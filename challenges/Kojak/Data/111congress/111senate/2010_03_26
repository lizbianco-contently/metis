Mr. President, I thank my colleague and dear friend, \nSenator Stabenow, for those kind words. I know no one who cares more \ndeeply and works harder in this body for the average American family, \nfor the workers of this country, than Debbie Stabenow. She is always \nthere thinking about how we can make their lives better, what we can do \nto increase employment opportunities for working families. The fact she \nis here today leading the debate on extending unemployment insurance \nagain shows her dedication to those hard-working men and women who make \nthis country what it is. I thank the Senator from Michigan for her \nleadership in this crucial area.\n  I listened to the news this morning on the radio while driving in. \nThe new figures are out for growth rate. We are growing now at about--\nlast quarter was about 5 percent. That is a turnaround from a negative \n6 percent 1 year ago. Also, in unemployment, about 1 year ago we were \nlosing jobs at 750,000 each month. It came down to only 35,000 jobs we \nwere losing a month in the last 3 months. Every expectation is that \nwhen we end March, we will actually be in the positive once again. It \nshows that President Obama's economic policies and programs and what we \ndid in the Recovery Act are working.\n  This is encouraging news. However, there are still almost 15 million \nhard-working people who lost their jobs and still struggling to find \nwork. For these people, the recession is still a reality and recovery \nseems far out of reach.\n  There have been 6.1 million people out of work for more than half a \nyear. That is the highest number of long-term unemployed we have had \nsince we started keeping track in 1948. The families of these long-term \nunemployed are hanging by a thread. Their savings are exhausted. The \nunemployment benefits they get are the lifeline that helps them pay the \nrent, put food on the table, and keep their kids in school.\n  Yet in the face of this unprecedented crisis and long-term \nunemployment, a short-term extension of unemployment insurance is being \nneedlessly, needlessly--I would say cruelly--obstructed in the Senate. \nIn a real case of deja vu, a few members of the minority party are yet \nagain stonewalling a piece of legislation that I think most people in \nthis room and most of the people in this country would agree is vitally \nimportant.\n  Indeed, we know for a fact there is broad support for extending \nbenefits in the Senate because we already passed a longer extension \nearlier this year. That is what is most illogical about this whole \nsituation. We have already said we want to continue the Federal \nextended benefits program through the end of this year. We are now just \nwaiting for the House to act. But now we cannot pass a 30-day extension \nto give the House the time they need to catch up. That does not make \nsense. We have already passed it for the year. We just need to fill in \na small gap for 1 month. Those on the minority side are saying no.\n  As a result of this political gamesmanship, more than 37,000 \nunemployed Americans will be abruptly cut off from Federal unemployment \nbenefits. They will lose their subsidized COBRA health insurance \ncoverage during the first week of April. In my own State of Iowa, about \n1,200 workers struggling with joblessness will see their safety net \ndrop out from underneath them.\n  Blocking this bill may be a political game for some in the minority \nparty, but it is not a game for millions of Americans who, in a matter \nof days, will lose their lifeline. For them, the obstruction of this \nbill, by just a few in this Chamber, is a personal and family crisis of \nthe first magnitude.\n  It is interesting, we are going to be leaving here today. I guess \nthis will be the last day before the Easter recess. We are out for 2 \nweeks. Senators will be going back to their States, probably traveling \nand doing different activities with their families. They will probably \nbe having nice Easter dinners with all their families. Guess what. Not \none Member of this Senate or the House will lose their pay or benefits \nduring this period of time. How about all the people out there right \nnow who are facing an April 5 cutoff of their unemployment benefits, a \ncutoff of their COBRA health benefits? These are not people who have a \nbig bank vault with a lot of money on which they can draw. These are \npeople hanging by a thread. They have been out of work at least for \nover half a year. It almost borders on the unconscionable that we would \nleave and not pass this bill.\n\n  I know those on the other side say we have to pay for it. I am all \nfor paying for things, but I daresay, if a tornado wiped out a town in \nOklahoma or we had a flood, as some are having in the Midwest, that \nwiped out a community and we needed to rush money in and rush items in \nto help people, would we stand here and say: Oh, no, we can't call that \nan emergency; that is not an emergency; somehow we have to come up with \nthe pay-fors right away. No, it would be an emergency. We would rush in \nto help.\n  For the thousands of Americans who are going to lose their \nunemployment on April 5, it is an emergency. It is as if a tornado hit \ntheir home or a flood wiped out their community. It is an emergency, \nand we respond to emergencies with emergency spending--that is all we \nare saying--for 30 days, short term. This is an emergency. Yet it is \nbeing obstructed by the minority, by the Republicans. Let's say it for \nwhat it is. The Republicans are stopping this legislation. It is simply \ninexplicable.\n  There is no reason to put millions of families through the stress and \nuncertainty of wondering whether their benefits are disappearing. There \nis no reason to put States through the trouble and administrative \nexpense that comes with a lapse in the program. That is even going to \ncost more money.\n  The flood insurance program also needs to be extended or many people \npurchasing a home will not be able to close on their homes, causing \nmajor economic problems for them and the home seller.\n  Extending benefits is good for the families, workers, the States, and \nour economy. Economists calculate that every $1 invested in the \nunemployment insurance safety net generates $1.90 in economic activity. \nUnemployed households spend these dollars on immediate needs--to pay \nthe rent or medical bill, buy groceries and school supplies, or repair \nthe family car--all economic activities that quickly inject dollars \ninto our communities.\n  I call on my colleagues to stop their obstruction and do the right \nthing. Do the right thing. Just think about those people out there who \nare going to lose these benefits on April 5. I know some people say we \nwill come back on the 12th and maybe by the 15th of the month we will \nbe able to take care of it and we will go retroactive and fill that in. \nThese are not people who can just go down to the bank and have a line \nof credit. These are people who probably in desperation--in \ndesperation--will go down to some loan shark, get some kind of payday \nloan, something like that, and pay 20 percent interest on it for a \ncouple weeks because they are that desperate.\n  I think it is unconscionable that we would hold this up because a few \nsay we have to pay for it. We will pay for it. They say we cannot put \nthis off on our children and our grandchildren. I agree, we have to be \ncareful. We have to start getting out of the hole we are in. We are in \na hole economically. Don't put it all on the backs of the few who have \nbeen out of work for so long facing getting their money cut off on \nApril 5. Let's have a little heart. Let's have a little compassion. \nLet's have a little understanding of what these people are going \nthrough every day in their lives, the stress they have. Let's do the \nright thing and extend unemployment benefits for 1 month.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator \nStabenow control the time from 9:30 a.m. to 10 a.m.; that I control the \ntime from 10 a.m. to 10:30 a.m.; that Senator Stabenow control the time \nfrom 10:30 a.m. to 11 a.m.; that I control the time from 11 a.m. to 12 \np.m.; and that Senator Stabenow control the time from 12 p.m. to 12:30 \np.m.\n\n[[Page S2137]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. President, we are here today because Republicans are objecting \nagain to critical legislation and critical problem-solving efforts that \nare going to help middle-class families, that are going to help move us \nforward as a country.\n  We have seen, over and over, a pattern in the last year and 2 years \nago when they first began to move this kind of a strategy forward, of \nblocking, blocking, blocking, saying no, saying no, saying no, rather \nthan working together to solve critical issues. People are facing some \nof the most daunting challenges right now, more than they ever have in \ntheir lifetime--either trying to hold on to their job, trying to find a \njob, trying to make sure they have medical care for their families--and \nwe have taken a very critical step this week to be able to ease some of \nthose challenges and fears. Americans are struggling in an economy they \ndidn't create, and when we look over this pattern, I am compelled to \nspeak for a moment about it.\n\n  Over the history of our country, we have never seen such obstruction, \nefforts to block what we are doing, as we are now seeing. In the last 2 \nyears, there were a total of 139 filibusters and efforts to block. That \nwas in a 2-year period. Today, barely into the new year, after a little \nover a year, we are at 130 different times that the other party has \nsaid no to doing things that would help middle-class families, that \nwould help small businesses, and that would help us move this country \nforward. One hundred thirty times. Unheard of, never happened before.\n  I know for people watching, they probably wonder: What in the world \nis going on here, and why should we care about procedure? We just want \nyou to solve problems. But it is the effort we saw in the past with the \nSenator from Kentucky, who blocked for days our effort to move forward \nand extend unemployment benefits for families who are out of work \nthrough no fault of their own. People want to work, Mr. President, as \nyou know, and they work hard. It is not their fault this economy went \ninto a tailspin, which, quite frankly, in my judgment, was caused as a \nresult of the policies of the previous administration that for 8 years \nchose to focus on just a few people. So the people in Michigan are \nsaying: What about the rest of us? What about the rest of us? We are \nnot the Wall Street fat cats. We are not the CEOs with the big bonuses \nor the people who got the big tax cuts. We are just working every day. \nWe just want the American dream for our kids. We want to know things \nare going to be better. We want to know we can send our kids to college \nso they will have a great opportunity to be the best they can be.\n  That is who we are fighting for, and that is why we took subsidies \nfrom banks this week and gave the money directly to students, to create \nopportunities for those who want to go to college. That is why we have \nfocused on lowering costs for middle-class families and small \nbusinesses on health insurance. But we are back here today because, \nunfortunately, our Republican colleagues are trying to score political \npoints on the backs of people who have lost their jobs.\n  Now, I know a great way to bring down the deficit, and one that \nhasn't been tried. The 8 years that our colleagues were in control, \nalong with President Bush, they focused on the people at the top and \nsaid that was going to do it. If it had worked, that would have been \ngreat, but unfortunately they left everybody else behind, and we saw \nwhat happened. So I have a great idea. Let's focus on putting everybody \nback to work so they can contribute to our economy by paying their \ntaxes, and that will pay down the deficit. That is what President \nClinton did. That is what the Democrats did when we were last in \ncontrol. That is what we are focused on doing now--putting people back \nto work--because that is the formula for bringing down this deficit.\n  The challenge we have is that we have one job for every six people \nwho are looking right now. So we aren't in a situation yet where we \nhave the jobs available for every person who wants to work and is able \nto work. That is what we are laser-focused on here in the Congress. But \nwe need to continue to understand, as Senator Harkin has said, that too \nmany families are caught in this economic tsunami. Whether it is a \nflood, a hurricane, or the fact that your community got wiped out \nbecause a plant closed, it is an economic emergency.\n  We have always stepped up and funded the extension of unemployment \nbenefits as an emergency with emergency funding. We have always done \nthat, and now we are being asked to change that. We weren't asked to \nchange it for Wall Street and the bailout. We weren't asked to change \nit for the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. But we are being \nasked to change it on the backs of working people, and I believe that \nis wrong.\n  We are still recovering from the worst economic situation since the \nGreat Depression, but we are recovering. When President Obama took \noffice, we were losing 800,000 jobs a month--too many of them in my \ngreat State of Michigan. We are now, at the end of the year, down to \nlosing close to zero a month. That is better--not good enough, so we \nmust stay focused, but we are hearing that we are going to have some \npretty good numbers from March, where people are actually going back to \nwork and jobs are being created. I don't want to stop and I know the \nPresiding Officer doesn't want to stop until every single person who is \nable to work and who wants a job has the dignity of work so that we \ngive breadwinners the ability to bring the bread home. And that is what \nthis is about.\n  So we are in a situation where we are in transition, and too many \nfamilies are caught. In my great State, the unemployment rate is still \nthe highest in the country--14.1 percent. It is coming down slowly, but \nit is still way too high. We have almost 700,000 people who have lost \ntheir jobs and are looking for work. But that is only the official \nnumber. That doesn't include the people who are working one part-time \njob, two part-time jobs, three part- time jobs trying to hold it \ntogether or people who have been out of work so long they no longer \nqualify for any kind of help. Those numbers are much bigger.\n  Every day, the unemployment insurance agency in Michigan gets 13,000 \nto 15,000 phone calls from people asking for help--every day. Every \nsingle day, up to 15,000 phone calls come in from people in Michigan \nwho are desperate about what they are going to do in this situation. \nWell, we can help them. That is what this is about. That is what we are \ntrying to do.\n  If this isn't an emergency, I don't know what is. The other side \nsays: No, it is not an emergency. But for families who have lost their \njobs and who are trying to find work, trying to put food on the table, \nI can assure you, this is an emergency. It is an economic disaster. \nWhen 14.9 million people around the country are unemployed, to me, that \nis a disaster. And those are the people we are fighting for today, \nyesterday, tomorrow. Those are the people who, when Wall Street got \nbailed out, said to us: What about us? Well, part of the answer is, to \nmake sure they can keep a roof over their head and food on the table, \nto allow them to receive unemployment benefits. And these aren't huge \nnumbers. They do not begin to match the Wall Street bonuses. We are \ntalking about $250, $300 a week. But it may be the difference between \nbeing able to keep your family going or not.\n  In this legislation, we have a very important provision on health \ncare--on COBRA. When COBRA was put in place, it was a great idea. If \nyou lost your job, you could pay to continue the health insurance your \nemployer was providing. The problem is, it is way too expensive when \nyou are paying both the employee and the employer side. So last year, \nin the Recovery Act, we put some help in place: 65 percent would be \npaid for by the Federal Government to help families keep their \ninsurance going. That is also a part of this--to keep that going so \nfamilies can keep their health care. That is extremely important.\n  We need to focus on the real challenges families are facing today and \nwork together across the aisle to tackle those. People are so tired of \nthe\n\n[[Page S2138]]\n\ngames. They are so tired of it. They watch what is happening here, and \nthey say: What are these people thinking? What are they doing?\n  I know that politically folks may gain points by objecting, blocking, \nfilibustering 130 times, but it makes the whole process look messy--\nterribly messy. It causes people to lose faith in their government. \nThat may seem to have some short-term advantage, but I believe that is \na disastrous direction for our country. People want to know we are \ngoing to work together. People are going to want to know we put \npriorities in the right place so that we are focusing on the majority \nof Americans, not an elite few.\n  The great thing about our country is the middle class. That is what \nhas always differentiated us from other countries--the fact that we \nmake things, we grow things, and we add value to it. And by the way, we \nmake things and grow things very well in Michigan, Mr. President. We \nwill take on any State. We will take on anybody. We know how to do \nthings. We know how to work, we know how to make things.\n  But we have not had this focus over the last decade on strengthening \nthat middle class. We are turning that around now, and I am very proud \nof the fact that we are seeing manufacturing begin to turn, that we are \nseeing efforts that we put in place through the Recovery Act putting \npeople back to work.\n  Too many families are not yet feeling that economic recovery, and \nthis is for them. This is about saying to the American people, middle-\nclass families across the country: You know what, we get it. We are \nsorry you are having to go through this, and we are going to do our \npart. We are going to do whatever we can to make sure you have the \nresources to keep things together while you are going out and looking \nfor that job or going back to job training and holding things together \nwith bits and pieces--odd jobs, part-time jobs--until this economy \nturns around.\n  We know, ultimately, that it is about jobs. We know, ultimately, it \nis about the private sector creating those jobs. But there is a \npartnership we need to have between the Federal Government and our \nindustry so they can successfully compete in a global economy. Rather \nthan focusing on Democrats versus Republicans, who can score the next \nshort-term gain in the election, we should be coming together and \nrealize that this is an economic race between the United States and \nChina, it is the United States versus Japan, it is the United States \nversus Korea. We are in a global economic race. Instead of spending \ntime objecting, playing games, filibustering at an unheard of rate in \nour history--absolutely unheard of; never before have we seen this kind \nof obstruction--we ought to be coming together and be laser-focused on \nChina, which is spending $288 million every day--$288 million every \nday--to beat us on clean energy technology. Let's make that the fight. \nLet's make that the fight together.\n  This is the wrong place and time to be obstructing and playing games. \nIt is the wrong place to say that suddenly we want to balance the \ndeficit on the backs of people who are out of work through no fault of \ntheir own; that we are going to change the rules now; that it is no \nlonger an emergency and no longer emergency spending. We shouldn't be \nchanging the rules now and doing it to people who are out of work. That \nis not fair.\n  I say to my colleagues: Don't block democracy. Just vote--today. We \ncan vote on this up or down. We can vote on it. Don't obstruct; just \nvote. You want to make a motion, you want to vote, a majority vote, \nfine. Let's vote. But don't force a filibuster and don't object and \ndon't threaten a filibuster. Just vote. We are happy to vote.\n\n\n                  Unanimous-Consent Request H.R. 4851\n\n  Mr. President, at this point, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 323, H.R. 4851, \nto provide a temporary extension of certain programs, and that the bill \nbe read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon \nthe table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I think my colleague realizes that, in fact, this will \nadd $9.2 billion to the debt, and she also realizes, in spite of her \nclaim that we could vote, that there is nobody in town to vote because \nthere are only 10 or 11 of us still in town. And because every \nRepublican voted against adjourning so that we could stay and work this \nout, I would object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, could you indicate the time remaining on \nour side for this portion?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. In this block of time, the Senator \nhas no time remaining.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, let me set the record straight. Yesterday \nin this body we offered the same bill in a way that would not increase \nthe debt. It was immediately tabled, with all Republicans voting not to \ntable it and the majority voting to table it. So there is a little bit \nof confusion.\n  We worked out an agreement with Senator Stabenow and Senator Levin \nfrom Michigan where we came together with an agreement for 2 weeks \nwhere this would be paid for, so the reason this bill is not moving \nforward is because the House leadership rejected that compromise. In \nother words, we had a compromise. We developed a plan where our \nchildren will not pay for this, we will, by offsetting and not adding \nto the debt.\n  With that, I wish to recognize my colleague from Wyoming, Senator \nBarrasso, for what time he might consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, it was fascinating to be here in the \nSenate Chamber this morning when first the Senator from Iowa made the \nstatement, ``I'm all for paying for things.''\n  I am all for paying for things? But not for this. Not for that. Not \nfor the next thing.\n  Watching the Senator's voting record, it seems that everything is an \nemergency. He certainly does not seem to want to be paying for \nanything, just add it to the debt.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a moment.\n  He talked about a tornado in Oklahoma. When the Oklahoma City bombing \nhappened and we sent emergency funds to Oklahoma City, we paid for \nthem. We decreased spending somewhere else to pay for that spending. \nHis point falls on a flat wall because when we had an urgency such as \nthat in 1995, we paid for it.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I heard the Senator, my good friend from Michigan, a \nfew minutes ago say it is the United States versus China. My good \nfriend from Michigan said we are laser focused on China and that China \nis spending money every day to beat us.\n  I think the problem is the government in Washington is spending money \nevery day--the taxpayers' money, money we do not have, and that is what \nis going to beat us. It is money irresponsibly being spent by this \ngovernment in this city, voted on time and time again by a Washington \ngovernment that doesn't live within its means, doesn't do what the \nStates in this country do, where we do live within our means. I served \nin the Wyoming Senate where we did balance the budget. The Governor had \na line-item veto. We had to balance our budget. It is the spending by \nus in the United States that is going to lead to China beating us, not \nmoney being spent in China every day.\n  That is why on the front page of the Wall Street Journal today, above \nthe fold, right there, Wall Street Journal, Friday, March 26, 2010, \n``Debt Fears Send Rates Up.'' The fear of the debt is sending rates up.\n  What it means is people do not think we are responsible in the way we \nare living. We are not living within our means. We are not doing what a \nfamily does in this country, where a family says we have to live within \nour means. When the Senator from Iowa says you can't go down and get an \nextended line of credit if you have already tapped your credit, this \ncountry continues to do it. Washington continues to overspend and not \nlive within its means.\n\n[[Page S2139]]\n\nThe amount of spending being done, often under the guise of saying it \nis an emergency, has been irresponsible, unsustainable, and my concern \nis it will soon be irreversible.\n  I believe in this country. I believe in America. We are a strong \nnation. We are a resilient nation. We are a proud nation. And we are a \nnation that has faced down some of history's most vicious tyrants, we \nhave faced down some of the most incredible obstacles, challenging \nobstacles, and we have risen to the occasion time and time again.\n  Today, here we are, faced with many challenges, none of which is too \nlarge or too difficult for the American people to overcome. But the \nPresident of the United States has determined the people cannot be \ntrusted to overcome the obstacles we face. Instead, here in Washington, \nDemocrats believe the government continues to be the answer. I am here \nto tell you that government is not the answer. The government is the \nproblem.\n  Americans have been promised transparency, accountability, hope, and \nchange. Instead, what the American people have been given is \nirresponsible and unsustainable spending, along with unthinkable \ngovernment intervention into nearly every aspect of our lives. This \ncountry needs an economic environment where people, where individuals, \nwhere families, where businesses can recover and thrive. What the \nadministration has done is give us more bureaucracy and more debt and \nit is going to get worse now that the health care bill has been signed \ninto law. To make matters worse, this government in Washington is \nsending the bill to our children and our grandchildren.\n  Look at the proposals that are ahead of us here--costly cap-and-trade \nproposals which are going to raise costs and raise energy prices for \nAmerican families, government-run health care, irresponsible bailouts \nof every industry in sight, one takeover after another, where \ngovernment says we know better than the American people.\n  Government is wrong. I have great concern that people here in \nWashington are completely out of touch with what is happening in the \nreal world. I go home to Wyoming every weekend. I am going today. That \nis the best way to do it, to go home and listen to people who have to \nbalance their checkbooks, people who have to live within their means, \nand then visit with State legislators who know when they go to the \ncapitals of their respective States that the States have to live within \ntheir means, balance their budget, don't overspend, tighten the belt, \ncut spending if we need to.\n  Watching this debate in the last couple of weeks with health care, \nhaving practiced medicine for 25 years, we need to focus on the overall \nhealth of people as well as the economy, because if people cannot put \nfood on the table or a roof over their head, no matter what additional \nbill is passed in Washington--which spends more money--that is not \ngoing to make it easier for the families of America. Spending billions \nto combat global warming--global warming--billions, it seems senseless \nfor somebody who is retired and can't afford to heat their home in the \nWyoming winter.\n  There was a time when our leaders recognized that America's most \nvaluable asset was the American people. I continue to believe that. \nThere is a reason the preamble to our Constitution begins with, ``We \nthe people,'' not ``You, the people.'' Our forefathers created a system \nof government through which free Americans get to decide their own \nfate. Today the very fabric of America is in danger of being tattered \nbeyond repair, and every time I go home, as I travel around the State \nof Wyoming, people continue to tell me we are losing our country. I am \nnot the only one who is hearing it. When Senators, when Representatives \ngo home--and many of us do go home every weekend--we are hearing it \nState by State. Those Members of Congress who choose to not go home, to \nnot go visit with the people they represent, to not hold town meetings \nbecause they are told by leadership don't go listen to the people, \nlisten to us--those are the kinds of people who continue to vote for \nirresponsible spending.\n  I am hoping Members go home over the upcoming Eastertime, go home and \nlisten to people in their own home communities who will say Washington \nneeds to live by the same rules families in America live by--live \nwithin your means. American families know what it means to live within \nyour means.\n  Since the beginning of this crisis, Americans have been forced to \nmake some very difficult choices and to tighten our belts. Financially \nstressed Americans balance budgets for food, for gas, for electricity, \nfor tuition, for clothing, rent, mortgage payments, and much more. When \nyour neighbor maxes out the limit on their credit card they are keenly \naware this is a clear indication of a spending problem. They cannot \ncall the credit card company and simply say increase the credit limit. \nUnfortunately, we know Washington is not your average consumer. \nPresident Obama said it best. He said:\n\n       In the long run we can't continue to spend as if deficits \n     don't have consequences, as if waste does not matter, as \n     if the hard earned tax dollars of the American people can \n     be treated like monopoly money.\n\n  Let me repeat that. This is President Obama who said last year, right \nbefore Christmas, ``We can't continue to spend as if the hard earned \ntax dollars of the American people can be treated like monopoly money. \nThat's what we have seen time and time again.'' He said ``Washington \nhas become more concerned about the next election than the next \ngeneration.''\n  Those on this side of the aisle are most concerned about our economy, \nour Nation, jobs, growth, opportunity, the families of this country. \nThis is a long-term problem and it must be addressed in the short term. \nWe cannot afford to wait. We cannot continue to call everything \nemergency spending without paying for it.\n  The American people are demanding action. Time and again Washington's \ninsatiable appetite for spending is met with more of the same. Only in \nWashington can you max out the country's credit card at $14 trillion \nand simply keep on spending. Unlike your average American, Washington \nhas refused to make the tough choices needed to rein in unsustainable \ndeficits we are now facing. Since we are not making the tough choices, \nthe cost of handling the debt is continuing to go up. Interest rates \nare rising which means the amount of money that is going to go to pay \nthat debt will continue to rise. Yet we are looking at a deficit that \ncontinues to rise, $1 trillion a year, all the way through 2020, and a \nPresidential budget that will double the national debt in 5 years and \ntriple it in 10.\n  The current national deficit for this fiscal year is $1.4 trillion. \nThat is three times the previous record high. As I said, according to \nthe budget projections, the deficit is going to be close to $1 trillion \na year through 2020. This budget deficit is simply appalling. All you \nneed to do is go home, have a townhall meeting, listen to people. \nPeople around the country are incensed with this sort of reckless, \nwasteful Washington spending.\n  The worst part is people do not believe they are getting value for \ntheir money. In a recent poll, of every $1 you send to Washington in \ntaxes, how much do you think is being wasted? The American public said \n50 cents on every dollar sent to Washington in taxes is being wasted. \nThat is an all-time record high number. People are not seeing that \nWashington is being responsible in how taxpayer dollars are being used \nand the American people simply do not believe they are getting value \nfor their money.\n  I agree, the people are not getting value for their money. All you \nneed to do is look at the Washington wasteful spending and it is no \nsurprise that the American people are incredibly upset. Year after \nyear, monstrous deficits are leading us to a national debt crisis. In \n2009 alone, the public debt grew 31 percent. It now is almost half of \nthe gross domestic product. By 2020 it is expected to balloon to over \n70 percent of the gross domestic product.\n  So when I look at this and I talk to people at home and I think about \nthis and I look at the great threats, the great threats to our Nation, \nto me the debt is the threat. As a result, I take a look at this major \nspending bill, the so-called stimulus package--which was supposed to \nkeep unemployment down below 9 percent and said if you didn't pass it, \nit might go to 9 percent--they passed it, and it still went to 10 \npercent. Do you know only 1 in 16 Americans believes it actually \ncreated jobs.\n\n[[Page S2140]]\n\nThe President is out there saying it created jobs, traveling around the \ncountry, and only 1 in 16 Americans believes it. That is how severe \nthis problem is.\n  With that, I see my part of the time has expired and I wish to turn \nthe remainder of this time over to Senator Coburn.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I want to set a little bit of a tone. \nFirst, I thank the Senator from Michigan. Yesterday, it was through her \nwork and Senator Levin's work that we were able to come to an agreement \non a compromise in the Senate. I think that shows when we get down to \nissues we can work together; when we get to the position. It was her \nefforts, along with several others, that allowed us to reach that \ncompromise.\n  But I wanted to make a point--a couple of points. No. 1, there is \nnobody on our side who does not want to extend the unemployment \nbenefits. The difference is we want to extend them without hurting her \nfuture. Whether you are a conservative, liberal, Democrat, Republican, \nor an Independent, the consequences of our actions are going to affect \neverybody. I used this last year, and this little girl is saying: I am \nalready $38,375 in debt, and I only own a dollhouse.\n  Well, let me show you what is going to happen this year. This year \nalone, she is $45,000 in debt. We moved from $39,000 to $45,000 for \nevery man, woman, and child in this country. That only reflects the \noutstanding debt we do not owe ourselves, that we have stolen from \nSocial Security and that we have stolen from other trust funds, that we \nput in an IOU.\n  There is another thing that is happening that Americans should be \naware of. In the past year, the average interest rates on the debt \nobligations we are issuing have risen 1 percent. So we have $12.8 \ntrillion worth of debt. Multiply that by 1 percent, and in this next \nyear we are going to pay an extra $128 billion in interest just from \nthat 1 percent.\n  So for every 1 percent interest rates go up, we have interest costs \nof $128 billion. What will happen as we continue to project trillion-\ndollar deficits over the next 9 years is, that is going to rise and \nrise and rise.\n  She is the one that is going to pay for that, and this will not be \n$45,000; it will be $75,000. Then it will be $85,000, and then pretty \nsoon--and by the way, that only reflects the debt. That has no \nreflection on the unfunded commitments that we have made to veterans, \nsocial security benefits, Medicare, none.\n  If we add those in, we have another $37 trillion that has to be \naccounted for just over the next four decades. So debt is a big problem \nfor us. I would also make a point, the Senator from Michigan mentioned \nthe long-term debt extender that we have. It is 12 months. It is going \ndown each time we do it. We sent that to the House. You know what. It \ndid not increase the debt because we offset it. We paid for it.\n  So the House has a bill the Senate has passed that was paid for, and \nthey stole some of the pay-fors for the health care bill. So the House \nhas not sent it back because the House refuses to make the hard choices \nto pay for the things that are necessary to be done right now. That is \nwhat happened yesterday. The Senate came to an agreement. We decided we \nwould pay for 2 weeks so nobody will have any hitch in their \nunemployment, no hitch in their COBRA, no hitch anywhere. When it was \nsent over there, it was rejected.\n  Now, I want to posit something to you. The reason it was rejected is \nwe do not want to create the precedent that when we spend money we have \nto pay for it. Where in the world is that a normal thinking process? In \nother words, we want to make sure we always have the option to spend \nmoney that is not paid for. There could be nothing more economically \nunreasonable than that.\n  So this is not a battle about not wanting to help the people who need \nour help today, this is a battle about helping the people who need our \nhelp today without hurting the children of tomorrow, without rescuing \nthem.\n  If we are talking about emergencies, the fact is, because we cannot \ncontrol our appetite for spending, our interest costs have gone up \nanother $128 billion this year. That is an emergency. The other thing \nis that we have over $300 billion worth of waste, of fraud, of \nduplication in the Federal Government every year. So if you dispute it, \nyou can say there is only--let's say it is half that. Why would we not \nget rid of that and pay for this rather than charge this intermediate \n$9.2 billion to those little children?\n  I actually had the pleasure of meeting this little girl in my office \nafter I saw this photo. She has parents. They are worried. So what is \nher future going to be like? Is she going to have the same opportunity \nI have? So what I would posit forth is that we can do both. We can meet \nthe needs of those who are dependent upon us now because of the \neconomic downturn, and we can protect her and all of those of her \ngeneration.\n  To not do so says we are going to take the easy way out. We are not \ngoing to act responsibly. We are not going to act like every other \nfamily in America acts. They look at what is there, what is the \npriority, what we can do, and what we cannot do. Then they make a \ndecision about what is most important.\n  The process the Senator from Michigan wants us to do, even though she \nagreed yesterday, is to not put a priority on it that considers both \nthe short term and the long term; that cares both for the children as \nwell as the unemployed; that considers both the future of our country \nand her opportunity to take advantage of the freest Nation in the \nworld.\n  This is not a Republican-Democrat thing. Republicans have been \nirresponsible in spending too. It is a whole new era now. Everything \nhas changed. It does not matter what party we are in. If we do not get \nhold of the debt in this country, everyone is going to suffer.\n  I spoke on the Senate floor yesterday, and I will reiterate it: \nWhether you call it a filibuster or whether you call it obstruction, as \na grandfather of five children, truly reflective of tons of \ngrandparents out there and tons of grandkids out there, I am not going \nto agree in the future to spend money we do not have until we get rid \nof the things that are not a priority, the $300 billion, before we \nmove. Someone has to start saying no to the addiction we have that \nevery time we have a problem we will just spend money.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4915\n\n  I would like to make a unanimous consent request. I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate now proceed to H.R. 4915, a revenue measure \nfrom the House; provided that the only amendment in order be a \nsubstitute amendment, the text of which is the 2-week extension that we \nagreed on yesterday of unemployment benefits that is paid for, that \nwill not increase the debt, with agreed-to offsets from the \nFinance Committee that was agreed to yesterday; proceeded further that \nthe amendment be agreed to, the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand passed, with a motion to reconsider laid upon the table.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object, I would just indicate to \nmy colleague that from our perspective this is an emergency, an \neconomic disaster for families right now. We need to do as we have done \nthree other times in the Congress and extend this emergency spending to \nhelp families who are out of work.\n  Given that, I will object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I am sorry we have an objection. The fact \nis, we agreed to it. The fact is, the Senator from Michigan is having \nto protect the House of Representatives. She knows we are not going to \ngo forward with this unless we pay for that, until we get back.\n  The only way to do that is through unanimous consent. The only way we \nare going to accomplish that is what we agreed to yesterday and send it \nto the House and let them do it by unanimous consent, even though they \nsaid they will not do it.\n  The fact is, we agreed in the Senate. We came to an agreement, and \nbecause the House has said they will not do it, they do not want to--\nthey want to increase the debt to do it rather than to do it and not \nincrease the debt. I think that speaks of where we are in the country.\n  We cannot do this. We have agreed on the way to do it in our body.\n\n[[Page S2141]]\n\n  After we had an agreement yesterday that maybe the House did not \nlike, it actually solved the problem and solved the problem for these \nlittle kids as well as those unemployed in Michigan and across the \ncountry. We now have the House saying: No, we cannot do it.\n  So I am sorry. I apologize to the Senator from Michigan for putting \nher in that position. I sincerely do. But I think we have to be \nrecognizable of the fact that what looks like may be happening as both \nHouses recess is that it will not get done. It will not get done \nbecause we cannot get it done. It will not get done because the House \nrefuses to take a position to not add to the debt as we solve this \nproblem, as we meet both priorities--those people who are hurting and \nthe priority of what is to come in the future. I think that is \nunfortunate for us.\n  I would yield the remaining time I have, which is only about 2 or 3 \nminutes, to the Senator from Georgia, and then I hope he will join me \nwhen we come back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I will be here this \nmorning to talk about this issue. I, too, just want to say to the \nSenator from Michigan, it is unfortunate that the Senate has tried to \nbe responsible and react to the situation we are in from an \nunemployment insurance standpoint, and in a very responsible way, and, \nunfortunately, the House will not agree with us. I am one of the folks \nwho has a great deal of sympathy for those folks who are unemployed, as \ndo all other 99 Members of this body.\n  This is the fourth time we have sought to extend unemployment \ninsurance for individuals across America. My State of Georgia has an \nunemployment rate of almost 10.5 percent. We have a lot of people who \nare hurting in a very significant way.\n  I voted last time, on March 2 I believe it was, to extend \nunemployment insurance without paying for it because I know the \ndifficulties people are having. But I did it with the understanding \nthat we had 30 days to fix it. We had 30 days to figure out a way to \npay for it. Yet, instead of concentrating on ways to figure out a way \nto pay for it, last night, the Senator from Oklahoma was forced to \nraise an objection to the extension that is not paid for, so the \nmajority decided: Well, maybe he is really serious about paying for \nit. Maybe the Republicans do want to see us pay for this rather than \nadding to the debt that our children and our grandchildren will \ninherit.\n\n  That is when serious discussions took place. I will come back with my \ncolleague from Oklahoma and talk more about this later. I regret that \nthe House has taken the action they have. It sends us down a continuing \ntrail that we have been on in the Congress over the last several years. \nMy colleague is right. Republicans have done this, just as Democrats \nhave. Republicans have not been as egregious about it as we have seen \nin the last year and a half, but it is an issue we have to get under \ncontrol. Now is the time to do it. If we can't find a way to pay for $9 \nbillion worth of expenses, then it is Katy bar the door.\n  Today we borrow 43 cents out of every dollar the Federal Government \nspends. That is spending that is out of control. I look forward to \ncontinuing this dialog as we turn the discussion over to the other \nside. We will come back in a little while and talk more about it.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to my distinguished \ncolleague, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee, the terrific \nsenior Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I wonder if Senator Chambliss might stay for 1 second so I \ncan inform my Republican colleagues, in about 10 minutes I will be \nasking unanimous consent to confirm a general who has been nominated--a \nbrigadier general who has been nominated to be a major general, who has \nbeen stuck on this calendar since October because of the objection of \nSenator Vitter, who is not hiding that it is totally unrelated to the \nmerits of this general. He acknowledges that. Senator Vitter has \nacknowledged that his problem is with the Corps of Engineers. This is a \nCorps of Engineers that has nothing to do with the projects Senator \nVitter is trying to get funded. The Corps of Engineers has said it is \nillegal to proceed. They have written him back. The hold still stands. \nThis is a uniformed officer of the U.S. Government. As chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, I feel obligated--and the reason I \ninterrupted your mission, forgive me, is because it is a Senate Armed \nServices Committee matter, where we have unanimously approved him 6 \nmonths ago or 5 months ago to be a major general.\n  I want to put folks on notice. I will be making a unanimous consent \nrequest in about 10 minutes that this matter be taken off the calendar \nand that it be confirmed. I wanted, as a courtesy, to make sure folks \non that side of the aisle knew.\n  I thank my dear friend from Michigan, my colleague, Senator Stabenow, \nfor yielding me this time. I know later on this morning or early this \nafternoon there will be a unanimous consent request that unemployment \nbenefits be extended, that a bill be adopted. It is critically \nimportant that unanimous consent request be approved. I will speak now \nfor a few minutes on that matter.\n  We have thousands of people in our State of Michigan who have lost \njobs thanks to a crisis that was created in mortgage company boiler \nrooms and Wall Street board rooms. Now they are suffering because of \nthe failure of our Republican colleagues to understand the emergency \nsituation--I want to focus on the word ``emergency''--of those who have \nlost their jobs because of that crisis. It should not be hard to \ndeliver much needed aid to people who are facing an emergency crisis. \nWe have an unemployment rate in the country that is approximating 10 \npercent. We have an unemployment rate in Michigan that is over 14 \npercent. People need us to do what is right and to extend these \nbenefits.\n  Here we are, up against a wall of obstructionism again, while \nthousands of our constituents, people in every State, wonder what it is \nexactly we are doing that we would deny the extension of unemployment \nbenefits when we have a deep recession. Hopefully, we may be coming \nout. There is some evidence we may be coming out, but not for this \nrecord number of people who will lose their unemployment benefits if we \ndon't act.\n  This is not an abstract policy debate. These are real lives which are \nhanging in the balance. We have more than a half million Michiganians \nreceiving unemployment benefits. We have 125,000 Michiganians who will \nlose their unemployment benefits by the end of April, if we do not act. \nUnemployed breadwinners will continue to receive benefits only if we \ncan find the will and the decency to act on their behalf--real people, \nreal families coping with enormous problems. Denying this extension is \nsimply inhumane. It is more than the families. We could talk about \nthat. We can talk about the economy, which also benefits from these \nunemployment benefits. In fact, economists tell us--this has been \nextensively documented--that government payments, such as unemployment \nbenefits, are among the most effective forms of economic stimulus. Not \nproviding that stimulus has a negative effect on the entire economy. \nBut that is not the point I wish to reinforce this morning. It is the \nfact that we have an emergency in millions of homes, and that emergency \nneeds to be recognized as such. If it is--and I hope our Republican \ncolleagues would agree--we then do not have to have the offsets which \nwe would if it is not designated as an emergency.\n  Our Republican colleagues tell us they are in favor of an extension, \nbut they argue it should be offset with cuts in other programs. In \nfact, one of the programs they look to for an offset is the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act or the stimulus package. It is a pretty \nironic place to look since that package is a job creator. So in order \nto do the right thing and extend unemployment benefits, some of our \nRepublican colleagues argue--and I guess continue to believe--we should \ntake funds from a stimulus package, which most economists say is \ncreating jobs, in order to pay for the extension of jobless benefits. \nIf there is any wrong place to look for offsets, that would be it.\n  The main point is not that it is the wrong offset. The main point is, \nevery single time we have extended benefits,\n\n[[Page S2142]]\n\nwe have seen in this body that it is an emergency.\n  On June 30, 2008, in a 2008 Supplemental Appropriations Act, we \ndeemed the extension of unemployment benefits an emergency. It was \ndesignated as an emergency on June 30, 2008. Then when we funded \nunemployment benefits on February 17, 2009, we designated that \nextension cost as an emergency. December 19, 2009, when we extended \nbenefits, this time in a Defense Appropriations Act, it was designated \nan emergency. On March 2, a few weeks ago, it was designated as an \nemergency. Is the emergency over? Is this recession over? Is that what \nRepublican objections are suggesting? It is no longer an emergency? It \nhas been an emergency since 2008, but that is all over now?\n  I don't think the American people see it that way. I think the \nAmerican people see what is happening in their families, in their \nhomes, a crisis that continues to exist with record levels of \nunemployment.\n  I hope we will be able today to persuade our Republican colleagues \nthey should not object to the extension of benefits and to continue to \ndeclare the situation in which we find ourselves as an emergency, since \nit so clearly is.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer how much time I have remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. May I have 2 additional minutes.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Yes.\n\n\n             Unanimous Consent Request--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, back in October--to be precise, October 27, \nso we have now almost 5 months--almost 5 months ago, the Armed Services \nCommittee unanimously approved the nomination of BG Michael Walsh to be \na major general. This is a man who has had an exemplary career in the \nmilitary. He has been there 30 years in the Corps of Engineers. He \nserved in command assignments throughout the United States, throughout \nthe world. In 2006-2008, Brigadier General Walsh served in Baghdad. He \nwas commander of the Gulf Region Division of the Army Corps of \nEngineers. He was responsible for reconstruction projects managed by \nthe corps throughout Iraq. Prior to that tour, Brigadier General Walsh \nserved as commander of the Army Corps's South Atlantic Division. He \nserved in places as far afield as Germany and Saudi Arabia.\n  We approved this unanimously in the committee. There is no doubt \nabout this general's qualifications and his character. No one has \nraised the slightest issue as to whether he should be approved based on \nhis own merits. Instead, the objection is, the Corps of Engineers has \nnot approved a number of projects Senator Vitter wants the corps to \napprove.\n  It is inappropriate to stop a uniformed officer of the United States \nfrom having an advancement in his career because a Senator believes the \nCorps of Engineers, where this general served, should approve projects \nwhich the corps has said it cannot approve. Even if it wanted to, it \ncan't approve them. The funds have not been appropriated. They have \nwritten Senator Vitter that it is illegal for them to approve these \nprojects, as well as being against their policy. I don't want to get \ninto the question of whether it is legal or whether it is the right \npolicy to approve three projects which Senator Vitter thinks are \nimportant. That is not the issue.\n  This general could not approve those projects if he wanted to. It is \nnot his job. That comes from higher up. All he does is execute projects \nwhich the corps approves.\n  This is the situation. For 5 months, we have a uniformed officer of \nthe United States whose career is being interfered with in this way, \nwhose advancement is being interfered with because there is a hold on \nthis nomination from one Republican Senator.\n  I have urged the leadership on the other side to weigh in on this. By \nthe way, Senator McCain, my ranking member on the Armed Services \nCommittee, supports what I am doing. I want Republicans to realize \nthis. The ranking member of the Armed Services Committee is joining me \nin making this unanimous consent request. This was a unanimously \napproved nomination. He loses pay. He loses rank. His career is \ninterrupted. Why should this kind of unfairness be perpetrated on a \nuniformed member of the U.S. Army because one Republican Senator can't \nget the projects he thinks he should get for his State?\n  That is what it comes down to. This is one of the purest forms of \ninappropriate obstructionism I have seen here. As chairman of the \ncommittee, I am simply not going to stand by without trying my best to \nchange this.\n  I hope my friends will not object, but I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senate proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination on the Executive Calendar, Calendar No. 526, BG Michael \nWalsh, to be major general; that the nomination be confirmed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, and the Senate then resume where it \nwas.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I must say to my colleague, I agree with him--what he \nsaid--but under the conventions that we use, Senators can ask others to \nobject on their behalf, and, regrettably, I have been asked to do that \nand will do that on Senator Vitter's behalf.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I deeply regret that, and I am going to continue to press \nforward on this. I hope the leadership on the Republican side will \nweigh in on this.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank my friend.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my colleague for his \nextraordinary leadership on the Armed Services Committee and his \nefforts to make sure we have the staff, the leadership in our \nDepartment of Defense, our military, on behalf of our troops. It is \nvery regrettable that once again we are seeing obstructionism, blocking \nus from moving forward.\n  I do not know the exact number now, but I know we have over 70 \ndifferent positions that are being held up. They have been held up, \nmany of them, for over a year now in the Obama administration--many \nrelated to jobs, to commerce, to trade, to the Department of Defense--\nand it continues to be part of what we are seeing over and over and \nover again in efforts to just function, have government be able to \nfunction.\n  Mr. President, for so long--I know there are all the politics of \npeople believing they can gain points because of debating whether \ngovernment is good or bad, whether it is the problem, whether it is the \nsolution--I think the majority of the American people just want it to \nwork well. They want us to work together, and they want the services \nthat are to be provided, whether it is supporting our troops in the \nmilitary, whether it is providing education for our children, whether \nit is police officers on the street, whether it is making sure the \nwater our children drink is safe, or whatever it is. They want it to \nwork well and make sure every dollar we are spending on their behalf is \nspent with them in mind and it is done well and we are doing it \nefficiently and effectively.\n  I do have to say, in looking at the beautiful picture of the child my \nfriend from Oklahoma held up--talking about children and the future--\nthis week, we completed a process that will make sure it is illegal to \nblock that child from getting health insurance because of a preexisting \ncondition. I wish our colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle \nhad chosen to join with us in that very important effort to make sure \nevery child can receive the health insurance they need, that every \nparent can have freedom from the fear that when they go to bed at night \nthey are not going to have to say one more time: Dear God, please don't \nlet the kids get sick because I don't know what I am going to do.\n  So we do care about those children. We have put into place a health \ninsurance reform plan that is going to make sure every pregnant mom \ngets prenatal care and has maternity care, which in a majority of \nprivate-sector insurance plans you can go out and buy for yourself, \nthey do not cover it. I am happy to have a discussion about children \nand about making sure they can afford to go to college, which was also \nin the bill\n\n[[Page S2143]]\n\nwe passed this week--providing more opportunity for children. I am \nhappy to have that discussion.\n  But it is amazing to me we continue to be lectured by the people who \ngot us into this mess because of their economic policies. We are now \nlectured on probably a daily basis about the size of the deficit. We \nunderstand that. I was very proud to be in the House of Representatives \nwhen President Clinton and the Democrats balanced the budget for the \nfirst time in 30 years. When I came into the Senate, the big debate was \nwhat to do about the surplus. We were looking at almost a $6 trillion \nsurplus over 10 years. Well, unfortunately, under President Bush, under \na Republican Congress, that went away pretty fast: by not paying for \ntax cuts for the wealthiest Americans--somehow that was OK--by not \npaying for two wars, by not paying for a prescription drug effort under \nMedicare. During those 8 years, somehow it did not matter there was a \ncredit card being run up, that a huge surplus that had been accumulated \nthrough tough decisions, very tough choices, in the 1990s was somehow \nsquandered away. So I have a hard time hearing over and over again \nabout the deficit and being lectured as if somehow President Obama or \nthe Democrats caused that deficit.\n  I am not saying we do not have a challenge right now and a huge hole, \nand that we are not in a situation where we need to do emergency \nspending because of this economic disaster that has gone on. I \nunderstand that. I understand we are currently in a situation to be \nforced into a position because there are no savings to help people. Now \nwe are in a deficit position. But I find it interesting that all of a \nsudden, when we are in a situation where middle-class families need \nhelp--all of a sudden, when working people in this country need help--\nthis is an issue, when it was not an issue for 8 years during the Bush \nadministration. That is what I find difficult.\n  We have put back in place the budget rules that were in place during \nthe Clinton years, and we are going to dig ourselves out of this \ndeficit. We passed a health insurance reform bill that over the next \ntwo decades is going to decrease the deficit by over $1.2 trillion. We \nknow there is a hole. We understand that. But we also understand that \nmiddle-class families--who are under the crunch, who are losing their \njobs, who are trying to figure out how to pay the bills--did not cause \nthat, and the solutions being proposed now would put it right on their \nbacks. That is what we say no to. Because it is about time, as people \nin my State say, we focus on the rest of us. What about the rest of us \nin this country--not just those in the privileged, few powerful \npositions, the people on Wall Street? That is what this is about. This \nis fundamentally a debate about that. That is what we are talking about \ntoday.\n  I also want to indicate what we are talking about is extending an \nemergency program put in place in 2008 because of the economic disaster \nthat families are facing. It is not the regular unemployment program. \nIt is what was put in place in 2008 because of job loss, because of the \nfact that we got to a point where we are losing 600,000, 700,000, \n800,000 jobs a month. That is a disaster as much as a hurricane, a \nflood, or anything else that could happen to families and communities.\n  Since that time, we have extended it--as we are asking to extend it--\non four different occasions. We are asking right now for at least 2 \nweeks until the long-term extension gets passed by the House. For 2 \nweeks let us extend it, or 30 days. Let us extend it so there is not a \ngap in coverage, so we do not have families, who are feeling stress \nalready, now reading in the papers that the unemployment extension is \ngoing to stop and trying to figure out what in the world they are going \nto do during this period of time. We are asking for 2 weeks, 3 weeks, 4 \nweeks to be able to extend it until the House is able to pass the long-\nterm extension.\n  We are right back where we were again: objection, objection, \nobjection on being able to do that--more objections than we have ever \nhad in the history of our country in terms of process. We find \nourselves in a situation where, even though we have not adjourned--I \nwill emphasize that: Senator Reid, the majority leader, did not \nadjourn. We could have votes. I realize people have left. We could have \nvoted last night. We wanted to vote last night. Our only option to \novercome this was to start a process to stop a filibuster, which takes \n2 days and voting and 30 hours, and all of this, and they know that. So \nwe could have voted last night: yes or no. We could have done that last \nnight. But, once again, as we have had 130 different times, we are in a \nsituation where there has been objection, objection, objection.\n  This is very much about priorities. My friends on the other side of \nthe aisle talk about priorities. Yes, this is about priorities. It is \nabout values. And it is about who you are fighting for. Fundamentally, \nit is about who you are fighting for. I can tell you, the people in \nMichigan--hard-working people, middle-class Americans, families who \ncare deeply about this country; they love this country--are tired of \ndecisions being made for a few at the top. They are tired of the games \nand the obstructionism that has gone on and on and on. They want us to \nget things done--real things that affect their lives. That is what they \nwant to have us get done.\n  I see my distinguished friend from Rhode Island on the floor--a \nchampion on this issue, a fighter for Rhode Island, working men and \nwomen, and someone who has been on this floor over and over again \nfighting to make sure people who are out of work through no fault of \ntheir own have the opportunity to receive some help, some short-term \nhelp.\n  I now yield to my friend from Rhode Island up to 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank Senator Stabenow.\n  We are here to attempt to extend unemployment benefits for a brief \nperiod of time so Americans do not get caught up in the expiration of \nthese benefits on April 5. This has been a repeated struggle. We have \nhad many incidents over the last several months where we have had to \ncome down here and, at the last moment, attempt to project these \nbenefits further. I hope we do not fail again today.\n  In 2009, when President Obama walked into office, we were losing \n700,000 jobs per month. This is a crisis of epic proportions, rivaling, \nin some respect, in some regions of the country, the Great Depression. \nIn my home State of Rhode Island, we have a 12.7-percent unemployment \nrate, and it has been persistent now for almost 2 years. We are seeing \nan unfortunate record of long-term unemployment. We have to help our \ncolleagues, our neighbors, our friends, and we have to do it in a way \nthat does not deny them the basic necessities to hang on in a difficult \neconomy.\n  But this situation is not just as a result of the last several months \nor the last several years. If you look back across the past decade--\nfrom 2000 to 2010--it has been an extraordinarily unproductive one for \nworking Americans. There has been zero net job creation since December \n1999. We have had no decade since the 1940s where job growth was less \nthan 20 percent. This is the culmination of a decade in which people \ncould not find the kind of work they typically found in America. We saw \nmiddle-income households' earning power decline. They were making less \nin 2008 than they were in 1999. Two-thirds of the Nation's total income \nfrom 2002 to 2007 flowed to the top 1 percent.\n  So middle-income families have been losing out persistently, and now \nthey have hit the skids because so many of them now are seeing their \njobs go, seeing their house threatened with foreclosure, seeing the \ndream of sending their children to college evaporate. At least the \nminimum we can do is provide the kind of assistance they need.\n  We routinely, when there is a natural disaster, provide assistance. \nIn the last 20 years, an estimated $336 billion in disaster assistance \nand $61.8 billion in agricultural assistance has flowed to the States. \nThis is a disaster in the same respect. It is a disaster to individual \nfamilies who have lost their employment.\n  The irony here is, if a flood had washed through a State in the Union \nand destroyed the work of 12 percent of the population, we would be \nhere with disaster relief to get the funds to give loans, to give \nsupport, et cetera. Well, this is a disaster. We must move.\n  In that respect, seeing my time is coming to a close, the time I \nhave----\n\n[[Page S2144]]\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would be happy to give the Senator some \nadditional time, and we will roll the time off of your later time, if \nyou would like time now, I say to the Senator.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. Let me \ntake 1 or 2 more minutes. That is extremely thoughtful. I thank the \nSenator.\n  We have an opportunity to act today, and we should. The proposal is \nto go ahead and to extend through the next several days the existing \nbenefits so we have time to come back. We have already sent to the \nHouse an extension of unemployment benefits that will carry through to \nthe end of this calendar year. It also includes FMAP provisions, which \nare extremely important to States. I think in the spirit of letting us \ncontinue to support these Americans while we debate and finally \nconclude, I hope successfully, a longer term solution is the best thing \nto do.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4501\n\n  My colleague Senator Stabenow an hour ago propounded a unanimous \nconsent request, only to receive an objection. I will once again ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of Calendar 323, H.R. 4501, to provide a temporary \nextension of certain programs, that the bill be read three times, \npassed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, again, I \nwould note this is the fourth time I have done this and, regrettably, \nbecause we had an agreement yesterday that the House would not go along \nwith, I have to object because we will be adding to the debt.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator's objection. \nAdditionally, I appreciate his consideration in allowing me to speak.\n  Let me conclude. We have a huge debt at the moment. I think if you \nlook at the major contributing factors of that debt, they would include \ntax cuts that were unpaid for, supported strongly by the Republicans, \nwhich went dramatically to the richest Americans, and two wars that \nhave been unpaid for. In fact, I think in a few weeks we are going to \nhave to consider another supplemental Defense budget which at this \npoint I do not believe is paid for and which I do not feel will \nengender any objection by the Republican side. It will include, given \nthe nature of counterinsurgency operations, monies that will be used, \nironically, to help develop productive jobs and build clinics and do \nthings our soldiers must do to secure the peace in Afghanistan and \nIraq. Yet at the same time we can't find that kind of money here \nwithout on offset to help Americans.\n  So there is a question of priorities. There is a question of the \ndeficit. Again, repeating something my colleague said, I too recall \nwhen we had a surplus. That was under the leadership of President \nClinton. There were tough votes by my colleagues and myself. That \nsurplus has dissipated. We are now in a severe situation with the \ndeficit. The compelling priorities of Americans who need to work and \ncan't find it yet are extremely persuasive and should be responded to \nby the success of the bill.\n  I again thank the Senator from Oklahoma. He is extraordinarily kind.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent, since the \nmajority took an additional 5 minutes of our time, that our original \nunanimous consent be changed to give us the time from 11:05 to 12:05, \nand the majority from 12:05 to 12:30.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I yield to Senator Chambliss at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleague from \nOklahoma for highlighting this issue and for reaching a point where the \nAmerican people have wanted us to be for some time, and that is to \nsimply look at the spending that is going on in Washington and say \nenough is enough. That if we are going to continue down the road of \nincreasing Federal spending, then we have to offset that additional \nFederal spending that is over and above the amount of revenues coming \nin.\n  I also wish to say to my friend from Michigan, the chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee, who made the request on the approval of the \npromotion of a general that, as he knows, I have already voted in favor \nof doing that one time within the committee. I regret we are having to \nstand up and object. However, as he well knows, that is part of the \nprocess here, so Senator Coburn had to object on behalf of another \nMember of the Senate.\n  I can't help but note, as we are talking about spending here, an \narticle that appeared in this morning's Washington Times. The caption \nin the article is ``CBO Report: Debt Will Rise to 90 Percent of GDP.''\n  The article reads:\n\n       President Obama's fiscal 2011 budget will generate nearly \n     $10 trillion in cumulative budget deficits over the next 10 \n     years, $1.2 trillion more than the administration projected, \n     and raise the Federal debt to 90 percent of the Nation's \n     economic output by 2020, according to the Congressional \n     Budget Office. In its 2011 budget, which the White House \n     Office of Management and Budget released February 1, the \n     administration projected a 10-year deficit total of $8.53 \n     trillion. After looking it over, CBO said in its final \n     analysis released Thursday that the President's budget would \n     generate a combined $9.75 trillion in deficits over the next \n     decade.\n\n  This is exactly why, with the leadership of the Senator from \nOklahoma, we have to address this issue of spending and why we have to \nget this issue of spending under control. No time is better suited to \ndo this than now. We are looking at a deficit, according to the \nindependent Congressional Budget Office, of $10 trillion over the next \n10 years.\n  The majority is saying we can't find $9 billion to offset this \nparticular bill that everybody agrees is needed and that everybody on \nboth sides of the aisle wishes to see enacted. Very simply stated, the \nRepublicans want to see the bill paid for. If we can't find $9 billion \nin Federal spending that is out there today to offset this bill, how in \nthe world are we going to be able to do anything other than, under the \ncurrent leadership, go down this road of seeing nearly $10 trillion in \nbudget deficits accumulate over the next 10 years?\n  Congress has an obligation to serve as custodian of the American \ntaxpayer dollar. When we engage in unchecked deficit spending, it has a \nlong-lasting, negative impact on all Americans.\n  I understand times are tough across the country. As I said earlier, \nin my home State of Georgia, the unemployment rate announced last month \nwas 10.4 percent. There is a new number coming out today. I suspect it \nis going to be at least that high. Georgians are hurting, and I am \nconcerned about that. That is why I wish to make sure we can extend \nthis unemployment insurance but to do so without paying for it, in my \nopinion, is reckless at this point in time and it would not be in the \nbest interests of all Americans to extend it without paying for it.\n  The fact is, as I said earlier, I voted to extend it without paying \nfor it back in the early part of March. The reason I did was because it \nwas with the understanding that the majority had 30 days to work with \nthe minority to try to find the offsets. When did the discussions on \nwhat those offsets would be begin? They began last night about 2 hours \nbefore we finally decided it was time to go home. To the credit of the \nPresiding Officer as well as others on the Majority side in a \nleadership role, they agreed with the Republican party, the Republican \nMembers of this Senate, that we should offset it and we could offset \nit. That was objected to by Speaker Pelosi. So, unfortunately, here we \nare today in a situation where we are arguing about $9 billion and \nlooking at a proposed deficit from this administration of $10 trillion \nover the next 10 years.\n  The American people are as upset as they can be with Congress, and \nrightfully so. The main reason they are upset with us is because of \nthis very issue. When I am back home, which is where I go every \nweekend, and I visit with folks, whether it is in the grocery store, \nwhether it is at church or within the business community, every \nconstituent at some point in the conversation about what is happening \nin Washington will bring up the issue of Federal spending and why in \nthe world\n\n[[Page S2145]]\n\nMembers of Congress don't take some action to get this spending under \ncontrol. There has never been a better time to do it than with this \nparticular bill, and there has never been an easier time to do it. We \nare not talking about $1 trillion; we are talking about $9 billion in \noffsets, in reductions in Federal spending, in waste, fraud, and abuse \nthat we all know is out there, in whatever area we can agree on that \nthe money would come from. As we know, we have already identified some \nareas where we can reduce Federal spending to pay this.\n  Now is the time to do it. I would simply say to my colleague from \nOklahoma, I commend him for being firm. I commend him for being in a \nleadership role on this issue. I am very pleased to stand with him to \nsay that now is the time to do it. I think we should find that $9 \nbillion.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Georgia. I ask \nunanimous consent to have a colloquy on our side between the Members \nwho are here. If there is no objection, I wish to proceed with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. I recognize the Senator from Florida and the Senator from \nAlabama to start that off. I yield to the Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I appreciate the leadership Senator \nCoburn has shown. We need to focus on the seriousness of the issue and \nall that is at stake--why it is important and how it can be done. It's \nnot impossible to pay for this bill and provide these benefits without \nadding to the debt of the country by containing other spending. There \nis no reason we can't do this. I thought last night we had reached an \nagreement that would actually have achieved that, but we were not able \nto.\n  Let me briefly restate the posture we are in. Senator Grassley \noffered an amendment a few days ago to extend unemployment insurance \nfor 30 days. It also would include a doctors payment so they don't get \ncut for their Medicare work; COBRA benefits, FMAP benefits, and other \nthings. He offered that measure, but our Democratic colleagues blocked \nit. Now, the amendment was paid for. He had an offset, which was I \nthink mostly unspent stimulus money that still remains available to us \nto spend on this kind of activity. Then yesterday Senator McConnell \nreintroduced it. He sought to have the Grassley amendment come up for a \nvote that would have extended unemployment insurance and would have \npaid for it. That was voted down by our Democratic colleagues.\n  What I first wish to say to my colleagues who have been so vigorous--\nalmost excessively so--in attacking the Republican side for not dealing \nwith this issue is that we have offered two proposals to do so and they \nhave been blocked. So it is not fair to say Republicans don't want to \ndo unemployment insurance. It is not fair to say that. To do it in an \nattacking fashion, and to attack those of us who are simply saying \nlet's pay for it, as if we don't care about people who are unemployed, \nis offensive to me and I object.\n  I know what the deal is. Last night I thought we could reach an \nagreement on this but it fell apart. The Democratic leadership and \nSenator Reid decided they will let it lapse, and then they will attack \nand blame Republicans for it.\n  I just do not think that is fair.\n  Let's get back to the critical issues that are at stake.\n  Senator Chambliss mentioned that according to the Washington Times \ntoday, the Congressional Budget Office--the group we employ to help us \nunderstand these issues--says the publicly held debt of the United \nStates will reach 90 percent of the gross domestic product by 2020. Why \nis that significant? First of all, it is above what Europe expects. \nThey will not allow a country to enter the European Union if it has \ndebt exceeding 60 percent of GDP.\n  More importantly, the Budget Committee had a professor testify from \nthe University of Maryland who has written a book on this subject \ntestify. She was asked by the Democratic chairman to provide expertise \nto the Budget Committee a couple of weeks ago. What she said is that \nwhen your debt reaches 90 percent of GDP, it impacts economic growth \nadversely. She said that with debt at 90 percent of GDP, the growth of \nour economy will be reduced by at least 1 percent. That is not a small \namount.\n  As we know, 2-percent growth is not a bad thing to have. If you get 3 \nor 4 percent of GDP growth, you are moving along at a pretty good pace. \nIn a mature economy you almost never get growth exceeding 3 or 4 \npercent of GDP on a sustained basis. If you are losing 1 percent of \nyour growth, it could be 50 percent or 30 percent of the entire \nnational growth that is being eliminated, pulled down. Why? Because we \nexcessively spending money today, putting our debt off on our children \nand grandchildren into the future. That is going to make them less able \nto have a robust economy than they otherwise would have. People will \npay. Nothing is created from nothing, as Julie Andrews taught us in \nthat great song. Nothing comes from nothing, nothing ever could. \nSomebody is going to pay for this.\n  We are enjoying and celebrating today by spending money that is not \nours. We do not have it in our bank account. We are having to go out \nand borrow. That is the problem that I believe is of great importance.\n  Get this, it has also been reported in the press that Berkshire \nHathaway, Warren Buffett's company--I say to Senator LeMieux--can \nborrow money cheaper than the U.S. Government. The insurance, for those \nwho want to insure the money they loan to the government in case the \nU.S. Government does not pay it back, has tripled. Our annual deficit, \nas a percentage of GDP, is about 9.9 percent. The Greeks are in great \ntrouble. Theirs is 12.9 percent of their economy. We are moving too \nclose to that level. Remember, there are people who, when they buy a \nU.S. Treasury bond, insure themselves against the U.S. Treasury's \nfailure to pay. They are paying three times today what they were paying \njust a few years ago because the U.S. Government's debt is not sound. \nMoody's, the company that rates the debt, continues to suggest they may \ndowngrade our debt. This is because we are borrowing too much. It is \ntime for us to put a stop to this and bring it under control.\n  We have offered several amendments that would fix the unemployment \ninsurance and pay for it. Last night, a series of offsets were \nprovided--offsets being things you could do to get the money out of \ncurrent resources and expenditures instead of borrowing it.\n  Also, it is well known that all the money has not been expended in \nthe $800 billion stimulus plan. A lot of that money is not spent. The \nstimulus bill, when we passed it, was supposed to do a number of \nthings. One was to deal with our crumbling bridges, our infrastructure, \nand one was unemployment insurance. That money has not been spent. Why \ndon't we use it? If you don't use it, it allows that unspent money in \nthe stimulus pot to be used as a slush fund to finance whatever other \nidea on which our leadership desires to spend it. That is what it is. \nWhy won't we use it? Because they still want to use it on other things \nthey have in their minds, of which I have not been fully informed.\n  I will say that I have a lot of county commissioners--and I assume \nthe Senator from Florida has also--talking about roads and highways. I \nhave to tell them how heartbroken I am that the stimulus legislation, \nwhich spent an incredible amount of money--$800 billion--only spent 3 \nor 4 percent on highways and bridges. They are not feeling any growth \nof a significant nature in their infrastructure improvements. The \nadvantages of money being spent on infrastructure are twofold. It \nabsolutely creates a certain number of jobs. Perhaps not a huge number, \nbut a certain number of jobs are absolutely created to do the \nconstruction work, to replace a bridge, to pave a road, or to fix a \nwater sewer system.\n  Those are real jobs. But, more important, when you do that, you have \naccomplished something. You have obtained a tangible asset that \nbenefits the people in that community and makes that community more \nproductive. It also helps make our Nation more competitive because we \nhave either built new infrastructure we needed or restored \ninfrastructure we were going to have to restore anyway to keep up our \nproductivity. Having so little of the money in the stimulus\n\n[[Page S2146]]\n\npackage go to that sort of thing is one reason we have not seen growth \nin jobs.\n  It is particularly disheartening to me to think of how little \npermanent benefit we have gotten from the bill.\n  I see my colleague from Florida, Senator LeMieux, is here. One of the \nthings he and I have talked about a lot--and I think it has been a bit \nof a shock to him since he has been here--is the extent to which our \nNation is increasing our debt. I know he deeply, as a citizen \nlegislator, cares about this situation. In his conversations with me, \nhe has shared with me that is what he thinks is the biggest threat to \nour country. I know he wants to do everything he can to help us right \nthis ship that is going in the wrong direction.\n  I am pleased to yield the floor at this time to Senator LeMieux.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I thank my friend and colleague from \nAlabama. Senator Sessions has been an outstanding leader on many issues \nbut specifically on this issue of fighting against this debt. He and I \noften talk about these concerns. He comes to the floor, and he \narticulates these concerns so the American people can understand how \ndangerous this situation is. But he does not just come and talk about \nthe problem; he offers real solutions to cap our spending, to find \nmechanisms to get this Congress on the right course.\n  As my friend mentioned, I am new to the Senate. I was appointed and \ncame here in September of last year. My experience is in business and \nmy experience is in State government back home in Florida. The \ncomparisons to how Congress manages its money--your money--versus how a \nfamily does or a business does or even a State government does, those \ncomparisons are striking because this is the only institution I have \never been a part of where we do not have to make ends meet, where we \njust spend money we do not have, where we never have a discussion \nabout, well, if we raise this budget for this particular part of the \nmoney we spend, how much are we going to have to lower this budget. \nThat discussion does not happen in the U.S. Congress.\n  In 2011, we are going to take in an estimated $2.2 trillion in \nrevenue from taxes--money that is coming from you, the American \npeople--but we are going to spend $3.8 trillion. That is like a family \nin my home State, say, in Ocala, who makes $22,000 a year and they are \ngoing to spend $38,000. Oh, by the way, they have $1 million in debt. \nIt is unsustainable.\n  The way the American people run their families, the way businesses \nhave to run their budgets, the way State governments that are \nconstitutionally required to balance their budgets have to cut spending \nin tough times--we do not have those mechanisms in this body, and we do \nnot have enough people, such as Senator Sessions, Senator Chambliss, my \nfriend from Georgia, and Senator Coburn from Oklahoma, who come to the \nfloor and bring forth good ideas to talk about this spending problem.\n  This current bill to extend unemployment insurance and add money for \ndoctors who give Medicare services--a lot of those folks in my State in \nFlorida--and for money for COBRA, which is health care when you are \nunemployed, so government can put in that portion your employer would \nnormally pay for--these are all good things. Every Member of this body, \nall 100 Senators, all 41 Members of the Republican side want to vote \nfor this bill.\n  Last night, as my friend from Alabama said, we had a deal worked out \nwith my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to pay for this. What \na novel idea: We are going to spend new money, and we are actually \ngoing to cut money from someplace else in the budget so we do not add \nto the deficit and the debt--shockingly good idea in Washington. But \nthe deal fell apart because our friends in the House of \nRepresentatives, the Democratic leadership, would not agree to it.\n  Let me tell you, there is probably no State in the Union that needs \nthis money more than Florida. I want to vote for it, but I cannot vote \nfor it because it is not paid for.\n  My friend from Georgia just talked about the unemployment number that \ncame out--more than 10 percent unemployment in Georgia. He has a new \nnumber coming out today. The number came out in Florida. We are at 12.2 \npercent unemployment announced today--12.2 percent, the worst \nunemployment in the history of keeping records in Florida. The second \nworst time was in 1973 to 1975, during that recession. There are \n1,126,000 Floridians out of work. By the way, that is just the \nunemployed number. We know those who are underemployed--people who lost \ntheir jobs and now have to work part time and cannot get full-time \nemployment--we know that number, if you add it with those who are \nunemployed, is probably 17, 18, 19 percent of the people.\n  When I go home to Florida and I am walking down the street, one out \nof every five people I see of working age and ability either does not \nhave a job or does not have enough work. That is the issue on which we \nshould be focused. But we cannot continue to pay for things here that \nwe cannot afford. We cannot continue to burden our kids and the next \ngeneration with debt they will not be able to pay.\n  The hour of awakening and the hour we will be responsible and feel \nthe impact for this spending is not just 5 or 10 years from now; it is \nnow, it is today. Let me give an example.\n  Today in the Wall Street Journal, there is an article by Tom \nLauricella. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record this \narticle in the Wall Street Journal.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Wall St. Journal, Mar. 26, 2010]\n\n                        Debt Fears Send Rates Up\n\n\n  Unease at Deficit Hurts Demand for Treasurys; Mortgage Costs on the \n                                  Rise\n\n                          (By Tom Lauricella)\n\n       A sudden drop-off in investor demand for U.S. Treasury \n     notes is raising questions about whether interest rates will \n     finally begin a march higher--a climb that would jack up the \n     government's borrowing costs and spell trouble for the \n     fragile housing market.\n       For months, investors have focused their attention on the \n     debt crisis in Europe, but there are signs the spotlight is \n     turning to the ability of the U.S. to finance its own budget \n     deficit.\n       This week, some investors turned up their noses at three \n     big U.S. Treasury offerings. Demand was weak for a $44 \n     billion 2-year-note auction on Tuesday, a $42 billion sale of \n     5-year debt on Wednesday and a $32 billion 7-year-note sale \n     Thursday.\n       The poor demand, especially from foreign investors, sent \n     the bonds' prices sharply lower and yields higher. It lifted \n     the yield on the 10-year note to 3.9%--its highest since last \n     June, and approaching the psychologically important 4% mark. \n     That mark has been pierced only briefly since the financial \n     crisis in 2008.\n       Investors' response marked a big shift from auctions in \n     recent months in which major foreign buyers, such as central \n     banks, had snapped up Treasurys. It could spell trouble for \n     the U.S. housing market; the rates on many mortgages are \n     linked to the yield on the 10-year note.\n       The move up in its yield coincides with the impending end \n     of the Federal Reserve's program to support the mortgage \n     market. The Fed has bought $1.25 trillion of mortgage-backed \n     securities, bolstering their prices and thus holding down \n     their yields.\n       In just the past two days, the rate on 30-year Fannie Mae \n     mortgage securities has risen to 4.5% from 4.3%. Once fees by \n     lenders are tacked on, this means mortgage rates above 5%. \n     Thomas Lawler, a housing economist, says some bigger lenders \n     have already raised rates. Some were quoting 30-year \n     mortgages at 5.125% Thursday morning, up from 4.875% earlier \n     in the week, he said in a note to clients.\n       Concerns about the U.S. budget deficit are beginning to \n     hurt the Treasury market, said Steve Rodosky, head of \n     Treasury and derivatives trading at bond giant Pacific \n     Investment Management Co. He said he is increasingly worried \n     about the U.S. fiscal outlook.\n       In all, the U.S. government is expected to sell $1.6 \n     trillion in debt this year, including the $118 billion sold \n     this week.\n       There are some temporary factors behind the week's \n     lackluster demand, such as a reluctance by Japanese investors \n     to make new investments ahead of their fiscal year-end March \n     31.\n       While this could be just ``noise'' in the markets, ``I \n     think it involves a greater, long-term concern about deficits \n     in the U.S., about Social Security being in a deficit,'' said \n     Brian Fabbri, chief economist North America at BNP Paribas. \n     ``And all of the concerns about the U.S. have been heightened \n     by concerns about Greece.''\n       The jitters in Treasurys haven't spread to other markets. \n     Stocks remain near 18-month highs. The Dow Jones Industrial \n     Average came within 45 points of the 11000 mark on Thursday \n     before falling back. It closed up 5.06 points at 10841.21.\n       Bruce Bittles, a strategist at R.W. Baird & Co., said he \n     remains bullish on stocks for now. But he said if the yield \n     on 10-year Treasurys creeps above 4%, that would be a signal \n     to start dialing back his clients' stock holdings.\n\n[[Page S2147]]\n\n       ``In a debt-based economy like we have in the U.S., it \n     doesn't take much of a hit from bond yields to cause some \n     real pain,'' by raising costs to finance economic activity, \n     he said.\n       The dollar has rallied, even as Treasurys have sold off. \n     Usually, concerns about budget deficits send a currency \n     lower. But investors appear to be betting on better prospects \n     for a recovery in the U.S. than in Europe.\n       Adding to the focus on the Treasurys' woes has been an \n     unusual development in an important, but usually ignored, \n     market: interest-rate swaps. These common derivatives entail \n     contracts that typically involve trading one stream of \n     interest income for another. And in the past week, investors \n     are being paid more to own U.S. Treasurys than U.S. corporate \n     bonds.\n       This development ``is causing a lot of people to start \n     scratching their heads, trying to understand what's going \n     on,'' said BNP's Mr. Fabbri. One explanation, he said, may be \n     investors are more comfortable with the risks of owning bonds \n     backed by U.S. corporations than the government. The big \n     question is whether this slippage in demand for Treasurys \n     will prove temporary or is the start of a trend.\n       For the most part, investors have taken at face value \n     statements from Federal Reserve officials, including Chairman \n     Ben Bernanke on Thursday, that the Fed isn't about to start \n     raising the short-term rate it controls. But a growing number \n     of investors expect that at its next policy-making meeting in \n     late April, the Fed may step back from its pledge to keep \n     short-term rates low for an ``extended period.''\n       Longer-term interest rates aren't set by the Fed but move \n     on their own, in response to supply and demand. And some \n     argue that the bond market has been too confident about these \n     longer-term rates remaining low, at a time when the economy \n     is slowly improving and the government is running huge budget \n     deficits.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, the article talks about the fact that \nwhen we are selling our debt, which is what the Federal Government does \nwhen we do not have enough money to pay for our expenditures, when we \nspend more than we have, we borrow and we issue debt instruments--\nbonds, Treasury notes. Now we find out in today's Wall Street Journal \nthat the demand for our debt is falling. As my friend, Senator Sessions \nfrom Alabama, said, Warren Buffett now is a better investment than the \nU.S. Treasury. What an important statement that is for us to think \nabout, that we no longer are the best investment, that an individual in \nthis country is a more worthy investment.\n  Now Treasury note demand is down. What happens when less people want \nto buy our debt? When they turn their nose up at our Treasury \nofferings, the bond prices go down and the yield goes higher. The \ninterest rate goes up. That does a couple things. One is that we have \nto spend more money on interest payments. That means more of our \nspending in the year will go to pay for our debt. The third or fourth--\ndepending on how you count it--biggest expenditure every year in our \nbudget is our interest payments. There is more than $200 billion a year \nin interest payments alone. That is money that could be sent back to \nyou, the taxpayer, or could be used to pave roads or hire teachers or \nsend kids to college, and we are sending it to finance bad decisions we \nhave already made. But now, with the interest rates, the yield rates \ngoing higher on the debt we are offering, guess what it is going to do. \nIt is going to increase the cost of borrowing money, which is going to \nincrease the cost of mortgages.\n\n  So here I am from Florida, and I sure want to extend unemployment \ninsurance to folks who are suffering, but I also don't want to do any \nmore damage to our real estate market. We have some of the worst \nforeclosure rates in the country. So what is going to happen when that \nfamily of four in Naples, FL, who has been struggling through this \neconomy, has a problem keeping a job? Maybe mom lost a job and now she \nis underemployed and dad is unemployed, and they are trying to make \ntheir mortgage payments. They have an adjustable rate mortgage and \ntheir interest rates are going to go up. What happens if someone wants \nto buy a new house in our struggling real estate economy? They can't go \nbuy that house because that house is now more expensive because the \ninterest rates have gone up.\n  So the problems of our debt and our deficit are not just going to be \nvisited on our kids, they are being visited now. Other countries around \nthe world, their economies are booming. Their growth is coming back--\nplaces such as Brazil are on fire. Their stock market is up incredibly \nbecause the world is finding it a better place to invest than the \nUnited States. Our debt is making us a bad investment. So not just for \nour kids or our grandkids, right now this economy is going to have \nproblems recovering because of the debt we have now.\n  But let's talk a second about the future. Sometime between now and \nMonday my wife and I are going to have our fourth child. I have the \ncell phone in my pocket. If it rings, I have to go. That baby is going \nto be born in a country where he or she will be responsible for about \n$40,000 in debt. What is the future of our baby, along with our other \nthree sons who are 6, 4 and 2, going to be like in this country with \nall of this crushing debt, with $10 trillion more in debt expected by \nthe end of this decade?\n  We are going to pay $800 billion in interest payments by the end of \nthis decade if this spending continues. That is more than we spend on \nthe defense of the United States, more than our Defense Department \nbudget. More and more will go to interest; less and less will go to \nspending. Then what will happen? Taxes are going to have to go up, and \nby the way, 70 million people are going to retire and they are going to \ngo into Medicare. Those two programs right now don't have enough money \nin them.\n  So while I am high on the American people, and I am optimistic this \ncountry can do anything, I am seriously worried about this government. \nI am seriously worried about the fact that we spend money we don't \nhave, and I am seriously worried about the fact that there are too few \nMembers of this body and the body down the hall who want to make the \ntough decisions to start cutting our spending now to save our future.\n  By the way, it wouldn't be that hard to do. It wouldn't be that hard \nto do for us to come together, Democrats and Republicans alike. The \nAmerican people should know we have colleagues on the other side of the \naisle who want to do this. We talk to them. They are concerned too. But \nwe have to come together and address this, and we are going to have to \nmake, as the President would say, grownup decisions about the future of \nthis country. Some things are going to have to get cut, and we are \ngoing to have to spend less.\n  Let me give an example of the framework--for when we come back from \nthe break--of a piece of legislation I will introduce to give us the \nmechanism for doing this. If we went back to the spending that we had \nin 2007, which is just 3 years ago, and we froze spending at that level \nfor the next 10 years--until 2020--we would balance the budget in 2013, \nand we would cut the deficit of $12 trillion in half by 2020.\n  Now, the question I ask when I am back in Florida talking to \nconstituents is--as my friend from Georgia said--whether at a \nsupermarket, at a townhall meeting, or at a church--would you be able \nto live off the money you made in 2007? Well, the answer unanimously \nis, yes; it is more than I am making now. The economy didn't go into \nrecession until December of 2007. So why can't government go back to \nwhat we spent in 2007 and cap it? Then we could do something we don't \ndo in this Congress: We could look at the money we are spending now as \nopposed to trying to spend new money and find out whether we are doing \nit efficiently.\n  We could cut the wasteful programs. My colleague from Oklahoma has \nalready been identifying hundreds of duplicative programs in \ngovernment. We could go and find ways to combat waste, fraud, and \nabuse. For example, we know there is $60 billion to $100 billion a year \nin Medicare fraud--health care for seniors. My State, unfortunately, is \nthe leading place for health care fraud in the country.\n  I have a proposal I have talked to my friend, the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, about--Chairman Baucus--and other Democrats, and I \nthink we are going to get some bipartisan support to pass that this \nyear, and that may save us $20 billion by stopping waste, fraud, and \nabuse in Medicare. Does anyone think there is not waste and fraud and \nabuse throughout the spending of government? When is the last time \nsomeone went and looked under the hood of one of these agencies and \nsaid: Could we do the same work with less? Do we need to spend as much \nmoney as we spent last year?\n\n[[Page S2148]]\n\n  Businesses do this every year. They are doing it right now, just as \nfamilies are doing it. They are saying: Do we really need to do what we \ndid last year? We have less money; what do we cut? Government doesn't \ndo that.\n  Our friends on the other side are more interested in new programs. We \nshould all spend a year or two focusing on the programs we have. My \nfriend from Oklahoma, Senator Coburn, is a champion at oversight and \ngets under the hood of these agencies and looks at the spending. It is \nnot just in the social services agencies, it is in all the agencies--in \nthe Defense Department and everywhere.\n  We have a duty to the American people to make sure that every dollar \nwe spend, we spend wisely. Let's spend a couple of years questioning \nthe money we are spending now. Let's have our agency heads, our \nSecretaries, our Cabinet members, instead of devising new programs, go \ninto the programs they have and see whether they are helping the \nAmerican people. If they are not, let's cut them. Let's freeze hiring \nacross the Federal Government. A lot of folks are going to retire out \nof the Federal Government when the baby boomers retire. It is an easy \nway to shrink the size of government, to let those folks retire and not \nreplace them. Technology in the private sector gives us great \nopportunities to do more with less. In government, we do less with \nmore.\n  So I am appreciative of my friend from Oklahoma for bringing up this \npoint and objecting. It is not politically popular to do. None of us \nwants to stand in the way of unemployment compensation. I need it in \nFlorida for my folks who are out of work. But we are impacting our way \nof life now, and we are going to impact our children's lives. When my \nbaby is born this weekend, or on Monday, I am going to be extremely \nhappy--and I know my wife is--about bringing a fourth child into the \nworld, but it will still be in the back of my mind: Is he or she going \nto inherit the same America I have, with all the same opportunities I \nwas able to enjoy? I hope so.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my friend from Oklahoma.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Senators from Alabama and Florida for their \ncomments.\n  Many have heard us use the word ``pay-for'' sometimes. When we say \nthat, what we are actually saying is, we don't want the debt increased. \nSo we don't want to get that confused.\n  I also want to make one comment in relation to what Senator Reed from \nRhode Island said earlier today. He said nobody on the other side of \nthe aisle will be objecting to the supplemental coming for the military \nif it is not paid for. I want to state for the record that I voted \nagainst it the last two times. It is not because I don't want to \nsupport the military, but it wasn't paid for. We didn't make the hard \nchoices. I will vote against it again, and I will try to make that a \npay-for. So it is an unfair characterization to say ``nobody.'' I am \npretty consistent on that. If we are going to spend new money, we \nshould cut some of the money we are spending now that isn't as \nimportant.\n  Under the Constitution, the No. 1 responsibility for us is defending \nthe country. One of the reasons we are in trouble is we have ignored \nthe enumerated powers clause of the Constitution, which sets out a very \nlimited role for the Federal Government and reserves the rest of the \nprograms we are talking about to the States and to the people.\n  With that, Mr. President, I would like to recognize the senior--the \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl. I started to say senior, but that is not \nso.\n  Mr. KYL. It is easier just to say the ``other'' Senator from Arizona, \ngiven who my colleague is. First of all, I want to say that my \ncolleague, John McCain, has been a leader in this battle for fiscal \nresponsibility for as long as I have been in the Senate. So as long as \nwe are talking about the senior Senator from Arizona, let me get in \nthat plug.\n  But the Senator from Oklahoma, who just yielded the time to me, has \nbeen the leader in the fight here to ensure that we pay for the things \non which we spend money. I would like to get back to that critical \npoint because I heard both the Senator from Oklahoma and the Senator \nfrom Alabama, who is on the Senate floor, and was last night, make this \nvery point.\n  Let's be clear about what this debate is about and what it is not \nabout. There are a lot of things the government must do. National \ndefense is No. 1. We have to do it. Then we figure out what we have \nenough money for with regard to everything else.\n  There are other very important obligations or responsibilities of the \nFederal Government. We finally get down the list of priorities of the \nthings that it would sure be nice to do, if we could, because of \nvarious needs of the American people. But a lot of times this gets into \nconflict with what families can do to help each other, what communities \ncan do, what churches and religious institutions can do. So it is not \njust a responsibility of government, let alone the United States \nGovernment in Washington.\n  The reason I make that point is that for every dollar that is sent \nback to Washington, the amount of money that gets sent back to help \npeople is usually measured in cents rather than dollars. So it is not \nthe best way for us to take care of our fellow citizens. But one of the \nprograms we have decided we want to have some Federal assistance in is \nto support our States when they provide unemployment compensation to \npeople who have been out of work for a long time and just can't find \nwork.\n  If we have relatively low unemployment, in the 5- or 6-percent \nrange--5 percent is relatively low; 6 percent is beginning to be \nsomething where we begin to pay attention to it--we can let that go for \na little while. But before long, we have citizens out there who can't \nfind work and, therefore, are having a hard time supplying what they \nneed for their families. Again, for a while, their families and \ncommunities and churches and so on can help them, but there comes a \npoint when government has said: We need to help them, and it is best \ndone at the State level. But in the last many decades the Federal \nGovernment has provided support for that unemployment compensation as \nwell.\n  What we are talking about is a situation where we are now close to 10 \npercent unemployment, and it has been that way now for a couple of \nyears. So we keep extending the Federal Government's support for people \nwho can't find jobs. That is a legitimate thing for the Federal \nGovernment to do. It is not the most important thing, but I will tell \nyou, for everybody who needs the help, it is important.\n  So we have tried to do that, and I have voted for every one of these \ntemporary extensions of unemployment benefits. But there also comes a \npoint in time, because this has gone on now for a couple of years and \nwe keep voting time after time for these extensions, that you have to \nask the question: OK, compared to what? Who is paying for this or who \nis going to have to pay for it?\n  As between someone who is looking for a job and needs some help for \ntheir family right now, and my grandchild--and I don't know the \ncircumstances of my grandchild. My grandchild may be smart and get a \ngood job and never have to worry about things in life or, as happens to \nevery family, my grandchild might have a tough time--so I am asking \nmyself--and I heard Senator Coburn on the floor last night make this \npoint--as between what we are spending money on today and my grandchild \nand your grandchild, should we maybe be thinking about the burden we \nare placing on them to pay for this money we are spending today? It is \neasy for us to say we feel sorry for people who cannot find a job right \nnow, let's help them out. It is harder when you say, who is paying the \nbill? If it is my grandkids, and I am not sure what their circumstances \nwill be, I have to think that through.\n\n  What Senator Coburn has led is an effort to say, since we cannot say \nwhat kind of a burden they will have, although we know it is huge based \nupon what we have already spent and deferred for them to pay for, we \nought to be making the tougher decision right now: If this is a \nworthwhile goal, if we want to extend this unemployment compensation, \nthen let's find a way to pay for it now rather than putting more of \nthat burden on our children and on our grandchildren. That is what is \nat issue, not whether we want to do it, not whether it is a good idea \nto do\n\n[[Page S2149]]\n\nit, not whether there are people suffering. All of that is conceded. \nThe question is, Should we put that burden on our children and \ngrandchildren continuously, without even bothering to ask whether we \ncan pay for it now? Maybe there is something else we could give up now \nor delay in order to pay for this so we are not adding to the burden of \nour kids and our grandkids.\n  Last night, we came to a very important conclusion in the Senate, \ninformally, and that conclusion was, since there is a 1-week period of \ntime between the time April 5 that these benefits run out and the time \nApril 12 that we come back into session from the Easter recess, that \nthese, the unemployment benefits, are not paid for here, that we do not \nhave the money to extend the benefits, that what we should do is extend \nthose benefits for that week period of time and pay for it. That is to \nsay, Democratic Senators and Republican Senators agreed, let's extend \nit for that week and let's make sure we are paying for it right now. So \nat least that week's benefits are not going to be an added burden on \nour kids and grandkids--a very important agreement and precedent that \nwe established, for about 45 minutes.\n  When our colleagues on the Democratic side who had agreed with us \nthat this should be done ran that up the flag pole with our Democratic \nleadership colleagues in the House of Representatives, apparently the \nDemocratic leadership said: No, we do not want this paid for. In other \nwords, we want that put off in the future so somebody else will pay for \nit, our kids and grandkids. So our Democratic friends in the Senate \ncame back to us and said we thought we had an agreement to extend this \nfor a week and to pay for it, but our leadership in the House would not \nagree and, therefore, we have to go back to what we did before, which \nis we are not going to have those benefits available for the week \nbetween April 5 and April 12.\n  That is too bad because I think what it showed is, first of all, \nDemocrats and Republicans in the Senate can work in a bipartisan way. \nWe established a good principle. We can both lead with our heart and \nhelp people who need help today but also act with our heads and make \nsure we pay for it rather than just sending the bill to our kids. That \nwas a good precedent, that was a good agreement.\n  But when people out in America say: Why can't they ever work \ntogether, why can't they put politics aside, you have to ask the \nleadership in the House of Representatives because I think we had a \npretty good agreement last night.\n  But what I think we also have established is, over time, more and \nmore of our colleagues are coming to realize it is not a choice between \ndoing something we want to do to help people who need help right now \nand doing nothing, it is a choice between our paying for it or asking \nour kids to pay for it. I think most of us are beginning to come to the \nrealization that from now on, as much as we have gone into debt \naccumulating this huge amount of debt in the past, thinking it would be \nOK for our kids and grandkids to pay for it, we now realize we have put \nentirely too much debt on their shoulders. Their standard of living is \nnot going to be as good as ours.\n  Do you know--I will close with this--public opinion surveys going all \nthe way back to just after World War II asked Americans: Do you think \nthe next generation will be better off than our generation? Do you \nthink we will leave it better for our kids than it was left for us?\n  Every generation has been able to say: Yes, our kids will have a \nbetter standard of living and better future than we did--except now. If \nyou look at the surveys, they all say we believe we have it better than \nour kids will; that we have put too much of the burden of what we have \nspent onto our kids and grandkids. For the first time in history, \nAmericans believe their kids, our kids, will not be as well off as we \nwere. Why? Because we wanted to spend, we wanted to help people by \nspending a lot of money in Washington, but we were not willing to make \nthe tough decisions to figure out how to pay for it.\n  That is a real shocking testament because we have always said we are \nthe land of opportunity, and the American dream is every generation \nthat succeeds will be better off than the generation before. To think \nabout the fact that Americans do not believe that is true anymore is \nbothersome. But we have an ability to do something about it, and it \nstarted last night right here in the Senate. It started with Senator \nCoburn saying: No, we need to pay for this, and everybody else finally \nsaying you are right and coming together in a bipartisan way, Democrats \nand Republicans saying we can at least start with 1 week where we do \nsomething we all want to do, help people who are unemployed, and pay \nfor it ourselves rather than sending the bill to our kids.\n  That is a start and we ought to build on that. Even though that fell \napart, I think it represents the beginning. If we can continue to seek \nthe advice of our constituents, ask the American people: What do you \nthink about this, do you think we are right about this, I think they \nwill tell us that is exactly what they want us to do, and I think they \nwill thank us this week for beginning to take the small steps to get to \nthat point. Rather than casting aspersions or making political \narguments or getting into partisan politics, I am going to assume we \nhave kind of turned a corner and all of us can agree this is what we \naspire to do. We may stumble along the way a little bit. But if we can \nnow take two steps forward and only one step back rather than one step \nforward and two steps back, digging the debt hole deeper and deeper, \nthen maybe in a few years we will be able to answer those public \nopinion questions and say: I think we have turned it around. I think \nour kids will have a better future than we did. That is the best legacy \nof all that we could leave for them.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I comment on the Senator's point, there is not anybody in \nthis body, Republican or Democrat, liberal or conservative, who does \nnot want a great future for our kids. Everybody does. The Senator from \nOregon has a set of twins, beautiful kids. He wants the best for them. \nWhat we want is the same thing other Americans want.\n  I showed this little sign earlier. I actually got to meet this girl \nbecause I thought it was so unique that she had the wisdom or somebody \nin her family had the wisdom to make the contrast. She doesn't even \nhave a home yet, and when she had this her share of the debt was \n$38,375. That is just external debt. That does not include what we \nborrowed and stole from Social Security and all the other trust funds. \nIf we included that, she would have been about $42,000. I marked \nthrough that this morning because it is now at the end of this year, \nSeptember 30 of this year, every man, woman and little girl and little \nboy will be responsible for $45,000. It is going to grow $6,000 per \nman, woman, and child this year alone. That is just talking about the \nexternal debt. That is not talking about what we are stealing from \nother people.\n  Is there a point in time when we are on a downslope, where we get to \na point in time where there is no return? We know that. Senator \nSessions talked about it in terms of 90 percent of GDP, and how that \nhas a depression. I made the point earlier. We saw a 1-percent increase \nin interest rates last year. We owe $12.8 trillion. That is $128 \nbillion we are going to pay more in interest in this next year than we \npaid in the last year, as you float through all the bonds and recognize \nthat 1 percent increase. What was 2.4 percent 1\\1/2\\ years ago on 10-\nyear Treasury bonds is 3.88 percent right now, this morning. I checked \nit before I came over here. That is 1.48. As our debt balloons, that \ninterest cost is going to go up.\n\n  You heard Senator Sessions say in 2019 we will spend $850 billion on \ninterest. We are going to spend $850 billion on interest. Of the $9.8 \ntrillion we are going to borrow over the next 9 years, $5.6 trillion of \nthat is going to be interest. So now we are borrowing trillions of \ndollars to pay the interest on trillions of dollars.\n  It has to stop. My colleagues on the other side of the aisle \nrecognize that. It is not that they do not want to fix it too. I agree \nwith the Senator from Arizona. I think we will come to that realization \nacross party lines. I was proud of the Senate yesterday because we \nactually worked together and came to a compromise that we could all \nagree to, and we got shot down by those who are thinking short term.\n\n[[Page S2150]]\n\n  I am not doing this to score political points, as the Senator from \nMichigan alluded. I am not doing anything that I have not believed all \nthe time I have been here, and my colleagues all across this body know \nthat. The problem right now in our country is the debt. It is the debt.\n  If, in fact, we want a future--I have a 7-month old new one. I have \nfive grandchildren. She is as cute as she can be. Her name is Katie \nRose. I got to see her a couple weeks ago as my daughter came through. \nShe hadn't seen me in a couple months and didn't like what she saw. I \ncan't blame her for that. But the fact is, everybody has a Katie Rose. \nIf this is your child, the new birth we are going to celebrate, Senator \nLeMieux's this weekend--everybody has one. So the contrast is, Can we \ndo both? Can we take care of the Katie Roses of this world and take \ncare of the unemployed or do we just say: No, it is too hard. If it is \ntoo hard, we are over. And I believe it is not over. It does not have \nto be. We can come together and solve both the debt problem and the \nneeds of our country. We can do that.\n  I wish to give one little example. In the month of December, I had my \nstaff search through programs that are duplicative. In 2 weeks, my \nstaff found 640 duplicative programs--640. Let me just give one \nexample. In our Federal Government, we have 105 programs run by nine \ndifferent agencies to encourage people to study math, science, \nengineering and technology. One hundred five? So after that experience \nin December on one of the bills out here we put through, that passed, \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle agreed we should have GAO do \nthat study for us to give us all of them. That is just what we found in \n2 weeks--there are thousands--because that tells us where to start \neliminating duplication, start asking for metrics on what you are \ndoing. If you have a program for math, engineering, science and \ntechnology, we ought to measure whether it is effective. We might only \nwant to have one program instead of 105.\n  In the Judiciary Committee in the past 2 months, we have had two \ndifferent bills that have come forward to solve problems. When the \nbills were offered, we didn't even know we had agencies out there and a \nprogram ready to do it.\n  There were some positive things with the health care bill. There are \ntons of negatives in my experience as a doctor who has practiced 27 \nyears. But one of the negatives is, we are going to have 88 new \ngovernment programs and we are probably going to add about 50,000 or \n60,000 or 70,000 people to that. I know we are going to add 16,500 to \nthe IRS to make sure you bought your health insurance. Why would we do \nthat?\n  It is time for us to make the difficult choices. The choice does not \nhave to be do nothing or pay for it. The choice can be we can take care \nof both.\n  I will close with this discussion. This is what we did last year--43 \ncents of everything the Government spent we borrowed from Katie Roses. \nThat is who is going to pay it back. We are not going to pay it back. \nThis year it is going to be over 45 cents, maybe 46 or 47 cents this \nyear, because when you take the real projections for what our addition \nto the debt this year is--in terms of recognizing all the debt such as \nan accountant would do, not like the Government does--we are going to \nhave a $1.8 trillion deficit.\n  This means, externally and internally, we are going to borrow $1.5 \ntrillion externally, but internally we are going to borrow $300 billion \nfrom trust funds and programs and everything else we have.\n  Let me give you a little example people never think about. It is \ncalled the Inland Waterway Trust Fund. It is the trust fund that has \npaid for all of our inland waterways. There is no money in it because \nwe have taken it all out. We cannot do what we need to do on our \nnavigable waters where we haul freight and barges because we have \nstolen all of the money. There are hundreds of those trust funds where \nwe have emptied the coffers.\n  I will end with this last request. When we come back, my pledge is to \nwork with anybody in this body who will seriously work with me on \nmaking the appropriate tradeoffs of what is important and what is not \nin terms of priorities.\n  You know that our nature as elected officials is not to offend \nanybody. If we continue with that process--I am talking about those who \nsupport programs we cannot afford--we are all going to be offended \nbecause every Katie Rose in the world, in our country, will have her \nfuture squelched.\n  And the last set of numbers you should pay attention to: If you are \nunder 25 years of age today--that means from 25 to 1--20 years from \nnow, you plus everybody who is born in that 20 years will be \nresponsible for debt and unfunded liabilities of $1,113,000. Think \nabout that. In the next 20 years, those under 25 and below and \neverybody born will be responsible for $1,113,000. Think about what \nthat costs. If you apply a 6-percent interest rate to that, let's round \nit at $60,000--it is more than that; $66,000-something--you are going \nto have to pay $66,000 in carry costs either through interest on the \nnational debt or through direct taxes before you ever pay the first \nincome tax to run anything for the Federal Government. What does that \nmean in terms of opportunity for those Katie Roses and this little \ngirl? It means they will have trouble buying a home. They will have \ntrouble educating their kids to give them opportunity.\n  So I believe we are at a point where we have to start making the hard \ndecisions. My pledge to my colleagues is that I will work with you in a \nway that is positive to make sure we do not put these people at risk. \nBut I also will work with you to make sure you understand that I am \ngoing stand up every time, including the supplemental that is coming \nforward, and say that we must pay for it rather than charge it to our \nchildren.\n  With that, I yield our time to the Senator from Oregon. I would note \nthat we have until 12:30 to finish this discussion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oregon is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, when I have come to the floor over the last \nfew months, I have always tried to focus on ways to bring parties \ntogether, both sides to work for common solutions--whether it's health \ncare, the new tax reform bill Senator Gregg and I have introduced, or \nthe Build America Bonds program put together by Senator Thune and I, \nwhich has clearly been a huge success in terms of revolutionizing the \nsystem for funding transportation and infrastructure. Senator Cornyn \nand I are working on a significant crime bill. So I am always going to \ncome to this floor and try to be bipartisan and bring both sides \ntogether.\n  On this question of helping folks who are so desperately hurting \ntoday--including so many in my State, where we have a very high \nunemployment rate--I want to suggest a bipartisan path forward that I \nhope we can look at in the days ahead. I see my friend from Georgia \nhere, who also wants to work on these major economic issues in a \nbipartisan way.\n  When you listened to colleagues last night and this morning, it seems \nto me there is agreement on two fundamental principles. One is that it \nis absolutely essential to help folks who are hurting now. We have \nmillions of Americans walking on an economic tightrope; balancing their \nfood bill against their fuel bill; trying to pay for essentials; going \nto bed every night, whether in Colorado, Oregon, or Georgia, figuring \nout if they are going to be able to pay the bills when they wake up in \nthe morning. So there is agreement on both sides that you have to help \nfolks who are hurting now. There is also agreement that we have to deal \nwith this deficit, and the spending issue which is contributing to the \ndeficit for the long term. So, in effect, we start the possibility of a \nbipartisan strategy around agreement in two key areas: We have to help \nfolks now who are hurting, and we have to deal with those major \ndeficits, the revenue and spending problems, in the long term.\n  What there is disagreement on, it seems to me, is the timing of these \nparticular debates. I and others feel very strongly that it is just not \nright to compound the hurt Americans are suffering, even for a few \nweeks, even for a few days. That is why we very much want, before we go \nhome, to have this worked out and to get this unemployment benefits \nextension to them.\n  We also recognize that getting at this long-term budget issue quickly \nis a matter of national urgency. I sit on the Budget Committee. We are \ngoing to\n\n[[Page S2151]]\n\nhave a chance to do that in April, within 30 days.\n  So what you see is, in effect, all of the various ideas with respect \nto extending unemployment so that folks who are hurting so badly do not \ngo without for a short period of time--a week, 2 weeks, 30 days--a \nvariety of different approaches. All of those time periods are shorter \nthan the time period for when we will have an our opportunity to make \ntough decisions for the long term that we have heard Democrats and \nRepublicans talking about this morning.\n  So I hope that we can get back to working in a bipartisan way around \nthose two areas of agreement that will help folks who are hurting now, \nhelp them quickly, not have them suffer any more, even for a few \nadditional days, and that we recognize that in April, on the Budget \nCommittee on which I serve, we will have the opportunity to tackle the \nlarger budget issues. We have very strong bipartisan leadership between \nSenator Conrad and Senator Gregg. A lot of us thought they were right \non their debt commission. I supported that, supported it for a long \ntime. So we have an opportunity to make those long-term budget \ndecisions Democrats and Republicans rightly have said are so important, \nbeginning next month. So let's do both. Let's help people who are \nhurting now and recognize how serious the challenge is with respect to \nthe long term as well.\n  The only other point I would make with respect to the unemployment \nextension is a point made by a number of our country's leading \neconomists who are advising both Republicans and Democrats, again, in a \nbipartisan fashion. Mark Zandi, for example, one of our leading \neconomists who is relied on by individuals of both political parties, \nhas pointed out that for every dollar of unemployment, our country gets \n$1.64 in return. The folks who are unemployed spend their benefits as \nquickly as they can get them. They spend them only on essentials. They \nspend them on the essentials of life.\n  It is pretty obvious that consumer spending is a very significant \npart of economic recovery. The economic recovery is obviously fragile. \nWe have so many folks out of work, and those folks and the folks who \nare worried about losing their jobs put off spending on anything but \nthe most basic needs. So obviously that slowdown in consumer spending \nalso takes a toll on our economy. If we are going to make up for the \ndecline in consumer spending, one obvious way, it seems to me, is to \nget this extra help to folks who are hurting so badly today in our \ncountry.\n  So it strikes me that the decision to not get help to people \nimmediately is simply illogical. It is bad from the standpoint of \neconomic recovery. It is obviously going to compound the hurt Americans \nwho are out of work are experiencing now, and colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle have said they don't want that to happen.\n  So I am very hopeful that even before the end of the day, for the \nfolks who are out of work, who are exhausting their unemployment and \nCOBRA benefits--that there will be discussions here in the Senate to \ntry to make sure folks are not denied the bare minimums that are needed \nto just get by and not denied even for just a few days. The fact is, \nthese are folks who are making $250, $300 a week. None of them are \nliving a life of leisure. No one can say these folks are somehow, as a \nresult of their benefits, disinclined to find work. They are not part \nof ``Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.'' They are the millions who \ntoday walk that economic tightrope, always feeling that another big \nbill is going to push them into the abyss where they cannot afford to \npay the rent, cannot afford to pay the utility bill, cannot afford \nfood. It is not right to let these folks suffer.\n  I would submit that on a matter such as this, which is, in my view, a \nquestion of right and wrong, that is what extending unemployment \nbenefits for a short period of time to prevent human suffering is all \nabout, that we stay at this effort so folks who are hurting so badly in \nour country do not lose out, if even for only a few days. I will be at \nmy post to continue to work and talk with colleagues of both political \nparties toward that end. We have to stay at it to ensure there is no \nbreak in the essential benefits the most vulnerable of our country so \ndesperately needs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/26/senate-section/article/S2151-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2151]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION EXTENSION ACT OF 2010\n\n  Mr. WYDEN.

Mr. President, I have listened to the debate in \nthe last few hours, yesterday, and today. I have heard these debates \nfor years about unemployment compensation, unemployment insurance. In \nthe end, some of my colleagues vote for extension of unemployment \nbenefits for hard-working Americans, Americans who have had jobs and \nare trying to find jobs but have lost their jobs.\n  When I saw what happened a month ago when Senator Bunning, time and \ntime again, single-handedly for a period of time--because of the \npeculiar rules of this institution, one Senator representing a State \nthat has less than 1 percent of the population, one Senator \nrepresenting a State which makes up less than 1 percent of the \ncountry--granted the minority leader is in that State too--one Senator \ncan block the extension of unemployment compensation to millions of \nAmericans, to people in Youngstown, Lima, Mansfield, or Chillicothe and \nToledo. Now we have a handful of his colleagues doing the same thing.\n  Sometimes I think they don't understand unemployment compensation. \nThey believe unemployment is welfare. It is called unemployment \ninsurance. That doesn't mean people are looking for a handout. It means \nworkers, as virtually everyone does who is working, pay into an \ninsurance fund when they are working. The whole point is, if they lose \ntheir job they collect unemployment insurance.\n  It is like you buy car insurance, hoping you don't have to use it. \nBut if you get in a car accident, you use the insurance to pay for it. \nMany people don't ever have to collect unemployment insurance. They are \nthe lucky ones. It is the same with health insurance. You buy health \ninsurance and you hope to not use it, but if you get sick, then you use \nyour health insurance. Whether you are a worker in Boulder or Pueblo or \nTrinidad or Columbus or Dayton, you need that unemployment insurance as \na backup.\n  So many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, so many \nconservatives think it is a welfare program: I got laid off. I can draw \nunemployment and stay on it, and I don't have to work. I can enjoy my \ntime off.\n  It is not vacation. The New York Times had some articles the other \nday\n\n[[Page S2152]]\n\nabout the number of people who can't find jobs and how it affects their \nhealth. It affects their mental health, their relationships with their \nchildren and spouses. It affects their views of themselves and their \nself-worth. It is not a welfare program. It is not enough money to get \nby comfortably. It is enough to keep them going with the hopes that \nthey will find a job pretty soon.\n  There are, of course, requirements too. They don't just sit home and \ndraw unemployment. They are required to actively seek work in most \nStates. I know of people in my State, as does the Presiding Officer, in \nColorado, who have sent out 20, 30, 50 resumes a week. Most of them are \nnot even answered or the answers are curt and negative over and over.\n  My colleagues, all of whom dress up, men and women both, wear decent \nclothes, are paid $170,000 a year. Many more come from great wealth. \nThey probably don't experience what unemployment compensation is like. \nI will not be personal, and I will not mention any names, but for them \nto stand on the Senate floor--I know what they really think sometimes--\nfor them to come up with all kinds of reasons to block the extension of \nunemployment benefits--not to mention COBRA, the program, the \ngovernment helps people continue to get health insurance after they \nhave lost their job, when they have almost no money to spend on it--\ndon't know how important that is to people's lives. I hear some of my \ncolleagues say: I am voting against an unemployment extension because \nwe are not paying for it.\n  First, unemployment insurance is considered emergency spending. This \nis a little bit too much beltway talk, but it has always been \nconsidered emergency spending. We don't have to find a way to \ncompensate for it, to pay for it, any more than when there is a flood \nin North Dakota or there is a hurricane in Louisiana or, unfortunately, \nthere is a war in Iraq which had always historically been paid for. \nSenator Simpson, a former Republican Senator from Wyoming, said the \nIraq war is the first time he ever knew about in American history when \nwe didn't pay for a war. I hear these lectures--and that is what they \nare--from our conservative colleagues, preaching to us, talking to us \nlike we are children because we are not paying for an unemployment \nextension.\n  In the last 10 years, they voted for a war that they refused to pay \nfor. Only $1 trillion it has cost. They voted for the giveaway for drug \ncompanies and insurance companies, all in the name of Medicare \nprivatization. That was $100 billion or more. They didn't pay for it. \nThen they voted for tax cuts that went to the richest Americans. They \njust forgot to pay for that too.\n  We do tax cuts for the rich; we do giveaways to the drug companies \nand insurance companies. Tax cuts for the rich, not paid for; giveaway \nto the insurance companies and the drug companies, not paid for; a war \nin Iraq, not paid for. Yet they are all of a sudden shrinking it down \nto: We are not going to let workers in this country who are laid off \nget their sustenance--just a few dollars for rent, for food, kids' \nschool supplies--we are going to block that. That is, frankly, why \npeople around the country are angry at Congress.\n  They say: Why can't you just do the right thing here instead of \nmaking it political? They have made it political by saying: This is \nwhere we are drawing the line. We are not paying for unemployment \ninsurance extension. If you are not going to pay for it, we are not \ngoing to do it.\n  It is the same over and over. Offer another drug company giveaway or \ntax cuts for the rich, they will say: Where do I sign up? That will \nhelp the country. Their way of thinking is a bit peculiar.\n  Senator Kaufman, who has such insight on preventing another disaster \non Wall Street--if people would have listened to him a few years \nearlier, we would be in a better situation. He is waiting to speak. I \nwill read a few letters I have received.\n  Marianne from Lorain County, the county I live in, says: I am a \nsingle mom of a 4-year-old. I have been unemployed for over a year. I \nhave never been unemployed before. I have worked since I was 15. It is \na terribly difficult situation. I am at the end of my rope, not knowing \nwhat do I have to give up next. Do I have to give up my home, my car, \nmy son's preschool. I am writing to ask you to push another \nunemployment extension, please.\n  How can that not be an emergency. How can they stand on this floor \nand say: Sorry, can't do it, just can't do the unemployment extension? \nThis is exactly the kind of person who is so often afflicted by this \nsituation. She works and she has worked since she was 15. She has a 4-\nyear-old. She is making a choice: Do I give up my home? Do I give up my \ncar?\n  I live in Lorain County. Unless you are lucky and you live in exactly \nthe right place, you have a lot of trouble getting to work if you don't \nhave a car. So we are going to say: You get rid of your car, but we \nwant you to find work. Or if she gives up preschool, we know, by any \nmeasurement, if we are going to get this country competitive \neconomically, internationally, and do what we need to do, we need to do \nbetter with education. The Presiding Officer understands that preschool \neducation is such an important component for children for preparing for \nthe future.\n  Let me read a second letter from Stephen from Tuscarawas County, a \ncounty south of Canton, west of Youngstown, a fairly small county.\n  Stephen writes:\n\n       I am a union electrician who started my apprenticeship in \n     1992. I have been an electrician ever since. I have never \n     been at a loss for work until September 2009. As much as I \n     wish I didn't have to collect unemployment, I am terrified it \n     will run out. I will have no means to take care of my family \n     of five. I will have no idea what to do if that happens. I am \n     the sole breadwinner for my family. My wife has had to have \n     surgery twice in the past year and a half. She broke her knee \n     and currently can't walk.\n\n  She is a mother of five and busy doing what she is doing taking care \nof this family. For many families, there are two breadwinners. In \nStephen's case, with electrician's wages, he has had enough income for \na wife and three children.\n  He continues:\n\n       I just ask that you take into consideration our situation. \n     We need this extension.\n\n  I will not share other letters. I wanted to share those two from a \nsingle mother who has worked all her life, and an electrician in \nTuscarawas County who has, for more than 20 years, been a well-paid \nunion electrician. We know those are good jobs with good benefits and \ncontribute a lot to our country.\n  I will close with this: Again, I plead with my colleagues, my \nconservative colleagues, put aside your ideology for a minute. Put \naside your ideology that says that unemployment is welfare because it \nis not; it is insurance. People have paid into it. They should collect \nwhen they have paid into it and when they have done well; they collect \nfrom it when they have done badly. It is an American concept of \ninsurance, social insurance, private insurance, whatever. Put aside \nyour ideology, put aside your politics that you want to score points by \nsaying: We will not do this because we have to ``pay for it.''\n  If they had shown us they cared a little more about the budget \ndeficit 10 years ago, when we had a huge budget surplus, soon after the \nPresiding Officer came to the House--he was part of the effort that put \na budget together and we had economic growth and we had a budget \nsurplus. They took that surplus and put all that money to their \ncontractor friends in Iraq and put all that money into drug companies \nand insurance company subsidies, put all that money into tax cuts for \nthe richest Americans. Now they want to take it out on those people who \nhave lost their jobs. It is unconscionable. It is not what the American \npeople stand for. It is not American values.\n  I ask them to reconsider what they are doing.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/26/senate-section/article/S2152-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2152-S2155]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            TOO BIG TO FAIL\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I have spoken twice on the floor in the \npast\n\n[[Page S2153]]\n\nfew weeks on the problem of ``too big to fail.'' This is a critical \nissue for any financial reform legislation. Each Senator must ask \nwhether this issue is effectively addressed in landmark legislation the \nSenate will soon consider. I will limit my remarks today to the central \naspect of the challenge we face, ``too big to fail.'' In particular, \ndoes this bill take the necessary steps to reduce the size, complexity, \nand concentrated power of the behemoths that currently dominate our \nfinancial industry and our economy?\n  If not, what is the justification for maintaining their status quo, \nwhat is the risk that one might fail, and--if that were to occur--what \nis the likelihood that the American taxpayer will once again have to \nbail them out?\n  The answer is that there is little in the current legislation that \nwould change the behavior or reduce the size of the Nation's six \nmegabanks.\n  Instead, this bill invests its hopes in two ideas: First, that \nchastened regulators--who, we must remember, failed miserably in \npreventing the crisis--will this time control these megabanks more \neffectively--today, tomorrow, and decades into the future. And, second, \nthat a resolution authority designed to shield the taxpayers from yet \nanother bailout will be able successfully to unwind incredibly complex \nmegabanks that are engaged across the globe.\n  In the midst of the Great Depression, Congress built laws that \nmaintained financial stability for nearly 60 years.\n  Through the Glass-Steagall Act, which included the establishment of \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Congress separated \ninvestment banks, which were free to engage in risky behavior, and \ncommercial banks, whose deposits were federally insured.\n  As I described in a previous speech, during the last 30 years, that \ndivision was methodically disassembled by a deregulatory mindset, \nleading to the reckless Wall Street behavior that caused the greatest \nfinancial crisis and economic downturn since the 1930s.\n  What walls will this bill erect? None.\n  On what bedrock does this bill rest if the Nation is to hope for \nanother 60 years of financial stability? Better and smarter regulators, \nplain and simple.\n  No great statutory walls, no hard divisions or limits on regulatory \ndiscretion, only a reshuffled set of regulatory powers that already \nexist. Remember, it was the regulators who abdicated their \nresponsibilities and helped cause this crisis.\n  Thus far, on the central aspect of ``too big to fail,'' financial \nreform consists of giving regulators the authority to supervise \ninstitutions that are too big, and then the ability to resolve those \nbanks when they are about to fail.\n  Upon closer examination, however, the former is virtually the same \nauthority regulators currently possess, while the latter--an orderly \nresolution of a failing megabank--I believe, is an illusion.\n  Unless Congress breaks up the megabanks that are ``too big to fail,'' \nthe American taxpayer will remain the ultimate guarantor in an almost \ncertain-to-repeat-itself cycle of boom, bust, and bailout.\n  The first question is how big must a financial institution be to be \n``too big to fail''?\n  Let us examine how concentrated some of our giant financial \ninstitutions have become.\n  Only 15 years ago, the six largest U.S. banks had assets equal to 17 \npercent of overall gross domestic product.\n  The six largest banks today in the United States now have total \nassets estimated to be in excess of 63 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct.\n  Three of these megabanks have close to $2 trillion of assets on their \nbalance sheets.\n  Their gigantic size, and the perception in the marketplace that they \nare indeed too big for the government ever to permit them to fail, \ngives these megabanks a competitive advantage over smaller financial \ninstitutions. It also instills a dangerous willingness to engage in \nexcessive risk taking.\n  As Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke recently stated,\n\n       [I]f a firm is publicly perceived as too big, or \n     interconnected, or systemically critical for the authorities \n     to permit its failure, its creditors and counterparties have \n     less incentive to evaluate the quality of the firm's business \n     model, its management, and its risk-taking behavior.\n       As a result, such firms face limited market discipline, \n     allowing them to obtain funding on better terms than the \n     quality or riskiness of their business would merit and giving \n     them incentives to take on excessive risks.\n\n  In other words, with a taxpayer safety net beneath them, these Wall \nStreet firms will continue to have an irresistible incentive to keep \nwalking across a financial high-wire of speculative investments in \nsearch of ever greater profits.\n  Some might say that Canada and other countries also have large banks \nand didn't encounter serious problems. But this ignores the obvious \nfacts that our economy is about 10 times the size of Canada's and our \nfinancial ecosystem is far more complex.\n  It also ignores that Canada's largest banks rest on a bedrock of \ngovernment-guaranteed mortgages and a social compact between those \nbanks and their regulators.\n  To adopt a Canadian-type model in the U.S., we would need to merge \nour banks into even fewer banking giants, and then re-inflate Fannie \nMae and Freddie Mac to guarantee some of the riskiest parts of the \nbanks' portfolios.\n  Moreover, for every example of a country--usually far smaller than \nours--that has coped with megabanks, there are at least as many where \nthis system has failed, and failed spectacularly.\n  Take Ireland, for example, whose largest banks went on a credit binge \nthat ended in disaster. Now Ireland's citizens are paying the price \nthrough draconian pay cuts and higher taxes, to say nothing of the \ncountry's lost economic growth.\n  Ireland provides a cautionary tale. These megabanks, whether they are \nlegally domiciled in our borders or beyond, are simply too big to \nmanage and too complicated to regulate.\n  There are also those who argue that we have had financial crises \ncaused largely by small institutions. That is absolutely true. But \nthose problems were managed without bringing our entire financial \nsystem to the brink of disaster, the signature and near-cataclysmic \nevent of the last crisis.\n  In the savings and loan crisis, more than 700 thrifts--both large and \nsmall--failed, many wrongdoers were sent to prison, and the Resolution \nTrust Corporation was created to liquidate the assets of failed \ninstitutions. In short, the crisis was managed and our financial system \nabsorbed the blows.\n  Compare that to the last crisis when our financial system barely \nrecovered from a black hole that threatened to suck into oblivion our \nentire financial system after the failure of just one large investment \nbank.\n  The legislation proposes that we must improve the regulation of \ninstitutions that are ``too big.'' The reform proposals would put in \nplace a systemic risk council to monitor for such risks and to identify \nfinancial institutions that should be subject to enhanced supervision. \nNext, they would have the Federal Reserve act as the de facto regulator \nof these systemically significant financial institutions.\n  The truth is, we have had a de facto systemic risk council for \ndecades. It is called the President's Working Group on Financial \nMarkets. Chaired by the Treasury Secretary, it includes the heads of \nthe Federal Reserve, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the \nCommodities Futures Trading Commission, and it was established by \nPresident Reagan following the 1987 stock market crash.\n  Its track record in spotting incipient financial risks has been \nabysmal. Notably, Treasury Secretary Paulson used the President's \nWorking Group as a form of a systemic risk council, but it achieved \nessentially nothing--nothing--to reduce those risks. While adding \nadditional members and providing some additional powers, the new \nsystemic risk council is the President's Working Group by another name.\n  The reform proposals would also give the Federal Reserve the \nauthority to supervise institutions that the council deems are \nsystemically significant. Under the proposed legislation, the Federal \nReserve would have specific powers to impose higher leverage, capital, \nliquidity, and other requirements upon these institutions.\n  The Federal Reserve already has the power to impose such standards on \nmost of these institutions. The proposed regulatory reforms are mainly \na redundant statement of the Fed's existing powers.\n\n[[Page S2154]]\n\n  Just this week, a Moody's report stated:\n\n        . . . the proposed regulatory framework doesn't appear to \n     be significantly different from what exists today.\n\n  Moody's went on to explain that:\n\n       The current regulatory regime is already authorized to \n     protect the soundness of banks and the financial system as a \n     whole. In addition, the current banking laws give bank \n     regulators the power to have banks cease and desist from \n     activities and to require banks to have higher capital \n     ratios.\n\n  No doubt the bill does contain some expanded tools for the Fed. For \nthe first time, the Fed will have direct supervisory authority for not \njust bank holding companies, but for their large nonbank subsidiaries \nas well. In addition, the Fed will also have authority over nonbank \nfinancial institutions that the council deems are systemically risky.\n  But as Moody's has recognized, the powers resemble the current \nregulatory framework. Federal bank regulators, which had the \nresponsibility to ensure financial stability before the crisis, will \nagain bear the responsibility after the crisis.\n  And bank regulators will continue to dance the tango with the big \nbanks, interrupted briefly by new legislation which, in fact, includes \nfew substantive changes in safety and soundness banking practices.\n  It is true that under the current Senate bill, regulators could--\ncould--potentially invoke the Volcker Rule, which would prohibit \ncommercial banks from owning or sponsoring ``hedge funds, private \nequity funds, and purely proprietary trading in securities, derivatives \nor commodity markets.''\n  I applaud former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker for his \ncritical leadership on these issues, which the administration has \nendorsed.\n  Unfortunately, the legislation now being considered by the Senate \nrequires the council first to study the Volcker rule before deciding \nwhether to enforce it. In the end, it could issue a recommendation not \nto enforce the Volcker rule at all.\n  Or the council might recommend simply that regulators mandate capital \nrequirements that are adequate for any risky proprietary activities a \nparticular bank might undertake--a power regulators already have. The \nreality is that regulators have long had the authority to prohibit \nspeculative activities at banks, but never opted to do so.\n  Under the Bank Holding Company Act, the Federal Reserve may require a \nbank holding company to terminate an activity or control of a nonbank \nsubsidiary--such as a broker-dealer or an insurance company--if that \nactivity or subsidiary poses serious risk to the safety, soundness or \nstability of the holding company.\n  As we all know too well, in the past, these very same bank regulators \nfailed utterly. Indeed, as the ``umbrella regulator'' for all bank \nholding companies, the Federal Reserve could have increased capital and \nother requirements for these institutions, but instead farmed out this \nfunction to credit rating agencies and the banks themselves.\n  Meanwhile, as the consolidated supervisor of major investment banks, \nthe SEC had similar powers to those of the Fed. And it goes without \nsaying that its track record of regulatory enforcement was littered \nwith colossal failures.\n  Chastened regulators may try in the coming years to be harder on the \nmegabanks, to increase their capital requirements, and to keep a close \neye on their liquidity levels, liabilities, and leverage ratios.\n  But even if they do, history has shown us that the tango will reach \nthe end of the dance floor, and the big banks will execute the turn and \nlead again, leaving our regulators hopelessly aside in understanding \nthe complex and opaque transactions that interconnect the giant banks.\n  In sum, little in these reforms is really new, and nothing in these \nreforms will change the size ofour megabanks.\n  That is why I believe we must impose these changes by statute--by \nstatute. I would go beyond even statutorily requiring banks to live \nunder the Volcker rule, by reinstating by statute the firewall between \ncommercial and investment banking activities. Unless we break the \nmegabanks apart, they will remain too large and interconnected for \nregulators to effectively control them. And once the next inevitable \nfinancial crisis occurs, and the contagion spreads too quickly for the \ngovernment to believe that a failing firm won't take down others as \nwell, the American taxpayer--the American taxpayer--the American \ntaxpayer--will again be forced into the breach.\n\n  The proposed plan calls for a resolution authority to deal with these \ninstitutions when they inevitably get into trouble. An early \nresolution, we are promised, guided by a systemic council looking into \nits crystal ball, will prevent the taxpayer from ever again needing to \nsave the day.\n  It is true that the existing mechanism, which tasks the FDIC with \nresolving failing depository institutions, has worked well--but only \nworked well up to a point. The problem is that our experience with \nresolving banks--highlighted by the 140 bank failures that occurred \nlast year and their cost to the deposit insurance fund--has shown us \nthat prompt corrective action is almost always too late.\n  As many commentators have noted, no matter how well Congress crafts a \nresolution mechanism, there can never be an orderly winddown of a $2 \ntrillion financial institution that has hundreds of billions of dollars \nof off-balance-sheet assets, relies heavily on wholesale funding, and \nhas more than a toehold in over 100 countries.\n  A backstop of a $50 billion or even a $100 billion resolution fund \nwould come nowhere close to being big enough to resolve a $2 trillion \nfinancial institution.\n  As the Economist notes:\n\n       [Resolution authority] may prove unworkable, of course. The \n     threat of being wiped out in bankruptcy could cause creditors \n     to flee both the troubled firm and any firms like it, \n     precisely the sort of panic the resolution regime is meant to \n     avoid.\n       ``In a severe financial crisis it will be too terrifying \n     for politicians and bureaucrats to use'' the new process, \n     predicts Douglas Elliott of the Brookings Institution.\n       Instead, he says, they will resort to ad hoc measures as \n     they did in 2008.\n\n  Not surprisingly, there are many barriers to resolving large and \ncomplex financial institutions. Most notably, there are international \ndimensions to the problem, depending on resolution authority.\n  Following the collapse of Lehman Brothers, there was an intense and \ndisruptive dispute between regulators in the U.S. and U.K. over how to \nhandle customer claims and liabilities. While U.S. bankruptcy \nprotection allowed Lehman Brothers' U.S. operations to continue for \ndays as a going concern, Lehman's operations in the U.K. were halted in \naccordance with British bankruptcy law.\n  Given that there apparently were more than 600,000 open derivatives \ncontracts in the U.K. on the day that Lehman failed, many \ncounterparties and clients were stranded, consequently hampering \nbankruptcy efforts in the U.S. as well.\n  To those who promote resolution authority as a solution, I ask: \nExactly what would have happened differently if Lehman had been in \nreceivership during those harrowing days in September?\n  Moreover, the reluctance last spring to nationalize these banks, to \nplace them in a form of resolution receivership, was because it would \nhave been too costly to the taxpayer to take over or put into \nbankruptcy the megabanks.\n  Why would it not be costly with a U.S.-only resolution authority? The \ntruth is: It would be. The taxpayer will remain the ultimate guarantor.\n  The international difficulty of acting quickly before contagion \nspreads is almost impossible to overcome without a cross-border \nresolution agreement. Unfortunately, there is nothing in the resolution \nauthority that the Senate will consider that would help address this \nproblem. We all know that it is a problem that will only get worse \ngiven the inevitability of further financial globalization.\n  In coming years, the U.S. megabanks will extend their reach into \nglobal markets, relying on their funding advantages as too-big-to-fail \nU.S. banks to profit from increasingly sophisticated transactions in \ncountries around the world.\n  The problems with resolution authority for the megabanks aren't just \ninternational in nature. These institutions use short-term \ncollateralized loans called repurchase agreements, or repos, to finance \na significant portion of their\n\n[[Page S2155]]\n\nbalance sheet and have massive counterparty exposures that arise out of \ntheir roles as derivatives dealers.\n  Both repos and derivatives are qualified financial contracts, meaning \nthat exposures that arise from them are effectively super senior to the \nclaims of all other creditors. By giving these trading exposures such a \nprivileged position under the bankruptcy code, we have allowed a major \npart of our financial system--called the shadow banking system--to grow \ncompletely unchecked without any market or regulatory discipline \nwhatsoever.\n  As Peter Fisher, former Under Secretary of the Treasury and former \nhead of the markets desk at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, has \nstated:\n\n       [these changes to the bankruptcy code] transformed the \n     `too-big-to-fail' problem of our largest deposit takers into \n     the `too-interconnected-to-fail' problem of our major \n     financial institutions.\n\n  The proof of that statement is borne out by the data.\n  One report by researchers at the Bank of International Settlements \nestimated that the size of the overall repo market in the U.S., Euro \nregion and the U.K. totaled approximately $11 trillion at the end of \n2007.\n  Meanwhile, the total notional value of OTC derivatives contracts is \nequal to $605 trillion, as of June, 2009.\n  Large financial institutions that rely chiefly upon wholesale \nfinancing and have massive counterparty exposures from their \nderivatives positions are combustible. The case studies of Lehman and \nthe other investment banks show how quickly and violently these \ninstitutions can implode. When they do, their interconnected nature \ninevitably causes a contagion, leading to a collapse in confidence and \nthe classic patterns of a bank run.\n  As the Moody's report summarizes the question, We must:\n\n     try to assess whether or not the law could be effective in \n     its stated objective: allowing a troubled, systemically \n     important financial institution to default on selected \n     obligations, while avoiding the larger effects that such a \n     default might have on the financial system and on the broader \n     economy.\n       That is a challenging objective to accomplish in reality, \n     given contagion risk and the high degree of connectedness \n     among such institutions, both domestically and cross border \n     (where any such resolution authority would have no \n     authority).\n\n  Resolution authority is therefore a slender reed upon which to lean \nwhen it comes to institutions as large, complex and interconnected as \nthese.\n  The truth is that we need to split up and break down the largest and \nmost complex financial institutions.\n  As President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas Richard Fisher \nstated on March 3rd:\n\n       I think the disagreeable but sound thing to do regarding \n     institutions that are [`too big to fail'] is to dismantle \n     them over time into institutions that can be prudently \n     managed and regulated across borders. And this should be done \n     before the next financial crisis, because it surely cannot be \n     done in the middle of a crisis.\n\n  The first step is to separate federally insured banks from risky \ninvestment banks. As Senators Maria Cantwell, John McCain and others \nhave urged, we should break up the largest banks and resign to history \n``too big to fail'' banks. This worked for nearly 60 years, and would \nonce again ensure the soundness of commercial banks while placing risky \ninvestment bank activities far beyond any government safety net.\n  Second, we also need statutory size and leverage limits on banks and \nnonbanks. We should set a hard cap on the liabilities of banks and \nother financial institutions as a percentage of GDP.\n  The size limit should constrain the amount of non-deposit liabilities \nat large mega-banks, which rely heavily on short-term financing like \nrepos and commercial paper.\n  In addition, we should institute a simple statutory leverage \nrequirement to limit how much firms can borrow relative to how much \ntheir shareholders have on the line.\n  Finally, we must put in place reforms for derivatives and other \nqualified financial contracts.\n  Get this: The five largest banks control 95 percent of the OTC \nderivatives market.\n  We must require derivatives to be centrally cleared, which will \nreduce the complex web of counterparty credit risks throughout our \nsystem.\n  CFTC Chairman Gary Gensler underscores that point by stating:\n\n       Central clearing would greatly reduce both the size of \n     dealers as well as the interconnectedness between Wall Street \n     banks, their customers and the economy.\n\n  In addition, we should reconsider the legal treatment of qualified \nfinancial contract exposures under the bankruptcy code, and therefore \nunder a resolution regime, as well.\n  Given the sheer size of cross exposures arising from derivatives and \nrepos that financial firms have with each other, it makes sense to \nallow derivative and repo exposures to be netted out prior to any \nautomatic stay.\n  It is not apparent why that net credit exposure should come ahead of \nthe claims of other secured creditors. This is special treatment, not \nmarket discipline.\n  All of these changes taken together would reduce risk in the system, \nimpose discipline in the market, and break the cycle of obligatory \nbooms, busts and bailouts. In short, they eliminate the problem of \nhaving institutions that are both too big and interconnected to fail.\n  If instead our solution is to depend on regulators, and to wait with \nan impractical plan to resolve failing institutions, the financial \nsystem will continue on its inexorable path, growing bigger, more \ncomplex and more concentrated. And we will only be laying the \ngroundwork for an even greater crisis the next time.\n  In the midst of the Great Depression, we built strong walls that \nlasted for generations. The devastation of our most recent crisis \nchallenges us to do so again.\n  These megabanks are too big to manage, too big to regulate, too big \nto fail, and too interconnected to resolve when the next crisis hits. \nWe must break up these banks and separate again those commercial \nbanking activities that are guaranteed by the government from those \ninvestment banking activities that are speculative and reflect greater \nrisk.\n  We must limit the size, liabilities, and leverage of any systemically \nsignificant financial institution.\n  Given the ever-increasing rate of financial innovation, the need for \nCongress--not the regulators--to impose these time-honored principles \nhas never been greater. The stakes have never been higher.\n  It is time to follow in the footsteps of those great Senators who \nmade the tough decision in the 1930s to pass the Glass-Steagall Act and \nother landmark reform bills, which paved the way for almost 60 years \nwithout a major financial meltdown. Once again, we must ensure that \ngovernment guarantees of commercial bank deposits do not enable \nfinancial institutions to engage in the risky activities of investment \nbanks.\n  Finally we must guarantee that there are no banks that are too big to \nmanage too big to regulate, and too big to fail. The American people \ndeserve no less.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes, if I can. I \nknow we are in the waning minutes of going out of session and Members \nhave, I think by and large, probably left the city for their respective \nStates--as I will be doing in a day or so, going back to Connecticut to \nspend time with my family and constituents over the Easter-Passover \nbreak.\n  I wish to take a couple of minutes to talk briefly about my \nresponsibilities as chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs Committee on which I serve with 22 others of our colleagues. \nAlmost a quarter of this institution sits on that committee. Senator \nRichard Shelby of Alabama is my ranking Republican member and former \nchairman of the committee, I might point out.\n\n[[Page S2156]]\n\n  We finished our work, at least in our committee, last Monday--a \nrather abbreviated markup, I might point out. I didn't plan it to be \nthat way, but we ended up with a pretty short markup of a fairly \ncomplicated bill.\n  A week ago today, at about this time or a little after this time, we \nreceived amendments. Almost 400 amendments were filed, so I anticipated \na rather elongated markup, but members decided they weren't going to \noffer their amendments in the committee, which is their right. I had a \nresponsibility as chairman of the committee to consider those \namendments if they were offered, and we were prepared to accept some, \nmodify some, and reject others. But the conclusion of the committee was \nto take what changes we had made and move forward. So it is my hope \nthat shortly after our return in the second week of April, we will come \nto the floor of the Senate to debate--hopefully a full-throated \ndebate--about how we reform the financial services sector of our \nNation.\n  In light of the events over the last several years, this is a \ncompelling issue that mandates our involvement and participation. We \ncan hardly allow this Congress to leave the door wide open again to the \nkind of abuses that brought our Nation to the brink of financial \ncollapse. Those were the words used by the Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, Mr. Ben Bernanke, on September 18 of 2008, as they were the \nwords of the former Treasury Secretary, Henry Paulson, when they met \nwith the leadership of the House and the Senate and the respective \nleaderships of the committees of jurisdiction. They predicted that had \nwe not acted in the remaining weeks of that session before the \nadjournment in 2008, in fact, we might very well be looking at a very \ndifferent country today. Certainly we avoided the collapse they talked \nabout but at great cost. The fact that this country and its taxpayers \nhad to write a check for $700 billion, resources of which went to a \nhandful of financial institutions to ``bail them out'' in order to \npreserve the safety and soundness of a fragile financial system is \nsomething that still causes remarkable levels of anger and \nfrustration--understandable levels of frustration and anger--of the \nAmerican people all across the country, regardless of where one \nlives. The idea is that a firm on Wall Street could get near the brink \nof disaster and get massive resources poured into them and then we have \nto watch someone's home in Connecticut or Delaware or Colorado, \nTennessee or Alabama foreclosed, a business closed, a retirement \naccount evaporating within a matter of hours, despite the fact these \nlarger institutions were getting the resources from the American \ntaxpayers.\n\n  We made an effort--I don't claim by any stretch of the imagination \nperfection--to try to deal with the reforms. Obviously, it is a \ncomplicated matter and complications are added to it. We have 23 \nmembers of a committee, not to mention 100 Members of this body who all \nhave various views on what ought to be done, not to mention the other \nbody, the White House, stakeholders, and others, trying to fashion \nlegislation, not saying we are going to stop all financial problems in \nthe future--that would be ludicrous to make such a suggestion--but \nthere will be other financial problems.\n  What we are going to try and do with this bill and what we think we \nhave done to a large extent with this bill is to say there may be other \nfinancial problems but never again should a financial problem of a \nmajor financial institution put the rest of the country at risk. That \nis what happened. Because of their abuses, their greed, the failure of \nregulators, or the failure of the government to regulate certain \ninstitutions, we saw a system go haywire.\n  I do not mind if some firm wants to go to the casino and gamble with \ntheir money. I understand that. But the idea that they would do that \nwith the taxpayers' money or with the well-being of our economy has to \nstop. Our legislation is designed to do that.\n  First and foremost, never, ever again should a financial institution \nget so large, so interconnected, and produce products that put the rest \nof us at risk. Our legislation shuts that door, we believe, firmly.\n  Others are arguing because, frankly, they do not want to admit what \nthe real argument is about, they do not like the fact we have a \nconsumer protection agency for the first time in the history of our \ncountry, so people who buy a mortgage, buy stock, buy an insurance \npolicy, whatever else it may be, will have someplace to go if, in fact, \nthey are being abused. That is exactly what happened. They were abused \nin too many instances. Rather than focus their criticism on that, they \nare focusing on other things that, frankly, we are dealing with very \neffectively in the legislation.\n  We also set up an early warning system to the largest extent possible \nso we know what is going on out there with products and firms that \nbring us to the brink of disaster as they did only a few short months \nago.\n  We are looking at some of these exotic instruments--credit default \nswaps, derivatives, over the counter--an industry that went from about \n$90 billion and within the space of 6 or 7 years, to close to $600 \nbillion. It exploded in large measure because it was in the shadow \neconomy. That ends with this bill. They are going to have the glaring \nlight of sunshine on them through exchanges so the American people can \nknow exactly what these instruments are and how much risk is being \ntaken with their use.\n  There are elements of this country that do not like that idea because \nthey would rather not have the light shone on them to examine what they \nare, but we are determined to see to it that is going to be the case in \nour legislation as well.\n  There are a lot of other provisions in a 1,400-page bill that deal \nwith other matters related to all of this business. I wanted to inform \nmy colleagues that we have a strong bill coming out of our committee--a \nfully independent consumer protection agency, bureau or division. It is \nhoused in the Federal Reserve in our bill, which has caused some people \nto wonder how independent it can be. It is totally independent. Its \nhead will be appointed by the President of the United States. That head \nwould then have to be confirmed by the Senate. The budget this agency \nwould have is going to be separate from other budgets. It will have its \nown line of funding to go forward. It has independent authority on \nrulemaking, examination, and enforcement with institutions that have \nassets in excess of $10 billion. And for those that are smaller than \nthat, the examination and enforcement will be done at the State level \nor others will be responsible.\n  Many are concerned this would reach down to the community banks. We \nseparated that out. I know my colleagues expressed that view. That we \nhave finally someone watching out is going to be very important. We \nwere told for years our system was safe and sound because they were \nmaking a lot of money. As we learned painfully, that is not the only \ncriteria to determine whether a financial institution is safe or sound. \nIn fact, they were anything but safe and sound, despite their earnings \nreports. We subsequently learned that people were put into homes they \nnever could afford, did not understand because these institutions were \nsecuritizing those mortgages, bundling them together and then selling \nthem to unwitting investors because they had ratings on them that never \nreflected the reality of what those instruments were worth in our \ncountry. Our legislation deals with that as well in a very strong and \neffective manner.\n  My only purpose in sharing a few thoughts this afternoon before \nadjournment occurs is to say I hope my colleagues in their visits back \nto their States, in talking with their constituents, will talk about \nthese issues. Listen to your businesses on Main Street. Listen to the \nborrowers. Listen to the users and the customers of financial \ninstitutions.\n  The institutions are going to call you. They are going to write you. \nThey are going to find you, believe me, because many of them do not \nlike what I have done in this bill. They would like the status quo to \nbe maintained. You are going to hear from them, I promise you. You are \ngoing to have to work a little harder to listen to the voices out there \nwho may not contact you about this but will tell you what it is like to \ntry to borrow money, make an investment, get credit, buy a home, get a \nstudent loan in order to afford the cost of higher education. I urge my \ncolleagues\n\n[[Page S2157]]\n\nto listen to those voices as well. They deserve to be heard in this \ndebate. Then I hope we will have the kind of full-throated debate when \nwe get back, meet with the other body with a final product, and \nhopefully give the President of the United States a bill worthy of the \nchallenge before us.\n  This is the single largest reform of financial services since the \nthirties. It is long overdue. We must not fail in our obligation to \nmeet the challenges. If we leave here failing to do this, we will \nexpose our economy, and the American public will never, ever again \nwrite a check as they did in the fall of 2008. You can forget about \nthat. We need to make sure these firms that get into trouble understand \nthe presumption is bankruptcy, receivership. Shareholders will pay a \nprice, and management goes. The idea that you are going to be able to \ncount somehow on the American taxpayer pulling your chestnuts out of \nthe fire is over within the ``too big to fail'' concept.\n  The importance of achieving that goal along with these other reforms \nI think will have the desired effect. Failure to do that leaves us \nexposed to the kinds of financial challenges we have witnessed over the \nlast several years.\n  Again, a business, I say respectfully, in Connecticut, Delaware, or \nColorado, a homeowner in those States should not have to pay the price \nbecause a handful of financial institutions got too greedy, too risky, \nand were unwilling to examine what they were doing or did, recognizing \nthe Federal Government would bail them out if they made a bad choice, \nwhich they did.\n  I look forward to that debate and presenting the bill our committee \nmarked up on Monday of this past week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on behalf \nof the millions of Americans who know our Nation is desperately in need \nof health care reform. Traveling across Colorado this past year, a \ncommon theme surfaced as I spoke with families, health care providers, \nand businesses alike. They all want a health care system that tackles \ncosts, improves quality, and puts their needs first.\n  I have heard, as I know the Presiding Officer has in his home State \nof Delaware, stories of Coloradans who paid a lifetime of health care \npremiums in order to provide for their families, all to have an \ninsurance company drop their coverage because a wife or a husband or a \nchild became ill.\n  Visiting with health care providers, I heard about the waste and \nabuse in our system. They have all pleaded with me to have commonsense \nreforms that get them back to the business they thought they were \nentering years ago--the business of caring for their fellow Americans \nbeset by illness and disease.\n  I heard from small business owners who continue to see double-digit \nincreases in insurance costs, in many cases for the ninth or the tenth \nor even more years in a row. These small business owners want to see \nrelief, not for themselves but because they do not want to have to \nchoose between laying off workers and leaving their workers vulnerable \nto medical bankruptcies.\n  Decade after decade, we see how the fine print of insurance company \npolicies puts shareholder interests above those of American families \nand how partisanship has prevented the kind of progress everyone agrees \nis sorely needed.\n  I have good news. Despite all the ugly rhetoric, distortions, and \nmisrepresentations we have heard, Coloradans and the rest of the \ncountry can finally rest assured that someone has put their interests \nfirst.\n  This week, I watched as President Obama signed into law the kind of \nreforms that will free Americans from the shackles of never-ending cost \nincreases, dropped coverage, and unfair practices that put profits \nabove the provision of care.\n  Throughout this past fall and winter, I joined you, Mr. President, \nand the rest of our freshman class in the Chamber repeatedly to talk \nabout the urgent need for health care reform. We shot down false \nclaims, challenged the phony reasoning that was out there, and pointed \nout where the rhetoric ends and reality begins.\n  Over the past few days, many more of our colleagues from this side of \nthe aisle have compellingly and eloquently explained how important the \nnew health reform law is to both the American people and the American \neconomy. The fact is that this historic bill signed by the President \nsaves lives, saves money, and it saves Medicare.\n  Bringing this long debate to a close, I wish to speak directly to the \npeople of Colorado. It is important that they know how these health \ninsurance reforms will benefit their families and the rest of our great \nState.\n  As a result of the President signing the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act into law, the parents of Colorado's 1.2 million \nchildren can sleep easy starting this year knowing that insurance \ncompanies no longer have the right to deny their kids health care \ncoverage because of a preexisting condition.\n  Also starting in 2010, almost half a million, 500,000 young adults in \nColorado who would otherwise be kicked off their parents' health care \npolicies can maintain that coverage through to their 27th birthday. \nThis is particularly welcome to me, as I know it is for many \nColoradans, because I have two college-age kids who fit into the \ncategory I just described.\n  We have 575,000 seniors in our Medicare Program, and for every single \none of them, this new law will protect--I want to emphasize that--will \nprotect their guaranteed benefits and immediately allow them to get \npreventive care with absolutely no copay or out-of-pocket costs. This \nadded benefit, contrary to what we have heard, will increase their \nhealth care coverage under the Medicare Program so that our seniors can \ncontinue to live happy and healthy lives.\n  This new law goes to great lengths to help slow the growth of health \ncare costs and, by doing so, it is projected that these lower costs \nwill allow Colorado's employers to hire up to 6,500 new employees in \nour State. And for as many as 68,000 small businesses, health reform \nwill begin providing millions of dollars in tax credits so they can \nafford to offer health insurance to their employees.\n  Yesterday, we sat here and cast 56 votes as Democrats to make final \nimprovements to the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. That \nreconciliation measure we passed yesterday will provide prescription \ndrug relief as well for our Colorado seniors. More than 100,000 \nColorado seniors, such as my friend Frank Blakely in Colorado Springs, \nwill pay less for prescription drugs.\n  Right now, these seniors hit what we all know here as the Medicare \npart D doughnut hole, which means they have to pay thousands of dollars \ndirectly out of pocket for their medicines. But beginning this year, \nevery one of these seniors will receive a $250 check to help them \noffset those costs, and we will begin to close the overall gap in \nMedicare coverage so that we completely fill this doughnut hole by the \nyear 2020. I know this will be welcome relief to those on fixed incomes \nall across the United States, because it will free up scarce retirement \ndollars to visit family members, help pay a grandchild's college \ntuition or even to help, in some cases, put food on the table.\n  I think one of the overriding features of health reform is the \nfreedom it will give to Coloradans and hard-working Americans--the \nfreedom to change jobs, to launch a business, to even start a family \nwhile knowing that health care coverage will be there for them when \nthey need it. Americans need to know their country won't leave them to \nfend for themselves when an insurance company denies or drops their \ncoverage. They deserve peace of mind to know that someone is on their \nside.\n  Over the last few days we have heard a lot of the same misleading \nrhetoric that we did back in August by those who were dead set on \nlevying accusations rather than working on real reform. Well, health \nreform has become the law of the land and the American people don't \nhave to wait any longer for these important reforms. The legislation we \npassed will establish a sturdy foundation upon which we will build, \nimprove, and strengthen access to health care in America. Will there be \nmistakes made along the way? I don't doubt it.\n\n[[Page S2158]]\n\n  I am a lifelong mountain climber, and I know from experience that any \ndifficult climb includes storms, and you make a mistake finding your \nroute along the way. But what matters is that you dust yourself off and \nyou move forward. I think there have been a lot of storms on this \njourney so far, and it hasn't been perfectly smooth. But it has been in \nthe right direction. Despite our stumbles and twists and turns along \nthe way, we kept our eye on the summit in front of us, where providing \nquality affordable coverage for every American is a reality.\n  Every successful expedition, in my experience, has a leader, and I \nwant to take a moment to recognize our leader, Senate Majority Leader \nReid. He has literally had the health and well-being of millions of \nAmericans on his shoulders--some would say the weight of the world. \nThat is a heavy backpack. But at the same time he has shouldered that \nload, been an unwavering advocate for reform, and he has exemplified \nthe American resiliency which has helped make our Nation the greatest \nNation on Earth.\n  I would also like to thank my staff, especially Jake Swanton and John \nRayburn, who have worked tirelessly to fight for Colorado and make \nquality affordable health coverage a reality for millions of Americans.\n  As I close, I want to say how proud I am that the health care bills \nwe passed this week will modernize our health care delivery system, \nincrease much-needed choice and competition within the health insurance \nindustry, and help put our economy back on track, while clearly \nimproving the financial security of middle-class working families.\n  This has been an historic week for Colorado and for the American \npeople. The victory, of course, isn't for the Senate or the House, or \nthe President, or for our political parties, it is for the American \npeople. I have certainly been humbled to have been given the \nopportunity to serve my great State during this unforgettable, long, \nand sustained debate, and I look forward to the important climbs that \nstill await us as we implement this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado).

Mr. President, the signing of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act was historic. In addition to providing coverage and \nlowering health insurance costs for millions of Americans, the \nlegislation will truly transform how care is delivered in the United \nStates. As part of this new law, we are improving Medicare for the \nseniors and people with disabilities who depend on the program, \nextending the solvency of the program, and closing the prescription \ndrug doughnut hole.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act creates the \nIndependent Payment Advisory Board, IPAB. The Finance Committee, led by \nChairman Baucus and Senator Rockefeller, devised the board to provide \nreason and expertise to Medicare payment policy. Experts have concluded \nthat the board will in fact bend the cost curve, achieving key goals of \nhealth reform: lowering costs overall and increasing Medicare's \nlongevity.\n  Built into the IPAB are protections for beneficiaries from limits on \ncare and increased costs. The Senate will ensure that the new board \noperates in a transparent way with input from patients, providers, and \nexperts to guarantee the best outcomes and continued access to care. \nMoreover, we in the Senate will oversee Medicare and the IPAB to \nprotect the seniors and people with disabilities. Medicare is one of \nour most treasured programs, and the IPAB will only improve the program \nfor beneficiaries in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/26/senate-section/article/S2158-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           COWBOY POETRY WEEK\n\n  Mr. REID.

What \nbegan as storytelling over the campfire has evolved into both a way to \npreserve the history and culture of the West, as well as a modern art \nform that embraces the cowboy way of life.\n  The National Cowboy Poetry Gathering, in Elko, NV, celebrated its \n26th anniversary this January. Through events like this, cowboy poetry \nhas experienced a resurgence in recent years, at once preserving \nrecitation traditions that are a central form of artistry in \ncommunities throughout the West and promoting popular poetry and \nliterature to the general public. At cowboy poetry gatherings, urban \npopulations are able to glimpse a way of life that continues to exist \non rangelands across the West.\n  As someone from a small town in Nevada, I have seen firsthand how the \nWest has changed since I was young, but thanks to cowboy poets, among \nothers, we will never lose the true spirit of the West. For this \nreason, I would like to thank the thousands of people out there in a \nfew short weeks celebrating Cowboy Poetry Week, and I wish them all an \nenjoyable and successful week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/26/senate-section/article/S2158-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2158]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RECONCILIATION\n\n  Ms. STABENOW.

In short, it makes a good \nbill better.\n  Now, at the very last minute, my colleagues on the other side have \noffered a number of amendments designed to play games with Americans' \nhealth care and to cause delays and obstructions as we reach final \npassage of this bill. I voted against the long list of amendments \noffered by the other side--as did the majority of the Senate--not \nbecause some weren't good amendments but because this was not the \nappropriate legislation to attach them to. I have been and will \ncontinue to be a champion of many of these issues, but I will not vote \nto play games with the health care of American families.

Mr. President, today I rise to speak on the important \noccasion of Women's History Month. Since 1987, the month of March has \nbeen dedicated not only to remembering and appreciating the \ndistinguished accomplishments of women, but also to commending their \ncontinued positive influence on society. I would like to call \nparticular attention to the contributions of North Carolina women, as \nthey have consistently proven themselves to be revolutionary in their \nthoughts and actions and have contributed immensely to the development \nof our Nation since its conception.\n  Our way of life has been bettered in countless ways by women \nrevolutionaries, crusaders, politicians, athletes, and everyday \ncitizens of North Carolina. From the 51 patriotic women who organized \nthe Edenton Tea Party to Dolley Madison, whose social grace and \npolitical acumen helped create the modern White House; from Harriet \nJacobs, a North Carolina escaped slave who exposed the injustices of \nslavery in her ``Incidents in the Life of a Slave Girl,'' to Mary Jane \nPatterson, the first African-American woman to receive a bachelor of \narts degree; from Tabitha Ann Holton, the first licensed female \nattorney in North Carolina and the South, to Dr. Annie Lowrie \nAlexander, the State's first female physician; from Sallie Walker \nStockard, the first woman to graduate from the University of North \nCarolina to Kay Yow, the great North Carolina State University women's \nbasketball coach who led\n\n[[Page S2159]]\n\nAmerican women to gold at the 1988 Seoul Olympics; from Eliza Jane \nPratt, the first woman to represent North Carolina in the United States \nCongress to Elizabeth Dole, the first female U.S. Senator from North \nCarolina and dedicated public servant, the history of North Carolina's \nwomen is America's history, and it is truly remarkable.\n  During Women's History Month, we honor the generations of women who \nhave achieved notoriety in the past, however, we must do more than \nremember. It is imperative that we reflect on the present and prepare \nfor the future. It is the hardworking North Carolina women who are \ncontinuing to serve our society as parents, doctors, teachers, nurses, \nbusinesswomen, soldiers, marines, and in countless other capacities \nthat will impact our Nation's history in a powerful and positive way. \nWe must build on the legacy of these great North Carolina women, \nespecially those who serve anonymously and who have preserved the \nAmerican way of life while contributing so much to the strength and \ncharacter of our Nation. The women of our great State have triumphed \nthroughout our history, and I know that they will play a leading role \nin our future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/26/senate-section/article/S2159-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CLOSING THE GUN SHOW LOOPHOLE\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on March 4, 2010, John Patrick Bedell, a \n36-year-old Californian with a history of mental illness, arrived at \nthe Pentagon after a manic, cross-country journey. At 6:40 pm, Mr. \nBedell, armed with two 9mm handguns, walked to the security checkpoint \nat the Pentagon entrance and started shooting. Three Pentagon security \nofficers, Colin Richards, Jeffrey Amos and Marvin Carraway, returned \nfire and brought down Mr. Bedell, who later died from his injuries. Mr. \nAmos and Mr. Carraway were wounded in the exchange, but thankfully have \nfully recovered. If not for the decisive action taken by these brave \nofficers, this apparently random attack could have claimed more \nvictims. And while I am pleased the Pentagon's security system worked \nin this instance, I remain deeply troubled by the fact that Mr. Bedell \nwas able to acquire firearms in the first place.\n  Since the shooting, law enforcement officials have been able to \npartially trace the firearms used by Mr. Bedell. One handgun was sold \nlast year to a private individual at a Las Vegas gun show, and that \nperson later resold the gun to a third person. At that point, according \nto authorities, they were not able to further trace the gun's ownership \nhistory until Mr. Bedell opened fire on March 4. This murky trail \nperfectly illustrates the danger of unregulated, private firearm \ntransactions.\n  Under the Brady Law, before an individual can purchase a gun from a \nlicensed dealer, they must pass a background check to ensure they are \nnot legally prohibited from purchasing a firearm. In 2008, 9.9 million \nbackground checks were conducted for firearm purchases, 147,000 of \nwhich were rejected. The majority of these denials were the consequence \nof a prior conviction, indictment or a history of mental illness. \nHowever, when an individual purchases a handgun from a private citizen, \nwho is not a licensed gun dealer, there are no requirements to ensure \nthat the purchaser is not in a prohibited category. Neither the Las \nVegas gun show sale, nor the subsequent private transactions that \nultimately resulted in Mr. Bedell acquiring the firearm, were \nregulated. Due to this ``gun show loophole'' in federal law, \nauthorities were not aware of, or able to block this string of private \nsales, which led to Mr. Bedell purchasing the weapon and using it to \nattack the Pentagon. In fact, according to news reports, Mr. Bedell \nattempted to buy a gun from a licensed firearm dealer in California, \nbut the sale was blocked because he fell into a prohibited category.\n  Because private party transactions account for approximately 40 \npercent of all gun sales, current Federal background check requirements \nhave a limited impact on the overall rates of gun related violent \ncrime. To better protect our communities from gun related violence, \nbackground checks should be required for all prospective firearm \ntransactions, including private transactions. To that end, I am a \ncosponsor of the Gun Show Background Check Act of 2009, S.843, which \nwas introduced by Senator Frank Lautenberg. This bill would extend the \nprotections of the Brady Law to purchases made at gun shows, thereby \nclosing the loophole that currently permits gun sales without criminal \nbackground checks. I urge my colleagues to take up and pass this \ncommonsense legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/26/senate-section/article/S2159-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PASSAGE OF S. 3186\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

Mr. President, I wish today to join with the American \nRed Cross and elebrate March as American Red Cross Month. Throughout \nthe history of this organization, the American Red Cross has \ndemonstrated not only their fierce and patriotic loyalty to this \ncountry and our needs but to those abroad as well.\n  This year, many of our brothers and sisters worldwide have \nexperienced extreme devastation. The earthquakes in Haiti and Chile \nshowed us not only how fragile life can be but the importance of \nhumanitarian response to those in need.\n  Alexander Solzhenitsyn, a Russian novelist, historian, and Nobel \nLaureate for literature knew the power of our interconnectedness as it \nrelates to our own humanity. He said, ``The salvation of mankind lies \nonly in making everything the concern of all.''\n  No other organization embodies this philosophy more than the American \nRed Cross and of the vision articulated by Clara Barton, founder of \nthis wonderful organization that has helped countless individuals--both \ndomestic and abroad--in times of crisis.\n  Whether comforting a wounded soldier during battle, assisting those \nwho are recovering from a natural disaster, or administering life-\nsaving blood to a sick patient, the American Red Cross is there, never \nwavering but standing steadfast in the service to humanity.\n  This year especially, they have been ever vigilant in remaining true \nto the humanitarian nature of their organization. In Haiti, the Red \nCross distributions of food and relief supplies continue throughout \nurban settlements and are reaching approximately 12,500 people each \nday. To date, nearly 27,000 people have been vaccinated in the \ncoordinated immunization campaign, in which the Red Cross health care \nunits and the Haitian National Red Cross Society are participating. The \nAmerican Red Cross has provided approximately $375,000 in operational \nfunding for this campaign.\n  In Chile, the American Red Cross has increased the funds committed \nfrom its International Response Fund to $250,000 in support of Red \nCross response operations. It will be contributing these funds toward \nthe International Federation's emergency appeal. Additionally, the \nInternational Federation has announced a disaster plan of action and \nfunding in the amount of $6.4 million to support Chilean Red Cross \nrelief operations to assist 75,000 people for 6 months in the areas of \nshelter, water and sanitation, health and telecommunications. This is \nin addition to $280,000 released from its Disaster Response Emergency \nFund.\n  Like the national headquarters of the American Red Cross, I am \nextremely proud of our Kansas chapters of the American Red Cross \norganizations and volunteers. From respnding to our own State's natural \ndisasters, to providing programs to our troops such as the Holiday Mail \nfor Heroes Program to providing much needed health and wellness \ncourses--these individuals are\n\n[[Page S2160]]\n\nthe bedrock upon our local Kansas communities.\n  Since 1943, every President of the United States has proclaimed March \nas American Red Cross Month and in turn, the organization uses this \nmonth to promote the services provided to the public each and every \nday. Communities depend on the Red Cross in times of need, the Red \nCross depends on the support of the public to achieve its mission.\n  I am pleased to join with the Red Cross and highlight the courageous \nwork that this organization has accomplished for more than 128 years \nand continues to accomplish this day. I would also like to take this \nopportunity to salute all of the tireless volunteers of this \norganization known as ``Red Crossers'' who for many, have been involved \nin their communities for 10, 20, even 80 years.\n  It is very fitting that we celebrate March as American Red Cross \nMonth and continue to advance the principles of this very essential \norganization.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/26/senate-section/article/S2160-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 TRIBUTE TO SENATOR J. BENNETT JOHNSTON\n\n Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the former \nsenior Senator from Louisiana, Senator J. Bennett Johnston, on \nreceiving the prestigious Centennial Leadership Award. As chairman and \nranking member of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee, \nSenator Johnston oversaw the enactment of two decades' worth of \nlegislation involving our Nation's national parks. It is most \nappropriate that my former colleague is being honored with this award, \nand I congratulate him on receiving it.\n  The Centennial Leadership Award is an appreciation of Senator \nJohnston's leadership in advancing the National Parks Second Century \nCommission. In 2008, the National Parks and Conservation Association \nestablished an independent commission to develop a 21st century vision \nfor the National Park Service. This Commission was comprised of over 30 \nnational leaders and experts with substantial knowledge of the Nation's \nNational Park System. This Commission met several times, held public \nmeetings, and produced a report recommending expansion of the National \nPark idea through educational opportunities, community conservation, \nand local partnerships to preserve our national heritage.\n  In 2016, this country will celebrate the centennial of the National \nPark Service. As we get ready to celebrate these breathtaking \nlandscapes and historic treasures, I am especially grateful to Senator \nJohnston for his leadership over the years in preserving these areas. \nSenator Johnston's leadership created the Jean Lafitte National \nHistorical Park, the Cane River Creole National Historical Park and \nNational Heritage Area, and the New Orleans Jazz National Historical \nPark. In addition, he also championed passage of the National Historic \nPreservation Act Amendments of 1990, the California Desert Protection \nAct, and has always been a staunch advocate of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. Without his forethought and perseverance, Americans \nmight not have many of these magnificent parks to visit and recreate \nwith their families each year.\n  Again, I congratulate the former Senator from Louisiana on receiving \nthis award. I think Senator Johnston said it best: ``The national parks \ntruly are America's best idea.'' I couldn't agree more.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/26/senate-section/article/S2160-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2160]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN'S MEN'S GLEE CLUB\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I would like to call attention to \nthe 150th anniversary of the Men's Glee Club at the University of \nMichigan, the second oldest collegiate chorus in the Nation. Long \nrecognized as one of the world's best male choruses, the Men's Glee \nClub is a talented and highly entertaining group. This impressive \nmilestone will be marked by a series of events in early April. Alumni \nfrom across the Nation will gather in Ann Arbor to commemorate this \noccasion, celebrating 150 years of outstanding musical achievement.\n  The Men's Glee Club, which currently numbers more than 100 and is led \nby director Paul Rardin, was started by a handful of students in 1859. \nThis chorus has evolved from its early years when it was divided into \ngroups by academic year and some of those groups were accompanied by \ninstruments. Ultimately, these groups would unite, and ever since, the \nchorus has enjoyed steady and growing success.\n  In the 1920s, the Glee Club began to venture beyond Michigan's border \nto tour the Nation, often by train. After World War II, the Glee Club \nsought to widen its audience through the use of radio, television and \nrecordings. In 1955, the Glee Club decided to venture internationally, \ntouring Western Europe. In 1959, the chorus won its first international \ncompetition, the International Musical Eisteddfod in Llangollen, Wales. \nThis accomplishment was especially gratifying because the Glee Club was \nthe first American group to do so. Since then, the Men's Glee Club has \nwon this prestigious competition on three more occasions.\n  In the ensuing years, the U-M Men's Glee Club has continued to travel \ninternationally, cementing an international reputation for excellence. \nIn 1967, the Glee Club embarked on an 8-week, around the world tour to \nmark the University of Michigan's 150th anniversary of its founding. In \nthe 1980s, the Glee Club performed at Avery Fisher Hall in New York and \nat Tiger Stadium in Detroit prior to a World Series game.\n  Among the group's notable alumni are individuals such as former New \nYork governor Thomas Dewey, Metropolitan Opera star Russell \nChristopher, CNN medical reporter Sanjay Gupta, and Bob McGrath, a \ntenor who sang on the Mitch Miller Show before becoming a star on \nSesame Street.\n  The University of Michigan is renowned for excellence across many \ndisciplines, so it is no surprise the Men's Glee Club has had such a \nrich history. I know my colleagues join me in paying tribute to the \nUniversity of Michigan Men's Glee Club on their 150th anniversary. I \nlook forward to another 150 years of harmony and outreach.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/26/senate-section/article/S2160-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2160-S2161]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:38 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1612.

A bill to reaffirm that the Small Business Reauthorization \nAct of 1997 does not limit a contracting officer's discretion regarding \nwhether to make a contract available for award pursuant to any of the \nrestricted competition programs authorized by the Small Business Act; \nto the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Small \nBusiness Parity Programs Act of 2010. As the Chair of the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship, I have held a number of hearings \nand roundtables on the issues affecting small businesses that contract \nwith the Federal Government. The legislation I am introducing today \nrepresents the second of several steps the Committee is taking to \naddress some of the disparities and inequalities that prevent our small \nbusinesses from receiving their fair share of government contracts.\n  As the largest purchaser in the world, the Federal Government is \nuniquely positioned to offer new and reliable business opportunities \nfor our Main Street businesses. Government contracts are perhaps one of \nthe easiest and most inexpensive ways the government can help \nimmediately increase sales for America's entrepreneurs, giving them the \ntools they need to keep our economy strong and create jobs. When large \nbusinesses get government contracts, they can potentially absorb that \nnew work into their workforce. When small businesses get government \nwork they must ``staff up'' to meet the increased demand. By increasing \ncontracts to small businesses by just 1 percent, we can create more \nthan 100,000 new jobs--and today, we need those jobs more than ever.\n  But small businesses face significant challenges in competing for \nthese contracts, including a maze of complicated regulations, contract \nbundling, size standards with loopholes for big businesses and a lack \nof protections for sub-contractors. Despite the fact that federal \nagencies have a statutory goal to spend 23 percent of their contract \ndollars on contracts to small firms, and to ensure fair participation \nby women-owned firms, small disadvantaged firms, service-disabled \nveteran firms, and HUBZone businesses, the agencies often fall short of \nthese goals.\n  The Small Business Parity Programs Act of 2010 is just the second of \nseveral steps that I am undertaking to ensure that all small businesses \nhave fair access to government contracting opportunities. This \nparticular legislation will reaffirm Congress's intent that government \ncontracting officers have the discretion to choose among any of the \nsmall business development and contracting programs when deciding to \nmake a contract award. This legislation makes clear that small \nbusinesses that participate in the 8(a), service-disabled veterans, \nwomen, and HUBZone programs all have a fair opportunity to win these \ncontracts.\n  Two recent decisions by the Government Accountability Office \nmisinterpreted Congress's long-standing intent with regard to the \noperation of the current laws governing these programs. The decisions \nstated that the HUBZone program had preference over all other small \nbusiness contracting programs. The decisions were also relied upon in a \nrecent opinion issued by a judge of the Court of Federal Claims, in a \ncase called Mission Critical Solutions v. United States.\n  I was disappointed by these decisions because they misinterpret the \nintent of Congress in passing the Small Business Reauthorization Act of \n1997. For this reason, along with the Small Business Committee's \nRanking Member, Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine, I filed an amendment \ncontaining the provisions included in this bill to S. 1390, the \nDepartment of Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2010. The \namendment was accepted and passed the full Senate on July 24, 2009 with \noverwhelming and bipartisan support. To my disappointment, it did not \nmake it through conference Committee with the House and was left out of \nthe final bill. The Conference Report accompanying that bill did \ninclude, however, explicit language reaffirming Congress' intent that \n``contracting officers of the Department of Defense and other federal \nagencies have the discretion whether or not to award contracts pursuant \nto the HUBZone program'' or any of the other small business procurement \nprograms.\n  As Chair of the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship, I \nhave focused a considerable amount of energy on promoting the interests \nof small businesses in the federal contracting arena. The legislation I \nam introducing will, quite simply, make clear that it has always been \nCongress' intent to allow contracting officers to accord parity to each \nrestricted competition program authorized by the Small Business Act.\n  This legislation will have an immediate, positive impact for small \nbusinesses seeking fair access to federal contracts. It will reaffirm \ncontracting officers' flexibility to award contracts to HUBZone \nbusinesses, which provide important benefits for hard-hit communities. \nAt the same time, it also will reaffirm Congress's intent to ensure \nrobust implementation of the 8(a), SDVO and Women-Owned small business \ndevelopment and procurement programs. Among other things, programs such \nas these are crucial to enable the government to address the \nsignificant discriminatory barriers that evidence submitted to us shows \nstill limit the opportunities available for minority-owned businesses, \nwomen-owned businesses, and SDVO businesses to participate in the \nmarketplace.\n  The language of our bill is intended to make clear that no single \nrestricted competition program has priority over any other, contrary to \nthe misinterpretation of Congress' intent by the GAO and one decision \nof the Court of Federal Claims. However, nothing in the bill is \nintended to change the current requirement that, where a contracting \nofficer chooses to make an award pursuant to the HUBZone program, that \naward must be made on the basis of restricted competition if the \ncontracting officer has a reasonable expectation that at least two \nqualified HUBZone small business concerns will submit offers and that \nthe award can be made at a fair market price.\n  It is well past time to provide greater opportunities for the \nthousands of small business owners who wish to do business with the \nFederal Government. I believe that this legislation is a good step \ntoward opening those doors.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this simple yet \ncommonsense bill and I look forward to working with them as we move \nthis legislation forward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3190\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 471\n\n       Whereas classes began at The University of Southern \n     Mississippi (referred to in this preamble as ``the \n     University''), originally named Mississippi Normal College, \n     on March 30, 1910;\n       Whereas throughout a century of growth, expansion, and \n     changes of name, first to State Teachers College, in 1924, \n     then Mississippi Southern College, in 1940, and ultimately \n     The University of Southern Mississippi, in 1962, the \n     institution has been dedicated to engaging and empowering the \n     citizens of Mississippi to transform lives and communities;\n       Whereas the University is the only dual-campus university \n     in Mississippi, and the innovative faculty of the University \n     continues to cultivate intellectual development and \n     creativity through the generation, dissemination, \n     application, and preservation of knowledge by annually \n     educating more than 16,000 students from over 100 countries;\n       Whereas the University is the home of numerous innovative \n     and internationally recognized programs that contribute to \n     the successful research enterprise of the University,\n\n[[Page S2164]]\n\n     which generates more than $90,000,000 annually;\n       Whereas the University has more than 125,000 graduates, \n     whose talents and skills have reflected favorably on the \n     State of Mississippi and who have served as trailblazers in \n     the areas of politics, entertainment, law, business, \n     professional athletics, and volunteerism, improving the lives \n     of all they have touched;\n       Whereas the University is looking ahead as it enters its \n     second century as a premier research university of the Gulf \n     South, with programs in academics, athletics, community \n     service, and the arts that are competitive in the State and \n     region, and throughout the Nation and around the world; and\n       Whereas the significance of this centennial in the \n     development of the University, and the State of Mississippi, \n     cannot be overemphasized: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes The University of Southern Mississippi for \n     100 years of service and excellence in higher education; and\n       (2) proudly shares this commemorative occasion with the \n     administration, faculty, students, and alumni of The \n     University of Southern Mississippi.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/26/senate-section/article/S2164-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 472--IN RECOGNITION AND SUPPORT OF NATIONAL SAFE \n                             DIGGING MONTH\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Thune, and Mr. Rockefeller) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Res. 474\n\n       Whereas Parkinson's disease is the second most common \n     neurodegenerative disease in the United States, second only \n     to Alzheimer's disease;\n       Whereas even though there is inadequate comprehensive data \n     on the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease, as of \n     2010, it is estimated that the disease affects over 1,000,000 \n     people in the United States;\n       Whereas although research suggests the cause of Parkinson's \n     disease is a combination of genetic and environmental \n     factors, the exact cause and progression of the disease is \n     still unknown;\n       Whereas there is no objective test for Parkinson's disease \n     and the rate of misdiagnosis can be high;\n       Whereas symptoms of Parkinson's disease vary from person to \n     person and include tremor, slowness, difficulty with balance, \n     swallowing, chewing, and speaking, rigidity, cognitive \n     problems, dementia, mood disorders, such as depression and \n     anxiety, constipation, skin problems, and sleep disruptions;\n       Whereas medications mask some symptoms of Parkinson's \n     disease for a limited amount of time each day, often with \n     dose-limiting side-effects;\n       Whereas ultimately the medications and treatments lose \n     their effectiveness, generally after 4 to 8 years, leaving \n     the person unable to move, speak, or swallow;\n       Whereas there is no cure, therapy, or drug to slow or halt \n     the progression of Parkinson's disease;\n       Whereas increased education and research are needed to help \n     find more effective treatments with fewer side effects and, \n     ultimately, an effective treatment or cure for Parkinson's \n     disease;\n       Whereas the Federal Government, through the National \n     Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense Neurotoxin \n     Exposure Treatment Parkinson's Research Program, the Veterans \n     Affairs Parkinson's Disease Research, Education and Clinical \n     Centers, and other agencies, supports vital work to better \n     understand Parkinson's disease and to find new treatments; \n     and\n       Whereas the Parkinson's community will gather in Central \n     Park on April 24, 2010, for the Parkinson's Unity Walk, an \n     annual gathering inspiring people with Parkinson's, their \n     friends, and their families: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of April as Parkinson's \n     Awareness Month;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of Parkinson's Awareness \n     Month;\n       (3) continues to support research to find better \n     treatments, and eventually, a cure for Parkinson's disease;\n       (4) recognizes the people living with Parkinson's who \n     participate in vital clinical trials to advance our knowledge \n     of this disease; and\n       (5) commends the dedication of local and regional \n     organizations, volunteers, and millions of Americans across \n     the country working to improve the quality of life of persons \n     living with Parkinson's disease and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/26/senate-section/article/S2164-4", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2164-S2165]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 475--RECOGNIZING MARCH 2010 AS NATIONAL WOMEN'S \n                             HISTORY MONTH\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Hutchison, Ms. Snowe, \nand Ms. Mikulski) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.J. Res. 80, which was \nreceived from the House and is at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the joint resolution by \ntitle.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A joint resolution (H.J.

Mr. President, today I ask our colleagues to support a \njoint resolution honoring and recognizing the Blinded Veterans \nAssociation for its 65 years of dedication to blinded veterans, and \ntheir families.\n  On March 28, 1945, during the closing stages of World War II, a group \nof nearly 100 blinded veterans were recuperating at the Old Farms Army \nConvalescent Hospital near Avon, Connecticut. These men discussed the \nchallenges they had faced and those they were yet to experience, and \ndecided to form an organization with the express purpose of helping \nother fellow blinded veterans. It was on that day that the Blinded \nVeterans Association was born.\n  The war-blinded population is one with unique needs and as such, \nrequires specialized care and support. BVA has filled an essential \nrole, serving as an ardent advocate and engaging in outreach efforts, \nto ensure these men and women regain independence and confidence, and \nexperience a smooth transition into civilian life.\n  After 65 years of service, BVA continues to actively contribute to \nthe betterment of blinded veterans' lives. BVA conducts two programs \nthat help to reintegrate newly blinded veterans of our current wars \nback into their communities. The Field Service Program strategically \nplaces legally blind veteran representatives in different geographical \nareas, to ensure newly blinded veterans are aware of what health care \nservices they qualify for, and are equipped with the necessary skills \nand tools to deal with life after sight loss. Operation Peer Support \nlinks returning blinded OEF/OIF veterans with blinded veterans of \nprevious wars who faced similar challenges, thereby providing role \nmodels and necessary support. BVA further supports this important \ncommunity by offering academic scholarships each year to a limited \nnumber of blinded veteran dependents.\n  Blinded veterans have sacrificed much for this nation and deserve the \nbest care and support. As their voice, BVA has helped Congress ensure \nwe are doing everything within our reach to assist these brave men and \nwomen as they adapt to a new life after service.\n  Mr. President, I urge passage of this joint resolution honoring BVA \non its 65th anniversary of advocacy on behalf of blinded veterans, on \nMarch 28, 2010.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask unanimous consent the joint resolution be read \nthree times and passed, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (H.J.

Res. 117\n\n       Whereas the Daughters of Penelope is a leading \n     international organization of women of Hellenic descent and \n     Philhellenes, founded November 16, 1929, in San Francisco, \n     California, to improve the status and well-being of women and \n     their families and to provide women the opportunity to make \n     significant contributions to their community and country;\n       Whereas the mission of the Daughters of Penelope is to \n     promote the ideals of ancient Greece, philanthropy, \n     education, civic responsibility, good citizenship, and family \n     and individual excellence, through community service and \n     volunteerism;\n       Whereas the chapters of the Daughters of Penelope sponsor \n     affordable and dignified housing to the Nation's senior \n     citizen population by participating in the Department of \n     Housing and Urban Development's section 202 housing program \n     (12 U.S.C. 1701q);\n       Whereas Penelope House, a domestic violence shelter for \n     women and their children sponsored by the Daughters of \n     Penelope, is the first of its kind in the State of Alabama \n     and is recognized as a model shelter for others to emulate \n     throughout the United States;\n       Whereas the Daughters of Penelope Foundation, Inc. supports \n     the educational objectives of the Daughters of Penelope by \n     providing tens of thousands of dollars annually for \n     scholarships, sponsoring educational seminars, and donating \n     children's books to libraries, schools, shelters, and \n     churches through the ``Open Books'' program;\n       Whereas the Daughters of Penelope is the first ethnic \n     organization to submit oral history tapes to the Library of \n     Congress, providing an oral history of first generation \n     Greek-American women in the United States;\n       Whereas the Daughters of Penelope promotes awareness of \n     cancer research, such as thalassemia (Cooley's anemia), \n     lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), Alzheimer's disease, muscular \n     dystrophy, and others;\n       Whereas the Daughters of Penelope provides financial \n     support for many medical research and charitable \n     organizations such as the University of Miami Sylvester \n     Comprehensive Cancer Center (formerly the Papanicolaou Cancer \n     Center), the Alzheimer's Foundation of America, the American \n     Heart Association, the Special Olympics, the Barbara Bush \n     Foundation for Family Literacy, the Children's Wish \n     Foundation International, the United Nations Children's Fund \n     (UNICEF), Habitat for Humanity, St. Basil Academy, and \n     others; and\n       Whereas the Daughters of Penelope provides support and \n     financial assistance to victims and communities affected by \n     natural disasters such as hurricanes, earthquakes, and forest \n     fires: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the significant contributions of people of \n     Greek ancestry, and of Philhellenes, to the United States; \n     and\n       (2) commemorates the 80th anniversary of the Daughters of \n     Penelope in 2009, applauds its mission, and commends the many \n     charitable contributions of its members to organizations and \n     communities around the world.\n\n                              S.

Res. 472\n\n       Whereas each year the Nation's underground utility \n     infrastructure--including pipelines and electric, gas, \n     telecommunications, water, sewer, and cable television \n     lines--is jeopardized by unintentional damage due to those \n     who fail to have underground lines located prior to digging;\n       Whereas some lines are buried only a few inches \n     underground, making them easy to strike even during shallow \n     digging projects;\n       Whereas such digging often has unintended consequences such \n     as service interruption, environmental damage, personal \n     injury, and even death;\n       Whereas April is the beginning of the peak of excavation \n     projects around the Nation;\n       Whereas in 2002 Congress required the Department of \n     Transportation and the Federal Communications Commission to \n     establish a 3-digit, nationwide toll-free number to be used \n     by State ``One-Call'' systems;\n       Whereas in 2005 the Federal Communications Commission \n     designated ``811'' as the nationwide ``One Call'' number for \n     homeowners and all excavators to call before conducting \n     excavation activities;\n       Whereas the ``One-Call'' system has helped reduce the \n     number of digging damages caused by failure to call before \n     digging from 57 percent in 2004 to 37.5 percent in 2009;\n       Whereas the 1,400 members of the Common Ground Alliance, \n     who are dedicated to ensuring public safety, environmental \n     protection, and the integrity of services, promote the \n     national ``Call Before You Dig'' campaign to increase public \n     awareness about the importance, for homeowners and \n     excavators, of calling 811 to find out the exact location of \n     underground lines;\n       Whereas the Common Ground Alliance has designated April as \n     National Safe Digging Month in order to increase awareness of \n     safe digging practices across the country and to celebrate \n     the anniversary of 811, the national ``Call Before You Dig'' \n     number: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals of National \n     Safe Digging Month and encourages homeowners and all \n     excavators throughout the country to call 811 before digging.\n\n                              S. Res. 473\n\n       Whereas the National Association of Junior Auxiliaries and \n     the members of the National Association of Junior Auxiliaries \n     provide valuable service and leadership opportunities for \n     women who wish to take an active role in their communities;\n       Whereas the mission of the National Association of Junior \n     Auxiliaries is to encourage member chapters to render \n     charitable services that--\n       (1) are beneficial to the general public; and\n       (2) place a particular emphasis on providing for the needs \n     of children; and\n\n       Whereas, since the founding of the National Association of \n     Junior Auxiliaries in 1941, the organization has provided \n     strength and inspiration to women who want to effect positive \n     change in their communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates April 4, 2010, as ``National Association of \n     Junior Auxiliaries Day'';\n       (2) recognizes the great contributions made by members of \n     the National Association of Junior Auxiliaries to their \n     communities and to the people of the United States; and\n       (3) especially commends the work of the members of the \n     National Association of Junior Auxiliaries to better the \n     lives of children in the United States.\n\n                              S. Res. 474\n\n       Whereas Parkinson's disease is the second most common \n     neurodegenerative disease in the United States, second only \n     to Alzheimer's disease;\n       Whereas even though there is inadequate comprehensive data \n     on the incidence and prevalence of Parkinson's disease, as of \n     2010, it is estimated that the disease affects over 1,000,000 \n     people in the United States;\n       Whereas although research suggests the cause of Parkinson's \n     disease is a combination of genetic and environmental \n     factors, the exact cause and progression of the disease is \n     still unknown;\n       Whereas there is no objective test for Parkinson's disease \n     and the rate of misdiagnosis can be high;\n       Whereas symptoms of Parkinson's disease vary from person to \n     person and include tremor, slowness, difficulty with balance, \n     swallowing, chewing, and speaking, rigidity, cognitive \n     problems, dementia, mood disorders, such as depression and \n     anxiety, constipation, skin problems, and sleep disruptions;\n       Whereas medications mask some symptoms of Parkinson's \n     disease for a limited amount of time each day, often with \n     dose-limiting side-effects;\n       Whereas ultimately the medications and treatments lose \n     their effectiveness, generally after 4 to 8 years, leaving \n     the person unable to move, speak, or swallow;\n       Whereas there is no cure, therapy, or drug to slow or halt \n     the progression of Parkinson's disease;\n       Whereas increased education and research are needed to help \n     find more effective treatments with fewer side effects and, \n     ultimately, an effective treatment or cure for Parkinson's \n     disease;\n       Whereas the Federal Government, through the National \n     Institutes of Health, the Department of Defense Neurotoxin \n     Exposure Treatment Parkinson's Research Program, the Veterans \n     Affairs Parkinson's Disease Research, Education and Clinical \n     Centers, and other agencies, supports vital work to better \n     understand Parkinson's disease and to find new treatments; \n     and\n       Whereas the Parkinson's community will gather in Central \n     Park on April 24, 2010, for the Parkinson's Unity Walk, an \n     annual gathering inspiring people with Parkinson's, their \n     friends, and their families: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the designation of April as Parkinson's \n     Awareness Month;\n       (2) supports the goals and ideals of Parkinson's Awareness \n     Month;\n       (3) continues to support research to find better \n     treatments, and eventually, a cure for Parkinson's disease;\n       (4) recognizes the people living with Parkinson's who \n     participate in vital clinical trials to advance our knowledge \n     of this disease; and\n       (5) commends the dedication of local and regional \n     organizations, volunteers, and millions of Americans across \n     the country working to improve the quality of life of persons \n     living with Parkinson's disease and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/26/senate-section/article/S2168-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         APPOINTMENT AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. 3191, introduced earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n\n[[Page S2169]]\n\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 3191) to reauthorize the Satellite Home Viewer \n     Extension and Reauthorization Act of 2004, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, as the Senate prepares to break for Easter \nrecess, I am pleased that it has acted to pass two pieces of \nlegislation that will allow for the extension and reauthorization of \nthe Satellite Home Viewer Act. Yesterday, the Senate passed a bill that \nwill extend key provisions of the Act through the end of April. Passing \nthis short-term extension is necessary to ensure that consumers across \nthe country retain access to network television content. Without it, \nthese consumers would have no way to receive these signals. I \nunderstand that the House of Representatives also acted on this short-\nterm extension last night.\n  Today, the Senate passed the Satellite Television Extension and \nLocalism Act of 2010--STELA--which is a full, 10-year reauthorization. \nSince the inception of the distant signal license, the license has been \nreauthorized for 5-year periods, giving all stakeholders an opportunity \nto revisit it and Congress the opportunity to improve it. Reauthorizing \nthe,law for 10 years is not my preferred course of action. In fact, the \nSenate previously passed a 5-year version of STELA that makes \nsignificant improvements to current law, as part of H.R. 4213, which is \ncurrently pending in the House of Representatives.\n  The version of STELA passed by unanimous consent in the Senate today \ncontains all of the improvements from the 5-year version. Nonetheless, \nit is my view that enacting a 5-year extension is preferable, given the \nrate at which technology is altering the marketplace. I urge the House \nof Representatives to enact STELA as swiftly as possible once Congress \nreturns from Easter recess, and I look forward to working with them to \naccomplish that goal.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I ask unanimous consent that the bill be read for a \nthird time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nquestion is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I understand there is a statement regarding the pay-go \neffects of the legislation, which I ask unanimous consent to have \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           Budgetary Effects of PAYGO Legislation for S. 3191\n\n       Mr. Conrad: This is the Statement of Budgetary Effects of \n     PAYGO Legislation for S. 3191.
