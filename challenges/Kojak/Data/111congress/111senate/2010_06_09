Mr. President, following any leader remarks, the Senate \nwill resume consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. 4213, \nwhich is a bill to extend a number of expiring provisions, some of the \ntax issues we have to deal with every year, and some other good things \nto create jobs. There are going to be rollcall votes throughout the \nday.\n  We have four amendments that are pending. The chairman and I spoke \nlast night. We believe we need to clear some of these amendments out of \nthe way before we start piling on more amendments. We really need \nMembers to come forward. If they have amendments, talk with the \nmanagers of the bill. We need to move forward on this legislation. We \ncannot sit here, as we did yesterday, and not do a lot.\n  Tomorrow, as everyone knows, we are going to spend a lot of time on \nthe Murkowski resolution. That could take as many as 7 hours of floor \ntime.\n  We need to move forward. We are out of session on Friday and Monday, \nreally the only two nonvote days we have this entire work period.\n\n\n                             Primary Night\n\n  Mr. President, it was primary night last night. I expressed in many \ndifferent ways--I was up early this morning with my supporters in \nNevada, telling them I appreciate their help.\n  I congratulated my Republican opponent in the general election, \nSharron Angle, on the campaign she ran. She actually came from nowhere \nin a 13-person field in the Republican primary to win this election. I \nextended my appreciation to her in that regard.\n\n\n                                Baseball\n\n  Mr. President, as a little sidenote, because we have 5 months to \ncampaign all over the country, including Nevada, I want to take a pause \nand think about some of the things going on in the country.\n  One of the things going on in the Nation's Capital is tremendously \ninteresting to me, and that is baseball. I watched on television last \nnight much of the performance of this 21-year-old phenom, Stephen \nStrasburg. I watched not only him pitch but the interview after the \ngame. He is 21 years old. He carried himself so well. In 7 innings, he \nstruck out 14 Major League Baseball players. He did it very well. He is \nright-handed, but he reminded me so much of Sandy Koufax because he \nthrows more than 100 miles an hour. He throws a curveball about 85 \nmiles an hour. People who follow baseball know that is remarkable. That \nis great control. The reason I mention that is because he was the No. 1 \ndraft choice for the Washington Nationals.\n  The No. 1 draft choice for the Washington Nationals a couple of days \nago was a 17-year-old boy from Las Vegas, NV, named Bryce Harper. When \nBryce Harper was 15 years old, he hit a home run more than 550 feet, \nwhich is a Mickey Mantle-type of home run, which Mickey Mantle did not \ndo often. He took the GED when he finished his sophomore year in high \nschool. He went immediately to junior college and played in the Junior \nCollege World Series this year. He is a wonderful young man. He has a \ngreat family. He is going to be in Washington playing Major League \nBaseball very soon. I think he will probably start playing in the Major \nLeagues at about the same age\n\n[[Page S4710]]\n\nas Al Kaline did, who was a Major League Baseball player. He throws as \nwell as Al Kaline. He hits probably better than Al Kaline did.\n  Washington is fortunate to have these two fine young men. Not only \nare they great baseball players, but from everything we know about the \ntwo young men, they are good role models for young men and women around \nthe country.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, will the majority leader yield before \nchanging the subject?\n  Mr. REID. Yes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I say to my friend from Nevada, I was \nthere. I had a chance to see Strasburg. As remarkable as the 14 \nstrikeouts my friend referred to is the fact he did not walk anybody. \nWhat a remarkable athlete. We can only hope and pray that his arm holds \nup and that he has the kind of career everyone is anticipating. There \nwas literally electricity in the air. It was an exciting event. It was \ngreat to be there.\n  Mr. REID. I so appreciate my counterpart talking about that. I wish I \ncould have been there. But it was, even watching it on TV--gee whiz, \nthere are those of us who love sports, and I know my friend loves \nbasketball, especially that which takes place in Kentucky and the \nothers, of course, in Kentucky. But this was really a remarkable \nperformance. For Washington, which has been so starved for a good \nathletic team of some kind, it was nice.\n  I say to my friend through the Chair, when I was going to law school \nhere, I watched two Major League Baseball games in the old Griffith \nStadium. Oh, they were so much fun. I don't know who won. I am sure the \nWashington team lost. I know the two teams they played both times were \nthe Yankees, where I watched Roger Maris, Mickey Mantle, Yogi Berra, \nand all those great players.\n  From this work in which we are engaged, which is always so serious, \nit is nice once in a while to divert our attention to something that is \na little more relaxing. That baseball game last night was not relaxing, \nbut it sure was a lot of fun.\n  Mr. President, my staff just indicated that I said we would not be in \non Friday and Monday. We probably will be in; there will just be no \nvotes.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if I may add one point, the majority \nleader mentioned that Bryce Harper was drafted by the Nationals on \nMonday. I look forward to him being the next Nevada contribution to the \nWashington area, right after my friend the majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to my friend, it is a wonderful story. \nHis brother, who was a great pitcher at California State Fullerton--\nwhich won the NCAA National Baseball Championship--his brother thought \nso much of his little brother, who is 4 years younger than he is, that \nhe transferred from California State Fullerton to a junior college so \nhe could play with his brother. The elder Harper is a pitcher, and the \ncatcher is his little brother. The senior member of the brotherhood of \nHarper ball players, his record was 12 and 1 this year.\n  Another word about Bryce Harper. Community college baseball is very \ncompetitive. The record for the most home runs for any player in junior \ncollege baseball was 12. Bryce Harper hit 30. His batting average as a \n17-year-old boy playing with men was .450. In one game, he was six for \nsix. I think he had three or four home runs. It is an interesting \nstory.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I will say that what one can conclude \nfrom this is that next year, when the Senate is not in session in the \nevening, both the Democratic and Republican leaders will be at the Nats \ngames.\n  Mr. REID. I think that is pretty clear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/09/senate-section/article/S4710-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4710]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, our Nation faces many urgent crises at \nthe moment. Americans are looking for solutions. They are not getting \nany from Washington. Whether it is the housing crisis or the financial \ncrisis, the debt crisis or the crisis in the gulf, what they are \ngetting is a White House and a Democratic majority in Congress that \nseems more intent on pursuing a government-driven political agenda than \nfinding commonsense solutions to the problems about which all of us are \nconcerned.\n  Americans are exasperated by all this, but they should not be \nsurprised because if there is one motto that defines this \nadministration, it is the one delivered by the White House Chief of \nStaff in a revealing moment just after the President's election. I am \nreferring, of course, to what Rahm Emanuel famously referred to as \n``Rule 1: Never allow a crisis to go to waste.'' It is a fitting slogan \nfor an administration which saw a crisis at some of America's great \nautomaking firms as an opportunity for the government to extend its \nreach into industrial policy, which saw the panic on Wall Street as an \nopportunity for government to extend its reach further into Main \nStreet, which saw out-of-control costs in health care as an opportunity \nto extend government's reach further into health care decisions of \nevery American, and which is now talking about using a nightmarish \nenvironmental calamity in the gulf as a prime opportunity to extend \ngovernment's reach even further into Americans' lives through a new, \njob-killing national energy tax that would hit every single household \nand business, small or large, in our country.\n  Think about it. For more than 50 straight days, an underwater geyser \nof oil, now roughly the size of Vermont, has been polluting the gulf. \nThis is the kind of crisis that in the past would have united the \nNation in a focused effort to solve the problem. Yet day after day, as \nthis toxic oil continues to flow, what we get from the administration \nis some new twist on the blame game or some ham-handed effort to appear \nin control of the situation.\n  Meanwhile, in Congress, we are getting much the same thing. The \ndeficit extenders bill that is now on the floor was supposed to be \nabout giving job creators some assurance that the tax benefits they \ncurrently are receiving and on which they depend to retain workers will \nbe there the next time they have to make a major business-related \ndecision. Yet Democrats are using this bill as another opportunity to \nextend government's reach. Desperate for funds to bail out programs, \nthey are raiding a trust fund--get this--created to pay for just the \nkind of cleanup we now need in the gulf. They are quintupling the tax \nthat oil companies pay into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund that was \ncreated in the wake of the Exxon Valdez fix, and instead of using this \nmoney to clean up the oil that is spewing in the gulf, they are raiding \nthe trust fund to pay for new unrelated spending.\n  Dipping into the oilspill trust fund in order to pay for something \nelse--in other words, they are using the crisis in the gulf not only as \na cover for even more government spending but as a major source of \nfunding for it. This is really an outrage, and it should give every \nAmerican a window into the Democratic approach to spending, as well as \nthe lack of seriousness about the debt. Frankly, they just cannot \nrestrain themselves. That is the only possible excuse for raiding this \ntrust fund for unrelated government spending.\n  At the same time, as Americans wonder when this gusher will ever be \nplugged, we hear word that the administration and my good friend, the \nmajority leader, want to piggyback their controversial new national \nenergy tax--also known as cap and trade--to an oilspill response bill \nthat could and should be an opportunity for true bipartisan \ncooperation. So again we see the administration using a crisis--in this \ncase the disaster in the gulf--as an opportunity to muscle through \nCongress another deeply unpopular bill that has profound implications \nfor small businesses and struggling households.\n\n  Look, if the health care debate taught us anything--anything at all--\nit is that Americans want these kinds of massive bills to be debated \nout in the open, not rushed past them on a holiday or tucked into a \nmust-pass bill aimed at alleviating the kind of suffering we are seeing \nin the gulf. The problem for Democrats is that debating the Democratic \ncap-and-trade bill\n\n[[Page S4711]]\n\nmight not fit neatly into the White House messaging plan since it has \nbeen widely reported that a major part--a major part--of the Kerry-\nLieberman bill was essentially written by BP.\n  Let me say that again: A major part of the Kerry-Lieberman bill was \nwritten by BP. This is clearly an inconvenient fact. An administration \nthat seems to spend most of its time coming up with ways to show how \nangry it is with BP is pushing a proposal that BP actually helped to \nwrite. I can't understand, and I don't think the American people will \nunderstand, why the majority believes it makes sense to respond to the \nBP oilspill by imposing a gas tax increase on the American people that \nwas advocated by BP.\n  I think the American people want us to work together to address the \ndisaster in the gulf, not exploit it--not exploit it--for partisan \npolitical purposes. The oilspill trust fund ought to be used to clean \nup oilspills. The oilspill trust fund ought to be used to clean up \noilspills. This is one crisis Americans will not let Democrats exploit \nfor their policy purposes.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/09/senate-section/article/S4711-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4711]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in a few moments I will speak on the \npending business before the Senate--the American Jobs and Closing Tax \nLoopholes Act--but before I do, I would like to refer to the comments \nof the Republican leader, as well as the statement of the Senator from \nLouisiana that he gave yesterday.\n  For several months now, Americans have witnessed a massive oilspill \nin the Gulf of Mexico, Americans have seen the sweeping environmental \ndamage, and Americans have seen the dramatic economic effects. It is \nsomething that is overwhelming, it is appalling, and it is incredible \nhow much damage is being created by the BP gulf oilspill. I am sure to \nthe average observer there might seem no better time than now to ask \noil companies to contribute more to shoulder the burden of the \noilspill. Actually, they have caused the spill--at least one company \nhas--and they should bear the burden.\n  This, then, would seem to be an appropriate time to raise the \noilspill liability tax. The oilspill liability tax is pretty small. It \nis 8 cents a barrel. That is all it is currently. One would have to \ncome up with a pretty creative argument if one wanted to protect big \noil companies from this fee.\n  Well, the Senator from Louisiana, and just now the Republican leader, \nhave done that. They have come up with a pretty creative argument to \nprotect the oil companies. The Senator from Louisiana, for example, has \nreturned to the last refuge of bean counters, and he has cried double \ncounting. The double counting argument seems to be a favorite among \nbean counters, Mr. President. It seems to be the argument one falls \nback on when one cannot argue the substance and one just wants to muddy \nthe waters. In reality, the funds collected by raising the oilspill \nliability tax will strengthen the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. That \nis simple arithmetic. But opponents of raising the tax on big oil \ncompanies want to make it less attractive for doing so. They want to \nmake it so that the funds collected by raising taxes on big oil do not \ncount in the Federal budget. That way it will be less effective and \nless attractive to raise taxes on big oil.\n  So don't be misled by the green eyeshades talk. Don't be misled by \nthe bogus charges of double counting. Don't buy into the arguments of \nthose who want to protect big oil. I urge my colleagues that when we \nget to it later today to vote against the Vitter amendment and to \nreject the arguments we have been hearing today that raising the per-\nbarrel tax for funds which go into the oilspill liability fund is \nsomehow double counting because, clearly, that money goes into the \ntrust fund, and funds from that trust fund are then used to pay for the \ncleanup and some damage that has occurred and also counts toward \nreducing the Federal deficit because it is extra money that goes to \ngovernment debt and, therefore, is money which is not doubled counted.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject those arguments.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator from Montana yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I will yield to the Senator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I listened to the statements made today by the Republican \nleader about the increase in this fee that is to be paid into the Oil \nSpill Liability Trust Fund. I would like to ask the chairman of the \nFinance Committee, currently, the fee is 8 cents a barrel?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And the price of a barrel of oil, as of this morning's \nWall Street Journal, is $71.99 a barrel?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So this is a small, tiny fraction--one-tenth----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Of the current fee.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Of the current fee. One-tenth of 1 percent as best I can \ncalculate it.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is true.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is being paid by oil companies into a fund so that \nif there would be a spill and the oil company responsible couldn't pay \nfor it, they would have at least accumulated enough money to protect \nthe taxpayers----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. From this liability.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. I might also say this fund was created \nin the wake of the Exxon Valdez spill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Twenty-one years ago. I might also ask the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, it is my understanding that the total value of \nthe current Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is somewhere in the range of \n$1.5 billion?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think that is the amount. I am not certain, but it is \nabout that.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So the effort in this bill is to increase that per-barrel \ntax paid by oil companies for this oilspill liability fund to----\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Forty-one cents.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Forty-one cents. So 41 cents would represent, as I \ncalculate it, one-half of 1 percent of the current cost of a barrel of \noil.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The current oil priced at $71 a barrel.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Right. So the argument from the other side is that even \nif we accumulated this money and put it into this fund for cleaning up \nspills, we shouldn't count it as additional money being held by the \nFederal Government at the same time; is that correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And if we fail to count it as an additional source of \nrevenue being held by the Federal Government, is it not true that it \nwould be subject to a budget point of order, which would then require \n60 votes, and that would allow the oil companies to find 41 friends on \nthe Senate floor--and I think I know where they will start looking--to \ndefeat this effort to create this tax?\n\n[[Page S4712]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I might say that is my reading of the Budget Act; that is \ncorrect.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Could I also ask the chairman of the Finance Committee, \nin this situation--where BP is clearly responsible for the mess in the \nGulf of Mexico and has at least stated its responsibility; where we \nhave a deep-pocket defendant that declared $5.6 billion in profits the \nfirst quarter of this year--if the next spill or the next accident \nresulting in multibillion-dollar damage to the Gulf of Mexico, or \nwherever, is caused by a company without deep pockets, is this fund the \nonly place to turn to protect taxpayers?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is exactly correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. And if we fail to increase this tax and increase the size \nof this fund, it means the taxpayers would be called on to bail out \nother oil companies that may be responsible for similar damage in the \nfuture?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is the precise theory of all trust funds in the \nfirst place, but now the cap needs to be raised.\n  Mr. DURBIN. So all the protests from the other side of the aisle \nabout this 40-cent tax on big oil companies is basically not only to \nprotect the big oil companies but to put the taxpayers on the hook for \nanother bailout----\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If we run into another oilspill?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. If the fund is not large enough, that is exactly correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I know my friend wants to speak, but let \nme just set the lay of the land so my friend from Vermont can speak.\n  The Senate has returned to the American Jobs and Closing Tax \nLoopholes Act. I want to remind my colleagues this bill is about jobs. \nIt is about helping 15 million Americans who have lost their jobs as \nwell. We are talking about people who have worked, who want to work, \nand who will work again. These are our neighbors, and they need our \nhelp.\n  The Labor Department just reported that although things are getting \nbetter, there are still five unemployed Americans for every job opening \navailable--five. For comparison, throughout 2007 there were fewer than \ntwo unemployed workers for every job opening. Again, today there are \nfive. We need to do more to help create jobs. We need to continue to \nhelp those who do not have jobs to get by.\n  Let me also remind my colleagues that hundreds of thousands of \nunemployed Americans need the assistance in this bill just to get by. \nThe Senate needs to pass this bill, and we need to do it soon. As I \nhave noted, this bill is about jobs. This bill is about helping the 15 \nmillion Americans who have lost their jobs. I remind my colleagues \nabout that because, so far, aside from the substitute, none of the \namendments offered is about jobs or about helping the 15 million \nAmericans who have lost their jobs.\n  Many of the pending amendments are worthy efforts, but I encourage my \ncolleagues to stick to the task, to address the subject at hand, and to \npass this bill. People need help.\n  Right now, we have five amendments pending: this Senator's amendment \nin the nature of a substitute, the Sessions amendment to cap \nappropriations, the Cardin amendment to provide for dependent coverage \nunder the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan, the Franken amendment \nto create the homeowner advocate in the Home Affordable Modification \nProgram, and the Cornyn amendment for more reports on government debt.\n  The majority leader has requested that the Senate address the backlog \nof pending amendments before we allow more amendments to become \npending. That is why I am serving notice that until we have voted on \nsome of the pending amendments, I will be obliged to object to setting \naside any of the pending amendments in order to allow further \namendments to become pending. Thus, we would like to line up some of \nthe votes, Mr. President.\n  If possible, we would like to have votes at least by noon or, at the \nvery latest, 2 p.m. We very much hope we can make some progress today--\nnot just hopefully but make progress. It is our obligation to make \nprogress. That is our job. People elected us to do what is right for \nAmerica. It is right to help extend these so-called tax extenders, the \nR tax credit, and so on and so forth, but it is also right to make \nsure unemployment benefits are available for those who are out of work.\n  I urge us to come together and do our work in these next couple of \ndays. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nVermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly about an \namendment I have filed and look forward to getting pending in a short \nwhile. This is an amendment which addresses many of the issues we have \nbeen hearing about this morning about which the American people are \nconcerned.\n  This amendment helps us lower the record-breaking deficit this \ncountry is facing, and this amendment will help us transform our energy \nsystem away from fossil fuel--away from the oil disaster that we are \nseeing in the gulf right now--to energy efficiency and sustainable \nenergy. So for all my colleagues who are concerned about record-\nbreaking deficits, I hope they will support this amendment which I will \nexplain in a moment. And for all of my colleagues who understand that \nthe future of this country is not offshore drilling, I hope they will \nsupport this amendment.\n  Let me explain briefly what this amendment does. At a time when the \nprofits of big oil companies are soaring, at a time when we are in the \nmidst of the largest oilspill in our Nation's history--one of the \ngreatest ecological disasters this country has ever experienced--at a \ntime when we desperately need to end our dependence on oil and gas and \nseriously transform our energy system by investing in energy \nefficiency, conservation, and renewable energy, this amendment is \nsimple and it is straightforward and I think it addresses all of those \nconcerns.\n  This amendment simply repeals over $35 billion in tax breaks to the \noil and gas industry. Let me repeat that. This amendment simply repeals \nover $35 billion in tax breaks to the oil and gas industry, all of \nwhich were recommended for elimination in President Obama's fiscal year \n2011 budget. What this amendment is doing is simply bringing to the \nfloor of the Senate the recommendations that were in President Obama's \nbudget.\n  According to OMB, the repeal of these tax breaks would be equivalent \nto about 1 percent of domestic oil and gas industry revenues over the \nnext decade. This is not an onerous attack on the oil industry. In \nother words, the cost to the oil and gas industry of repealing these \ntax breaks is negligible. And $25 billion of the money saved under this \namendment would be used to reduce the deficit and $10 billion would be \nused to invest in the highly successful Energy Efficiency and \nConservation Block Grant Program over a 5-year period.\n  This amendment does two things. For all of my friends, and every \nAmerican who is concerned about a $13 trillion national debt and \nrecord-breaking deficits, this amendment says let us put $25 billion \ninto deficit reduction. For all of us who are concerned about \ntransforming our energy system away from fossil fuel to energy \nefficiency and sustainable energy, this amendment says, over the next 5 \nyears let's put $10 billion into the Energy Efficiency and Conservation \nBlock Grant Program, which provides funding to States, cities, and \ntowns all over America to begin transforming energy in their \ncommunities.\n  This amendment is supported by Physicians for Social Responsibility, \nFriends of the Earth, Public Citizen, moveon.org, Center for Biological \nDiversity, One Sky, Environment America, the Sierra Club, and \nGreenpeace.\n  If there is anything we should be learning from the gulf disaster, \nthe horrendous disaster we are experiencing today on the gulf coast, it \nis that it is time to move aggressively away from polluting and unsafe \nfossil fuels which are getting more and more difficult to produce as we \nmove farther and farther offshore to drill for them. With a $13 \ntrillion national debt, the last thing we need to be doing is giving \nhuge tax breaks to big oil and gas companies that have been making \nrecord-breaking profits year after year.\n  As I indicated before, all of the oil and gas tax breaks that my \namendment seeks to repeal have been targeted for elimination in \nPresident Obama's fiscal year 2011 budget. So\n\n[[Page S4713]]\n\nhere we are. For all of my deficit hawk friends: $25 billion into \ndeficit reduction by asking the oil industry, which has been hugely \nprofitable in recent years, to start paying their fair share of taxes.\n  Let me quote from a speech that President Obama gave on this subject.\n\n       Our continued dependence on fossil fuels will jeopardize \n     our national security. It will smother our planet. And it \n     will continue to put our economy and our environment at risk. \n     . . . If we refuse to take into account the full cost of our \n     fossil fuel addiction--if we don't factor in the \n     environmental costs and national security costs and true \n     economic costs--we will have missed our best chance to seize \n     a clean energy future. . . . The time has come once and for \n     all for this Nation to fully embrace a clean energy future. \n     Now, that means . . . rolling back billions of dollars of tax \n     breaks to oil companies so that we can prioritize investments \n     in clean energy research and development.\n\n  That is the end of the quote from President Barack Obama. Frankly, \nthat is what this amendment is all about.\n  Let me give one interesting example of the absurdity of continuing to \nprovide tax breaks to the oil and gas industry. Last year, ExxonMobil, \nthe most profitable corporation in the history of the world, reported \nto the SEC that not only did it avoid paying any Federal taxes, it \nactually received a $46 million refund from the IRS. How is that, \nfolks? So, for all of the taxpayers in this country, people who are \nmaking $30,000 or $40,000 a year, who are prepared to pay their fair \nshare of taxes, we have a situation where last year ExxonMobil, the \nmost profitable corporation in the history of the world, reported to \nthe SEC that not only did it avoid paying any Federal taxes, it \nactually received a $46 million refund from the IRS.\n  We have a lot of working people in the State of Vermont who make \n$50,000 or $60,000 a year, working 6 or 7 days a week in order to take \ncare of their family. They pay taxes. ExxonMobil, the most profitable \ncorporation in America, gets a refund from the IRS. If anyone thinks \nthat makes sense I would like to hear about it.\n  ExxonMobil is the same huge oil company that had enough money to pay \na $398 million retirement package to its outgoing CEO, Lee Raymond, a \nfew years ago, so it is a real struggling company. They make more \nprofits than any company in the history of the world and paid their \noutgoing CEO $398 million in a retirement package but they cannot \nafford to pay a nickel in taxes. In fact, they get a tax refund. Do you \nthink we need to change that system? I do.\n  ExxonMobil is the same company that is making its profits by gouging \nconsumers at the pump by charging higher and higher prices for gasoline \neven when demand is low and supply is high. In Vermont, gas is now \n$2.85 a gallon. That has to stop.\n  This amendment would begin to make sure that ExxonMobil, BP, and \nother big oil companies pay at least a minimal amount of their record-\nbreaking profits in taxes to the Federal Government so we can begin to \ndeal with our record-breaking deficit; so we can begin the process of \ntransforming our energy system.\n  Let me be clear. As millions of Americans have lost their jobs, their \nhomes, their life savings, and their ability to send their kids to \ncollege because of this horrendous Wall Street recession, we cannot \ncontinue to allow big oil companies to make out like bandits. In the \nfirst quarter--I refer people to this chart--in the first quarter of \n2009, when our gross domestic product shrank by 6.4 percent and overall \ncorporate profits decreased by 5.25 percent--that is what a recession \nis about; profits are down, overall corporate profits--the five largest \noil companies were still able to earn over $13 billion in profits. As \nthis chart shows, during the last 10 years the five largest oil \ncompanies--ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, ChevronTexaco, and ConocoPhillips--\nearned over $750 billion in profits: a 10-year period, $750 billion in \nprofits. That is not chickenfeed.\n  During the first quarter of this year, big oil's profits increased by \n85 percent--not bad, 85 percent. Instead of using these profits to \ninvest in renewable energy and to prevent oilspills, big oil and gas \ncompanies are primarily using this money to buy back their own stock \nand enrich their CEOs. According to the American Petroleum Institute, \nbetween 2000 and 2007 the entire oil and gas industry, of all of their \nprofits--remember, $750 billion of profits over the last 10 years--\ninvested only $1.5 billion in North American ``nonhydrocarbon \ninvestments'' aimed at reducing the Nation's dependence on oil. That is \nless than one-quarter of 1 percent of their profits during this time \nperiod.\n  Meanwhile, the CEOs of big oil companies have received hundreds of \nmillions in retirement packages and total compensation. Over the last 5 \nyears, Ray Irani, the CEO of Occidental Petroleum, received over $725 \nmillion in total compensation; John Hess, the CEO of the Hess Oil \nCompany, has received over $240 million in total compensation; David \nLesar, the CEO of Halliburton, has received over $114 million in total \ncompensation; James Mulva, the CEO of ConocoPhillips, has received over \n$95 million in total compensation; and Rex Tillerson, the CEO of \nExxonMobil, made over $30 million in total compensation over that 5-\nyear period. Further, since 2002, the five largest oil companies have \nrepurchased almost $270 billion of their own stock.\n  It is important for the American people to understand how excessively \nwe are subsidizing fossil fuels and benefiting big oil. It is not only \nthat they are making record-breaking profits; it is not only that they \nare not paying their fair share of taxes; it is not only that they are \nnot investing in renewable energy so we can break our dependency on \nfossil fuel and clean up this planet, but in addition to that, they are \nreceiving huge amounts of taxpayer subsidies. These guys who tell us \nhow terrible the big government is are not hesitant to be running here \nto Capitol Hill to get their fair share of their welfare payments.\n\n  As this chart shows, according to the Environmental Law Institute, \nfrom 2002 to 2008, the U.S. Government provided more than $70 billion \nin fossil fuel subsidies compared to just over $12 billion for wind, \nsolar, geothermal, biomass, and other renewable energies which in fact \nare the future of this country in terms of energy. This set of \npriorities is totally absurd. We have to put an end to the outrageous \ntax breaks and subsidies that have been given to big oil and gas \ncompanies.\n  But that, again, is not all this amendment would do. It is not only \n$25 billion in deficit reductions. This amendment begins to move us \naway from fossil fuel to energy efficiency and renewable energy by \ninvesting $10 billion into the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block \nGrant Program. The stimulus package provided $3.2 billion for this \nhighly successful program, and that money is filtering throughout 50 \nStates in America. Hundreds and hundreds and thousands of communities \nare now making energy efficiency improvements in their townhalls, in \ntheir schools, and they are moving toward sustainable energy as a \nresult of this program. We would put $10 billion more, over a 5-year \nperiod, into a program which finally moves us away from fossil fuel to \nsustainable energy and energy efficiency.\n  Let me give an example of how this program is working. This program \nis helping to build wind turbines in Carmel, IN, to power its city \nsewer treatment plant. It is being used in Salt Lake City, UT, to \nprovide loans to businesses to make energy efficiency upgrades. It is \nbeing used in Columbus, OH, to make 29 public buildings more energy \nefficient.\n  I think, as everybody knows, the most significant thing we can do \ntoday, the best return on our dollar, is energy efficiency. That is \nwhat they are doing in Columbus, OH. That is what they are doing in \nVermont. That is what they are doing, in fact, all over this country, \nas a result of programs such as the Energy Efficiency Block Grant \nProgram. It is being used in Portland, ME, to retrofit 55 public \nbuildings. It is being used in Miami, FL, to convert landfill gas into \nthe production of electricity. Methane gas out of rotting organic \nmatter in a landfill provides electricity. What can be smarter than \nthat? It is being used in New York City to help homeowners and \nbusinesses with energy efficiency and renewable energy loans, among \nmany other projects we are seeing all over America, 50 States utilizing \nthis program, young people getting involved in thinking about energy, \nenergy efficiency, sustainable energy. We need to keep\n\n[[Page S4714]]\n\nthese investments in energy efficiency and conservation going and that \nis what this amendment does.\n  Finally, this amendment would dedicate $25 billion for deficit \nreduction. At a time of record-breaking deficits and debt, we simply \ncannot continue to give oil and gas companies huge tax breaks.\n  When it comes down to it, this amendment asks a very simple question: \nWhich side are you on? Which side are you on? Are you on the side of \nbig oil and gas companies or are you on the side of reducing the \ndeficit, reducing our dependence on oil, saving consumers and \nbusinesses money on their energy bills, and saving the planet we live \non? I would hope most of our colleagues here are on the side of doing \nwhat is right for the American people. That is what this amendment is \nabout. I understand that anytime you stand up to big oil and to big gas \ncompanies, there is going to be a lot of political push back. We know \nthat since 1990 the oil and the gas industry has made over $238 million \nin campaign contributions, and over the past 2 years alone, they spent \nover $210 million on lobbying. With the BP disaster in the gulf coast, \nmy guess is these guys are all over the place now lobbying and sending \nout their campaign contributions. But this amendment is the right thing \nto do. It should bring together all of us who are concerned about \ntransforming our energy system, all of us who are concerned about \nlowering our record-breaking deficits.\n  I intend to be offering this amendment. I look for widespread support \non both sides of the aisle.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                 Foreign Law and the U.S. Constitution\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I send to the desk to have printed in the \nRecord a letter I sent to Justice Sonia Sotomayor dated the day before \nyesterday. The reason for that concern is our Supreme Court process has \nbroken down.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                  Committtee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2010.\n     Justice Sonia Sotomayor,\n     Supreme Court of the United States,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Justice Sotomayor: I write to inquire about your \n     decision to join Justice Anthony Kennedy's opinion in the \n     case of Graham v. Florida, No. 08-1224. In that case, a 5-4 \n     majority of the Court ruled that sentencing a juvenile \n     offender to life in prison without parole for a nonhomicide \n     crime is unconstitutional.\n       In Justice Kennedy's opinion, he employs a methodology \n     similar to that used in Roper v. Simmons. In Roper and \n     Graham, the majority relies on what five Justices perceive to \n     be ``evolving standards of decency'' in concluding that the \n     punishment in question violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on \n     cruel and unusual punishment. In arriving at this conclusion, \n     Justice Kennedy looked to both the sentencing practices of \n     the states and the federal government and to the ``judgments \n     of other nations.'' Justice Kennedy's opinion in Graham, \n     which you joined, states, ``[the] global consensus against \n     the sentencing practice in question'' provides ``support for \n     our conclusion'' that the punishment is unconstitutional. He \n     further writes, the ``judgments of other nations and the \n     international community'' and the ``climate of international \n     opinion'' are ``not irrelevant'' to determining the \n     ``acceptability of a particular punishment.'' Specifically, \n     the opinion notes, ` ``the overwhelming weight of \n     international opinion against' life without parole for \n     nonhomicide offenses committed by juveniles `provide[s] \n     respected and significant confirmation for our own \n     conclusion' '' that it violates the Eighth Amendment.\n       Given your testimony at your confirmation hearing, I have \n     serious concerns about your decision to join Justice \n     Kennedy's opinion, which extensively cites foreign law, At \n     your hearing. I asked you the following question: ``[W]ill \n     you affirm to this Committee and the American public that, \n     outside of where you are directed to do so through statute or \n     through treaty, refrain from using foreign law in making the \n     decisions that you make that affect this country and the \n     opinions that you write?'' You responded: ``I will not use \n     foreign law to interpret the Constitution or American \n     statutes. I will use American law, constitutional law to \n     interpret those laws, except in the situations where American \n     law directs a court.'' I sought further clarification and \n     asked: ``So you stand by it? There is no authority for a \n     Supreme Court justice to utilize foreign law in terms of \n     making decisions based on the Constitution or statutes?'' You \n     responded: ``Unless the statute requires you or directs you \n     to look at foreign law . . . the answer is no.''\n       Your decision to join Justice Kennedy's opinion that uses \n     foreign law to ``support'' its conclusion conflicts with your \n     pledge to the Judiciary Committee and the American public not \n     to ``use foreign law to interpret the Constitution.'' In \n     light of that conflict. I respectfully request that you \n     explain why you chose to join the majority's opinion in \n     Graham. I recognize that Justice Kennedy's opinion does not \n     rely on foreign law as precedent for its decision; however, \n     if foreign law is of no value to the reasoning of the opinion \n     and did not influence the final outcome, then please explain \n     why you supported its inclusion in the opinion. These \n     questions are particularly relevant as the Senate is faced \n     with evaluating another Supreme Court nominee in the coming \n     months. Accordingly, I would appreciate a prompt response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Tom Coburn, M.D.,\n                                                     U.S. Senator.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I want to read you some quotes of the Justice, and then I \nwant to read you the answers she gave to my queries during her hearing \non the Judiciary Committee. I think it is going to be plain to see that \nwe have to change what we are doing on Supreme Court nominees.\n  Previous quotes from Judge Sotomayor on foreign law; the use of \nforeign law to interpret the U.S. Constitution, which is forbidden \nunder the Constitution, except in those international treaties where it \nis so directed under statute and treaty.\n  Statement of Judge Sotomayor:\n\n       To suggest to anyone that you can outlaw the use of foreign \n     or international law is a sentiment that is based on a \n     fundamental misunderstanding. What you would be asking \n     American judges is to close their minds to good ideas. \n     Nothing in the American legal system prevents us from \n     considering the ideas.\n\n  That is true.\n\n       The international law and foreign law will be very \n     important in the discussion of how we think about unsettled \n     issues in our own legal system. It is my hope that judges \n     everywhere will continue to do this. Within the American \n     legal system, we are commanded to interpret our law in the \n     best way we can. That means looking to what anyone has said \n     to see if it has pervasive value.\n\n  Well, that is wrong. The Constitution defines what judges look at in \nconsidering their decisions. So I asked her the following questions \nduring her confirmation hearing before the Judiciary Committee:\n\n       [W]ill you affirm to this Committee and the American public \n     that outside of where you are directed to do so through \n     statute or through treaty, refrain from using foreign law in \n     making the decisions that you make that affect this country \n     and the opinions that you write? [or concur with.]\n\n  Sotomayor's response:\n\n       I will not use foreign law to interpret the Constitution or \n     American statutes. I will use American law, constitutional \n     law to interpret those laws, except in situations where \n     American law directs a court [to do otherwise.]\n       So you stand by it?\n\n  These are my words.\n\n       There is no authority for a Supreme Court Justice to \n     utilize foreign law in terms of making decisions based on the \n     Constitution or our statutes?\n\n  Here is her response.\n\n       Unless the statute requires you or directs you to look at \n     foreign law, the answer is no.\n\n  So her statements before she comes before the committee are totally \nopposite of what she tells the committee, and then what she has done \nsince proves that her testimony before the committee was totally \nmeaningless.\n  On May 17, Justice Sotomayor joined an opinion citing the ``judgments \nof other nations'' when interpreting the eighth amendment to prohibit \nsentencing of a juvenile offender. The opinion states the following:\n\n       [The] global consensus against the sentencing practice in \n     question provides support for our conclusion.\n\n  Well, either she was dishonest with us in the committee or she does \nnot know what she is signing on to, which tells you that our process \nfor intervening and holding Supreme Court candidates is a failure.\n  The opinion further states that:\n\n       The judgments of other nations and the international \n     community [and the] climate of international opinion are not \n     irrelevant to determining the acceptability of a particular \n     punishment.\n\n  That is a total violation of the U.S. Constitution and its statutes. \nIt is a total negation of what she told the committee as she came \nthrough the\n\n[[Page S4715]]\n\ncommittee process. That is one of the reasons I did not believe her, \nbecause I believed her earlier statements to be her true feeling.\n  So what we have before the Judiciary Committee--and we have another \nnominee coming up now--is the ability for Justices to say whatever we \nwant to hear, and then do whatever they want to do and ignore the U.S. \nConstitution, as she did, and in her testimony before the committee.\n  As journalist Stuart Taylor recently wrote in The Atlantic--this \nopinion that she cosigned onto:\n\n       The opinion was based on little more than the personal \n     policy preferences of the five majority justices. And it \n     looked abroad for consensus that so plainly does not exist \n     here and violates our own U.S. Constitution.\n\n  So it did not matter what she told the committee. She did exactly the \nopposite of what she told the committee as she signed onto this \nopinion. We are going to need more than promises from the next nominee. \nAn acceptable Supreme Court nominee must have a demonstrated record of \nadhering to the Constitution and their judicial oath by strictly \ninterpreting the Constitution, according to our Founders' intent, not \ninternational opinion or consensus. It has no role in the \ninterpretation of our Constitution. Senators cannot simply accept \npledges from Supreme Court nominees that they will not use foreign law \nwhen interpreting the U.S. Constitution. The nominee to come before us, \nSolicitor General Kagan, wrote the following:\n\n       There are some circumstances in which it may be proper for \n     judges to consider foreign law sources in ruling on \n     constitutional questions.\n\n  Oh, really? Is that what our Constitution says? Is that what this \ncandidate believes? Here is what she said. What is she going to say \nbefore us in committee, that she will not? What value is that if, in \nfact, she knows that to be the law, she admits that is what the U.S. \nConstitution says, and as soon as she is affirmed, does exactly the \nopposite? The process has to be changed. We can no longer take it on \nfaith because, in fact, the process under which--since Bork actually \nspoke what he believed, since him, nobody has said what they believe. \nThey have all chiseled on what they believe. They will not be \naccountable to what they believe. So we have to change that process.\n  The other concerning thing about Nominee Kagan is that when she went \nto Harvard, she made international law mandatory in terms of getting a \ndegree out of law school at Harvard. But do you realize Harvard does \nnot require its lawyers to take constitutional law? You can graduate \nfrom Harvard Law School and never have studied U.S. constitutional law. \nThat tells you the trend this country is going in; we are abandoning \nour Constitution and the very wisdom that gives us the freedom we have \ntoday.\n  I will finish by saying, the consideration of any judge in the \nfuture, in terms of this Senator, is going to be borne out by what they \nhave said before they got to the committee, not what they say to the \ncommittee, because we can no longer, as a body, trust what the nominees \nsay in committee.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris.) The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before the Senate is a bill that \nincludes many provisions. It is known in shorthand as the extenders \nbill because each year there are portions of the Tax Code which expire, \nand they relate to a lot of different things we kind of take for \ngranted--the biofuels tax credit, for example--and other things. Each \nyear, Congress extends or reauthorizes those portions of the Tax Code, \nand most of them are noncontroversial.\n  The obvious question many people ask who are affected by them is, Why \ndo you do this every year and go through this exercise? It is an honest \nand legitimate question. I just say that the honest answer is, Because \nthe extenders themselves are not controversial; they are popular. They \nbecome the spoonful of sugar that helps the medicine go down because \nthey usually accompany other things that have more controversy with \nthem. That is the way politics works. That is the way the Congress \nworks, and that is what we do each year. This year is no exception, and \nwe are considering the extension of portions of the Tax Code and \nincluding with it other things that will have an impact on the country \nand on the economy.\n  When I look at what is included in this bill, which is going to be \nimportant, there are several provisions that I think are critically \nimportant for the economy.\n  Most of us believe we would be better off in America if we stopped \nexporting good-paying American jobs overseas. So the President has said \nrepeatedly and many of us have said in our speeches on the floor and \nback home that we want to stop rewarding in the Tax Code companies that \ndecide it is to their economic advantage to locate overseas, closing \ndown a factory in Galesburg, IL, and moving over to Europe or Japan or \nChina or India or wherever it happens to be. So this bill, first and \nforemost, eliminates major tax cuts and loopholes available to U.S. \ncorporations that want to relocate their business operations overseas. \nI think that is eminently sensible. Why would we in our Tax Code reward \ncompanies that want to leave the country, companies that want to \neliminate American jobs? That is the No. 1 thing this extenders package \ndoes, in addition to extending some of the tax provisions I mentioned \nearlier.\n  It also provides help for small businesses across America. If we are \ngoing to get out of this recession sooner rather than later, we really \nneed to depend on small businesses in America that will be able to step \nup and hire more people. We all think about the big company that is \ngoing to locate its new plant in our hometown and create 1,000 or 2,000 \njobs. Occasionally, that happens. But more likely than not, the job \ngrowth in most communities and most cities will be when smaller \nbusinesses can hire 1 or 2 people or maybe 10 or 20 people. \nCumulatively, those efforts result in a growth in the American \nworkforce. This bill, as a second part, creates tax incentives and help \nfor small businesses to hire more people in this weak economy.\n  Those are the two pillars of the bill: stop the export of American \njobs by eliminating the tax incentives in our American laws that reward \ncompanies for sending jobs overseas and, secondly, create an \nenvironment in our Tax Code and programs that help small businesses \nretain and hire more American workers. I cannot think of two better \nthings to do in a weak economy. Yet it seems there is opposition to \nthis bill from the Republican side of the aisle. There are some who may \nsupport it, and I hope they do. I hope it genuinely becomes a \nbipartisan bill.\n  But there is a genuine concern about some other provisions that I \nwould like to address.\n  I don't know that there is an American alive today who is unaware of \nwhat is going on in the Gulf of Mexico. I don't know what day we are \nin--60, 61--of this terrible environmental disaster where the BP rig \nblew up, killing 11 innocent people, and then the oil started spewing \ninto the Gulf of Mexico. British Petroleum came in and has been trying \nvainly to stop this oil from flowing into the gulf. They have said \nrepeatedly that they will make this all whole at the end of the day; \nthey will stop the oil from flowing and set about repairing the damage, \nwhich is extensive.\n  Twenty-one years ago, I was on a congressional trip up to Prince \nWilliam Sound in Alaska. The Exxon Valdez, a large tanker, had run \naground because the captain, they think--it was alleged--had been \ndrinking and didn't pay attention. It gashed the hull of the boat and \nended up spewing oil in every direction. I will never forget that as \nlong as I live because there was this black, dirty, sludgy oil all over \neverything. We went out on a Coast Guard ship and looked at it. You \nwould see these horrible situations where, in this pristine Alaskan \nenvironment, everything would be covered with this black oil, and you \nwould look down into the rocks and you could see as deep as you could \nsee that there was more and more of that oil.\n  I asked Senator Murkowski of Alaska what Prince William Sound is like\n\n[[Page S4716]]\n\n21 years later, and she said things have gotten back to a more normal \nstate but some things have changed forever. Some species of fish, such \nas the herring, are just gone from this particular place. Maybe at some \ndistant point in the future, they will return, but for the last 20 \nyears, they have been extinct and gone. I hope Mother Nature takes care \nof that over time. You can see that it will take a long period of time.\n  We don't know what is going to happen in the Gulf of Mexico, but we \nknow it will be expensive, first, in terms of human life--losing 11 \npeople--and, second, in terms of the environmental damage, which is \nincalculable at this moment; that is, the economic cost of the damage.\n  If there is any encouraging thing--and there isn't much--in this \nwhole conversation, it is the fact that British Petroleum is a very \nwealthy company. In the first 3 months of this year, they announced \n$5.6 billion in profits. When they say they can pay for the damage, it \nis clear that they have deep pockets and they can pay. And they will \npay. The taxpayers will not pay.\n  There is a provision in this bill relating to this issue that has \nbecome controversial on the floor. We decided back in the time of the \nExxon Valdez spill that we would create an oilspill liability fund. In \nother words, we would collect money and put it into a ``rainy day \nfund'' that would be there in case of an environmental disaster to pay \nfor the damage. We collect, under current law, 8 cents for every barrel \nof oil to put into this fund. This morning's paper tells us that a \nbarrel of oil is selling for $71.99, so 8 cents represents about one-\ntenth of 1 percent of the cost of a barrel of oil. It is a tiny, small \namount.\n  Over time, with all the oil that has been explored and produced, we \nhave collected over $1 billion into this oilspill liability fund, \nthinking we were prepared for the worst. We couldn't imagine what \nhappened in the Gulf of Mexico, where $1.5 billion wouldn't even come \nclose to paying for the damage that has been created by this BP \ndisaster. So this bill will increase the amount of tax on a barrel of \noil to 41 cents a barrel.\n  Remember, the price of a barrel of oil is $71.99, and we are going to \ncharge 41 cents to be put into this oilspill liability fund. There is \nan objection to this from the Republican side of the aisle. Their \nobjection is a little hard to follow because they are kind of tied up \nin a budgetary argument here. I think it is pretty clear to see what \nthe choices will be. If we don't collect this money for every barrel of \noil and put it into an oilspill liability fund, God forbid if there is \nanother environmental disaster; there won't be enough money to pay for \nit.\n  Today, British Petroleum has its slimy fingerprints all over this \nmess. We know they are going to end up holding the bag, as they should. \nThey have the money to pay for the damages associated with it. But what \nabout tomorrow? What if the company involved is not as well off as BP? \nWhat if they are bankrupted by an environmental disaster and they go \nout of business? Who then is going to compensate the shrimpers, the \noystermen, the fishermen, the tourist industry, the resorts, and all \nthe others who are affected by all this? At that point in time, you \nwould look to this oilspill liability fund. But the $1.5 billion it \ncurrently holds is not enough to do the job. That is why this bill \nincreases the amount per barrel of oil from 8 to 41 cents, so instead \nof one-tenth of 1 percent, it is about one-half of 1 percent of the \ncurrent cost of a barrel of oil that will be set aside as an insurance \nfund.\n  The Republicans are objecting to this. You have to ask them, what is \nthe alternative? If the oil companies don't pay so that we have an \ninsurance fund for the next environmental disaster, who will pay? I \nthink we know the answer. It will require another taxpayer bailout, \nwhich means taxpayers across America will be called on to come up with \nthe emergency disaster funds to pay for the next environmental \ndisaster, God forbid it ever occurs. Isn't it better to have the \nindustry drilling for oil building up the reserves in this oilspill \nliability fund so that the taxpayers don't end up ultimately paying for \nthe cleanup? It is obvious to me. The alternative is unacceptable, but \nthe alternative is what is being argued for on the Republican side of \nthe aisle. They want to step aside from what is the clear \nresponsibility of the big oil companies and those who would drill.\n\n  Yesterday, we had a hearing in the Senate Judiciary Committee, and we \ntalked about the liability of the oil companies in this situation. It \nturns out that Senator Patrick Leahy, of Vermont, and Senator Sheldon \nWhitehouse, from Rhode Island, did some research on it and found that \nmost of the law that governed this situation was ancient law--150, 160 \nyears old. The law, for example, for the 11 people who died on this oil \nrig in the explosion limits the recovery of their surviving families to \nthe actual monetary losses--in other words, how much future income will \nbe lost to that family because of the death of that worker. They cannot \ncollect for any loss of companionship due to the death of a father or \nhusband, and they cannot collect punitive damages, except to the amount \nof the actual compensatory damages--one to one. There is a limit to \nwhat they can recover.\n  Yesterday, Christopher Jones testified about his brother Gordon, who \ndied as a result of the explosion on this rig in the Gulf of Mexico. He \nshowed us photos of the family, the two little boys--one born after the \nfather died and another young boy and his mom. It was so compelling.\n  The argument was made by a man representing the oil and energy \nindustry that it would be reckless for us to expand the liability of \noil companies beyond the current limitations in the law. I think it is \nreckless for us to consider allowing anybody to drill in the Gulf of \nMexico who doesn't have the bonding and wherewithal to stand up for any \ndamages they should incur. Why in the world would we allow anybody to \ngo out in this circumstance, when we can see what happens when it goes \nwrong, and do it again without having some sort of insurance that \nprotects those involved working there, as well as those who are \naffected by the environment around the Gulf of Mexico? They have no \nbusiness drilling, as far as I am concerned, if they are not \nfinancially responsible and if they cannot stand behind their \noperations to make sure the taxpayers don't end up in a situation where \nthey are vulnerable.\n  The Republican position that says we should not impose a new tax on \noil companies to make sure there is enough money in an oilspill fund so \nthat the taxpayers won't have to pay for these disasters in the future \nis a position that is indefensible. It is a position that makes no \nsense.\n  They argue, incidentally, that if we collect this money, we should \nsomehow say it won't be used for any other purpose. Well, the money \nwill be used for the purpose of oilspill cleanup, but because it will \nbe a new asset of the Federal Government, it will be shown on the books \non the positive side. We are collecting the tax, gaining the asset, and \nincreasing in a small way our budget picture on the positive side. I \nthink they are lost in a budgetary argument that really is, in effect, \ntrying to protect the oil companies from this new tax.\n  I hope my colleagues won't be discouraged in this debate but will \nstand by the efforts of the committee to impose this new tax \nresponsibility. I hope that as Members of the Senate consider this \nbill--and I see my friend from Ohio here, and I will yield momentarily \nto him--they will try to understand how difficult it might be to \nexplain why they voted against a bill that eliminates tax breaks for \nAmerican companies that want to locate their businesses overseas and \nwhy they voted against a bill that provides help for small businesses \nin America to hire more workers in a time of high unemployment. Those \nare the two most important elements in this so-called extension bill. I \nhope--wouldn't it be a great day--we could have bipartisan support for \nthose two basic ideas and at the end of the day do something on the \nfloor to create jobs in America and, in the process, do it in a \nsensible way that builds for our future.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I stand here a bit incredulous \nabout the comments of Senator Durbin, the assistant majority leader, \nabout the oil industry and Republican opposition to simply making them \npay for potential problems they cause.\n\n[[Page S4717]]\n\n  I say I am incredulous, but as I think a little longer, I realize \nthat is par for the course. I have only been in the Senate 3\\1/2\\ \nyears. I have seen the Republicans side with the insurance companies on \nhealth care reform. I have seen them side with the drug companies on \nMedicare issues. I have seen them side with big Wall Street banks on \nWall Street reform. Now they side with the oil industry, with BP, with \nExxon and these companies that have had--literally, BP's profits were \nover $1 billion, several billion, multibillion-dollar profits per \nquarter. And my friends on the other side of the aisle--I don't know if \nit is the campaign contributions, social connections, what it is with \nthe oil industry--it is always the oil industry first, taxpayers \nsecond, and the consuming public third with them. I don't get that.\n\n\n                         COBRA Subsidy Payments\n\n  I wish to talk about an amendment Senator Casey is offering and of \nwhich I am a primary cosponsor dealing with COBRA, the health insurance \nissue. When this recession started and unemployment began to spike, \nmost of us in Congress acted to help those in clear need with the \nstimulus package and with the extension of unemployment insurance.\n  Remember, it is insurance; it is not welfare. People pay into the \nunemployment insurance fund when they are working, and when they lose \ntheir jobs, through no fault of their own, they get assistance from the \nunemployment insurance fund.\n  Another part of that is, when someone in Joliet or Cleveland or \nSpringfield, IL, or Springfield, OH, loses their job, they all too \noften lose their insurance. There is a Federal program, a Federal law, \nthat you can continue to draw health insurance when you lose your job \nif you, the employee, pay for your part of it and you pay the employer \ncontribution for your health insurance, which at least doubles, \nsometimes triples the amount of money you were paying for health \ninsurance when you were working.\n  That means simply, when you are working, you are paying X dollars, \nwhich is never cheap. When you lose your job, you are paying 2X or 3X, \nand almost nobody can afford that. If you have lost your job, how can \nyou pay more money for health insurance than before you lost it?\n  That is why in the Recovery Act a year and a half ago, I wrote \nlegislation, later amended in the bill, to give a significant subsidy \nto those people who lost their job but are trying and struggling to \nkeep their insurance. It allows newly unemployed workers to stay on \ntheir former employer's health plan with that subsidy.\n  I have received countless letters and e-mails from Ohioans who \ndescribe how COBRA is more expensive than rent or food. That is why we \nstepped in. We did a 65-percent subsidy. In other words, if you lose \nyour job, instead of paying your part of the insurance and your \nemployer's part, instead of paying that combined amount, which was \nFederal law for years, we are subsidizing 65 percent of that amount.\n  I cannot count the number of people I have talked with in the last \nyear who have come up to me and said: I still have insurance because I \nwas able--it is still difficult; it is not as though money is growing \non trees for these people who lost their jobs. It is still difficult. \nBut so many people have come up to me and said: I still have my \ninsurance because of that subsidy.\n  In this legislation, the House took away the COBRA subsidy under the \nview that we simply cannot afford this subsidy anymore. The Casey-Brown \namendment says: Yes, we can, and we are going to do it.\n  A recent report by the U.S. Department of Treasury concludes COBRA \n``has been an important source of insurance coverage during the \nrecession, especially for the middle class.''\n  It said that COBRA has ``significantly slowed the growth of the \nuninsured population, which had been skyrocketing through February \n2009.'' In other words, this government report showed what we are doing \nis working. A lot more people have insurance as a result of the COBRA \nsubsidy, just as a lot more people have jobs today because of the \nstimulus package.\n  Granted, it is not good. There are too many people who have lost \ntheir insurance and too many people who have lost their jobs. More \npeople have jobs because of the stimulus package and a whole lot more \npeople have health insurance and are not a burden on the State, their \ncommunity, or their families because they actually have insurance \nthrough COBRA.\n  The COBRA subsidy expired for newly unemployed Americans on May 31, 9 \ndays ago. The managers' amendment includes an extension of the \nunemployment insurance program, which is a good thing, but it does not \ninclude an extension of COBRA.\n  This absence is striking, given the fact that a recent survey shows \nthat 15 percent of unemployed insurance recipients rely on COBRA for \naffordable coverage. Unemployment insurance is an important lifeline. \nOf course, we need to do that. But it does not give enough money for a \nfamily to pay for their insurance.\n  Again, look at the math. Your unemployment insurance is less than you \nwere making when you were working. Your insurance payment for COBRA, if \nwe do not subsidize it, is a lot more, a factor of two or three times, \nin most cases, what you were paying for insurance when you were \nworking. You have less income and significantly higher health care \ncosts. That is why that subsidy is so very important. That is why I am \njoining with Senator Casey in offering an amendment that will extend \nthe COBRA Premium Assistance Program for another 6 months.\n  Let me conclude with a couple letters from Ohioans who explain the \npersonal side of this issue. We all come to the floor and talk about \npolicy. We all are a little geeky sometimes. I like to come to the \nfloor and read letters from people I represent in my State.\n  Robert and Rachel are from Montgomery County. That is Dayton, \nKettering, Huber Heights, West Carrollton--those communities:\n\n       One month after I was laid off, my wife, a registered \n     nurse, had a stroke.\n       Since that time, we have struggled but managed to keep our \n     heads above water because of the COBRA subsidy. We have four \n     children, and simply cannot live without health insurance, \n     because the cost can be devastating.\n\n  Understand, too, if you lose your insurance, trying to get insurance \nagain is so difficult and so expensive. We do not want this \ninterrupted.\n  Robert writes:\n\n       We feel the need to be one more voice encouraging your \n     colleagues to speak out for the families that have been hurt \n     the most by this economic disaster.\n       Please keep fighting for us.\n\n  Montgomery County, Dayton, has been inflicted with a GM plant \nclosing. National Cash Register, NCR, one of the oldest companies \npeople associate with the city of Dayton--the CEO did not talk to \nanybody. He pulled the company up, left, and moved to Atlanta. DHL, a \nlarge cargo carrier, a German company, pulled out of Wilmington nearby. \nThat was several thousand jobs. They have had that kind of economic \nhardship in Dayton.\n  We absolutely need to extend the COBRA subsidy for people such as \nRobert and Rachel.\n  The last note I wish to read is from Mary from Cuyahoga County, which \nis the northeastern Ohio area:\n\n       I live in northeast Ohio and have been out of work 13 \n     months. I live alone with no dependents, yet I can barely \n     meet my monthly financial challenges.\n       I became a cancer victim last year, but when my COBRA \n     subsidy is stopped, it will feel like an additional cancer in \n     my life.\n       The COBRA subsidy has bought me time to explore what I hope \n     to be an improving job market.\n\n  We are seeing good signs in northeast Ohio of increased job numbers \nand companies hiring people.\n\n       The COBRA subsidy has bought me time to explore what I hope \n     to be an improving job market. And not only would it buy me \n     time, it would renew my faith in government.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to continue the COBRA \nsubsidy. It clearly is the right thing to do. It is going to matter to \nso many families.\n  I don't understand why so many on the other side would oppose \nsomething such as this. It simply makes sense. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the Casey-Brown amendment.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S4718]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an urgent issue \nthat faces the American people, and it is an issue the Senate as well \nas the House must deal with, in my judgment; that is, the issue of \nextending COBRA premium assistance, health insurance assistance, to \nmany Americans who, through no fault of their own, are out of work; in \nmany instances, millions of Americans who have been out of work for a \nlong time.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to add the following Senators \nas cosponsors of an amendment I have that extends COBRA premium \nassistance. These are Senators who will be added beyond those who were \noriginal cosponsors.\n  They are Senators Franken, Stabenow, Reed of Rhode Island, and \nGillibrand.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the basic issue \nto have health insurance coverage for those who have been out of work. \nI know I join Senator Brown and the other cosponsors of this amendment \nto urge support for the extension of the eligibility period of the \nCOBRA Premium Assistance Program, which was authorized under the \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.\n  I do want to commend and note my appreciation for the support of \nSenators Begich, Whitehouse, Lautenberg, Kerry, Wyden, Harkin, Levin, \nBurris--the Presiding Officer--Franken, Reed of Rhode Island, and \nStabenow, who have cosponsored the amendment.\n  We continue to recover from this economic recession, a horrific \nchapter in American history almost too difficult or too complicated for \nsome of us to fully understand because we haven't lived through it \nourselves. We in the Senate haven't lost our jobs or lost our health \ninsurance. But we hear from and know of people who have, and that is \none of the main reasons we are here to talk about this issue today.\n  We are recovering but we haven't recovered fully, and now is not the \ntime to pull up the ladder on people who are still hanging on, in some \ncases to the last rung of the ladder. These basic, and I would argue, \nvital safety net programs--whether it is unemployment insurance or \nCOBRA premium assistance for health care--are programs that we can't \nshort-circuit. We can't cut people off at this point.\n  The American people agree with us, by the way. They understand we \nhave made progress on economic recovery, but the unemployment rate is \nstill far too high. It has just been a little bit less than 10 percent \nfor far too long. In my home State of Pennsylvania, fortunately it is \nlower than that. It has been lower than 9 percent a long time but has \nbumped up to around 9. But that doesn't really matter. The percentage \ndoesn't really tell the story. In our State, we have over 580,000 \npeople out of work, and the total number or the percentage number is a \nlot higher in many other States. So we just can't pull up the ladder \nand pretend we have fully recovered, that we can begin to transition to \na different strategy.\n  For millions of Americans out of work, through no fault of their own, \nmedical costs continue to rise while their personal savings dwindle or \nin some cases have been wiped out because of this recession, leaving \nmillions of Americans without adequate health care coverage and leading \nmany to refuse necessary treatment due to the high cost.\n  Americans who lose their coverage through job loss cannot be expected \nto purchase expensive health care plans while they are unemployed. It \nis difficult enough for someone who has a job to pay for health \ninsurance. We know that is difficult. A lot of small businesses were \ntelling us about that throughout the health care debate. But just \nimagine if you are out of work and you are trying to survive and you \nare called upon or required to pay for an expensive health care plan. \nSo we should act, and we should act now, to provide an extension for \nCOBRA subsidies to ease the economic strain of expensive health care \ncoverage for the unemployed.\n  The amendment I have offered, and that today I am just speaking \nabout, will provide much needed relief at a very difficult time for \nmany families as unemployed workers focus on finding new employment \nrather than having to worry--and worry doesn't even begin to describe \nthe anguish people feel--about receiving adequate health care coverage \nfor themselves and their families. We ought to provide them some peace \nof mind so they can concentrate on finding a job instead of worrying \nabout whether they, someone in their family, or a loved one is going to \nget the medical treatment they deserve.\n  The COBRA Premium Assistance Program has already been successful in \nensuring that Americans receive quality health care. Let me give one \nexample from a letter I received from Susan, in LeHigh County, PA. She \nis a cancer survivor, but due to her treatments she has been diagnosed \nwith congestive heart failure as well. She is on five different \nmedications. Susan has relied upon her husband's health insurance, but \nin September of 2009 her husband lost his job.\n  What I am describing has happened to millions of people. This isn't \nisolated. This isn't anecdotal. This is a situation that millions of \nAmericans, if not tens of thousands, at a minimum, in a State such as \nPennsylvania have faced. So what does Susan do at that point? She has \nto rely upon her husband's health insurance, he loses his job, and now \nthey have nothing. They have no coverage at all.\n  So Susan and her husband were able to utilize the COBRA Premium \nAssistance Program as a means to keep their health insurance. Thank \ngoodness the Recovery Act provided that kind of help. When my office \nfollowed up with Susan, we were happy to learn her husband had found a \nnew job and they were off of their COBRA Premium Assistance Program and \non her husband's new health insurance. Fortunately, that has a good \nending, but a lot of stories don't end that way.\n  Susan's story is a perfect example of the purpose behind the COBRA \nPremium Assistance Program which helps people transition.\n  Here is another letter, which I will refer to in pertinent part. This \nis a letter I received from another constituent in Pennsylvania by the \nname of Lisa. I will not read her full name because I don't have \npermission, but this is a letter she sent to us in early March, and \nhere, in pertinent part, is what she wrote about her own health care \nsituation. She said:\n\n       I have been receiving chemotherapy nearly every other week \n     for the past 18 months. The treatments were covered by my \n     COBRA benefits and has kept me alive.\n\n  So she is not saying the premium assistance from COBRA was something \nthat just gave her a little help when she needed it. She isn't just \nsaying: Thank goodness the COBRA premium assistance can pay for my \ntreatments--the chemotherapy that she needed. She is saying the COBRA \nbenefits ``kept me alive.'' That is a direct quotation from her letter. \nThen she says:\n\n       I must continue chemotherapy but ran into a problem when an \n     extension of my COBRA coverage was denied.\n\n  In this country, with all the challenges we have, some things aren't \ndifficult to solve. If we pass an extension of COBRA premium \nassistance, Lisa doesn't have to worry whether she is going to be able \nto continue her chemotherapy treatments. Why should she have to worry \nwhen we can help her here?\n  I know we will hear from people in Washington--a lot of hot air, a \nlot of lecturing, a lot of speeches--that it is time to transition; \nthat the economy is getting better and it is time to transition now and \nlet Lisa get her treatments on her own. We hope she lives. But some \npeople in Washington may not want to help her any longer.\n  We know the American people support this extension. We know they \nunderstand what real people are up against because, guess what, they \nare living with it. People in Washington who come to the Senate every \nday and are Senators and Congressmen, they do not quite understand this \nsometimes. We don't have a full appreciation for how difficult it is \nfor Lisa and her chemotherapy treatments. We don't have a full \nappreciation here for how difficult it has been for Susan. Thank \ngoodness her husband was able to get a job, but it was pretty tough \nwhen they didn't have a job and they didn't have health insurance.\n  So COBRA helps a lot of people, and we should know what the \nconsequences\n\n[[Page S4719]]\n\nare of inaction, without the extension of the COBRA Premium Assistance \nProgram. A report from the National Employment Law Projects predicts \nthat as many as 150,000 Americans each month will lose out on the \nsubsidies necessary to afford quality health care. A study by Families \nUSA shows that 4 million Americans, including almost 100,000 in \nPennsylvania, lost their employer-based coverage due to job loss in \n2009 alone--4 million Americans.\n  The average cost of COBRA family coverage is three-fourths of the \nmonthly unemployment benefits in Pennsylvania and 40 other States. So \nthe good news is you have unemployment coverage if you lost your job, \nbut the bad news is three-fourths of that goes for your health \ninsurance. We shouldn't force people to be in those situations.\n  In some States, health premiums actually cost more than the monthly \nunemployment benefits, slowly driving families further into debt. \nProviding continued relief for Americans is not just necessary, it is \nessential to keep some people alive, literally--no exaggeration--as \nLisa's letter tells us. Giving people assistance in their greatest time \nof need will allow them to focus on finding employment, caring for \ntheir families rather than avoiding expensive treatments or teetering \non the brink of bankruptcy.\n\n  In conclusion, besides the amendment that Senator Brown and I have \nbeen working on, along with our cosponsors, we circulated a letter that \nwill be delivered to Senator Reid and Senator Baucus this afternoon \nthat urges both to support the extension of the program and also the \npleas from people in Pennsylvania and a lot of other States who are \ntelling us how important this is--to provide an extension through the \nend of November for COBRA premium assistance, so people can have health \ncare and in a larger sense, I guess, to have peace of mind to know even \nthough they are out of work we care about them, we are going to fight \nfor them, and we are going to make sure they have health insurance \ncoverage as they try to go from joblessness to transition into having a \njob.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4303\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, today, once again, the Senate is \ngoing to consider the Sessions-McCaskill discretionary spending cap. I \nwish to take a couple of minutes and try to, once again, talk some \ncommon sense about Congress and our spending habits and about this very \nmodest baby step we must take if we are ever going to do the right \nthing when it comes to spending in the U.S. Government.\n  What is this amendment about? Well, at its heart, this amendment is \nabout trying to regain the trust of the American people. We have had to \ndo big, bold things because of an economic crisis. No question this \nPresident inherited a mess, and that we had to do some big, bold things \nto try to get out of the ditch.\n  But in the process, we have also, I hope, begun to realize that there \nis a two-step here. One is, big, bold things we had to do to get the \neconomy back on track, and the other is beginning to recognize, maybe \nfor the first time in a long time, that the path we are on is \nunsustainable.\n  Chairman Bernanke said it yesterday. It is unsustainable, the path we \nare on, in terms of spending in Washington, DC. What this amendment \ndoes is something that is very responsible and, frankly, modest. It is \nnot a cut in spending. In this economy, I understand many economists \nwould argue it is not the time to cut spending, but is it not time we \ncapped growth?\n  Think about it for a minute. Everywhere in America, whether it is at \na family's kitchen table or whether it is at a school board meeting or \nwhether it is at a city council meeting or a county legislative body \nmeeting or a State legislative budget hearing, everywhere in America \nthey are having to trim their sails, cut their budgets, try to find a \nmeaningful way to do more with less.\n  And what are we doing here? We cannot agree to cap growth? Are you \nkidding me? We cannot even say to the American people, we are not going \nto grow by as much over the next 3 years?\n  This does not even try to cut spending, it tries to cap growth. There \nare actually people in this body who think we cannot take this small \nmodest step to say we are not going to grow as quickly or by as much \nover the next several years?\n  How on Earth can we do hard stuff? How on Earth can we live up to our \nresponsibility as Members of the Senate, when it comes to fiscal \npolicy? How can we ever in the future do what we are going to have to \ndo to rein in this government if we cannot even cap spending at a time \nwhen everybody in America is cutting? Reining in growth should not be a \nhard vote. It should not be a hard vote.\n  There are people, and I understand this, I understand there are a lot \nof people in this body who have made it their work to appropriate, and \nthat has been the committee everybody wants to get on. It has been the \npowerful committee. Everybody knows around here, if you spend the \nmoney, you have power. I understand this is like the Earth shifting a \nlittle bit, that all of a sudden people who appropriate around here are \ngoing to have to take a different view of what their job is.\n  It is inevitable that that happens. Whether it happens this year, \nnext year, or the next decade, anybody knows we cannot sustain the \ncourse we are on. But what is frustrating to me is that some of the \npeople who are so anxious to defeat this amendment are using such old-\nfashioned fear tactics it is almost insulting. There are talking points \nthat are being circulated against this amendment that I think you ought \nto blush if you are responsible for. The notion is that we are going to \nmake these cuts in our most important programs. There is a talking \npoint going around that this would make us have to cut Border Patrol. \nCome on. That we are going to have to cut the priorities of this \ngovernment right now. No, we are not. We may have to cut back on some \nof the earmarking? Yes, probably. And cut that money from the budget.\n  Would we have to maybe cut out some low-performing government \nprograms? Yes, we would. In fact, the President announced that he wants \neveryone in the executive branch to identify 5 percent of their low-\nperforming programs. Then the next step would be that he would cut half \nof that, 2\\1/2\\ percent. He is asking them to find cuts in government.\n  All this amendment is doing is saying, we are going to curb growth. \nSo this amendment is not going as far as the President has asked his \nexecutive branch to do. The other thing about this is I keep getting \npushed at, well, these are priorities, our domestic discretionary \nspending--and this is from a lot of my colleagues on this side of the \naisle. But this amendment is not just about domestic discretionary \nspending. It is about defense discretionary spending. It exempts out \n$50 billion a year for our overseas contingency operations. It clearly \nexempts out emergencies, and there have always been more than 67 votes \nwhen we have appropriated for emergencies in this country. It is not as \nthough 67 votes are hard to get after a Katrina, after some kind of \nemergency that demands we respond to it.\n  The notion that we have now for the first time gotten the kind of \nsupport this amendment has received from Republican Senators to freeze \nthe growth on defense spending is huge. It is huge. Anybody who has \nspent any time looking around at contracting in the Department of \nDefense, which I have spent a lot of time on, or the way money is spent \nat the Pentagon, knows there are savings there. To curb the growth in \nspending, in discretionary spending in the Defense Department is a \nwonderful step forward. So it is not just domestic that is impacted by \nthis amendment, it is both domestic spending and defense spending, and \nit is time. It is time.\n  I hope everyone who has voted against this amendment in the past does \na gut check this time and thinks of themselves in front of a bunch of \npeople they work for in their home State, explaining to them why they \ncould not vote to curb growth in the Federal Government's budget. I am \ntelling you what, that is one explanation I would not want to have to \ngive\n\n[[Page S4720]]\n\nright now at home. I would not want to tell the people in Missouri that \nit was impossible for us to even put a lid on the growth of the Federal \nGovernment, right now at this time in this Nation's history, with all \nof the economic issues that are swirling around.\n  I think it would have a positive impact on our economy, to send this \nsignal. I think it would have a positive effect on our markets. I think \nit would have a positive global effect as we look at what is going on \nin Europe, that the Federal Government is finally acknowledging we have \ngot to begin to curb the growth of our expenditures.\n  These votes have been close. We got 56 the first time. We got 59, and \nthen everybody got nervous because we got 59 votes. Then the next time \nwe got 57. Three more votes. Three more votes, and we will send the \nright signal to the American people that we get it. I hope today is the \nday we send the signal to the American people that we know there are \nhard decisions ahead and we are beginning to take some modest steps to \nshow we have the guts and the fortitude to make those decisions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I stand to strongly support my amendment \nNo. 4312, which I introduced today, along with Senators Gregg, Cornyn, \nEnzi, Alexander, and Hutchison, and I urge all of my colleagues, both \nsides of the aisle, to support this commonsense amendment.\n  This is about something at issue in this present extenders bill on \nthe floor now that is near and dear to my heart, because it is directly \nrelated to the ongoing oil disaster, the ongoing crisis in the gulf, \nand that is an increase in taxes to supposedly fund the Oil Spill \nLiability Trust Fund but which does not do that at all, which is stolen \nfrom that trust fund, used for completely unrelated purposes.\n  Put another way, it is double counted. It is used as a fraudulent \noffset to mask other spending, other deficit spending in the bill. We \nhave a real crisis on our hands. Obviously it affects my State more \nthan any other. But it is a national challenge and a national crisis. I \nhave a pretty modest suggestion, in my opinion. Let's focus on the \nchallenge. Let's meet the challenge, not use it and abuse it \npolitically for other unrelated goals up here in Washington.\n  But I am afraid the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund is being used and \nabused in this bill for those other completely unrelated goals. I am \nafraid it is a perfect example of Rahm Emanuel's now famous phrase from \naround February 2009, ``We are not going to let a good crisis go to \nwaste.''\n  Well, this is a crisis. This is a whopper. But I take offense to not \nletting it go to waste, meaning to using and abusing it for other \npurposes. This bill proposes increasing the tax which ultimately is a \nconsumer tax on energy products that is supposed to be for the Oil \nSpill Liability Trust Fund.\n  It increases that tax from 8 cents a barrel to 41 cents a barrel. \nThat is an over fivefold increase. If that is necessary to clean up \noilspills, to have it ready for the future, I am completely open to it. \nBut that is not where the number came from. The number was pulled out \nof thin air. Because as soon as that money supposedly goes into the \ntrust fund, it is stolen. It pays for completely unrelated spending \nitems in the bill--for example, $15 billion over 10 years, and in this \nbill that is double-counted because it is used as an offset to mask \ndeficit spending, to mask other spending items. That is wrong.\n  Amendment No. 4312 is simple and straightforward. It says and does \ntwo things. No. 1, it says that the revenue supposedly going into the \nOil Spill Liability Trust Fund can only be used to clean up oilspills. \nIt is supposed to be there to clean up oilspills, it is supposed to be \na trust fund, so it can only be used for that purpose. Secondly, it \nsays that it cannot be double-counted. It is not be used as an offset \nunder the Congressional Budget Act or pay-as-you-go or anything else, \nas an offset for unrelated spending, to hide other deficit spending.\n  That is the amendment--two things, pure and simple. A number of the \nleadership of the majority have come to the floor concerned about this, \nas they should be, because it stinks, and the American people know it \nstinks, and have done gyrations and backflips to try to say they are \nnot stealing the money, they are not double-counting, it will be there. \nIf they really mean that, it is simple: No. 1, they should support my \namendment. No. 2, they should publicly admit that the true deficit cost \nof this bill is not what they say it is. It is $15 billion more. It is \nnot $79 billion; it is $94 billion. If they are sincere, if they mean \nit, great. Support my amendment and admit that the true deficit cost of \nthe bill before us is $15 billion more. But don't steal from that trust \nfund. Don't use that money that is supposed to be there to clean up \noilspills, such as the one that is hammering my State, for completely \nunrelated purposes. Don't double-count it. Don't use it as Enron \naccounting, a fraud to mask other spending, to artificially lower the \ndeficit impact of this bill. That is wrong. That is using a crisis. \nThat is ``not letting a crisis go to waste.''\n  We have a crisis. It is a heck of a crisis. It is a serious crisis. \nWe should solve it. We should go at it. We should address it together \nas a national challenge. We should not use it and abuse it politically \nfor an unrelated tax-and-spend agenda in Washington.\n  I urge all colleagues to come together, support amendment 4312, \nprotect the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, prevent it from being used \nand abused, double-counted--Enron accounting to mask deficit spending. \nDo the right thing by the people of Louisiana and by the people of this \nNation.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Burning of the Gaspee\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, here in this historic Chamber it is \nappropriate to recall those who came before us and risked their lives \nto create the great Republic we serve in this Senate.\n  Today, I would like to talk about a group of men who, 238 years ago, \non this date, engaged in a daring act of defiance against the British \nCrown--the first bloody act of defiance in the conflict that became the \nAmerican Revolution.\n  For many, the Boston Tea Party is considered a first act of defiance. \nGrowing up, we were taught how, on December 16, 1773, Bostonians poured \nshipments of tea overboard into Boston Harbor to defend the principle, \n``no taxation without representation.'' I think almost every \nschoolchild in America has heard of the Boston Tea Party.\n  Conspicuously missing from those children's education is the story of \nthe brave Rhode Islanders who dared to challenge the British Crown more \nthan a year before those Bostonians threw tea into the Boston Harbor. \nToday I would like to take us back to the real beginning of America's \nfight for independence and share with all of you the story of the \nBritish vessel, the HMS Gaspee, and to introduce some little known \nnames, heroes from history, who seem now to be lost in history's \nfootnotes.\n  In 1772, amidst growing tensions with American Colonies, King George, \nIII, stationed the HMS Gaspee in Rhode Island to prevent smuggling and \nenforce the payment of taxes to the Crown. But to Rhode Islanders, the \nGaspee quickly became a symbol of oppression.\n  The patronizing presence of the Gaspee was matched by the patronizing \nand domineering manner of its captain, LT William Dudingston. \nLieutenant Dudingston was known for destroying fishing vessels and \nconfiscating their contents and flagging down ships only to harass, \nhumiliate, and interrogate their sailors. But on June 9, 1772, an \naudacious Rhode Islander named Captain Benjamin Lindsey took a stand.\n  Aboard his boat, the Hannah, Captain Lindsey set sail from Newport to \nProvidence. When he was hailed by Lieutenant Dudingston to stop for a \nsearch by the Gaspee, the defiant Captain Lindsey continued on his \ncourse. Gunshots were fired, and the Hannah sped north up Narragansett \nBay with the Gaspee in full chase behind.\n  Outsized and outgunned, Captain Lindsey drew courage and confidence \nfrom his and his crew's keen familiarity with Rhode Island waters. He \nled\n\n[[Page S4721]]\n\nthe Gaspee into the shallow waters of Pawtuxet Cove, where the smaller \nHannah cruised over the sandbars and the heavier Gaspee ran aground. \nThe Gaspee was stranded in a falling tide, and it would be hours before \nhigh tide would again set her free.\n  Captain Lindsey took advantage of this favorable situation. Arriving \ntriumphantly in Providence, Captain Lindsey visited John Brown, whose \nfamily helped found Brown University. Knowing the Gaspee's helpless \nstate, the two men rallied a group of patriots at Sabin's Tavern--one \ndaren't speculate on the form of refreshment they took there--in what \nis now the east side of Providence.\n  The Gaspee was universally despised by colonists who had been bullied \nin their own waters, and the vulnerability now of this once powerful \nvessel presented these patriots an irresistible opportunity. On that \ndark night, 60 men in longboats with muffled oars, led by Captain \nLindsey and Abraham Whipple, moved quietly down the dark waters of \nNarragansett Bay.\n  As they encircled the Gaspee, Brown shouted a demand for Lieutenant \nDudingston to surrender his ship. Dudingston refused and instead \nordered his men to fire upon anyone who tried to board. The fearless \nRhode Islanders took this as a cue to force their way onto the Gaspee \nand forward they charged in a raging uproar of screams, gunshots, \npowder smoke, and clashing swords. It was amidst this violent struggle \nthat Lieutenant Dudingston was shot by a musket ball. Right there in \nRhode Island, right then, the very first blood of the conflict that \nwould lead to the American Revolution was drawn. Victory was soon in \nthe hands of the Rhode Islanders.\n  Brown and Whipple took the captive Englishmen back to shore and \nreturned to set the abandoned Gaspee afire. She burned prodigiously \nthrough the night, until the flames reached her powder magazine. Then, \nwith a convulsive explosion, she was flung in pieces across the bay. \nThe site of this historic victory would later be named Gaspee Point.\n  Too few people know of this bold undertaking which occurred 16 full \nmonths before the heroes of Boston painted their faces and threw tea \ninto the Boston Harbor in the event that became known as the Boston Tea \nParty. I hope the tale of the Gaspee will work its way into the history \nbooks. It preceded the Tea Party. It was more significant than the Tea \nParty. It was more violent than the Tea Party. And I think it set the \nstage of conflict that led to our independence and the freedoms we \nenjoy today.\n  So I hope Americans will think not just of the date of the Boston Tea \nParty but will remember June 9, the day the Hannah led the Gaspee \nacross the sandbars of Pawtuxet Cove, stranding her, and those 60 Rhode \nIslanders came down by oar to attack, burn, and destroy the Gaspee and \nengage in armed conflict with her crew.\n  I do know these events are not forgotten in my home State. Over the \nyears, I have often had the chance to march in the annual Gaspee Day's \nparade through Warwick, RI, as every year we recall the courage and the \nzeal of these men who risked it all for the freedoms we enjoy today, \ndrawing the first blood of our later Revolutionary conflict.\n  I hope the young pages I see in the Chamber who, I assume, have all \nheard of the Boston Tea Party--I see heads nodding, yes, they have--and \nmay not have heard of the Gaspee--I see heads shaking, they have not \nheard of the Gaspee--at least a small audience of young people today \nhas been educated that it was Rhode Islanders first, Rhode Islanders \nmore energetically, Rhode Islanders more aggressively, and Rhode \nIslanders more defiantly than anyone else at the early stages of the \nRevolution.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer, and I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Islands of Secrecy\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, this week there was a full-page \nadvertisement in the magazine Politico. It was actually a letter to me, \nan open letter to Senator Byron Dorgan, and then it says: ``Setting the \nRecord Straight About the Cayman Islands.'' It is signed by a man named \nAnthony Travers, chairman of the Cayman Islands Financial Services \nAssociation. The letter says:\n\n       During the recent debate over financial regulatory reform, \n     you--\n\n  Meaning me--\n\n     perpetuated the myth that the Cayman Islands is a tax secrecy \n     jurisdiction with unbelievably enormous loopholes. Neither of \n     these claims are true.\n\n  And so on. I thought I would respond to Mr. Travers. I don't know Mr. \nTravers from a cord of wood, but since he bothered to buy a full-page \nad in the newspaper Politico setting me straight, I thought perhaps it \nwould be useful for those who might ever have read this to know the \nfacts.\n  The Cayman Islands is a wonderful place. It has I guess the nicest \nwater I have ever seen; blue-green, beautiful water, beautiful beaches. \nI don't know much about the Cayman Islands. I have visited there. I \nknow about some of the Cayman Islands from a number of things I have \nread and seen about their banking system. What I have done on many \noccasions on the floor of the Senate when I have been talking about \nthose who have been trying to avoid paying taxes to the United States \nand those who want all that America has to offer them, except they \ndon't want to meet the obligations of citizenship by paying the taxes \nthey owe, is I have held up a picture of a house in the Cayman Islands. \nSo I will do it again today. This is called the Ugland House. A very \nenterprising reporter named David Evans from Bloomberg News brought \nthis to my attention the first time.\n  This is a five-story white house. It sits on Church Street in the \nCayman Islands. It is a building that has 18,857 corporations that call \nit home.\n  The first time I showed this on the floor, this five-story white \nbuilding on Church Street in the Cayman Islands, it had, I believe, \n12,748 corporations that say this is our corporate home. Now it has \ngrown. There are actually 18,857 companies in this five-story building. \nOh, they are not there; it is just a fiction. They claim a mailbox in \nthis little white stucco building in order to find a way to avoid \nresponsibilities to others outside of the Cayman Islands. Many of them \nwould be American companies searching for ways to provide secrecy for \ntheir financial transactions and presumably searching for ways to avoid \npaying their tax obligations.\n  The fellow who wrote to me, whose name is Anthony Travers--and let me \ndescribe who he is. Mr. Travers, says the Cayman Islands News Service, \nis chairman of CSI Stock Exchange and a former partner of Maples and \nCalder. Anthony Travers apparently chairs the Cayman Islands Financial \nServices Association. So he is a former partner of Maples and Calder. \nWho is Maples and Calder? The law firm of Maples and Calder is the only \noccupant of the Ugland House. Isn't that interesting? They have 18,857 \ncompanies that claim to be there--that is pretty crowded, right--18,857 \ncompanies claim to be crowded into this five-story white stucco \nbuilding. But these companies are just there to claim a mailbox--\nperhaps they all use the same mailbox--to avoid their obligations to \nother countries, especially our country.\n  So Mr. Travers has an epileptic seizure because I suggest that the \nCayman Islands is a place where there is tax secrecy and he writes a \nletter to set the record straight. He does no such thing. He doesn't \nhave the foggiest idea what he is talking about. I know what I am \ntalking about. This is a place he used to work. This is where the law \nfirm he worked for existed. They are the ones that accomplished \napparently the opportunity to have 18,857 companies claim a mail box as \ntheir legal address.\n  Well, if that is not enough, let me say this: The Wall Street Journal \nhad an opinion piece by Robert Morgenthau in New York, he said:\n\n       There is $1.9 trillion--\n\n  He is talking about the lack of financial transparency and the \nactivities of principals in the financial markets--\n\n       There is $1.9 trillion, almost all of it run out of the New \n     York metropolitan area, that\n\n[[Page S4722]]\n\n     sits in the Cayman Islands, a secrecy jurisdiction. Let me \n     say that again: ``A secrecy jurisdiction.''\n\n  That is from Mr. Robert Morgenthau, who knows what he is talking \nabout.\n  By the way, let me also say that McClatchy reported this:\n\n       Goldman Sachs used offshore tax havens to shuffle its \n     mortgage-backed securities to institutions worldwide, \n     including European and Asian banks, often in secret deals run \n     through the Cayman Islands, a British territory in the \n     Caribbean that companies use to bypass U.S. disclosure \n     requirements.\n\n  Well, I guess Mr. Travers sure did set me straight, except he didn't \nhave the facts. He knows what the facts are because he has been in this \nbuilding with 18,857 corporations. One wonders where he could find a \nchair or even find lunch--a pretty crowded place.\n  Let me further then say, the Asset Protection Law Center, reportedly \nrun out of a law firm located in California, describes this as the four \nmain factors for being involved in the Caymans and being involved in \nwhat they are doing:\n\n       No. 1: There are no income taxes, capital gains taxes, \n     profits tax or estate taxes.\n       No. 2: The bank secrecy laws are among the strictest in the \n     world with criminal penalties for unauthorized disclosure.\n       No. 3: The law allows companies to be formed with a minimum \n     of paperwork, and shares can be held anonymously in bearer \n     form or by nominees.\n       No. 4: The law regarding the formation of trusts is highly \n     developed and allows an excellent level of flexibility--\n\n  I will bet it does--\n\n     an excellent level of flexibility, asset protection, and \n     privacy.\n\n  I guess that describes what we have in the Cayman Islands. Again, the \nletter from Mr. Travers to myself explains how the claims of tax \nsecrecy jurisdictions are untrue.\n  Then, if I might, one more time, without being too repetitious, the \nfive-story white building where Mr. Travers--or at least Mr. Travers' \nold firm--occupies and accommodated 18,857 neighbors to join them for \nthe purpose of getting their mail there in order to claim that is where \ntheir business location exists. Is it because they have relatives in \nthis building? No, no relatives. Is it because they visit the building \nfrom time to time? No, likely they have never seen the building. Is it \nbecause they want to claim an address in the Cayman Islands because \nthey like blue and green water or beaches? No. It is because they need \na location in an area where you have unbelievable secrecy so you can \nclaim this is home to avoid taxes and to avoid other disclosures of \nwhat you are doing with a substantial amount of money.\n  Mr. Morgenthau had it correct. Mr. Morgenthau talked about $1.9 \ntrillion that has been run around through these orifices, in this case \na five-story building in the Cayman Islands. All I say to Mr. Travers \nis this: I have certain expectations of those who want everything that \nAmerica has to offer. If you are an American citizen or an American \ncorporation, which is an artificial person, if in those circumstances \nyou want all that America has to offer, then I believe you have \nresponsibilities to pay your taxes and become productive citizens and \nmeet the responsibilities that citizens have in this country. Most of \nthe people I represent up the street and down the block and out on the \nfarm don't have the ability or the willingness to decide to hide their \nincome from their government. But some of the biggest enterprises in \nthe country do, so they find a willing partner in a little white \nbuilding on Church Street in the Cayman Islands that allows them to do \nthat. That is very unfortunate.\n  I would say to Mr. Travers: Next time you try to set somebody \nstraight, use a few facts. Perhaps it will buttress your argument. But \ndon't try to fool me or the Congress or the American people about what \nis going on inside of this white building. We understand what is going \non inside this building, and I think the people who allow that to \nhappen and to decide it is a legitimate way to do business ought to be \nashamed of themselves.\n\n\n                             Gulf Oilspill\n\n  Madam President, if I might--I understand some colleagues are here--I \nwish to make some very brief comments about a hearing we had this \nmorning in the Energy Committee with Secretary Salazar dealing with the \noilspill.\n  I asked this morning again about the promise and the pledge that BP \nhas made that they will cover all of the ``legitimate'' costs that \noccur as a result of this oilspill. I have asked this question to the \nU.S. Justice Department, I talked to the President about it yesterday, \nand I talked to Secretary Salazar about it. Isn't it time now, on the \n51st day of this gusher, for us to say to BP that we expect you to pay \nand we don't expect the American taxpayer to bear the burden of your \nmistakes? If, in fact, you have made a pledge--and they have \nrepeatedly--to cover all legitimate costs, let us finally take steps to \nmake that pledge binding. BP is a very large company that has made $150 \nbillion in net profits over the last 10 years, averaging $15 billion a \nyear. This company made $6 billion in net profits in the first quarter \nof this year. It is time to say to that company: If you are serious and \nyour commitment is real, then let's make a binding commitment.\n  I believe we ought to ask BP to put $10 billion in a gulf coast \nrecovery fund now, and that fund ought to be the result of a signed \nagreement between our government and BP. That signed agreement ought to \ncreate a special master and a special counselor from BP working \ntogether to disperse funds from that $10 billion which will be the \nfirst tranche of funds that likely will be necessary to respond to this \noilspill.\n  As I speak, there are people standing on a dock in a small town on \nthe gulf and they have a fishing boat at the end of a pier that is \ngoing nowhere because there is no fishing to be done. They have to make \na payment on that boat at the end of this month. Also, there is likely \na small cafe on that pier and the people who put their life savings \ninto that don't have any customers. Who is going to help them? Who is \ngoing to respond to their needs, and when? It is time, in my judgment--\npast the time--for us to make this commitment that BP has said they \nwill pledge a binding commitment.\n  The initiation of that, in my judgment--I have written to the Justice \nDepartment. I hope very much they will initiate that effort to do this. \nIf BP says, You know what, no, we are just going to give you a pledge, \nI would say we have seen that pledge and heard that pledge before, and \nlong after people are dead. I am talking about Exxon Valdez. A company \nthat was still objecting to paying, despite the fact they made the same \npledge.\n  I want BP to make that pledge binding, and that can be done I believe \ncontractually through our government and BP by establishing a gulf \ncoast recovery fund. Placing the first $10 billion into that fund and \nhaving a special master and counselor be in charge of that fund in \norder to respond to those people out on the dock who are wondering: How \ndo I make my payment? How do I make my living? What do I do tomorrow, \nnext week, next month?\n  This is a very important issue, and I hope in the coming days the \nadministration and the Congress will be able to address this.\n  Let me make one final point. I know there are people trying to create \nother issues from this disaster in the gulf. This President, President \nObama, did not punch that hole in the planet, he didn't drill that \nwell, and he can't cap that well. The fact is he, his administration, \nand others have done everything possible.\n  This morning I met with Dr. Tom Hunter. I don't know whether people \nknow Dr. Tom Hunter. He is the head of Sandia National Laboratory. He \nis one of the extraordinary minds, one of the really interesting people \nin this country. Dr. Tom Hunter had some health issues some many months \nago, but I will tell my colleagues where he has spent his last 51 days. \nHe, as a part of a group with the other best thinkers in this country, \nhas been called by this administration to represent the core of \ncompetent people to try to figure out how to address this issue. When I \nheard Dr. Hunter was working on this with Dr. Steve Chu, the Energy \nSecretary, Ken Salazar and so many others, I told the Secretary of the \nInterior this morning: You know what, you look like you need 10, 12 \nhours of sleep.\n  I said: That doesn't mean you look awful; I just know how weary it \nhas been working every day for 51 days. This administration has tried \nvery hard, and they are continuing to try. The fact is, there are a lot \nof people playing politics with this oilspill. We don't need to point \nfingers. We need to\n\n[[Page S4723]]\n\ngather together and join hands and understand this was a national \ndisaster, and the consequences of it will be with us for a long time.\n  Now our first responsibility is simply to work together to figure out \nhow to shut off this gusher. Second, how do we deal with the problems \nthat exist for so many people as a result? How do we begin the process \nof trying to clean up the environmental damage it has done? Third, it \nis quite clear to me things aren't going to change with respect to \noffshore drilling.\n  We need oil production. Thirty percent of our domestic production \ncomes from offshore drilling. Perhaps there is a difference between \nshallow water and deep water production. There will be changes in \nregulations and in approaches. All of that is necessary. But first and \nforemost, we need to stop this gusher and then begin work to find a way \nto address the needs of so many people who have lost hope and their \nlivelihoods. We can do that.\n  Let me just say again that this administration has done everything it \ncan, and it continues to do that. I am pleased to see Dr. Hunter and so \nmany of the others with the best minds in America brought together, \nbrought to bear on this issue. If this gusher can be stopped--and it \nwill be--it will be because some of the best people in the country have \nworked 51 days overtime trying to find a way to address this very \nsignificant disaster.\n  I apologize to my colleague for the waiting. I will perhaps come back \nagain if Mr. Traverse from the Cayman Islands wishes to send additional \ninformation out about the Ugland House. Maybe I should visit the Ugland \nHouse, if it is not too crowded with the 18,857 companies calling it \nhome. But that is perhaps for another speech and another day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I enjoy it very much and I learn a lot \nevery time the Senator from North Dakota gets up to speak. There is no \none in this body who better states the issues I am concerned about than \nhe does. This house in the Cayman Islands--maybe we should take a codel \ndown there. Also, his comments on the gulf are absolutely right on \npoint. Not only am I not disturbed, I enjoyed the opportunity to hear \nhim speak once again.\n\n\n                    In Praise of Judge Timothy Rice\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today to recognize another of \nour Nation's great Federal employees.\n  Since first embarking on this series over a year ago, I have honored \nso many dedicated public employees from across the executive branch. I \nhave shared the stories of some who work in the legislative branch as \nwell. Today, it is my distinct privilege to highlight an outstanding \npublic servant from the Federal judiciary.\n  Ever since the First Congress passed the Judiciary Act of 1789, one \nof the hallmarks of American life has been our fair and independent \njudicial system. Indeed, our courts have long been the envy of the \nworld and a model for other nations.\n  It has been an honor to serve on the Judiciary Committee and to \nparticipate in the confirmation of Federal judges. Over the past year \nin office and in my many years of working as chief of staff for the \nformer Judiciary chairman, Joe Biden, I have met so many highly \nqualified judges.\n  America's Federal judges have, at times, faced great danger. From \nthose who served on the frontier in the 19th century to those who today \nface ever-increasing threats from angry litigants and others, Federal \njudges honor us all through selfless devotion to duty.\n  Although they come from diverse backgrounds, judges must all share a \ndedication to justice and the law. For so many, these are truly a \npassion. They don their robes each day inspired by the biblical \npronouncement: ``justice, justice, you shall pursue.''\n  The great Federal employee I am honoring today serves as a magistrate \njudge for the district court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. \nThat court falls under the jurisdiction of the Third Circuit, which \nalso covers Delaware.\n  Judge Timothy Rice has been a Federal magistrate judge since 2005. \nBefore coming to the bench, Tim spent 17 years working for the Justice \nDepartment as an assistant U.S. attorney. He served as chief of the \nEastern District's financial crimes section from 1995-1997 and later as \nchief of the public corruption section from 1997-2002. In his last 3 \nyears as an assistant U.S. attorney, Tim served as chief of the \ncriminal division.\n  While obtaining his law degree magna cum laude from Temple \nUniversity, he held the position of editor-in-chief of the Temple Law \nReview. After graduating he clerked for Judge Anthony Scirica of the \nThird Circuit Court of Appeals.\n  Before attending law school, Tim worked for 4 years as a news \nreporter for the Observer-Dispatch in Utica, NY.\n  Despite his busy schedule presiding over a wide range of criminal and \ncivil matters, Tim makes time to give back to his community and his \ncountry. He has taught courses at the Temple University School of Law \nsince 1990, and he was appointed last year by Chief Justice John \nRoberts to serve on the Advisory Committee on Federal Rules of Criminal \nProcedure of the U.S. Judicial Conference.\n  Tim volunteers his time with a number of charitable Catholic \norganizations, such as the St. Vincent De Paul Society and \nResponseAbility. He also works with Philadelphia Reads, a literacy \nmentorship program for second grade students.\n  As a magistrate judge, Tim cofounded the Supervision to Aid Re-entry \nor ``STAR'' program to help reduce recidivism among ex-offenders. Not \nonly has the 3-year-old STAR program helped dozens of ex-offenders make \na smoother transition back into society, it has also saved the Federal \nprison system an estimated $380,000. With volunteers from the court \nsystem, the Philadelphia Bar Association, and area law schools, as well \nas support from local charitable organizations, the STAR program \nmentors ex-offenders to finish high school or college, find employment, \nand avoid a return to crime. Thanks in large part to Tim's commitment, \nenergy, and vision, the STAR model is being replicated elsewhere around \nthe country.\n  Tim and his wife Elaine have passed on a love of public service to \ntheir daughters, Meghan and Courtney, who work for the State Department \nand have been assigned to numerous overseas posts since 2005, including \nwar-time service by both in Iraq. Their youngest daughter, Caitlin, \njust graduated from the College of Charleston.\n  Judge Timothy Rice is just one of hundreds of Federal judges across \nthe Nation working day in and day out to fulfill the promise of our \nConstitution's preamble to ``establish justice'' throughout this land. \nI hope my colleagues will join me in thanking him and all those serving \nin the Federal judiciary for their tireless work to protect our lives \nand our liberties. They are all truly great Federal employees.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). Without objection, \nit is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Resolution of Disapproval\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, pending before us on the floor is the bill \nfrom the Senate Finance Committee, the extenders bill relating to the \nTax Code, but I would like to address an issue which is to come before \nthe Senate tomorrow. It is an issue that rarely comes here under a \nprocedure that was designed to give Congress a voice in the \ndetermination of regulations and rules promulgated by a President and \nthe administration.\n  The Senate has entered into a unanimous consent agreement to consider \nS.J. Res. 26 tomorrow, which would disapprove of the Environmental \nProtection Agency's endangerment. As a result of this action by the \nSenate, if we\n\n[[Page S4724]]\n\nvote, we will vote in disapproval of this endangerment. The EPA's \naction was in response to a Supreme Court order that it make a \ndetermination about whether greenhouse gases as pollutants could be \nreasonably anticipated to endanger public health or welfare.\n  This is an interesting story because it began with a question that \nwas posed to Carol Browner, then head of the Environmental Protection \nAgency under President Bill Clinton. As I was told the story, the \nRepublican leader in the House, Tom DeLay, asked Carol Browner of the \nEPA whether the Clean Air Act covered greenhouse gases, and she said \nshe would have to get back to him because that particular question had \nnever been directly asked or answered. After long study, she replied in \nthe affirmative, which was not the reply the gentleman from Texas was \nexpecting. This led to a flurry of lawsuits and questions because it \nreally raised the question as to whether greenhouse gases, as we know \nthem, going into the atmosphere are dangerous to the health and safety \nof people living on Earth and particularly here in the United States.\n  The EPA studied this for a long period of time. The Supreme Court \nconsidered this case, as to whether the Clean Air Act applied to \ngreenhouse gases, and ultimately concluded that it did but left it to \nthe EPA to make the final determination as to whether in fact these \ngreenhouse gases were dangerous. The EPA responded to the direction \nprovided by the Supreme Court by proposing to find that the emission of \nsix greenhouse gases--carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, \nhydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluorides--\nthreatened the public health and welfare of current and future \ngenerations and the combined emissions of these same gases from new \nmotor vehicles and motor vehicle engines contribute to the atmospheric \nconcentrations of these greenhouse gases and hence the threat of \nclimate change.\n  So, literally, tomorrow the Senate will be debating and voting on the \nquestion of climate change and whether greenhouse gases in fact are \ndangerous to the environment and the health and safety of people living \nin the United States. This has been a long, torturous process that led \nus to this moment. But the resolution being offered by the Senator from \nAlaska, Ms. Murkowski, would basically ask the Senate to find against \nthe scientific findings linking greenhouse gases and climate change. \nThe judgment of the EPA was based on scientific findings that showed \nthat the concentration of greenhouse gases is at unprecedented levels \ncompared to the recent and distant past; the effects of climate changed \nobserved to date and projected to occur in the future will have impacts \non public health and welfare; and the emissions of greenhouse gases \nfrom on-road vehicles regulated by the Clean Air Act contribute to \nclimate change.\n  There are those who deny the connection between greenhouse gases and \nwhat is happening to the Earth, the world in which we live. There are \nsome who do not believe in climate change, they do not believe in \nglobal warming, and they are very vocal in their positions.\n  I have had many groups come to see me on the issue from my State of \nIllinois. Many of them are farmers, agricultural groups, and I have \nmade a point of asking these farmers--as they tell me they oppose any \ntype of efforts to control carbon, to tax it or measure it in the \nfuture--a very basic question: Do you believe human activity on Earth \nis leading to changes in the world we live in--climate changes, the \nmelting of glaciers, different problems with pollution, public health \nissues, asthma, lung problems? And I have been surprised, at least \ninitially, to find that none of them believed it--not one. Three--after \nI asked this repeatedly--three said they had some questions about it, \nbut not one said they believed it; that human activity was changing the \nworld in which we live. I said to them: It is very difficult for us to \nhave a conversation let alone a debate about this issue if you don't \nbuy the premise, if you don't buy the starting point that things we are \ndoing--the way we live, the way we produce electricity, the way we move \nfrom one place to another--create pollution which changes the Earth.\n\n  This resolution by Senator Murkowski basically takes the same \nposition: that the Environmental Protection Agency's finding that these \ngreenhouse gases are a danger to us in the future and now is wrong. The \nEPA did not reach this conclusion lightly, as to whether there was a \nconnection between greenhouse gases and the safety and health of people \nliving on Earth. They had over 380,000 public comments they elicited \nfor this work.\n  The EPA endangerment finding has been supported not only by their \nconclusions but peer-reviewed literature in the work of the \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Proceedings of the \nNational Academy of Sciences. For the Senate to decide tomorrow that \ngreenhouse gases do not pose a danger to our environment or our own \nhealth is comparable to the Senate voting against gravity, saying \nbasically we are going to disagree with the scientific conclusion on \ngravity.\n  I could argue without gravity the space program would be a lot \ncheaper. But the fact is, gravity is a scientific finding backed up by \nvirtually everyone. Here we have a scientific finding backed up by the \nNational Academy of Sciences, and the Senator from Alaska is going to \nask us to vote tomorrow to reject it--the Senate to reject it. We will \nstand in judgment of these scientists and find they are wrong.\n  By what authority could we reach that conclusion? They have gone \nthrough this long process of concluding that greenhouse gas emissions \nendanger the planet we live on and our lives in the future. They have \nsuggested we need to take that into consideration when we talk about \nthe fuels we burn in the future, the way we generate electricity in the \nfuture, and start making plans to improve fuel efficiency, energy \nefficiency, to reduce the dangers associated with this.\n  I think this is an important vote, maybe a historic vote. It is also \ninteresting who supports the position of Senator Murkowski that we \nbasically reject the sound science behind the EPA position. It is a \nposition backed by many groups but particularly supported by big oil. \nThe big oil companies are concerned about the impact of measuring \ngreenhouse gas emissions and carbon emissions on the environment \nbecause it directly impacts the product they create and produce and \nsell.\n  Here we are in the midst of an environmental disaster in the Gulf of \nMexico brought on by one of the biggest oil companies on Earth, and we \nare now going to consider in the Senate a Murkowski resolution that is \nsupported by the same big oil interests asking us to reject the finding \nby the EPA that greenhouse gas emissions do pose a danger to our \nenvironment and the people living in the United States.\n  I say to my colleagues, tomorrow I hope they will think long and hard \nabout this vote. This is not just another vote about another political \nissue. The credibility of the Senate is at issue. If we are going to \nstand in judgment of these scientific findings and reject them, then I \nthink we will at least subject ourselves to a level of criticism that \nwe have not accepted basic and sound science as it has been developed.\n  There are many groups supporting the Murkowski resolution. I \nmentioned big oil. But there are many groups that oppose the Murkowski \nresolution. Among them are the American Academy of Pediatrics, the \nChildren's Environmental Health Network, the American Nurses \nAssociation, the American Lung Association, Public Health Association, \nPhysicians for Social Responsibility, the Association of Schools of \nPublic Health, Union of Concerned Scientists--the list goes on and on.\n  It is interesting, too, that automobile manufacturers oppose the \nMurkowski effort to reject the science behind greenhouse gas emissions. \nAn alliance of automobile manufacturers and 11 member companies have \nwritten to us expressing concern over the Murkowski resolution that \nwould overturn the EPA's endangerment finding on greenhouse gas \nemissions.\n\n       . . . if these resolutions are enacted into law, the \n     historic agreement creating the One National Program for \n     regulating vehicle fuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions \n     would collapse.\n\n  They are, of course, referring to an agreement which is trying to \nmove toward more fuel-efficient vehicles and vehicles that pollute \nless. An agreement is being reached. Most Americans\n\n[[Page S4725]]\n\nwould agree that is a good thing. But the basis for agreeing it is a \ngood thing is the belief that what is coming out of your tailpipe is \nnot necessarily good for the world we live in, and if we can reduce the \ngreenhouse gas emissions by moving toward hybrid engines, electric \ncars, getting better mileage in cars we do use, it is a good thing for \nthe American owning the car--they buy less fuel oil--and it is a good \nthing for the environment because there are fewer emissions.\n  If the Murkowski resolution prevails, we are rejecting the scientific \nbasis for believing that what comes out of your tailpipe can be harmful \nto the world in which we live. That is a position which is hard to \nunderstand and difficult to explain.\n  The auto workers have written to us asking us to vote against the \nMurkowski resolution, saying they are very concerned that such a vote \n``would unravel the historic agreement on one national standard for \nfuel economy and greenhouse gas emissions.''\n  We have had EPA Administrators from Presidents, both Democratic and \nRepublican--under Nixon, Ford, and Reagan--who oppose the Murkowski \nresolution: Russell Train, William Ruckelshaus, many faith groups, a \nlong list of environmental groups, and key stakeholders who oppose this \nMurkowski resolution. The list goes on and on.\n  It will be an interesting vote tomorrow to see if this Senate, this \nhistoric and traditional body, will be looking forward to the future \nand realizing if we do not take better care of the world we live in, we \nwill not be leaving as clean a world, as safe a world to our children \nin the future.\n  The Murkowski resolution says ignore the science, ignore the \nfindings, and ignore the responsibility we face to do something about \nthis problem. I think that is clearly a move in the wrong direction, \nand I hope my colleagues will reject this resolution when it comes \nbefore us tomorrow.\n  There are some who have argued if we do not pass the Murkowski \nresolution the EPA will start regulating just about everything in \nsight. When my farmers come here and start worrying about the tractors \nthey drive in the fields, I wonder if they have taken a close look at \nwhat the EPA rule has suggested.\n  There are approximately 900 currently regulated facilities, and the \nEPA estimates there will be about 550 more that would be affected by \nthis rule. No small farms, restaurants, or midsize commercial \nfacilities emit enough carbon to be regulated by the EPA. Many of these \nentities have been frightened by people who have been exaggerating the \nreach of the EPA or their interest in this particular issue.\n  When you look at the phase-in called for by the EPA, they are dealing \nwith the largest emitters of pollution in our country. What I think it \ndoes is, unfortunately, make the debate somewhat distorted to suggest \nit is going to apply to a farmer or small businessperson because the \nEPA's schedule and rules do not.\n  The alternative of doing nothing is unacceptable from my point of \nview. I do believe, sadly, things are changing for the worse in many \nrespects when it comes to the environment of the world in which we \nlive. I do believe there has been, as the EPA has found, an increase in \ngreenhouse gas emissions and accumulation of those emissions in the \nenvironment which have had a negative impact on the world.\n  I have seen the photos--most everyone has--about the warming of this \nEarth. Although there are clearly days and weeks when we have a lot of \ncold weather--we had it in Washington--we know on average the \ntemperature of the world we live in is going up. As it does, things \nchange: glaciers melt, there is more water in the oceans, currents \nchange, the temperature of the water that moves around the world \nchanges, and climate patterns start to change as well.\n\n  We need to do something about it. Voting for the Murkowski resolution \nis a step in the wrong direction. It basically says we are walking away \nfrom our responsibility, a responsibility which, though it is \npolitically difficult, I think is a responsibility we must face because \nthe science and our human experience lead us to that conclusion.\n  I know it is going to mean some changes in the world. I come from a \nState where there is a lot of coal. That coal is a source of a lot of \nenergy. But it also could be the source of a lot of pollution. There \nare ways to deal with it.\n  I see the Senator from Missouri on the Senate floor. He and I have \ncome together, not on every issue but at least on the notion of carbon \nsequestration. The idea is to take the emissions from an electric \npowerplant using coal, for example, and pipe them deep into the earth \nwell below any surface where they could escape. I think this is one of \nthe technologies, one of the scientific processes that should be \nresearched as a possibility.\n  Let me conclude, because I see my colleague on the floor, by urging \nmy colleagues to oppose the Murkowski resolution tomorrow. This \nresolution wants to basically reject scientific findings that have been \nbacked up across the world. It would subject this body to not only \ncriticism but maybe even ridicule for us to step away from basic \nscientific findings which have linked the activities of humans on Earth \nand a change in the Earth in which we live. We need to accept that \nbasic premise and accept that basic responsibility.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to make some remarks on this \nextenders bill now before us. It would seem to me, from what I have \nheard as I traveled this past week, that Americans want to send a very \nclear message to Washington. They have had enough of runaway spending, \nexploding debt, the bailouts, and the job-killing policies coming out \nof this Congress and this administration.\n  Unfortunately, with the bill on the floor now, it is clear that \nWashington, or most of it, has stopped listening to the American \npeople. This bill is supposed to be about getting job creators some \ncertainty that temporary tax benefits they rely on to retain workers \nwill continue to be there. Instead, it seems Democrats cannot resist \nthe opportunity to use this bill to expand the debt and extend the \ngovernment reach because this $126 billion baby does all of the above. \nIt is loaded up with unrelated spending that has nothing to do with \nextending necessary benefits and creating jobs. It is not fully paid \nfor and would add another $78.7 billion to the debt.\n  With the national debt at now a whopping $13 trillion, the American \npeople have said enough. Our children and grandchildren, if they were \nhere, would say: Don't put any more on our credit cards. Our debt is \nnow at an unprecedented $13 trillion for the first time in history. \nThis is no small milestone.\n  Make no mistake, the next crisis our Nation must deal with is the \nexploding debt crisis that is upon us. I believe Chairman Bernanke \nreferred to that today.\n  I support the provisions in this bill that would give our small \nbusinesses, our job creators, the security that longstanding tax \nbenefits they are counting on will continue. I also support extending \nnecessary benefits such as the Medicare reimbursements to keep doctors \nsupplying Medicare patients with health care. This was left out of the \nObamaCare bill to make it look not as expensive as it really was. But \nwe need to pay for that.\n  The difference between our view on this side of the aisle and that of \nthose on the other side of the aisle is that we should pay for \ntemporary tax extensions with reductions and cuts in spending, not with \npermanent tax increases. We want to pay for necessary benefits with \ncuts now, not saddle our children and grandchildren with even more debt \ndown the road.\n  I believe most of my colleagues on this side of the aisle agree. Like \nme, many Republicans support some of the provisions buried in this \nboondoggle of a bill. In fact, many of these provisions would easily \nsail through the Senate, but Democrats continue to bury these \nprovisions in massive spending bills such as the ones before us, \ncompelling anyone who cares about our Nation's fiscal health to vote \nno. Americans are demanding that we say no, that we put an end to the \nWashington-gone-wild policies.\n  They have had enough spending, tax increases, debt, bailout, \ngovernment overreaching, and job-killing policies.\n\n[[Page S4726]]\n\nRight now it appears that the majority is not listening. This bill \ncontains provisions that will severely curtail the ability of U.S. \nbusinesses that operate internationally, and will drive countless more \njobs and corporate headquarters overseas at a time when we should be \nfocusing on job creation and improving the competitiveness of the \nUnited States.\n  These tax increases are a step in the wrong direction. The President \nhas even said we are going to have an economic recovery driven by \nexports. Well, he has not stepped up and said we need to do free trade \nagreements which would do that; free trade with Colombia, South Korea, \nPanama.\n  This bill, by taxing the people who go overseas to create the \nopportunity for more exports of American goods, will obviously destroy \nour ability and lessen our ability to export more. As a technical \nmatter, six of the eight international tax increases in the extenders \nbill have not even been considered in the committee. Two of the eight \nwere in the President's Greenbook. The other six were only publicly \nbounced out for the first time May 20. This is $14.5 billion of tax \nincreases over the next 10 years.\n  Let me point out, as I have traveled overseas and looked at job \ncreation, I have been stunned to see that America is one of only two \ncountries that taxes businesses overseas and taxes them at home. Most \nother countries which are growing in their export and their influence \noverseas do not tax double.\n  Well, we are taxing double and we are increasing those taxes now. \nSeveral of the international tax increases are retroactive tax \nincreases. Many companies, in their reports with the SEC for the \nbenefit of the investing public, have already claimed financial \nstatement benefit for certain foreign tax credits they have already \nearned but for which they have not yet claimed credit.\n  The retroactive tax increases affect companies that have already \nclaimed credit for the tax credits to which they were entitled. They \nhave been treated properly as money in the bank. This extenders bill \nwould cause such companies to lose the credits, issue earnings \nrestatements and perhaps even lay off U.S. employees.\n  These international tax increases are permanent changes to the \nInternal Revenue Code, meant to pay for 1 year of temporary provisions \nin the Internal Revenue Code, a real mismatch. And how will the \nextenders be paid for next year?\n  Some on the other side may say these tax increases are necessary to \npreserve American jobs or keep business in America. Well, I can tell \nyou firsthand that is not the way it works. If you say that, you do not \nunderstand economics and international business.\n  I have made many statements on this floor and written a book about \nhow the best foreign policy we can have is export and foreign \ninvestment from this country. It is vitally important as a foreign \npolicy imperative, but also, I have seen firsthand that investment \noverseas not only creates wealth overseas, but it brings more exports \nfrom the United States, creating more jobs here. So it is a win-win for \nboth countries.\n  Foreign countries where we want to strengthen their economy are \ncrying for investments and for more of our exports because that is how \nwe can help them grow. But these tax increases make it less likely that \nAmerican businesses will hire, that American businesses will grow. \nInstead, Germany, India, and Chinese companies, Australia, and the \nBritish will outcompete us. They will be hiring more as they grow \noverseas and as we shrink. This is not the way we should move forward \nin job creation.\n  You may say there are reforms needed in the international tax arena, \nbut I think the biggest reform is to put us back on the same footing as \nmost other countries in the world that do not tax overseas. Why are we \nthe only ones? We are one of only two that do it. Does it make good \neconomic sense to penalize productive investment abroad which brings \nback profits, capital, and export opportunities here at home? That is \njust one. That is a $14\\1/2\\ billion job killer.\n  Another $14 billion job killer is on entrepreneurs, the people who \nare creating jobs and need to have venture capital. This is designed to \ncut the ability of venture capital groups to put together the money you \nneed for researchers or inventors who are creating jobs. I happen to be \nvery interested in this, because my State of Missouri has tremendous \nresearch in universities and in organizations such as the Danforth \nPlant Science Center coming up with innovation in agricultural \nbiotechnology that can provide better food, better products, \npharmaceuticals, improve the environment, and improve the well being of \npeople around the world. But there is a big jump between having \nsomething in the lab that may work and getting it out in sufficient \nquantity to supply the Nation and the world. Under the current law, \nentrepreneurs have a clear signal to take risks on investments in \npartnerships. The signal is this: They pay a 15-percent tax if they put \ntheir time and effort to bring money and ideas together and make it \nworkable. They have to pay a 15-percent tax when it becomes valuable \nenough to sell.\n  That clear signal incentivizes the flow of capital into startup and \nother ventures. You cut that off and we are going to see venture \ncapital-driven new business opportunities disappear. What are we \nthinking about? Let's go back.\n  The No. 1 concern of Missourians, of Americans, is creating jobs. \nThese are the jobs of the 21st century. We are losing lots of jobs of \nthe 20th century. We have to replace them with the jobs of the 21st \ncentury. That is where venture capital comes in working with \nentrepreneurs, working with researchers, bringing together the business \nacumen, the business skill to get these good ideas into provable \nproducts in the marketplace and supply the needs of the people in the \nworld.\n  Unfortunately, the majority and the Obama administration want to \nraise that rate to 33 percent in a little over 6 months. This 33-\npercent hit is set to be augmented by an additional tax hike on the \npart of the partnership gain attributable to carried interest. It means \nthere is a double whammy coming at startups and other business entities \nseeking capital to grow and, by the way, not incidentally, primarily \ncreate jobs.\n  We want jobs. Stop the idea of taxing people who are going to create \njobs. Rule 1, if you want more of something, tax it less. If you want \nless of something, tax it more. We want less jobs. That is the message \nthis substitute sends. The double whammy on startups and other \nbusinesses would mean that almost half that carried interest, that is \nnow capital gain, would be treated as ordinary income. So with ordinary \nrates set to rise to almost 40 percent, which will help kill small \nbusinesses, it means two-thirds of that carried interest would be \nalmost 40 percent. That is a lot worse deal. That is the kind of thing \nthis country cannot afford when we need jobs. Even though many in the \nbusiness sector said they want some of the extenders, the temporary \nextenders the bill includes, research and development and other things, \nthey do not want them if the price of getting them is these \ninternational tax increases.\n  Those opposing the bill include the Chamber of Commerce, the Business \nRoundtable, the National Foreign Trade Council, the National \nAssociation of Manufacturers, the Information Technology Council, IBM, \nand Microsoft. You can see that the innovative companies in our country \nknow this is going to shrink their business if these tax increases go \nforward and it is going to cut both in international exports and to \nstartup venture capital.\n  This goes back to what the Gallup poll has shown, that only 16 \npercent of Americans approve of the job Congress is doing, and 80 \npercent disapprove. If you poll those who will lose their jobs, the \ndisapproval rate would be even higher.\n  I believe the only way to restore America's confidence in elected \nofficials, particularly in this body, is to prove we are listening. The \nfolks in my home State of Missouri, like most Americans, want Congress \nand the President to quit treating their hard-earned tax dollars like \nMonopoly money. The folks in Missouri want me to vote no and oppose any \neffort to pile more debt on our children and grandchildren, and to \noppose efforts that would tax exports and job-creating investments in \nsmall and growing businesses.\n  I have heard. I am listening. I want to act on it. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me.\n\n[[Page S4727]]\n\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Health Care Campaign\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, here we are the day after some elections \nin various States around the country. I think everybody will draw their \nown conclusion as a result of those elections, but it is hard to \ndispute the assertion that the so-called tea party candidates did \nrather well in the elections around the country.\n  Those people who believe the disconnect between themselves and their \nneighbors and their fellow citizens and what we do here in our Nation's \ncapital is clearly disconnected. The anger and dissatisfaction \ncontinues to be displayed in poll after poll and election after \nelection. And why are they so upset?\n  Well, our national debt has just surpassed $13 trillion for the first \ntime. We now, this morning, in a prediction, have predictions that it \nwill surpass $19 trillion in 5 years.\n  In the first 206 years of this Nation's existence, we were able to \naccumulate a national debt of $1 trillion. Now it is going to take us 5 \nyears to add $4 more trillion, up to $19 trillion. So what is the \nresponse now by the administration and my colleagues across the aisle? \nAnother bill that addresses $10, $20, $30, $40, $50, $100 billion \nadditional to the debt and, of course, not paid for. And here we are, \nafter spending a good part of a $787 billion stimulus package, where we \nwere promised and assured that if we passed that the maximum \nunemployment in the United States would be 8 percent. As we all know, \nit is now at 9.7 percent, with the latest job information with a paltry \n41,000 new jobs, and 400,000 temporary government Census jobs.\n  So is it surprising to anyone that there is great anger and \ndissatisfaction throughout the country? We seem to be not just tone \ndeaf but deaf, which brings me to the issue of the so-called health \ncare reform.\n  CBO recently came forward and said, the real cost of the reform in \nits new authorization is over $1 trillion, something we were assured at \nthe time, in the year-long debate, that it would not be over $1 \ntrillion. It will cost over $2.6 trillion over its first 10 years of \nfull implementation.\n  I guess there was the assumption that either the American people \nwould forget the debate that was held here in the Congress or would \nforget these promises were made about the benefits of health care \nreform, but they were wrong. Recent polls show that about 60 percent of \nthe American people still oppose the legislation that was passed \nthrough the Congress and signed by the President, to great fanfare.\n  In the immortal words of the Speaker of the House, who said, ``We \nhave to pass the bill so that you can find out what is in it,'' the \nAmerican people are finding out what is in it, including medical device \nmakers who assert that the new tax on them will cost jobs because of a \n2.3-percent excise tax on companies that supply medical devices such as \nheart defibrillators and surgical tools to hospitals. It will cost an \nestimated $20 billion. The list of taxes goes on and on.\n  The response of those on the other side of the aisle is to launch a \n$125 million health campaign. They will spend an estimated $25 million \na year over 5 years so that, quoting from a Politico story:\n\n       The extraordinary campaign, which could provide an \n     unprecedented amount of cover for a White House in a policy \n     debate, reflects urgency among Democrats to explain, defend \n     and depoliticize health care reform now that people are \n     beginning to feel the new law's effects.\n\n  Interesting--$125 million.\n  To do its bit, the Medicare people have decided to spend--because we \nhave lots of money; there are no worries--$18 million--chicken feed--in \nMedicare funds to send a mailer to Medicare beneficiaries. The flier is \nentitled ``Medicare and the New Health Care Law, What it Means for \nYou.'' It was sent to 43 million Medicare beneficiaries under the guise \nof explaining how the new law will impact them. However, the brochure \ngoes into great detail about provisions of the law that do not even \napply to seniors and leaves out any mention of the cuts they will face. \nFor example, 330,000 of my fellow citizens in Arizona are enjoying a \nprogram called Medicare Advantage. Medicare Advantage does what the \ngovernment doesn't want our Medicare recipients to do, and that is to \ngive people choices on dental care, eyeglasses, other decisions they \nwould make. Of course, those people will see the Medicare Advantage \nprogram, which is very popular, dismantled under this law.\n  The flier and the President point out that over $500 billion in \nMedicare cuts could jeopardize seniors' health care, forcing millions \nto pay more. The cuts, according to the Obama administration's own \nMedicare actuaries, will lead to 7.4 million Medicare beneficiaries \nlosing their health plan because of the $206 billion in cuts to \nMedicare Advantage. The CBO estimates that Medicare prescription drug \ncoverage premiums will increase by 9 percent as a result of that law.\n  I look forward to continuing this debate with the President and my \nfriends. He took time out from his musical evenings to have a health \ncare townhall yesterday to talk about this great benefit to the \nAmerican people that his legislation has brought. Unfortunately, \nseniors and the American people are not fooled.\n  I quote from a Wall Street Journal article of May 28, 2010:\n\n       In the full-circle department, recall the moment last \n     September when Senator Max Baucus and Medicare went after the \n     insurer Humana for having the nerve to criticize one part of \n     ObamaCare. It turns out those same regulators have different \n     standards for their own political advocacy.\n       This week Medicare sent a flyer to seniors, ostensibly to \n     inform them of what ObamaCare ``means for you.'' Many elderly \n     Americans are worried--and rightly so--about where they'll \n     rank in national health care, given that the new entitlement \n     is funded by nearly a half-trillion dollars in Medicare cuts. \n     They must have been relieved to hear that ``The Affordable \n     Care Act passed by Congress and signed by President Obama \n     this year will provide you and your family greater savings \n     and increased quality health care.''\n       That's the first sentence of the four-page mailer, and it \n     gives a flavor of the Administration's respect for the \n     public's intelligence. It goes on to mention ``improvements \n     to Medicare Advantage,'' the program that Democrats hate \n     because it gives nearly one out of four seniors private \n     health insurance options. ``If you are in a Medicare \n     Advantage plan, you will still receive guaranteed Medicare \n     benefits.''\n       But that's not what Medicare's own actuary thinks. In an \n     April memo, Richard Foster estimated that the $206 billion \n     hole in Advantage will reduce benefits, cause insurers to \n     withdraw from the program and reduce overall enrollment by \n     half. Doug Elmendorf and his team at the Congressional Budget \n     Office came to the same conclusion, as did every other honest \n     expert.\n\n  I don't know if my colleagues will recall, but the first amendment we \nhad proposed from this side when the bill came to the floor was to \nprohibit cuts in Medicare. Now we are seeing that there will be a $206 \nbillion hole in Medicare Advantage that will reduce benefits and cause \ninsurers to withdraw from the program and reduce overall enrollment by \nhalf, just as we predicted on the floor of the Senate.\n  I look forward to coming back to the floor with my friend from \nTennessee and others as we continue this debate. Perhaps we should have \nbeen discussing it more all along. I can assure my colleagues, from the \nmany townhall meetings I am having all over the State of Arizona, the \npeople of Arizona, especially those in programs such as Medicare \nAdvantage and others, are deeply concerned and deeply skeptical.\n  Our proposal still remains valid. Starting next January, we will make \nevery effort to repeal and replace because we cannot lay this burden on \nfuture generations of Americans.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Arizona for his leadership \nand for his thoughtful comments on the health care law. We fought those \nbattles last year. We won the argument but lost the vote. That is not \nso good for the country, as our country is now finding out.\n  I am one of those 40 million Americans who are eligible for Medicare, \nwho received that brochure in the mail last week. I spoke about it \nyesterday. I\n\n[[Page S4728]]\n\nfound it very disingenuous and misleading and unfortunate.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Alexander pertaining to the introduction of S. \n3470 are located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4325 to Amendment No. 4301\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up \namendment No. 4325.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside.\n  The clerk will report the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Roberts] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4325 to amendment No. 4301.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To exempt pediatric medical devices from the medical device \n                      tax, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the end of title VI, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. EXEMPTION FOR PEDIATRIC MEDICAL DEVICES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Paragraph (2) of section 4191(b) of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is amended by striking ``and'' \n     at the end of subparagraph (C), by redesignating subparagraph \n     (D) as subparagraph (E), and by inserting after subparagraph \n     (C) the following new subparagraph:\n       ``(D) medical devices primarily designed to be used by or \n     for pediatric patients, and''.\n       (b) Expansion of Affordability Exception to Individual \n     Mandate.--Section 5000A(e)(1)(A) of the Internal Revenue Code \n     of 1986 is amended by striking ``8 percent'' and inserting \n     ``5 percent''.\n\n  Mr. ROBERTS. Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have \nreached an understanding that this amendment will be a side-by-side \namendment to the amendment offered by Senator Cardin. So at the time it \nwould be considered we would have the vote.\n  Mr. President, included in the $\\1/2\\ trillion of new taxes in the \nhealth care reform law is a tax hike of $20 billion on medical devices. \nThat is right. This new law imposes a $20 billion excise tax, a tax of \n2.3 percent, on lifesaving medical devices.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee \non Taxation both confirmed that these excise taxes will not be borne by \nthe medical device industry--will not be borne by the medical device \nindustry. Instead, the tax will be passed on to patients in the form of \nhigher prices and higher insurance premiums.\n  Recognizing that this tax, as initially proposed, was unpopular--\nbecause as written it would have increased taxes on medical devices \nsuch as eyeglasses and hearing aids--the bill was modified to exclude \nthese and other items that are generally purchased by the general \npublic at retail for individual use.\n  Yet even with these exemptions, patients still bear the burden of \nthis new tax. Here are just a few examples of the people who will be \nhit by this new tax and the types of devices that will be taxed. People \nwith disabilities, diabetics, amputees, people with cancer, and those \nwith heart problems are just some of the people who will see their \nhealth care costs go up because of this tax.\n  During debate on the health care bill, I offered amendments to simply \nstrike this unfair tax. Unfortunately, the majority did not approve \nthese amendments. My amendment today prevents this new tax from raising \nthe costs for pediatric medical devices--those devices that treat the \nyoungest in our population: children who have serious or life-\nthreatening illnesses such as cancer or a heart problem. The amendment \nexempts from the excise tax medical devices primarily designed to be \nused by or for pediatric patients.\n  This tax on medical devices is a tax on innovation as well. It harms \nresearch and development that leads to medical advancement. It creates \nan additional burden for medical device manufacturers to develop new \nproducts or to redesign them to meet the specific needs of pediatric \npatients.\n  As the FDA notes on its Web site:\n\n       Designing pediatric medical devices can be challenging: \n     [Obviously] children are often smaller and more active than \n     adults, body structures and functions change throughout \n     childhood, and children may be long-term device users.\n\n  With these challenges and other barriers that exist to the \ndevelopment, approval, and availability of pediatric devices, it seems \nto me--and I think it should be clear to everyone, all of my \ncolleagues--we should not add another barrier by taxing medical device \nmanufacturers who develop and manufacture pediatric devices. Imposing \nthe excise tax on pediatric medical devices will do nothing but slow \ninnovation for these necessary and lifesaving devices.\n  So when innovative and lifesaving technologies are taxed, when the \ncost of many tests increases because the devices used in the tests are \ntaxed, when new devices are not developed, and when fewer manufacturers \nare able to survive in the anticompetitive environment this tax will \ncreate, the consumers of health care will suffer for it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to exempt pediatric \nmedical devices from the excise tax to ensure that the youngest \npatients who need the lifesaving treatment these devices can offer do \nnot have to pay more for that treatment. This is a step in the right \ndirection to correcting the serious flaws in the health care law.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we are hoping to reach an agreement soon \non a procedure during which we can cast votes on various amendments. \nThe first would be an amendment by Mr. Cardin; the next, Mr. Roberts; \nand then the Sessions amendment. At the conclusion of the Sessions \namendment, I think we will then have 40 minutes of debate, and then the \nBaucus amendment and then the Cornyn amendment, but that will be \noutlined much more specifically in a unanimous consent request which I \nthink should be coming fairly quickly.\n  I wish to say a word or two about the Roberts side-by-side amendment \nwith respect to medical devices. I think it is important to remind \nourselves that we are a democracy. Sometimes I think that is forgotten. \nThat is, we are a country of laws. This is a country where we live by \nthe will of the majority, as enacted into law.\n  It used to be that we here in the Senate would air our differences, \nvote, and then move on. I must say that lately, and especially with \nregard to health care reform, many on the other side of the aisle \nappear to be unable to move on. Many on the other side of the aisle \nappear unwilling to accept the results of our legislative process as \nenacted into law and signed by the President. Many on the other side of \nthe aisle appear simply unwilling to accept the new health care law. \nSome come to the floor daily to complain about it and, in a sense, \nrelitigate it. It is already passed. It is the law. For the life of me, \nI don't understand why Senators don't realize that now is the time, \nsince the law has been enacted, to offer constructive remarks to help \nmake sure it works even better. We are here to serve the American \npeople. We are not here to score partisan political points. I think \nmost people at home want the Senate to work to offer ideas to help make \nthe recently enacted health care reform law work even better.\n  So today, unfortunately, we have again an amendment to carve out an \nexception to the medical device fee that helps pay for health care \nreform. This amendment would pay for the loss of revenue by leaving \nmore Americans without health insurance. We are in a situation where if \nwe cut out this medical device provision, then we have to make it up in \nsome way, so this amendment would pay for the lost revenue by leaving \nmore Americans without health insurance.\n  Senator Roberts offered this amendment a few minutes ago, and it \nwould again seek to make changes to the medical device excise tax that \nis set to go into effect in the year 2013. The Senate rejected an \namendment earlier in the year very much like this one. It rejected it \nduring consideration of the\n\n[[Page S4729]]\n\nHealth Reconciliation Act on March 24. We have already been there. We \nvoted on this, not only in the health care reform bill that passed, but \nwe also already voted on this amendment, and the Senate rejected an \namendment very similar to this and rejected it soundly by a vote of 57 \nto 40. Here we are again.\n  But, still, some on the other side of the aisle appear unwilling to \nmove on. So for the same reasons we rejected this amendment in March, \nwe should reject it again today. We should not exempt one set of \nmedical device manufacturers from contributing their fair share toward \nhealth care reform. We should not decrease the number of Americans with \nhealth insurance, which this amendment would do--decrease the number of \nAmericans with health insurance. We should, therefore, reject the \nRoberts amendment.\n  Let me describe the amendment in a little bit more detail. First, the \namendment tries to exclude certain medical device sales from \nassessment. As my colleagues will recall, a fee was placed on various \nproviders to help pay for health care reform, and in virtually every \ncase, the providers agreed to the fee. They would rather not have to \npay a fee, but they agreed to it. They didn't cause a big fuss. Why? \nBecause, as a result, more people would have health insurance, and with \nmore health insurance, providers generally make a little more money. \nWhat they may lose on markup they could make up in volume as more \npeople would have health insurance.\n  Products that consumers will buy at retail are already excluded. \nFurther attempts to exclude devices are attempts to undermine the \nentire medical device policy.\n  The health care reform bill included shared responsibility for all \nhealth care industries. I would remind my colleagues, that was the \nbasic premise of health care reform. We are all in this together. \nShared responsibility. All Americans help share responsibility--\nindividuals, companies, insurance companies, manufacturers, doctors, \nhospitals. It is shared. All Americans share. It is about the only way \nwe could make health care reform work in this country, and reform we \nmust because of all the waste that otherwise occurs in our system. \nThere are some estimates that there is up to 29 percent waste in the \nAmerican health care system. That is a lot of money. We spend about \n$2.5 trillion a year on health care reform and waste in the American \nhealth care system. That is a lot of money. We spend about $2.5 \ntrillion a year on health care reform, and 29 percent comes out to \naround over $800 billion of waste. I am not saying we can get all of \nthat waste out of the system, but I am saying the passage of this \nlegislation will go a long way, in many respects because of its very \nstrong provisions to attack fraud and abuse in Medicaid and Medicare.\n  The health care reform bill included shared responsibility for all \nhealth care industries. Medical device companies pledged to do their \npart. They pledged to do their part, and they must do their part. This \nis particularly true since that industry will see at least 32 million \nmore customers as a result of reform, leading to substantial new \nprofits. The device industry and many other industries in health care \nwill see 32 million more customers as a result of this health care \nreform law we passed, leading to substantial new profits for them.\n  This amendment offered by the Senator from Kansas also seeks to \nweaken the individual responsibility requirement in health reform--\nweaken it. Remember, this is a shared responsibility. He wants us to \nweaken a large part. The Congressional Budget Office has indicated that \nthe requirement is one of the most critical pieces of reform; that is, \nthat requirement that the Senator wishes to weaken. CBO, again, states \nthis requirement is one of the most critical pieces of reform. Without \nit, we lose coverage for millions of Americans. Without it--without \nthat reform--premiums could spike by up to 15 to 20 percent in the \nnongroup market. Premiums were likely to go up 15 to 20 percent in the \nnongroup market if this health care reform bill had not passed. That is \nthe analysis of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.\n  So, clearly, we must resist efforts to weaken the individual \nresponsibility policy in the health care reform bill. I, therefore, do \nnot support this amendment.\n  I have a couple of other matters. I have not had much opportunity to \nspeak today, so I wish to speak on those matters. I see my good friend \nfrom Utah wishes to speak and I will try to speak quickly so he can \nmake his remarks.\n  The Senator from Arizona came to the floor a few moments ago to \nattack a number of laws we have enacted this Congress. First, he \nattacked the Recovery Act. The Senator from Arizona ridiculed the \nRecovery Act's effects. But we here turn to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office for the straight facts. What are the facts? \nI think it was the late Senator Moynihan from New York who once said, \nyou know, you can argue the policy, but you can't argue facts. Facts \nare facts. Facts are very tenacious things that are there that you \ncan't wish away. So what are the facts, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office? The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that in \nthe first quarter of calendar year 2010, the Recovery Act's policies \nraised the level of real gross domestic product--that is adjusted for \ninflation--raised the level of gross domestic product by between 1.7 \npercent and 4.2 percent--not zero, not decreased but raised--raised the \ngross domestic product in the United States between 1.7 percent and 2.4 \npercent. Also, CBO says the Recovery Act lowered the unemployment rate \nby between .7 percentage point and 1.5 percentage points. That is the \nconclusion of the Congressional Budget Office.\n  What else did the Congressional Budget Office say? That the Recovery \nAct increased the number of people employed by between 1.2 million and \n2.8 million--increased the number of people employed. That is the \nconsequence of the act. The Congressional Budget Office further states \nthat it increased the number of full-time equivalent jobs by 1.8 \nmillion to 4.1 million compared with what those amounts would have been \notherwise. I think that is pretty clear.\n  I respect the ability of the Senator from Arizona to state his own \nthoughts. That is why we are here in the Senate, in many respects. But \nwe can't dispute the facts as stated by the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office, the facts which I just recited.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 4 p.m. today, the \nSenate proceed to vote in relation to the following amendments in the \norder listed and that no intervening amendment be in order prior to the \nvotes, with 2 minutes of debate prior to each vote, with the time \nequally divided and controlled in the usual form; that after the first \nvote in the sequence, the succeeding votes be limited to 10 minutes \neach: Cardin amendment No. 4304; Roberts amendment No. 4325; Sessions \namendment No. 4303, with a modification which is at the desk, and that \nthe amendment be modified.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I won't \nobject, but I want to make sure I have enough time to give the remarks \nI was supposed to give.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That depends on how long the remarks are going to be.\n  Mr. HATCH. They will be wonderful remarks.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am sure they are going to be wonderful. That wasn't the \nquestion.\n  Mr. HATCH. I am hopeful that I can be finished by 4 o'clock.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. We will work it out. We can always delay the first vote \nuntil, say, 5 minutes after 4 to accommodate the Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Amendment No. 4303, as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS.\n\n       (a) Point of Order.--It shall not be in order in the House \n     of Representatives or the Senate to consider any bill, joint \n     resolution, amendment, or conference report that includes any \n     provision that would cause the discretionary spending limits \n     as set forth in this section to be exceeded.\n       (b) Limits.--In this section, the term ``discretionary \n     spending limits'' has the following meaning subject to \n     adjustments in subsection (c):\n       (1) For fiscal year 2011--\n\n[[Page S4730]]\n\n       (A) for the defense category (budget function 050), \n     $564,293,000,000 in budget authority;

The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague's remarks and I \nappreciate his leadership on the Finance Committee. He is a fine man. \nWe have been friends for a long time. He has had a very tough job on \nhealth care.\n  But I was a little amazed that he would suggest the Republicans are \nopening up the health care bill after the distinguished Senator from \nMaryland actually opened it up with his amendment. I suspect there is \ngoing to be a lot of opening by Democrats, as well as Republicans, of \nthe health care bill because it is a colossally bad bill. There is no \nsin in doing that. Plus I have to say, coming from one of the States \nthat is one of the major producers of medical devices, most of those \ndevice companies hardly agreed to what has happened to them. They are \ngoing to have to pass those additional taxes on to consumers.\n  I make those remarks to correct the record a little bit. I realize \nwhat my friend is saying. I suspect there will be a lot of amendments \nto what I consider to be a bill that I think will be a problem for the \nrest of our lives if we don't reform it.\n  I rise today to express my deep concern about the so-called American \nJobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act. I also wish to relay my growing \nfrustration with the partisan gamesmanship and lack of leadership by \nthe majority of this body that has brought us to the deplorable state \nin which we find ourselves in connection with the expired tax \nprovisions.\n  As a long-time member of the Committee on Finance, it has been my \nprivilege to work with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to try \nto improve the tax laws of this country. While we have had our share of \npartisan fights over the nearly 20 years I have served on the \ncommittee, there has been an overall spirit of cooperation and \nbipartisanship that has set this panel apart from all the others on \nwhich I have served. Unfortunately, this positive spirit, which is so \nbadly needed in the Congress today, has been unraveling for some time \nnow.\n  Nowhere is this degradation of bipartisan cooperation more evident \nthan in taking care of what used to be the routine business of \nextending expiring tax provisions. This, of course, is a major \nobjective of the bill before us.\n  Let us move back a few steps and take an objective look at what we \nare attempting to do here with this bill. This legislation started out \nwith the purpose of reinstating a growing number of important tax \nprovisions that expired at the end of last year. I recall a time not so \nlong ago when the Senate took care of expiring provisions before they \nlapsed, not 6 months or even more, after their sunset.\n  The problem is not with the provisions themselves--they almost \nuniversally enjoy wide and deep support on both sides of the aisle. Nor \nis it a problem that these provisions are not important to the American \neconomy. Admittedly, some of them are more significant than others. The \nresearch credit, for example, is vital to our battle to keep R \nactivities here in the U.S.--which, by the way, is a battle we are in \ndanger of losing to many of our trading partners, who are working hard \nto attract these activities away from our shores.\n  Rather, the problem is twofold--a lack of taking care of needed \nbusiness on the part of the Senate leadership and the tendency of the \nmajority to use the expired tax provisions as a pawn in the games of \npolitics they are playing.\n  Let me offer several examples of this. First, it has sadly become \ncommonplace for the leadership of the Senate to not even begin to take \nthe extension of expiring tax provisions seriously until after they \nhave expired. We have, so many times now, routinely extended these \nprovisions after the fact on a retroactive basis, that we have created \na sort of expectation that this is a normal and fine way of doing \nthings. This is true despite the fact that we know and admit that this \nsloppy way of managing public policy will create additional complexity \nand burdens to the taxpayers that are dependent on these provisions.\n  Second, the majority had ample opportunity before now to take up and \npass the tax extenders, but political games got in the way. For \nexample, early this year in a demonstration of bipartisanship worthy of \nthe reputation of the Finance Committee, Chairman Baucus reached out to \nSenator Grassley and other committee members on both sides of the aisle \nin an attempt to put together a job creation bill. This bill, which was \neventually enacted as the HIRE Act, was to have included the expired \ntax provisions. Practically everyone agrees that these provisions are \njob creators, and both sides wanted to put them in the bill.\n  Instead, however, the majority leader essentially hijacked this \ncooperation and turned it into a partisan game where it was impossible \nfor our side to participate. In the process of doing so, he \ninexplicably removed from the bill the expired tax provisions and \ntrashed them as Republican-only initiatives. Thus, these tax extenders \ncould have been enacted in March but the Democratic leadership \ndemonstrated that it would rather play political games than get these \nimportant provisions taken care of, which we all pretty much supported.\n  Third, when the majority finally did turn its attention to extending \nthese expired tax provisions, it decided to attach unrelated provisions \nthat it felt it could push through the Congress because extender bills \neventually become ``must pass'' legislative vehicles. These unrelated \nprovisions include an expansion of the controversial Build America \nBonds program and a Medicare ``doc fix'' provision that had been \npromised in the so-called health care reform bill. Adding these \nprovisions effectively turned the extenders into a pawn in this game of \npolitics.\n  Finally, the majority has engaged in a strange game of insisting that \nthe expired tax provisions be offset with tax increases on other \ntaxpayers, while allowing far larger portions of the bill, such as the \nextension of unemployment benefits, to remain un-offset under the guise \nthat we are in an emergency.\n  Mr. President, we are indeed in an emergency, but it is an emergency \ncaused by too-high taxes and by lack of spending restraint. And by \nnational debt that is compounding itself day after day, year after \nyear, until we double our deficit in the next 5 years and triple it in \n10, if we are lucky.\n\n  The solution is certainly not to raise taxes and increase spending, \nyet this is exactly what this bill does. It is to these tax increases \nincluded in the bill that I wish to address the remainder of my \nremarks.\n  Most of my colleagues know that I have been a strong and long-time \nsupporter of many of the expired tax provisions. Let me again mention \nthe importance of the research tax credit. I, along with Senator \nBaucus, have long\n\n[[Page S4732]]\n\nchampioned this provision, and I have worked to make it a permanent \ncredit so we do not have to see these repetitive lapses in its \ncoverage, which only make it less effective as an incentive.\n  I wish this bill included a permanent research tax credit, which many \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle and the Obama \nadministration insist they are in favor of enacting. Knowing that a \npermanent extension was out of the question, I attempted to strengthen \nthe credit on a temporary basis, along the lines of the bill that \nSenator Baucus and I introduced last year, but the other side was not \neven willing to do this. Nevertheless, a straight extension of the \ncurrent law research tax credit is significant and is of dire \nnecessity.\n  I hasten to point out it would not have been as effective as the \nstrengthening provision that we both had agreed should be in the bill.\n  Why, then, am I planning to vote against this bill? Along with the \nhuge increase in un-offset spending, it is for the same reason that \nmuch of the business community is opposed to this legislation--the tax \nincreases added to the bill will damage the economy and job creation \nand outweigh the benefits of extending the expired tax provisions.\n  That is at a time when we know that unemployment is not coming down, \nnor is the economy getting that much better.\n  Let us take a look at some of these so-called tax loopholes that this \nlegislation is attempting to close.\n  The largest revenue raiser in the bill is the so-called carried \ninterest provision. For several years now, we have heard it stated with \noutrage that hedge fund managers get by with paying a lower tax rate on \ntheir billion dollar compensation packages than the tax rate their \nsecretaries pay on their relatively meager salaries. Well, if it were \nthis simple, maybe this is a legitimate loophole that we should have \nclosed a long time ago. Unfortunately, it is not this simple.\n  Rather, the carried interest issue is a complex one that permeates \nthrough many structures throughout our economy in ways that are \ndifficult to understand. For example, the same partnership structure \nthat is often utilized by a hedge fund is also used by venture \ncapitalists and real estate developers. These structures have long been \npart of our tax law and many multi-billion dollar deals that have \ncreated millions of jobs have been built upon them.\n  I am not here to say that from a tax policy point of view, the way we \ntax carried interest should not be examined and possibly changed. What \nI am here to say is that we need to use extreme caution in making any \nchanges to the taxation of these structures. Why? Because the simple \nfact is that if we increase the tax rates and change the nature of \nincome from these partnerships, the economic hurdle rates will rise, \nand fewer deals will get done. And if fewer deals are done, less \neconomic activity will be generated and fewer jobs will be created. At \nthis time of economic strife in this country, this is not a chance we \nshould take.\n  The problem Mr. President, is that these offsets are being considered \nfor one reason and one reason only--for the tax revenue they are \nprojected to provide. We are trying to fill a hole and we need a \ncertain amount of new taxes to do it. We are not looking to improve tax \npolicy here. If we were, we would approach this matter with the caution \nit warrants.\n  Another big tax change in this bill before us also needs to be \nreconsidered. I refer to the provision to change the way certain owners \nof S corporations are subject to self-employment tax. This $11 billion \nplus revenue raiser will create all kinds of headaches for legitimate \nsmall businesses that are currently playing by the rules.\n  The proponents of this change say that it is needed to close a \nloophole made famous by a former colleague of ours who will remain \nunnamed. However, the Internal Revenue Service already has all the \ntools it needs, in the form of existing tax rules, to enforce the kind \nof abuses that have occurred in this area.\n  The provision in this bill to correct this problem would arbitrarily \nafflict certain small businesses whose only sin is that they might have \nthree skilled professionals rather than four. Essentially, the \nprovision creates a raft of unanswered and complex questions that will \nlikely bedevil hundreds of thousands of small business owners who would \nmuch rather be concentrating on surviving the tough economic climate \nand possibly creating some new jobs.\n  Finally, I must say a few words about another category of offsets in \nthis bill that are entirely unjustified and were not well considered. \nThese are the set of changes to the foreign tax credit rules that \nsuddenly appeared on the scene just a few days ago. Unlike most other \ntax offsets that we discuss in the Finance Committee, which have been \naround for a long time and have had the benefit of examination by the \nprofessional tax community, these were sprung on us just a few days \nago. They were not part of the administration's budget proposal and \nhave not been subject to any kind of hearing in either House.\n  Rather, they were apparently concocted by some backroom bureaucrats \nin the bowels of the executive branch and brought forth in the guise \nthat these are glaring loopholes that must be closed for the sake of \nthe future of the federal fisc. However, what I have been told by \nseasoned tax professionals in the business community is that these are, \nin large part, not loopholes at all but legitimate tax planning \ntechniques that the Treasury and Internal Revenue Service have known \nabout for years.\n  What is worse is that the effective date of these provisions in this \nbill would have a retroactive effect. We all know that retroactive tax \nincreases belie good public policy. Moreover, many on the majority \nside, including the chairmen of both of the tax-writing committees, \nearlier agreed that international tax reform provisions should be \ndiscussed in connection with international tax reform, not as a knee-\njerk reaction to a perceived need for revenues on an unrelated bill. \nThis is not good lawmaking and we should abandon consideration of these \nrevenue raisers until we can examine them from a tax policy point of \nview.\n  In conclusion, we are on the low road with this bill. I am frankly \nashamed to tell Utahns who ask me about the expired provisions that \nCongress has not dealt with them yet, and that the reason why is that \nwe are too busy playing partisan games to manage the affairs of the \nnation in a responsible way.\n  It is not too late. Let us walk away from this mess and start again. \nLet us take up a clean bill to extend the expired provisions, which we \nall agree should be enacted, and then deal with these other issues \nseparately. Most importantly, let us not increase taxes on anyone when \nthe economy is in such a precarious position.\n  As our side has stated many times before, these tax provisions have \nbeen paid for many times over in previous years, by enacting permanent \noffsets to go along with their temporary extension. Let us not hurt our \nconstituents in the name of false fiscal responsibility. Let us instead \nemploy real fiscal responsibility and start finding ways to address our \nrunaway spending addiction.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4304\n\n  Under the previous order, there will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 4304, offered by \nthe Senator from Maryland, Mr. Cardin.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, the amendment we will be voting on is an \namendment that allows the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan \nenrollees to enroll their children up to age 26 immediately rather than \nwaiting until January 1, which is what the new law provides. Private \ninsurance companies are providing this opportunity now for their \nindividuals.\n  Let me point out that I understand a point of order might be raised \nunder the Budget Act. This has negligible costs. In fact, it will save \nsome money in that children who reach the age of 22 between now and the \nend of the year\n\n[[Page S4733]]\n\nwill be required to disenroll and then reenroll again after January 1, \nwhich makes no sense whatsoever.\n  The Office of Personnel Management wants to implement this plan now. \nThey have the capacity to do it, but they need the legal authority to \ndo it.\n  For the sake of our 8 million active Federal workers, retirees, and \ntheir families, it makes sense for us in an orderly way to allow their \nchildren up to age 26 to be part of the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Plan now rather than have to wait until January 1.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment and to support the \nwaiver of the budget point of order.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, prior to enactment of health care reform, \nthere was no law that required insurers to extend coverage for young \nadults to remain on their parents' plans.\n  For years, getting a diploma also meant losing your health insurance. \nAnd whether you went on to college or not, it was often hard as a young \nperson to find affordable coverage.\n  Overall, Americans in their twenties were twice as likely to go \nwithout health insurance as older Americans.\n  For too many young Americans over the years, the answer to these \nquestions was simply to go without health insurance and hope that you \nstayed healthy.\n  Under the new health reform law, insurers will be required to allow \nall Americans under the age of 26 who do not get health insurance \nthrough their job to stay on their parents' plan.\n  And beginning in 2014, children up to age 26 can stay on their \nparent's employer plan even if they have another offer of coverage \nthrough an employer.\n  This provision is scheduled to go into effect in September. But every \nmajor insurance company--more than 65 in total--and several major self-\ninsured organizations have said they will provide continuous coverage \nfor young adults this summer.\n  The amendment by the Senator from Maryland would make it possible for \nthe Federal Employee Health Benefit Program to follow the lead of \nprivate insurance companies and make this coverage available sooner, as \nwell.\n  This is a worthy goal. And the amendment would have negligible \neffects on the budget. And so I support the motion by the Senator from \nMaryland and urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I have been asked to raise a point of order \nthat the Cardin amendment violates section 311 of the Congressional \nBudget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, much like Senator Cardin's amendment, my \namendment also recognizes the need to ensure that the youngest in our \npopulation have access to health care. My amendment does this by \nexempting medical devices primarily to be used by or for pediatric \npatients. The CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation both confirmed \nthat these excise taxes will not be borne by the medical device \nindustry. The tax will be passed on to patients in the form of higher \nprices and higher insurance premiums.\n  My amendment prevents this new tax from raising the cost for \npediatric medical devices--those devices that treat the youngest in our \npopulation, children who have serious or life-threatening illnesses, \nsuch as a heart patient or a cancer patient.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Roberts amendment would address almost \nexactly the same matter the Senate voted on March 24. We rejected it \nthen and we should reject it now.\n  The amendment would carve out an exemption for certain medical device \nmanufacturers from paying their fair share of costs for health care \nreform and it will be paid for by reducing the number of people to be \ncovered by health insurance. The last thing we should do is cut back on \nhealth insurance coverage, and I urge my colleagues to oppose the \namendment.\n  I move to table the amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote in relation to \namendment No. 4303, as modified, offered by the Senator from Alabama, \nMr. Sessions.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise to spend a few moments to talk \nabout this amendment. We have voted on this amendment before, although \nwe have made a couple of changes: exempting moneys that are being spent \non contingency operations for our military overseas and lowering the \nvote threshold for emergencies where we need to go beyond the spending \ncap.\n  But this is the bottom line: On kitchen tables all across this \ncountry families are cutting their budgets. In county courthouses all \nover this country people are cutting budgets. In State legislatures all \nover this country people are cutting budgets. In city council chambers \nall over this country people are cutting budgets.\n  Then we get to Washington, and what we are trying to do here is not \ncut a budget. That is the amazing part about this. This does not cut a \npenny. All it does is curb the growth. Are we going to say to this \ncountry that we are unable to cap the growth of this government over \nthe next 3 years?\n  This is a baby step. This is not a major assault on the spending of \nthe Federal Government. This is a baby step.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, this will be the fourth time this year the \nSenate will be voting on an amendment offered by the Senator from \nAlabama which seeks to constrain discretionary spending. Each one of \nthe amendments has been similar.\n  This is the fifth time I have risen to speak in opposition to this \namendment, and I must admit I find myself somewhat at a loss for words. \nThere are only so many ways to highlight the negative impact of this \namendment on current services and the President's initiatives, while \nexplaining how it does not address real deficit reduction.\n  Fortunately, the Senate has voted this amendment down three times \nalready. I thank my colleagues for rejecting this amendment in the \npast, and I certainly hope we will do so again.\n  There are a number of reasons why this amendment is a bad idea. Let \nme remind my colleagues, again, of several of those reasons:\n  The Senator from Alabama uses last year's budget resolution as his \nstarting point. He believes that since Congress passed a budget \nresolution last year with a nonbinding target for this year, that we \nshould now make that target binding.\n  But, since this amendment was originally proposed, the Budget \nCommittee has reviewed the President's budget request for fiscal year \n2011 and has marked up a new budget resolution. In doing so, the \ncommittee has changed their recommendation.\n  Since the committee with jurisdiction has determined the levels that \nit believes the Congress should keep to, I am not sure what advantage \nthe Senate would have in agreeing to the notional targets in last \nyear's resolution.\n  I have stated this before, but it is important to note again for my \ncolleagues. The President's budget proposal for fiscal year 2011 allows \ngrowth in Homeland Security; this amendment does not assume growth. \nThis could result in fewer border patrol agents and firefighting grants \nand would weaken TSA's ability to respond to threats to aviation \nsecurity.\n  The President has requested more than $732 billion in his budget for \nnational defense for fiscal year 2011, including the cost of war. This \namendment only allocates $614 billion.\n  As I stated several weeks ago, over the 3 years covered in this \namendment, the caps that would be put into place are $141 billion below \nPresident Obama's 3-year plan, including $50 billion below defense and \n$91 billion below nondefense spending.\n  The Sessions amendment is $82 billion below the budget resolution \nwhich the committee adopted, and includes a cut of $50 billion from \nDefense, over 3 years. In the near term, for fiscal year 2011, the \nSessions amendment will require the Appropriations Committee to cut \ndefense spending by $9.5 billion and nondefense spending by about $11 \nbillion.\n  Such across-the-board cuts make for a great photo opportunity for \nappearing to reduce the deficit, but the consequences could be severe. \nThe lack of direction is reckless. Important needs would go unmet. This \namendment could result in cutting research funds for traumatic brain \ninjury, worsening the shortage of air traffic controllers, cutting \nafterschool centers and veterans employment programs, to name just a \nfew.\n  This week, the President has asked Federal agencies to identify 5 \npercent in spending cuts for fiscal year 2012 to areas that are not \ncritical to their overall mission. A more thorough, deliberative \napproach such as this is clearly more sensible than slashing budgets \nacross-the-board with little or no consideration of the consequences.\n  As I have said now several times before, a critical flaw in this \namendment is it does nothing to seriously reduce the deficit. It fails \nto address the two principal reasons for the government's current \nfinancial distress.\n  The two drivers behind the growth in the debt are unchecked mandatory \nspending and the huge tax cuts for the wealthy passed, with no offsets, \nby the previous administration. This amendment fails to address either \nof those two problems. It simply does not get the job done. Further, it \nhinders the efforts of those who do seek to address the deficit in a \ncomprehensive manner.\n  The fact of the matter is that many of our Republican colleagues are \nmore than willing to put a cap on discretionary spending. At the same \ntime, they refuse to support policies that would ensure the Nation has \nsufficient incoming revenue to make a real impact on the deficit, even \nthough mandatory spending has increased significantly for the last few \nyears.\n  We all know that it is impossible to achieve a balanced budget simply \nby freezing discretionary spending. In fact, we could eliminate all \ndiscretionary spending increases for defense and nondefense spending \nand still not even come close to balancing the budget.\n  And again, I remind my Democratic colleagues that if we cut \ndiscretionary spending without also reaching an agreement on mandatory \nspending and taxes, we will find it impossible to get those who do not \nwant to address revenues to come to a meaningful compromise.\n  I would also remind my colleagues that the deficit reduction \ncommission is working, as we speak, to come up with a comprehensive \nsolution to the current systemic imbalances we face.\n  And in the fall, they will make their recommendations to the \nCongress, and we have a firm commitment to bring those recommendations \nup for a vote.\n  The Senate has already rejected this flawed plan three times this \nyear. The flaws remain, and the Senate should reject it a fourth time.\n  This amendment fails to address the real causes of our deficits and \nthe national debt in a fair and comprehensive manner. It would provide \nfar less funding than either the President or the Senate Budget \nCommittee recommend.\n  For all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues once again to vote no.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is the Sessions-McCaskill amendment. \nWe have voted at least four times on this amendment. The Senator from \nAlabama has offered pretty much the same amendment.\n  For now, four times the Senator from Alabama has sought to fix caps \non the work of the appropriations process. Three times the Senate has \nrejected this amendment. I think we should do so today. The amendment \nby the Senators from Alabama and Missouri robs the Appropriations \nCommittee and the Congress of flexibility to respond to changed \ncircumstances in years to come. It would set budget caps, binding years \ninto the future, no matter what happens between now and then.\n  So for all of the reasons the Senate rejected this amendment three \ntimes before, I believe we should reject it again today. The Sessions \namendment seeks to change the budget process; therefore, it violates \nthe Congressional Budget Act. I thus raise a point of order that the \nSessions amendment\n\n[[Page S4735]]\n\nviolates section 306 of the Congressional Budget Act.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the growing Federal debt of the United States has the \n     potential to jeopardize the national security and economic \n     stability of the United States;\n       (2) the increasing dependence of the United States on \n     foreign creditors has the potential to make the United States \n     vulnerable to undue influence by certain foreign creditors in \n     national security and economic policymaking;\n       (3) the People's Republic of China is the largest foreign \n     creditor of the United States, in terms of its overall \n     holdings of debt instruments of the United States;\n       (4) the current level of transparency in the scope and \n     extent of foreign holdings of debt instruments of the United \n     States is inadequate and needs to be improved, particularly \n     regarding the holdings of the People's Republic of China;\n       (5) through the People's Republic of China's large holdings \n     of debt instruments of the United States, China has become a \n     super creditor of the United States;\n       (6) under certain circumstances, the holdings of the \n     People's Republic of China could give China a tool with which \n     China can try to manipulate the domestic and foreign \n     policymaking of the United States, including the United \n     States relationship with Taiwan;\n       (7) under certain circumstances, if the People's Republic \n     of China were to be displeased with a given United States \n     policy or action, China could attempt to destabilize the \n     United States economy by rapidly divesting large portions of \n     China's holdings of debt instruments of the United States; \n     and\n       (8) the People's Republic of China's expansive holdings of \n     such debt instruments of the United States could potentially \n     pose a direct threat to the United States economy and to \n     United States national security. This potential threat is a \n     significant issue that warrants further analysis and \n     evaluation.\n\n     SEC. _04.

The Senator from Texas.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 4302, as Modified\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, according to the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office, the pending legislation before the Senate will add $80 \nbillion to the Federal deficit. The Treasury Department, in a report to \nCongress last week, projects that by 2015 the national debt will reach \n$19.6 trillion.\n  My amendment represents a modest attempt to ensure that Congress is \nkept informed on the economic and national security implications of two \nimportant matters: first, the ballooning national debt; and, secondly, \nthe foreign financing of our deficit spending.\n  I believe it is only prudent for Congress to get regular analyses on \nthese issues, ones as critical as these.\n  My amendment has two components. First, it requires the General \nAccounting Office to provide Congress with an annual risk assessment on \nthe national security and economic hazards posed by the national debt. \nSecondly, it would require the President to provide Congress with \nquarterly risk assessments on the national security and economic \nhazards posed by current levels of foreign holdings of our debt. In the \nevent the risk level is found to be too high, the President would have \nto put together and then execute a plan to mitigate that risk in a way \nthat reduces Federal spending.\n  It is the worst kept secret in the world that our deficit spending is \nbeing financed by foreign investors who may not always have our \nNation's best interests at heart. We need to be thinking openly and \nclearly about the potential consequences of this, as well as the \nconsequences of allowing our national debt to reach such massive \nproportions.\n  The chairman of the Finance Committee apparently opposes my amendment \nand will offer an alternate based closely on mine. I regret to say, \nthough, his amendment makes changes to the legislative language that \ncould potentially result in tax increases on American taxpayers, which \ncould not come at a worse time.\n  Under my amendment, the Government Accountability Office would be \nrequired to recommend to Congress ways to bring down the security and \neconomic risks posed by the huge national debt. These recommendations \nwould be required to focus on spending reductions, not tax increases. \nBy contrast, under the Baucus amendment, this limitation is deleted, \neffectively paving the way for the GAO to recommend that Congress raise \ntaxes rather than cut spending.\n  Similarly, in cases where foreign holdings of our debt pose \nunacceptable risks to our security and economy, my amendment would \nrequire the President of the United States to formulate and execute a \nplan to mitigate those risks. His plan would have to reduce Federal \nspending. The Baucus amendment deletes that limitation, opening the \ndoor for the President's plan to include tax hikes on the American \ntaxpayer.\n  The Baucus amendment also substantially weakens the requirements for \nthe two types of debt risk assessments. First, it cuts the frequency of \nthe President's reporting requirements on the risks posed by foreign \ndebt holdings, making them annual rather than quarterly, and it also \nshifts the requirement over to the Secretary of the Treasury. It makes \nthe reports more vague and, as a result, less useful to Members of \nCongress who need this information.\n  Perhaps most puzzling, the Baucus amendment eliminates the \nrequirement for the GAO to determine whether our country can sustain \nthe security and economic risks posed by growing national debt. I \nrecognize it may be unpleasant--or even inconvenient--to think about \nthis, but it is a risk to our country, and it is an important question \nthat needs transparency and our best thinking.\n  We have an obligation to think openly and honestly about what effect \nCongress's runaway spending may have on our Nation's future which, of \ncourse, is the purpose of my amendment.\n  Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to oppose the Baucus amendment and \nto support mine.\n  I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4326 To Amendment No. 4301\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, I support transparency. I think most of us \ndo, certainly in concept. I support the transparency and deficit \nreduction goals of the Cornyn-Kyl amendment. But that amendment is \nunworkable. Why? Because it requires Treasury to speculate about the \nintent behind foreign purchases of U.S. Treasuries. How in the world is \nTreasury going to be able to know the intent behind foreign purchases \nof U.S. treasuries?\n  The Cornyn-Kyl amendment also sends the wrong message that the United \nStates is deeply suspicious of foreign holders of U.S. debt, and it \npotentially could chill foreign purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds. I do \nnot think we want to do that now.\n  Purchases of U.S. Treasury bonds have held interest rates very low. \nWe are very lucky. We are very lucky. I do not think many appreciate \nthis: With the budget deficits we have, and even with unemployment way \ntoo high, things could be much worse; that is, if interest rates were \nmuch higher. But investors like the safe haven of U.S. Treasuries--and \nthat is domestic and foreign purchases of U.S. Treasuries--and that is \nhelping to keep interest rates down at very low rates, and that is \nkeeping inflation down at very low rates. We are lucky that is a \ncondition we are experiencing in the United States today.\n  With America just beginning to recover from the financial crisis, we \ncannot risk our ability to finance the debt. We cannot risk it. For \nthose reasons, I must oppose the Cornyn amendment.\n  However, I urge Senators to support my side-by-side amendment, which \nmeets the transparency objectives of the Cornyn-Kyl amendment, but \ncould actually be implemented and will avoid roiling financial markets \nin this time of uncertainty.\n  Think a bit about what is happening in Europe. This is an uncertain \ntime. This is not a time to be taking big risks. Rather, it is a time \nto be steady as she goes and be smart and be steady.\n  My amendment would require the President to submit an assessment to \nCongress on the risks posed by foreign holdings of U.S. debt, but \nwithout unnecessarily singling out individual countries. I do not think \nwe want to single out individual countries because that has too great a \nrisk of unintended consequences.\n  My amendment would require the GAO to assess the risk associated with \nFederal debt, but it would not impose an unconstitutional requirement \non the President.\n  I am joined in this amendment by the chairman of the Foreign \nRelations Committee, Senator Kerry, and the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee, Senator Dodd. I urge Senators to support the Baucus-Kerry \nside-by-side amendment and oppose the Cornyn-Kyl amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Five minutes twenty seconds.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I will respond briefly.\n  The reason why we require, in my amendment, the President of the \nUnited States to make the report on the risks to our national security \nand our financial system is because only the President can command all \nof the resources of the U.S. Government, including that of our \nintelligence services, which may have something to say about the \nnational security risks associated with countries such as China owning \nso much of our debt. We know that, for example, leaders in the Chinese \nmilitary have threatened retaliation in exchange for the United States \nselling defensive weapons to the country of Taiwan. I would think the \nTreasury Department, which in the Baucus amendment would be required to \nmake that report, would not have access to the intelligence and the \nother information necessary--or from the Department of Defense--in \ndealing with China.\n  The Senator from Montana also says we should not rock the boat. We \nought to go steady as she goes. The problem is our boat is going to \nsink and go to the bottom of an ocean of debt if we do not change our \nways. This is a first step to try to provide additional transparency to \nlet the American people assess for themselves whether they think this \nis a good idea or whether their elected representatives in Congress \nshould do something about rising debt and runaway spending. I \nunderstand the Senator from Montana saying we don't want to single out \nspecial countries. It is true that some of our closest allies such as \nJapan and the United Kingdom also purchased large amounts of our debt, \nbut, frankly, I am not as worried about those allies of the United \nStates as I am the intention of China, which is not an ally, which is a \nrival, to say the least, and one whose actions we need to be \nappropriately skeptical about and discerning.\n\n  So unfortunately, I think the alternative amendment offered by the \nSenator from Montana waters down this important amendment, and I think \nit would obscure the facts from the American people and policymakers \nhere in Congress. So I ask my colleagues to vote against the Baucus \nalternative and vote for the Cornyn amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of my \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I am prepared to yield back the rest of my \ntime, and I wonder if the Senator from Texas is prepared to yield back \nhis.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I yield back the remaining time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield back our time as well, and I move to table the \nCornyn amendment. Wait. Which amendment is up first?\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, as I understand it, although the Senator \nfrom Texas personally is, the other side is not prepared to yield back \nthe rest of their time. Therefore, I ask unanimous consent to reclaim \nmy time and Senator Cornyn's time as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry: My understanding is \nthat the Senator from Montana was yielding back. I was willing to yield \nback my time and ask for a vote as soon as it can be conveniently \narranged.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That is correct. I understand you are OK, but your side \nis--now they are OK. So now that we have that settled, all time is \nyielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If all time is yielded back, the question is \non agreeing to amendment No. 4326 of the Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n\n[[Page S4738]]\n\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to support the Cornyn \namendment. This is a transparency amendment. It just gives the American \npeople and Congress the information we need in order to make a \ndetermination of whether Third World countries owning our debt poses a \nnational security or a financial risk to the United States. I ask for \nyour support.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Cornyn amendment is a dangerous one. \nIt would send the wrong message to people who are buying America's \ndebt. It would send a message that we are suspicious of people who buy \nour debt and would require the Treasury to opine the intent of \npurchasers of U.S. debt. It would thus discourage people from buying \nAmerican debt. This would cause us to have to pay higher interest rates \non our debt, and that would mean higher rates of inflation. It would \nroil the bond markets at a sensitive time. Look at what has happened in \nEurope and the softness there.\n  For lots of reasons I think it is unwise to undertake this risky \nadventure.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, will the Senator withhold for a brief \nminute.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. REID. As soon as this vote is complete, that will be the last \nvote for this evening. We are going to come in tomorrow morning at 9:45 \nand immediately go to the Murkowski resolution. There are 6 hours set \naside for that, and then a motion to proceed, and then an hour if the \nmotion to proceed succeeds. So everyone should be prepared tomorrow for \na long day. We will be in session on Friday more than likely. There \nwill be no votes on Friday or Monday. I remind everyone these are the \nonly days during the entire work period that there will be no votes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4318\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, at a time when the profits of big oil \ncompanies are soaring, at a time when we are in the midst of a \nhorrendous and huge oilspill on the gulf coast, at a time when we \ndesperately need to end our dependence on oil and gas and significantly \nincrease our investment in energy efficiency and renewable energy, the \namendment I am offering is simple and it is straightforward. This \namendment simply repeals over $35 billion in tax breaks to the oil and \ngas industry, all of which were recommended for elimination in \nPresident Obama's fiscal year 2011 budget.\n  Specifically, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation, the \nrepeal of expensing of intangible drilling costs, repeal of percentage \ndepletion for oil and gas wells, and repeal of the domestic \nmanufacturing deduction for oil and gas production would save $35.3 \nbillion over a 10-year period. According to OMB, the repeal of these \ntax breaks would be equivalent to about 1 percent of domestic oil and \ngas industry revenues over the next decade--1 percent. In other words, \nthe costs to the oil and gas industry of repealing these tax breaks is \nnegligible.\n  More than $25 billion of the money saved under this amendment would \nbe used to reduce the deficit, and $10 billion would be used to invest \nin the highly successful Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant \nProgram over a 5-year period.\n  So we are accomplishing two very important goals. Every day, Members \nof the Senate come down here and they say we have to deal with the \ndeficit. Under this amendment, we would save $25 billion for deficit \nreduction. That is pretty significant. Second, Members come down here \nevery day and talk about the need to transform our energy system, to \nmove to energy efficiency and sustainable energy--wind, solar, biomass, \ngeothermal, other technologies. This amendment puts $10 billion in \nmoving us away from fossil fuel. So it accomplishes two very important \npurposes.\n  This amendment is cosponsored by Senator Whitehouse and Senator \nWyden. We have support for funding for the Energy Efficiency and \nConservation Block Grant Program from the U.S. Conference of Mayors, \nfrom the National Association of State Energy Officials, and the \nNational League of Cities. Taxpayers for Common Sense strongly supports \nour efforts to repeal the oil and gas tax breaks and pay down the \ndeficit. Also supporting our amendment are the Sierra Club, Greenpeace, \nthe American Council for an Energy Efficient Economy, Conservation Law \nFoundation, Physicians for Social Responsibility, Friends of the Earth, \nPublic Citizen, moveon.org, Center for Biological Diversity, One Sky, \nEnvironment America, and Oceana.\n  If there is anything we should be learning from the gulf disaster, it \nis that it is time to move aggressively away from polluting and unsafe \nfossil fuels which are getting more difficult to produce and more \nexpensive to produce and that we must move toward safe, clean energy.\n  With a $13 trillion national debt, the last thing we need to be doing \nis giving tax breaks to big oil and gas companies that have been making \nrecordbreaking profits, year after year.\n  I know there are some people who come down here and say that one way \nto deal with the deficit problem is to privatize Social Security, to \nprivatize Medicare, to place at risk the retirement benefits of \nmillions of senior citizens. I think that is a very bad idea. There are \nother people who come down to the floor and talk about cuts in \neducation, cuts to health care that the middle-class and working \nfamilies of this country desperately need. I think cutting those \nprograms is a bad idea. But I think going after some of the largest and \nmost profitable corporations in this country, which have not paid their \nfair share of taxes, is a positive and intelligent way to deal with \ndeficit reduction.\n  Let me quote from the President of the United States, Barack Obama, \nin his statements on this subject. Again, what we are proposing is what \nPresident Obama has recommended in his 2011 budget. This is what \nPresident Obama said:\n\n       Our continued dependence on fossil fuels will jeopardize \n     our national security. It will smother our planet. And it \n     will continue to put our economy and our environment at risk. \n     . . . If we refuse to take into account the full cost of our \n     fossil fuel addiction--if we don't factor in the \n     environmental costs and national security costs and true \n     economic costs--we will have missed our best chance to seize \n     a clean energy future. . . . The time has come, once and for \n     all, for this nation to fully embrace a clean energy future. \n     Now that means . . . rolling back billions of dollars of tax \n     breaks to oil companies so we can prioritize investments in \n     clean energy research and development.\n\n  That is exactly what this amendment is all about. Let me give just \none example. I hope people are listening to this one. Let me give one \nexample of the absurdity of continuing to provide tax breaks to the oil \nand gas industry.\n  Last year, ExxonMobil, the most profitable corporation in the history \nof the world, reported to the SEC that not only did it avoid paying any \nFederal income taxes, it actually received a $156 million refund from \nthe IRS. So middle-class Americans, people in Vermont and all over this \ncountry who are working 50 and 60 hours in order to provide the \nnecessary income they need to pay the bills for their families, those \nfolks go out and they pay their income tax. They may not be too happy \nabout it, but they understand that in a civilized society you have to \npay taxes to pay the bills of government. Not ExxonMobil. The most \nprofitable corporation in the history of the world last year not only \navoided paying any Federal income taxes, it actually received a $156 \nmillion refund from the IRS. If that makes sense to anybody--maybe it \ndoes--it surely does not make sense to me.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the page of \nExxonMobil's 10-K report to the SEC that discloses this information.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4740]]\n\n            United States Securities and Exchange Commission\n      Form 10-K--Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of \n                  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n\n                                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--18.

ExxonMobil is the same huge oil company that has had \nenough money to provide a $398 million retirement package to its \noutgoing CEO, Lee Raymond, just a few years ago. They made more money \nthan any corporation in the history of the world last year. They did \nnot pay any Federal taxes. In fact, they got a huge refund from the \nFederal Government. And some years ago this particular corporation paid \nout $398 million in retirement package for its CEO. I do not think that \nmakes a whole lot of sense. I think we ought to end that nonsense and \nend it now. This country is at record-breaking deficits. We cannot \nallow large corporations such as ExxonMobil not to pay taxes.\n  ExxonMobil is the same oil company that is making its profits by \ngouging consumers at the pump by charging higher and higher prices for \ngasoline even when demand is low and supply is high. In Vermont, it is \n$2.85 a gallon. Working people are having a hard time paying high \nprices for gas. It does not matter whether demand is high or low, it \nappears that gas prices go up. This amendment would begin to make sure \nthat ExxonMobil, BP, and the other big oil companies pay at least a \nminimal amount of their huge profits in taxes to the Federal \nGovernment. That, it seems to me, is the very least we can do.\n  Let's be clear. As millions of Americans have lost their jobs, their \nhomes, their life savings, and their ability to send their kids to \ncollege as a result of this Wall Street-induced recession, we cannot \ncontinue to allow big oil companies to make out like bandits. Enough is \nenough. In the first quarter of 2009, when our gross domestic product \nshrank by 6.4 percent, and overall corporate profits decreased by 5.25 \npercent, the five largest oil companies were still able to earn over \n$13 billion in profits. That is in the middle of a severe recession.\n  As this chart shows, the combined annual profits of the five largest \noil companies during the last 10 years--these five companies, \nExxonMobil, Shell, BP, ChevronTexaco, and ConocoPhillips--earned over \n$750 billion in profits. Not bad. Not bad.\n  During the first quarter of this year, big oils' profits increased by \n85 percent. Instead of using these profits to invest in renewable \nenergy and to prevent oilspills, big oil and gas companies are \nprimarily using this money to buy back their own stock and enrich their \nCEOs.\n  According to the American Petroleum Institute, between 2000 and 2007, \nthe entire oil and gas industry invested only $1.5 billion in North \nAmerican nonhydrocarbon investments aimed at reducing the Nation's \ndependance on oil. That is less than one-quarter of 1 percent of their \ntotal profits during this time period. So here you have these companies \nmaking huge profits. They are not reinvesting that money in making our \ncountry cleaner and in moving us away from fossil fuels.\n  Meanwhile, the CEOs of the big oil companies have received hundreds \nof millions of dollars in retirement packages and total compensation. \nOver the past 5 years Ray Irani, the CEO of Occidental Petroleum, \nreceived over $725 million in total compensation--$725 million, in a 5-\nyear period, is not too sloppy.\n  John Hess, the CEO of the Hess Oil Company, has received over $240 \nmillion in total compensation; David Lesar, the CEO of Halliburton, has \nreceived over $114 million; James Mulva, the CEO of ConocoPhillips, has \nreceived over $95 million; and Rex Tillerson, the CEO of ExxonMobil, \nmade over $30 million in total compensation over the past 5 years.\n  Further, since 2002, the five largest oil companies have repurchased \nalmost $270 billion of their own stock. When we talk about asking the \noil companies to start paying their fair share of taxes, we should also \nremember that the Federal Government has provided very generous \nsubsidies above and beyond tax breaks for the oil companies. As this \nchart shows, according to the Environmental Law Institute, from 2002 to \n2008, the United States provided more than $70 billion for fossil fuel \nsubsidies, compared to just $12 billion for wind, solar, geothermal, \nbiomass, and other renewable energy. This makes no sense at all. We \nhave got to put an end to the outrageous tax breaks and subsidies we \nhave been giving to oil and gas companies.\n  But that is not all this amendment would do. This amendment would \nalso invest $10 billion into the Energy Efficiency and Conservation \nBlock Grant Program. The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nprovided $3.2 billion for this highly successful program. It is already \nhaving a very positive impact in creating jobs, in saving energy in all \n50 States of our country.\n  I am now quoting from a letter sent, in support of the $10 billion \nblock grant funding that this amendment provides, from Tom Cochran, the \nexecutive director of the U.S. Conference of Mayors. This is what Mr. \nCochran says:\n\n       Throughout the United States more than 1,200 cities are now \n     receiving direct funding under the EECBG program. We strongly \n     support your efforts to secure predictable and ongoing \n     funding for the EECBG program allowing the nation to continue \n     to invest in these successful local energy and climate \n     initiatives which have been shown to reduce energy use, \n     harmful greenhouse gas emissions and environmental \n     degradation.\n\n  Let me give you some examples of how this program, of which this \namendment would provide $10 billion over a 5-year period, is working. \nThis program is helping to build wind turbines in Carmel, IN, to power \na city sewer treatment plant. It is being used in Salt Like City, UT, \nto provide loans to businesses to make energy efficiency upgrades. It \nis being used in Columbus, OH, to make 29 public buildings more energy \nefficient. It is being used in Portland, ME, to retrofit 55 public \nbuildings. It is being used in Miami to convert landfill gas into the \nproduction of electricity. It is being used in New York City to help \nhomeowners and businesses with energy efficiency and renewable energy \nloans, among many other areas.\n  I know in my State of Vermont, dozens and dozens of communities and\n\n[[Page S4741]]\n\nschools are using this money to make their buildings more energy \nefficient and, in some cases, move to sustainable energy. We need to \nkeep these investments in energy efficiency and conservation going. \nThat is exactly what this amendment would do to the tune of $10 \nbillion.\n  Finally, this amendment would dedicate $25 billion for deficit \nreduction, $10 billion for the block grant program to make our country \nmore energy efficient. And the $25 billion for deficit reduction at a \ntime of record-breaking deficits and debt, we simply cannot continue to \ngive oil and gas companies huge tax breaks.\n  I know it is easy for some of my colleagues to come to the floor and \ntalk about the deficit, talk about the debt we are leaving our kids and \ngrandkids. It makes for great rhetoric. But, occasionally, you are \ngoing to have to stand up if you are serious about the debt and deficit \nand take on some of those very powerful special interests who are \ngetting huge tax breaks, do not need those tax breaks and do not \ndeserve those tax breaks. It is more important to protect our kids and \ngrandchildren here and the deficit than it is to give tax breaks to \nExxonMobil. When it comes down to it, this amendment asks a very simple \nquestion: Which side are you on? Are you on the side of big oil and gas \ncompanies, companies that year after year after year are making huge \nprofits or are you on the side of reducing the deficit, reducing our \ndependence on oil, saving consumers and businesses money on their \nenergy bills, and saving the planet we live on? That is what this \namendment is about.\n  I understand that there will be opposition to this amendment. I have \nseen it surface already. After all, since 1990, the oil and gas \nindustry has made over $238 million in campaign contributions. And over \nthe past 2 years alone, this industry has spent $210 million on \nlobbying, probably half a billion dollars since 1990 on campaign \ncontributions and lobbying. They have gotten a lot for that, I must \nconfess. For that investment, they have gotten a lot in tax breaks and \nsubsidies. But I think now is the time, given the oilspill in the gulf, \nbecause of the threat of global warming, in order to clean up our \ncountry, in order to create jobs and energy efficiency and sustainable \nenergy, we have got to say to big oil: Sorry. No more. No more. You are \ngoing to have to start paying your fair share of taxes so we can \ntransform our energy system and so we can begin to deal with this very \nserious deficit problem.\n  This amendment is the right thing to do for deficit reduction. It is \nthe right thing to do to transform our energy system. It is the right \nthing to do for consumers. I ask my colleagues to vote for the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about one of the \nthings that I love most about Montana--the North Fork of the Flathead \nRiver. Everyone who experiences the Flathead Valley in northwestern \nMontana is awed by its pristine waters, larger than life landscapes, \nand breathtaking views. With its headwaters in British Columbia, the \nNorth Fork of the Flathead River forms the western boundary of Glacier \nNational Park--it is one of the last untouched places on our continent.\n  For decades, the North Fork has been threatened by oil and gas and \nmining proposals in British Columbia. For the last 35 years, I have \nbattled these proposals, one by one. After 35 years of work, we are \nbeginning a new chapter of international cooperation in our efforts to \nprotect the North Fork. I am very pleased that Conoco Phillips is a \npart of this.\n  In February of this year, British Columbia and Montana announced \ntheir intent to prevent mining, oil and gas, and coalbed methane \ndevelopment in the North Fork on the lands they control. Senator Tester \nand I pledged to do our part to establish extra protections south of \nthe border, where 90 percent of the North Fork watershed is already \nfederally owned.\n  So, on March 4, we introduced the North Fork Watershed Protection \nAct, S. 3075, which bans future mining, oil and gas, and coalbed \nmethane development on Federal lands in the watershed. The bill enjoys \nsupport from business and conservation interests alike from all over \nthe State, including the Kalispell Chamber, Whitefish Mountain Resort, \nthe Billings Rod and Gun Club, and a long list of others. This breadth \nof support shows the importance of the North Fork for Montana's economy \nas well as our State's outdoor heritage.\n  There are some current leases in the area that have been dormant \nsince the late 1980s, when a court decision found that they were \nimproperly issued. Senator Tester and I have been engaged in active \ndiscussions with the current owners to retire these old leases. On \nApril 28, I was proud to announce that ConocoPhillips, the primary \nleaseholder in the North Fork watershed, elected to voluntarily \nrelinquish its interest in 108 Federal oil and gas leases covering \napproximately 169,000 acres, representing 71 percent of the leased area \nin the North Fork watershed.\n  ConocoPhillips should be commended for this decision and their \nstewardship of this very unique, special place. Their action is further \nevidence of the consensus that exists between the United States and \nCanada and among businesses and conservationists, that the withdrawal \nof these Federal lands from leasing is the only path forward.\n  In 1975, during my first term in the House of Representatives, I \nintroduced a bill to designate the Flathead River as a Wild and Scenic \nRiver. It was designated in 1976. For me, that began a lifelong effort \nto protect the North Fork. At that time I said:\n\n       A hundred years from now, and perhaps much sooner, those \n     who follow us will survey what we have left behind.\n\n  This action brings us one step closer to ensuring that that every \nMontanan, every American, and every Canadian who follows us will have \nthe opportunity to share our feeling of awestruck wonder that such a \nplace still exists, almost untouched by the modern world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/09/senate-section/article/S4741-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4741-S4742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DONALD C. STONE\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize Donald C. \nStone, who is one of the most experienced members on the staff of the \nSenate Select Committee on Intelligence who has brought unique skills \nto the committee during his tenure. Friday, June 11 will mark Don's \nlast day in government.\n  After 27 years, Don will be leaving the public sector and taking on \nnew challenges. He has had an extraordinary career, mostly in the \nsecret world of secured offices while he served his country well \noverseeing our Nation's intelligence agencies.\n  Don comes from this area. He grew up in Maryland and received a \nbachelor of arts in business administration and a master's in business \nadministration from Loyola College in Baltimore. He now lives in Falls \nChurch, VA, with his wife Dana and their two sons Robert and Andrew.\n  Don did not waste any time getting into the national security world. \nRight out of graduate school he went to work at the Central \nIntelligence Agency with the inspector general's audit staff. He worked \nthere for 11 years on very sensitive classified projects both here and \nabroad, sometimes under very trying circumstances. While working with \nthe CIA inspector general, Don had a rotational assignment with the \nNational Reconnaissance Office's inspector general audit staff from \n1993 to 1995, where he worked to make sure our Nation's spy satellite \nprograms were run well and that the tax dollars spent in the secret \nworld of spy agencies would pass muster if exposed to the light of \nreview.\n\n[[Page S4742]]\n\n  Don first came to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in June \n1995 to serve as an auditor on the committee's audit team. The \ncommittee had created the audit staff in 1988 to provide `` a credible \nindependent arm for Committee review of covert action programs and \nother specific Intelligence Community functions and issues.'' Don's \naptitude for this work quickly led to his being named the committee's \nchief of the audit staff in September 1998. Mr. Stone then crossed the \nCapitol to work on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \nin March 2005 as the deputy staff director of the Subcommittee on \nOversight. We were fortunate enough to bring Don back to the SSCI in \nJanuary 2007 as our director of Audit and Evaluations.\n  During his time on the committee, Don has completed many reviews and \naudits to assure us that our intelligence agencies spent our tax money \nappropriately and legally, and that they managed their programs \neffectively within the law.\n  Over the years, Don has conducted audits of major acquisition \nsystems, major espionage cases and their related damage assessments, \nthe Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, budget and personnel growth, \nand information sharing. He has led the committee's review of financial \nstatements of nominees for key intelligence positions, for keeping up \nwith what the inspectors general of the intelligence community agencies \nwere investigating, and for reviewing dozens of whistleblower and other \ncomplaint cases. Don has been properly persistent in reminding \nintelligence agencies of their need to do better.\n  He is also largely responsible for the effort, underway for the past \nseveral years, to push intelligence agencies to improve their financial \nauditability. A notable example of this was last year when the \ncommittee expressed concern and displeasure over the lack of progress \nthat one intelligence agency was making toward being able to produce an \nauditable financial statement. I received a call from the agency's \ndirector, who was not very pleased about the committee's critical view. \nThe committee staff and the agency staff met, and due in large part to \nDon's thorough research, the agency came away with a clearer picture of \nwhat steps it needed to take and, I hope, appreciative of the \nconstructive role the committee was playing.\n  As this body of work reflects, Don has the talents required to \nconduct congressional oversight. He is able to see both the forest and \nthe trees, and when necessary he can examine the individual leaves and \nroots. He has an extraordinary ability to focus on the details without \nlosing knowledge of how they fit within a larger context. We have \nbenefitted as a nation when he has cast his gaze on the workings of our \nnational security apparatus.\n  At home he practices his attention to detail on his model car \ncollection and taking up the hammer and paint brush to do the home \nimprovement work he truly enjoys.\n  I would be remiss without noting Don's passion for the local sports \nteams. Don lives and breathes the burgundy and gold of his hometown \nWashington Redskins and his residence is covered in red, white and blue \nnot just because he's a true patriot, but also because he's an avid fan \nof the Washington Capitals hockey team.\n  Don's love of hockey has rubbed off on his two sons who now play on \nthe ice and led him to take active roles in organizing and managing a \nlocal hockey league. This year, he is serving as the president of that \nleague and we can be certain the games are starting on time, the kids \nare playing hard and having fun, and the league's finances are in \norder.\n  Even with his retirement from government service, Don will be putting \nhis skills and expertise to use in the private sector, but still \nworking in the intelligence arena.\n  Donald Stone has worked in the shadows both in the clandestine world \nof our Nation's spy agencies and out of the public limelight. It is my \npleasure that now, as he leaves public service, we can openly \nacknowledge and praise the admirable work he has done to keep our \nNation safe.\n  Mr. Stone, on behalf of myself and all the members of the Senate \nSelect Committee on Intelligence during your years of service, I am \npleased to say on the Senate floor how greatly we appreciate your fine \nwork and your exemplary career. We will miss your insights and your \nprofessionalism. And I wish you all the best as you move on to the next \nstage of your life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/09/senate-section/article/S4742-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4742]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                  TRIBUTE TO GRACE AND CHARLES MAHONY\n\n Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, today I ask my colleagues to join \nme in recognizing the 125th anniversary of Olive Grove Baptist Church \nin Choudrant, LA.\n  In 1885, a small group of determined men and women founded what would \nbecome Olive Grove Baptist Church under the guidance of Rev. Andrew \nMoaten. Worshipping alongside Reverend Moaten were Deacon Henry Waters, \nTaylor and Martha Waters, Sister Mattie Hamilton, Deacon Mike Taylor, \nand Deacon State Wright.\n  These early members held services in a brush arbor for about 1 year \nbefore the first small structure, originally lit by kerosene lamps, was \nbuilt. As the needs of its parishioners grew, so did Olive Grove \nBaptist Church. A new church was completed in 1926 under the guidance \nof Rev. H.J. Jordan, and in 1944 members began to raise money for yet \nanother church. A storm destroyed the church in 1986, and current \nmembers now worship in the fifth Olive Grove Church to stand in \nChoudrant.\n  The church is currently led by the Rev. Derric Chatman, a dynamic \nyoung pastor. Current members, children of deceased members, \nindividuals with community ties, and the general public continue to \nsupport the church with generous financial backing, allowing the church \nto remain active in its various ministries and demonstrating the \nimportant role that Olive Grove Baptist plays in the local community.\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in congratulating Olive Grove \nBaptist Church on their 125th anniversary and in wishing them the best \nfor years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/09/senate-section/article/S4742-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4742-S4743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO CHARLES A. HURLEY\n\n Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Charles \nA. ``Chuck'' Hurley upon his retirement as chief executive officer of \nMothers Against Drunk Driving. Chuck is a true safety advocate, and his \nlongstanding commitment to that cause is more than worthy of \nrecognition.\n  Throughout my time in the Senate, Chuck and I have worked together on \nnumerous highway safety initiatives, including the national age 21 \ndrinking law, the national .08 BAC standard, primary seat belt laws, \nand teen driver graduated licensing programs. Chuck was instrumental in \ncreating the ``Click it or Ticket'' Campaign in North Carolina, \nestablishing the Nation's first pilot program to ensure drivers and \npassengers were buckling up. He also helped to launch the National SAFE \nKIDS Campaign, the national nonprofit organization dedicated solely to \nthe prevention of unintentional childhood injury.\n  A longtime supporter of MADD, Chuck has been involved in the \norganization since the very beginning. He attended MADD's first \nnational press conference in Washington, DC, in 1980, and strongly \nsupported the passage of my National 21 Minimum Drinking Age Act in \n1984. From 1993 to 1998, Chuck served on the MADD National Board of\n\n[[Page S4743]]\n\nDirectors and was later named to the MADD National Board of Advisors.\n  In 2005, Chuck became MADD CEO. Since then, he has developed MADD's \nCampaign to Eliminate Drunk Driving, which successfully encourages \nStates to require drunk drivers to use an ignition interlock device. He \nhas also been an outspoken advocate for the development of advanced \nalcohol detection technology, which could someday completely eliminate \ndrunk driving.\n  Chuck graduated with a bachelor of arts in political science from \nDickinson College in Pennsylvania. From 1968 to 1970, he served in the \nU.S. Navy as an intelligence officer in Taipei, Taiwan. Chuck then \nworked for Congressman Bill Steiger, where he helped create the \nOccupational Safety and Health Administration.\n  In the early 1980s, Chuck helped found the Lifesavers Conference, \nwhich is dedicated to reducing the tragic toll of deaths and injuries \non our Nation's roadways. Chuck also served as the vice president of \nthe Transportation Safety Group for the National Safety Council and as \nthe executive director of the Council's Air Bag and Seat Belt Safety \nCampaign. In addition, Chuck served as a senior official at the \nInsurance Institute for Highway Safety.\n  Chuck has dedicated his career to making our highways safer for \ndrivers and passengers. On behalf of everyone who uses our Nation's \nroadways, I am honored to express my gratitude and congratulations to \nCharles A. ``Chuck'' Hurley and extend my best wishes for a long and \nhappy retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/09/senate-section/article/S4743-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING SMITH & WESSON\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Smith & \nWesson in Houlton, ME--an Aroostook County economic anchor and an \nundeniable beacon for businesses in our great State and the Nation, \nespecially in these precarious economic times. Indeed, the name Smith & \nWesson has been synonymous with excellence since 1852, and I am proud \nto say it has been part of Maine's history since 1966 when the Houlton \nfacility first opened its doors.\n  Over the Easter recess, I was privileged to visit the Smith & Wesson \nplant where its employees, in demonstrating their meticulous \ncraftsmanship in manufacturing handcuffs and handguns, truly exemplify \nMaine's legendary work ethic and can-do spirit. As I toured the \nfacility and spoke with these committed team members, I had the \nopportunity to learn about the vital role they play in assembling their \nproducts--and I couldn't help but beam with pride in their dedication \nto their craft. Their inexhaustible energy was palpable throughout \ntheir newly expanded plant, which now allows for shifts 24 hours a day, \n7 days a week.\n  I was also impressed to meet and speak with Smith & Wesson's plant \nmanager, Terry Wade, who has been with the branch since 1972. Terry \nclearly is deeply devoted to his work as he labors side by side with \nhis employees. A humble individual who credits even his own successes \nto others, Terry is a force for innovation--and as I discovered, he \ninvented a handcuff model, currently being produced by the company, for \nwhich he holds a patent. Terry is a shining testament to the loyalty \nand drive of Houlton's Smith & Wesson workers, many of whom have been \nthere for more than 20 years.\n  And let me just say, what began over 40 years ago as a small \nmanufacturing arm of the larger parent company--making parts for \nrevolver assembly and shipping just one 40-pound box of parts a week \nfrom a 2,000 square foot building--has evolved steadily from a staff of \n18 to today's 160 dedicated men and women who are second to none. In \nfact, the Houlton plant just completed a hiring phase which, frankly, \nis outstanding when we consider the tenuous state of our economy and \nthe herculean challenge of creating jobs. Individuals and families are \nstill experiencing the troubling effects of the worst recession since \nWorld War II, with unemployment hovering near 10 percent nationwide, so \nI and, indeed, all of us in this Chamber cannot commend the Houlton \nfacility enough for bucking this trend and hiring more staff.\n  In addition to developing Smith & Wesson's exemplary line of \nrestraints, the Houlton plant also makes all of the company's semi-\nautomatic rimfire pistols, the Walther PPK and PPK/S, and the SW1911 \nSeries pistols. Due in large part to the exceptional team in Houlton, \nSmith & Wesson ranks first in the supply of restraints to law \nenforcement and their weapons are highly sought after by police \nagencies, security divisions, and military organizations--who surely \nall recognize the invaluable expertise and reliable quality that goes \ninto each item.\n  The accomplishments of this phenomenal enterprise in Maine are \nremarkable. In March 2009, the plant reached an extraordinary milestone \nwhen after 30 years of producing high quality handcuffs, it made its \nsix millionth pair. What a landmark occasion for a signature product \nused worldwide. And with the recent increase in the workforce--not to \nmention an impressive half-million dollar expansion to their firing \nrange--Smith & Wesson in Houlton was recently named Houlton Business of \nthe Year for 2009--a well-deserved accolade.\n  President Theodore Roosevelt once said that, ``far and away the best \nprize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth \ndoing.'' Those words could not ring more true as we recognize this \nAmerican success story. Smith & Wesson could not be more emblematic of \nthe world-class industry and workforces that are associated with our \ngreat State of Maine. No wonder our State motto is ``Dirigo'' or ``I \nlead,'' as that is just what this Smith & Wesson plant in Houlton has \nbeen doing for more than 44 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/09/senate-section/article/S4743-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING SMITH & WESSON\n\n Ms. SNOWE.

Due in large part to the exceptional team in Houlton, \nSmith & Wesson ranks first in the supply of restraints to law \nenforcement and their weapons are highly sought after by police \nagencies, security divisions, and military organizations--who surely \nall recognize the invaluable expertise and reliable quality that goes \ninto each item.\n  The accomplishments of this phenomenal enterprise in Maine are \nremarkable. In March 2009, the plant reached an extraordinary milestone \nwhen after 30 years of producing high quality handcuffs, it made its \nsix millionth pair. What a landmark occasion for a signature product \nused worldwide. And with the recent increase in the workforce--not to \nmention an impressive half-million dollar expansion to their firing \nrange--Smith & Wesson in Houlton was recently named Houlton Business of \nthe Year for 2009--a well-deserved accolade.\n  President Theodore Roosevelt once said that, ``far and away the best \nprize that life has to offer is the chance to work hard at work worth \ndoing.'' Those words could not ring more true as we recognize this \nAmerican success story. Smith & Wesson could not be more emblematic of \nthe world-class industry and workforces that are associated with our \ngreat State of Maine. No wonder our State motto is ``Dirigo'' or ``I \nlead,'' as that is just what this Smith & Wesson plant in Houlton has \nbeen doing for more than 44 years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/09/senate-section/article/S4743-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               RECOGNIZING MONROE, LOUISIANA ROTARY CLUB\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, tday I am proud to recognize the \nmembers of the Monroe, LA, Rotary Club who have served our country \nhonorably during war.\n  I would like to thank Charles C. Archibald, Raymond Armstrong, John \nBaker, Robert Barham, Ronald Blate, Reneau Breard, Lamar Buffington, \nRoy Cole, Jr., Barry Delcambre, Sam Donald, R.D. Farr, Leon Garfield, \nHershal Gentry, James Greenlaw, William Guy, Harvey Hales, Robert \nHammock, Howard John, Charles Johns, Barney Jones, Billy Lea, Earl \nLingle, Miles Luke, Jim Myers, Ray Patron, Gregg Riley, Jack Tarver, \nElbert L. Via and George Weaks for their courageous military service \nduring wartime and for continued civic service in the greater Monroe \narea.\n  With the motto ``Service Above Self,'' it is no surprise that these \nmen would be inclined to be members of Rotary. Their lifetime of \nservice is exhibited not only in service to their fellow citizens \nduring a time of war but also in continued commitment to their \ncommunity.\n  Rotary's four-way test asks four questions of all things members \nthink, say, and do. These questions are: Is it the truth? Is it fair to \nall concerned? Will it build goodwill and better friendships? Will it \nbe beneficial to all concerned? These four simple questions have proven \nto be excellent guidelines for a life of service. We thank these men \nfor serving the Monroe community with these principles. The Monroe \nRotary Club has sponsored many local projects including Boy Scouts, \nGirl Scouts, youth baseball, the Food Bank of Northeast Louisiana, and \nthe Salvation Army, to name just a few.\n  Thus, today, I honor these veterans for their distinguished service \nin the U.S. armed services during wartime, and for their continued \nservice to the State of Louisiana in the Monroe Rotary Club.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/09/senate-section/article/S4743-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4743]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/09/senate-section/article/S4743-4", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4743-S4744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n[[Page S4744]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/09/senate-section/article/S4744-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4744]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   REPORT RELATIVE TO THE SUSPENSIONS UNDER SECTION 902(A)(3) OF THE \n FOREIGN RELATIONS AUTHORIZATION ACT, FISCAL YEARS 1990 AND 1991 WITH \nRESPECT TO ISSUANCE OF PERMANENT MUNITIONS EXPORT LICENSES FOR EXPORTS \nTO THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA INSOFAR AS SUCH RESTRICTIONS PERTAIN \n TO THE LIGHT SCANNER 32 SYSTEM USED FOR GENE MUTATION GENOTYPING FOR \n                 INDIVIDUALIZED CANCER TREATMENT--PM 61\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States which was referred to the \nCommittee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 902(b)(2) of the \nForeign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Years 1990 and 1991 (Public \nLaw 101-246)(the ``Act''), and as President of the United States, I \nhereby report to the Congress that it is in the national interest of \nthe United States to terminate the suspensions under section 902(a)(3) \nof the Act with respect to the issuance of permanent munitions export \nlicenses for exports to the People's Republic of China insofar as such \nrestrictions pertain to the LightScanner' 32 System used for \ngene mutation genotyping for individualized cancer treatment.

A bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 15 South Main Street in Sharon, Massachusetts, as \nthe ``Michael C. Rothberg Post Office''; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Government Affairs.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I am proud to introduce legislation to \ndesignate the United States Postal Service in Sharon, Massachusetts, as \nthe Michael C. Rothberg Post Office.\n  Michael Craig Rothberg was born and raised in Sharon. Upon graduation \nfrom Sharon High School, Michael earned both undergraduate and master's \ndegree in math and computer science from McGill University in Montreal. \nUnfortunately, Michael Rothberg's life was tragically cut short on the \nmorning of September 11, 2001, at age 39, while working in his Cantor \nFitzgerald office on the 104th floor of the World Trade Center.\n  During his lifetime, Michael Rothberg created much more than a \nsuccessful professional life. He used his resources generously \ncontributing not only financial support, but also his time and energy \nfor causes he believed in. He worked hard for causes such as the Dana \nFarber Cancer Institute's Jimmy Fund, the Multiple Sclerosis \nFoundation, and Mutual Funds against Cancer. His spirit is remembered \nthrough many contributions to the Town of Sharon through the Michael C. \nRothberg Memorial Scholarship and other notable charitable \ncontributions to students, athletes and the community of Sharon, \nMassachusetts.\n  The people of Sharon, Massachusetts are very proud of Michael and the \nexample he set. It is fitting then that when people go to or pass by \nthe post office in Sharon, they will be reminded of a local man who \nunderstood how important it is to give back to causes that touch your \nheart.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY:\n  S. 3466. A bill to require restitution for victims of criminal \nviolations of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I introduce the Environmental Crimes \nEnforcement Act, ECEA, common sense legislation that will ensure that \nthose who destroy the lives and livelihoods of Americans through \nenvironmental crime are held accountable.\n  It has been 50 days since the collapse of British Petroleum's \nDeepwater Horizon Oil Rig, which killed 11 men. Oil continues to gush \ninto the Gulf of Mexico, and deadly contaminants are washing up on the \nshores and wetlands of Gulf Coast States. This catastrophe threatens \nthe livelihood of many thousands of people throughout the region, as \nwell as precious natural resources and habitats. The people responsible \nfor this catastrophe must be held accountable; they, not the American \ntaxpayers, should pay for the damage and the recovery. The bill I \nintroduce today aims to deter environmental crime, protect and \ncompensate its victims, and encourage accountability among corporate \nactors.\n  First, ECEA will deter schemes by Big Oil and other corporations and \nindustries that damage our environment and hurt hardworking Americans \nby increasing sentences for environmental crimes. All too often, \ncorporations treat fines and monetary penalties as merely a cost of \ndoing business to be factored against profits. To deter criminal \nbehavior by corporations, it is important to have laws resulting in \nprison time. In that light, this bill directs the United States \nSentencing Commission to amend the sentencing guidelines for \nenvironmental crimes to reflect the seriousness of these crimes.\n  Criminal penalties for Clean Water Act violations are not as severe \nas for other white-collar crimes, despite the widespread harm such \ncrimes can cause. As the current crisis makes clear, Clean Water Act \noffenses can have serious consequences on people's lives and \nlivelihoods, which should be reflected in the sentences given to the \ncriminals who commit them. This bill takes a reasonable approach, \nasking the Sentencing Commission to study the issue and raise \nsentencing guidelines appropriately, and it will have a real deterrent \neffect.\n  This bill also aims to help victims of environmental crime--the \npeople who lose their livelihoods, their communities, and even their \nloved ones--reclaim their natural and economic resources. To do that, \nECEA makes restitution mandatory for criminal Clean Water Act \nviolations.\n  Currently, restitution in environmental crimes--even crimes that \nresult in death--is discretionary, and only available under limited \ncircumstances. Under this bill, those who commit Clean Water Act \noffenses would have to compensate the victims of these offense for \ntheir losses. That restitution will help the people of the Gulf Coast \nrebuild their coastline and wetlands, their fisheries, and their \nlivelihoods should criminal liability be found.\n  Importantly, this bill will allow the families of those killed to be \ncompensated for criminal wrongdoing. As we have seen in the BP case, \narbitrary laws prevent those killed in tragedies like this one from \nbringing civil lawsuits for compensation. This bill would ensure that, \nwhen a crime is committed, the criminal justice system can provide for \nrestitution to victims, providing some small measure of security for \nthe families of those killed.\n  This bill takes two common sense steps--well-reasoned increases in \nsentences and mandatory restitution for environmental crime. These \nmeasures are tough, but fair. They are important steps toward deterring \ncriminal conduct that can cause environmental and economic disaster and \ntoward helping those who have suffered so much from the wrongdoing of \nBig Oil and other large corporations. I hope all Senators will join me \nin supporting this important reform.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S4747]]\n\n                                S. 3466\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to designate as wilderness certain public land in the \nCherokee National Forest in the State of Tennessee, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Corker and myself, \nI rise to introduce the Tennessee Wilderness Act of 2010. The \nlegislation will implement an important next step in conservation for \nsome of the wildest, most beautiful and pristine areas in east \nTennessee near where I live. To say that these are among the wildest, \nmost pristine and beautiful areas sets a very high bar since the region \nis home to the Appalachian Mountains, and our Nation's most visited \nnational park, a World Heritage site--in fact, one of the most visited \nsites in the world--the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, much of \nwhich is managed as if it were a wilderness area.\n  From growing up in these mountains and my many years of hiking the \nquiet trails of the Cherokee National Forest, I can attest that the \nwilderness areas we protected there are something very special. \nCongress began protecting wilderness areas in the Cherokee National \nForest in 1975, with additional wilderness areas being established by \nthe Tennessee Wilderness Act of 1984 and the Tennessee Wilderness Act \nof 1986. I was Governor of Tennessee during that time. I remember \ntestifying on behalf of and strongly supporting our congressional \ndelegation as we did that. I know sometimes our western friends are \nsurprised to see Tennessee Republicans advocating wilderness, bragging \nabout the fact that the Great Smoky Mountains National Park is managed \nin large extent as if it were a wilderness area and adding certain \nsections of the Cherokee National Forest to wilderness.\n  The Federal Government doesn't own very much of our land, but we have \nlots of visitors. Two or three times as many people visited the Great \nSmokies as visit Yellowstone. We have lots of visitors but very little \nFederal land. We like to protect it. We like to have clean air. We like \nto enjoy it ourselves.\n  We like the Cherokee National Forest because it gives us an \nopportunity to do some things we can't do in the national park. We can \nhunt, fish, ride horses, camp, do things in a great many ways. I \nbelieve this legislation, the Tennessee Wilderness Act of 2010, will \ncreate for Tennessee families and especially Tennessee youngsters, who \nneed to be outdoors and away from the computer screens and television \nscreens, an even more attractive opportunity to enjoy this beautiful \npart of our natural heritage.\n  I emphasize that the lands that will be designated as wilderness by \nthis legislation are already Federal lands. They are part of the \nCherokee National Forest. The areas covered were recommended for \nwilderness by the U.S. Forest Service in the development of its \ncomprehensive 2004 forest plan which included extensive opportunities \nfor public comment. Those areas have been managed as if they were \nwilderness areas since that time.\n  This new bill will officially designate as wilderness nearly 20,000 \nacres as recommended by the Forest Service. The bill establishes one \nnew wilderness area, the 9,038 acre Upper Bald River Wilderness in \nMonroe County. This new area complements the existing Bald River Gorge \nWilderness. It lies just south of that existing area, separated only by \nthe Bald River Road, which will, of course, remain an open public road.\n  By protecting the Upper Bald River Wilderness as well as the existing \nwilderness area, we will be protecting most of the Bald River \nwatershed. Excellent trails traverse the Upper Bald River area, \nincluding the Benton MacKaye Trail, offering excellent hiking, \nbackpacking, and horseback riding, as well as access for hunters and \nfishermen.\n  The rest of the lands designated as wilderness in this legislation \nare relatively small but important additions to some of the areas \nCongress established in 1975, 1984 and 1986. They have the effect of \nbetter protecting not only ecosystems and watersheds but also the \ndiverse recreational value of these areas.\n  At the southern end of the Cherokee National Forest is one of the \nlargest national forest wilderness complexes in the Southeastern United \nStates. It comprises the Cohutta Wilderness, most of which lies in \nGeorgia, and the Big Frog Wilderness in Polk County, TN. The new \nlegislation makes a small but important addition of 348 acres to the \nBig Frog Wilderness. The Big Frog-Cohutta combination, with adjacent \nprimitive areas, creates the largest track of wilderness on national \nforest lands in the Eastern United States.\n  In the same way, the new legislation makes two small but important \nadditions to the Little Frog Mountain Wilderness, also in Polk County. \nThese additions, totaling 966 acres, were recommended by the Forest \nService to give more logical boundaries to the Little Frog Mountain \nWilderness and protect the corridor for the Benton MacKaye Trail.\n  In upper east Tennessee, in Unicoi and Washington Counties, this new \nlegislation would add 2,922 acres to the Sampson Mountain Wilderness. \nThis is at the heart of a marvelous scenic region of our State. Along \nthese scenic trails, visitors can see flame azalea, mountain laurel, \nrhododendron, trailing arbutus, crested dwarf iris, mayapple, \nbloodroot, toothwort, magnolia, dogwood, redbud, and many other \nflowering plants, shrubs, and trees. The last 2 or 3 months have been \nthe time of year to visit that area with its many species of shrubs and \ntrees.\n  The 1986 Tennessee Wilderness Act established the Big Laurel Branch \nWilderness in Carter and Johnson Counties at the furthest upper east \nTennessee end of our State. The new legislation proposes to add 4,446 \nacres, including some 4.5 miles of the Appalachian National Scenic \nTrail. The addition lies along the slopes of Iron Mountain just north \nof Watauga Lake, one of the cleanest lakes in America.\n\n  The final element of the new legislation is an important addition to \nthe Joyce Kilmer-Slickrock Wilderness. Here visitors will find perhaps \nthe most impressive stands of virgin eastern forest in the United \nStates. The 1,836-acre addition includes remnant old-growth forest. The \nBenton MacKaye Trail passes through this area, making it a\n\n[[Page S4748]]\n\npopular destination for horseback riders and hikers.\n  This is a simple bill, but it will make a significant contribution \nfor these wild and pristine areas of the Cherokee National Forest.\n  I thank and salute the Cherokee National Forest staff and the many \ncitizens of Tennessee who worked to define these proposals and to build \ngrassroots support. These proposals have broad support from outdoors \nclubs, trail maintenance groups, local businesses, and conservation \norganizations.\n  I specifically want to thank Will Skelton, a Knoxville lawyer who has \nbeen instrumental in conservation for decades in Tennessee. No one has \ndone more to help more families appreciate, enjoy, and hike in the \nCherokee National Forest than has Will Skelton. I thank the Tennessee \nWild group for their role in this proposal.\n  Getting out in the woods and mountains of east Tennessee is an ever \nmore popular activity. People go to the wilderness to experience nature \nmost wild, walking a trail to some resting place where the noises are \ntrees creaking, the smells are of wet moss and leaves, the colors are \npure, and the world is at peace. That is why these protected wilderness \nareas have such immense value for our people, and it is why the value \nwill multiply many times as our world grows more crowded.\n  The foundational statute under which we protect the wilderness areas \nis the 1964 Wilderness Act. The Congress of that time showed \nextraordinary prescience about the threats that destroy wilderness:\n\n       In order to assure that an increasing population, \n     accompanied by expanding settlement and growing \n     mechanization, does not occupy and modify all areas of the \n     United States and its possessions, leaving no lands \n     designated for preservation and protection in their natural \n     condition, it is hereby declared to be the policy of the \n     Congress to secure for the American people of present and \n     future generations the benefits of an enduring resource of \n     wilderness.\n\n  We need more opportunities for young Americans to get away from the \ncomputer screens and into the American outdoors. Eastern Tennessee \nprovides a beautiful place to do that, and this act will provide more \nopportunities for that as well.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nsupport material be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3470\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Even in the current political climate, usually \n     antagonistic members of Congress continue to provide broad \n     support for the federal wilderness program. Good for them.\n       Such bipartisan agreement has been the case since the \n     inception of the Wilderness Act, which was signed into law by \n     President Lyndon B. Johnson 45 years ago this month. At its \n     inception, the program protected 9 million acres in 54 \n     wilderness areas. Today, there are more than 109 million \n     protected acres in 44 states. Expansion efforts, thank \n     goodness, continue unabated.\n       It is a matter of record that the valuable program has \n     grown continuously under both Democratic and Republican \n     administrations. President Ronald Reagan, a Republican, \n     signed more laws to increase wilderness property than any \n     other president, but Democrat occupants of the White House \n     have done their duty as well.\n       President Barack Obama is the latest to do so. In March, he \n     signed a bill that established 52 new wilderness areas and \n     that increased acreage at more than two dozen existing \n     wilderness areas. His signature added more than 2 million \n     acres to the protection program.\n       Every president since Mr. Johnson has now signed \n     legislation to expand wilderness areas. An examination of the \n     record, in fact, shows a steady increase over the years in \n     the number of protected acres regardless of who occupies the \n     White House or which party controls Congress. It's proof that \n     unanimity of purpose in politics is possible if not always \n     procurable.\n       There are now more than 800 wilderness areas in the United \n     States. They range in size from tiny--the five-acre Rocks and \n     Islands Wilderness in California--to the stagger-the-\n     imagination nine million acres in the Wrangeli-Saint Elias \n     Wilderness in Alaska. The latter state has the most protected \n     acreage with more than 57 million acres. Ohio, with 77 acres, \n     has the least.\n       Georgia and Tennessee are in the middle of the pack. The \n     former has nearly 500,000 protected wilderness acres and the \n     latter just over 66,000 acres. Those numbers are likely to \n     grow. Efforts to add acreage to protected wilderness areas \n     and to related areas such as the nearby Cherokee National \n     Forest, already the largest tract of public land in \n     Tennessee, are ongoing. All deserve widespread support.\n       By law, wilderness areas are protected and managed to \n     preserve their natural condition. Use of the land is severely \n     restricted, and properly so, to non-invasive activities such \n     as hiking, backpacking and horseback riding. That's \n     appropriate. Wilderness preservation and protection programs \n     help ensure that future generations can enjoy the nation's \n     patrimony. They also are powerful reminders that we all share \n     an obligation to preserve and to protect such singularly \n     American open spaces.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               OP-ED--Skelton: New Areas Need Protection\n\n           [From the Knoxville News Sentinel, Oct. 24, 2009]\n\n                           (By Will Skelton)\n\n       On Oct. 30, 1984, President Ronald Reagan signed into law a \n     landmark bill that protected many of the outstandingly scenic \n     portions of the southern Cherokee National Forest in \n     Tennessee from timber harvesting, mining and road building.\n       Thousands of Tennesseans and Americans have used and \n     enjoyed those areas protected as wilderness in 1984; without \n     that bill, many\n\n[[Page S4749]]\n\n     such areas would have been clear cut and roads built through \n     them. The areas range from the lofty peaks of the Citico \n     Creek and Big Frog Wildernesses to the waterfalls of the Bald \n     River Wilderness and to the quieter streams of Little Frog \n     Mountain Wilderness.\n       The bill was called the Tennessee Wilderness Act of 1984 \n     and was supported by then-governor Lamar Alexander, then-U.S. \n     representative John J. Duncan, and both of our senators, \n     Howard Baker and James Sasser. The bill protected 32,606 \n     acres (out of a total of 640,000 acres in the Cherokee) in \n     areas known as Big Frog Mountain, Bald River Gorge, Citico \n     Creek, and Little Frog Mountain.\n       Such areas were designated as ``wilderness,'' the highest \n     form of protection for our federally owned public lands. It \n     protects forests ``in perpetuity'' from logging, mining and \n     road building while allowing for traditional activities like \n     hiking, hunting, horseback riding, fishing and camping. \n     Wilderness also protects wildlife habitat, ensures clean \n     water supplies, and sequesters carbon.\n       I was coordinator of the Cherokee National Forest \n     Wilderness Coalition that led the effort to have these areas \n     protected. I edited a guidebook to the Cherokee's trails that \n     was published by University of Tennessee Press (``Hiking \n     Guide to the Cherokee National Forest''), and to which \n     Alexander did the forward for both the first (1992) and \n     second (2005) editions.\n       It has been 25 years since any additional wilderness has \n     been protected in the Cherokee National Forest, in spite of \n     several qualified candidates. These areas include the \n     wonderful Upper Bald River and several additions to existing \n     wilderness areas. The U.S. Forest Service recommended \n     wilderness protection for most of these areas. However, its \n     recommendations can only become ``wilderness'' if Congress \n     approves under the Wilderness Act of 1964.\n       A newly formed coalition, Tennessee Wild (http://\ntnwild.org/), is urging the protection of the additional \n     areas recommended by the forest service.\n       Several points are important to consider regarding this \n     current wilderness proposal:\n       1. The Cherokee National Forest consists of 640,000 acres, \n     roughly the same as the Great Smoky Mountains National Park, \n     with 340,969 in the northern Cherokee and 298,998 in the \n     southern Cherokee. Only 66,389 acres or 10.37 percent of the \n     forest is designated as wilderness; the areas listed above \n     would add only 17,785 acres, so we are talking about a very \n     modest increase.\n       2. No land is to be acquired by the forest service, as the \n     land proposed for wilderness is already owned by the \n     government.\n       3. Pursuant to the forest service's current management \n     plan, the service's recommended areas are currently managed \n     as wilderness. So no additional management or change would be \n     required and, because of the nature of wilderness, its \n     management is extremely low cost.\n       4. No roads would be closed; nor would any facilities be \n     affected as a result of the forest service's recommendation.\n       5. Finally, and maybe most important, the areas recommended \n     for wilderness are the best unprotected scenic and natural \n     areas in the southern Cherokee National Forest.\n       We are hopeful that our current political leaders, \n     especially Rep. John J. Duncan Jr. and Sens. Alexander and \n     Bob Corker, will act to protect these additional areas. Let \n     the words of John Muir, featured recently in the Ken Burns' \n     PBS special on our national parks, inspire us to action: \n     ``Everybody needs beauty as well as bread, places to play in \n     and pray in, where nature may heal and give strength to body \n     and soul.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID:\n  S. 3473.

A bill to provide an optional fast-track procedure the \nPresident may use when submitting rescission requests, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with the Senator \nfrom Delaware, Mr. Carper, and the Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, \nand others in introducing the Reduce Unnecessary Spending Act of 2010, \na bill which effectively gives the President a line item veto to cancel \nwasteful spending.\n  Based on President Obama's proposal, our measure would permit the \nPresident to get expedited consideration in both the House and Senate \nof a package of proposed spending cuts within larger spending bills \nCongress sends to the President. The President would have 45 days from \nwhen the initial spending measure was enacted to submit his proposed \ncuts, and once that package of cuts is sent to the Hill, Congress would \nhave less than a month to act on them. Any savings produced if Congress \nenacts these spending cut packages would go directly to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  Just a few weeks ago, I chaired a hearing of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee's Constitution Subcommittee at which this proposal and \nsimilar proposals were reviewed, and I am pleased to say that the \nconsensus of that hearing is that the bill we are introducing today is \nclearly constitutional.\n  When he took office, President Obama was handed perhaps the worst \neconomic and fiscal mess facing any administration since Franklin \nRoosevelt took office in 1933. The legacy President Obama inherited \nposes a gigantic challenge.\n  There is no magic bullet that will solve all our budget problems. \nCongress has to make some tough decisions, and there will be no \navoiding them if we are to get our fiscal house in order. But we can \ntake some steps that will help Congress make the right decisions, and \nthat can sustain the progress we make.\n  A line-item veto, properly structured and respectful of the \nconstitutionally central role Congress plays, as this legislation is, \ncan help us get back on track.\n  As I noted before, Mr. President, I am joined in this effort by a \nnumber of colleagues, but most notably by Senator Carper and Senator \nMcCain. I have been privileged to work on a number of critical budget \nreforms with Senator Carper. He has long been an advocate of this kind \nof expedited rescission or line item veto authority, and was the lead \nauthor of a similarly structured measure when he served in the other \nbody.\n  I have also been pleased to work with Senator McCain on budget \nmatters. He and I have worked together for the past two decades to \noppose wasteful earmark spending, and more recently I have been pleased \nto work with him on line item veto proposals, including this one.\n  I also thank my colleague from Wisconsin, Congressman Paul Ryan, for \nworking with me on this issue for several years now. He and I belong to \ndifferent political parties, and differ on many issues. But we do share \nat least two things in common--our hometown of Janesville, Wisconsin, \nand an abiding respect for Wisconsin's tradition of fiscal \nresponsibility. Earlier this year, Congressman Ryan raised this issue \nwith President Obama at a meeting in Baltimore, and I thank him for his \nefforts to advance this issue.\n  The bill we introduce today is a significant step forward in our \njoint efforts to provide the President with the kind of authority \nneeded to cut wasteful spending. As I noted earlier, this legislation \nis essentially the bill President Obama proposed just a few weeks ago. \nIt provides the President the ability to get quick and definitive \ncongressional action on cuts to individual programs in large spending \nbills.\n  Currently, the President must choose between vetoing a bill in its \nentirety,\n\n[[Page S4750]]\n\nor signing it and possibly enacting billions of dollars of wasteful \nspending. With this bill, the President will have a third option--\nsigning a spending bill, but then submitting a package of proposed cuts \nfrom that spending bill to Congress for quick review. The package of \ncuts proposed by the President will get an up or down vote in the House \nand, if it passes there, an up or down vote in the Senate.\n  Our line item veto bill covers earmark discretionary spending as well \nas broader non-entitlement spending accounts. The measure excludes \nentitlement spending and tax expenditures from the expedited rescission \napproach. Spending done through entitlements and tax expenditures make \nup an enormous amount of the total spending done by the Federal \nGovernment. However, unlike the programmatic spending done in \ndiscretionary programs, where cuts can be made by zeroing out or \nreducing a number for a specific account, reducing spending in \nentitlements or tax expenditures often requires a change in the \nunderlying policy. Indeed, Congress already has a fast-track procedure \ndesigned specifically for considering legislation that reduces spending \ndone through entitlements and tax expenditures. It is called \nreconciliation, and it was used effectively in the 1990s to reduce the \ndeficit.\n  As I mentioned, a key target of this new line item veto bill is the \nunauthorized earmark spending that too often finds its way into large \nappropriations bills. Earmark spending was what Congressman Ryan and I \ntargeted in our line item veto proposal, and it is the example every \nline-item veto proponent cites when promoting their legislation.\n  When President Bush asked for this kind of authority, the examples he \ngave when citing wasteful spending he wanted to target were \ncongressional earmarks. When Members of the House or Senate tout a new \nline-item veto authority to go after government waste, the examples \nthey give are congressional earmarks. When editorial pages argue for a \nnew line-item veto, they, too, cite congressional earmarks as the \nreason for granting the President this new authority.\n  Unauthorized congressional earmarks are a serious problem. We won't \nsolve our budget problems just by addressing earmarks, but if we are to \nget our fiscal house in order, eliminating earmarks has to be part of \nthe solution. For all the lip service Congress pays to this issue, \nthere are still thousands of earmarked spending provisions enacted \nevery year. Just last year, the Omnibus Appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2009 passed in March of 2009 contained more than 8,000 earmarks \ncosting $7 billion, and the Consolidated Appropriations bill for fiscal \nyear 2010 passed in December of 2009 included nearly 5,000 earmarks, \ncosting $3.7 billion.\n  There is no excuse for a system that allows that kind of wasteful \nspending year after year. And given the unwillingness of Congress to \ndiscipline itself in this regard, it is appropriate to provide the \nPresident some additional authority to seek an up or down vote in \nCongress on proposed cuts in this area of spending.\n  This is not a cure-all. We will not balance the budget just by \npassing a line item veto-like authority for the President. Nor will we \nbalance the budget just by eliminating wasteful earmark spending. But \nwe can make real progress in getting our fiscal house in order, and in \nchanging the culture of Washington which over the last 2 decades has \nseen an explosion of spending done through unauthorized earmarks that \ncircumvent regular congressional review and the scrutiny of the \ncompetitive grant process.\n  Like the measure Congressman Ryan and I introduced, under this \nproposal, wasteful spending doesn't have anywhere to hide. It's out in \nthe open, so that both Congress and the President have a chance to get \nrid of wasteful projects before they begin. The taxpayers--who pay the \nprice for these projects--deserve a process that shows some real fiscal \ndiscipline, and that is what this legislation promotes.\n  President Obama recognizes the pernicious effect earmarks have on the \nentire process. When he asked Congress to take the extraordinary step \nof sending him a massive economic recovery package, he knew such a \nlarge package of spending and tax cuts would naturally attract \nearmarks. He also recognized that were earmarks to be added to the \nbill, it would undermine his ability to get it enacted, so he rightly \ninsisted it be free of earmarks.\n  I am delighted he has stepped forward to propose a new line item \nveto-like authority, and I am especially pleased to be introducing that \nproposal with my colleagues today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3474\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 548\n\n       Whereas the State of Israel, since its founding in 1948, \n     has been a strong and steadfast ally of the United States, \n     standing alone in its commitment to democracy, individual \n     liberty, and free-market principles in the Middle East, a \n     region characterized by instability and violence;\n       Whereas the special bond between the United States and \n     Israel, forged through common values and mutual interests, \n     must never be broken;\n       Whereas Israel has an undeniable right to defend itself \n     against any threat to its security, as does every nation;\n       Whereas Hamas is a terrorist group, formally designated as \n     a Foreign Terrorist Organization by the Secretary of State, \n     and similarly designated by the European Union;\n       Whereas Hamas is committed to the annihilation of Israel \n     and opposes the peaceful resolution of the Israeli-\n     Palestinian conflict;\n       Whereas Hamas took control of the Gaza Strip in 2007 \n     through violent means and has maintained control ever since;\n       Whereas Hamas routinely violates the human rights of the \n     residents of Gaza, including attempting to control and \n     intimidate political rivals through extra-judicial killing, \n     torture, severe beatings, maiming, and arbitrary detentions;\n       Whereas Hamas continues to hold prisoner Israeli Staff \n     Sergeant Gilad Shalit, who was seized on Israeli soil and has \n     been denied basic rights, including contact with the \n     International Red Cross;\n       Whereas the military build-up of Hamas has been enabled by \n     the smuggling of arms and other materiel into Gaza;\n       Whereas the Government of Iran has materially aided and \n     supported Hamas by providing extensive funding, weapons, and \n     training;\n       Whereas, since 2001, Hamas and other Palestinian terrorist \n     organizations have fired more than 10,000 rockets and mortars \n     from Gaza into Israel, killing at least 18 Israelis and \n     wounding dozens more;\n       Whereas approximately 860,000 Israeli civilians, more than \n     12 percent of Israel's population, reside within range of \n     rockets fired from Gaza and live in fear of attacks;\n       Whereas, in 2007, the Government of Israel, out of concern \n     for the safety of its citizens, put in place a legitimate and \n     justified blockade of Gaza, which has been effective in \n     reducing the flow of weapons into Gaza and the firing of \n     rockets from Gaza into southern Israel;\n       Whereas, at the same time, the Government of Egypt imposed \n     a blockade of Gaza from its land border;\n       Whereas, according to Michael Oren, the Israeli Ambassador \n     to the United States, ``If the sea lanes are open to Hamas in \n     Gaza . . . they will acquire thousands of rockets that will \n     threaten every single citizen in the state of Israel and also \n     kill the peace process. . . . Hamas armed with thousands of \n     rockets not\n\n[[Page S4753]]\n\n     only threatens 7,500,000 Israelis but it's the end of the \n     peace process.'';\n       Whereas the Israeli blockade has not hindered the transfer \n     of approximately 1,000,000 tons of humanitarian supplies into \n     Gaza over the last 18 months to aid its 1,500,000 residents;\n       Whereas, on May 28, 2010, the ``Free Gaza'' flotilla, which \n     included the Mavi Marmara and 5 other ships, departed from a \n     port in Turkey and sailed towards Israel's defensive naval \n     blockade of Gaza;\n       Whereas the sponsor of the flotilla was a Turkish \n     organization, the Humanitarian Relief Foundation;\n       Whereas the Humanitarian Relief Foundation has aided al \n     Qaeda in the past, ``basically helping al Qaeda when [Osama] \n     bin Laden started to want to target U.S. soil,'' according to \n     statements by a former French counterterrorism official, in a \n     June 2, 2010, Associated Press interview;\n       Whereas the Humanitarian Relief Foundation has a clear link \n     to Hamas, according to a 2008 order of the Government of \n     Israel, and the Humanitarian Relief Foundation is a member of \n     the Union for Good, a United States-designated terrorist \n     organization created by Hamas leaders in 2000 to help fund \n     Hamas;\n       Whereas there were at least 5 active terrorist operatives \n     among the passengers on the Mavi Marmara, with affiliations \n     with terrorist groups such as al Qaeda and Hamas, according \n     to the Israel Defense Forces;\n       Whereas the flotilla's primary aim was to break the Israeli \n     blockade of Gaza, under the guise of delivering humanitarian \n     aid to the residents of Gaza;\n       Whereas, on May 27, 2010, while the flotilla was moving \n     towards Gaza, one of its organizers admitted, ``This mission \n     is not about delivering humanitarian supplies, it's about \n     breaking Israel's siege on 1,500,000 Palestinians,'' \n     according to news reports;\n       Whereas, based on interviews with Mavi Marmara passengers \n     after the incident, the actual intention of passengers on the \n     Mavi Marmara had been to achieve ``martyrdom'' at the hands \n     of the Israel Defense Forces;\n       Whereas Saleh Al-Azraq, a journalist who was aboard the \n     ship, recounted that, ``The moment the ship set sail, the \n     cries of `Allahu Akbar' began. . . It made you feel as if you \n     were going on an Islamic conquest or raid,'' according to an \n     interview recorded on Al-Hiwar TV on June 4, 2010;\n       Whereas Hussein Orush, a Humanitarian Relief Foundation \n     official, read from the diary of a dead Mavi Marmara \n     passenger: ``The last lines he wrote before the attack were: \n     `Only a short time left before martyrdom. This is the most \n     important stage of my life. Nothing is more beautiful than \n     martyrdom, except for one's love for one's mother. But I \n     don't know what is sweeter--my mother or martyrdom.' '', and \n     also stated, ``All the passengers on board the ship were \n     ready for this outcome. Everybody wanted and was ready to \n     become a martyr. . . . Our goal was to reach Gaza or to die \n     trying. All the ship's passengers were ready for this. IHH \n     was ready for this too.'', according to an interview recorded \n     on Al-Jazeera TV on June 5, 2010;\n       Whereas Ali Haider Banjinin, another dead Mavi Marmara \n     passenger, told his family before departing on the flotilla, \n     ``I am going to be a martyr, I dreamed about it,'' according \n     to news reports in Turkey;\n       Whereas Ali Ekber Yaratilmis, another dead Mavi Marmara \n     passenger, ``always wanted to become a Martyr,'' one of his \n     friends told Al-Hayat Al-Jadida newspaper in an interview on \n     June 3, 2010;\n       Whereas one female passenger on the deck of the Mavi \n     Marmara stated, ``Right now we face one of two happy endings: \n     either martyrdom or reaching Gaza,'' according to Al Jazeera \n     footage taken prior to the incident;\n       Whereas the Government of Israel had extended a reasonable \n     offer to transfer the flotilla's humanitarian cargo to Gaza;\n       Whereas the Mavi Marmara and the other ships of the \n     flotilla ignored repeated Israeli calls to turn around or be \n     peacefully escorted to an Israeli port outside of Gaza;\n       Whereas, on May 31, 2010, the Israeli Navy intercepted the \n     Mavi Marmara 75 miles west of Haifa, Israel, in an effort to \n     maintain the integrity of the blockade and prevent potential \n     smuggling of arms and other materiel into the hands of Hamas;\n       Whereas, upon the boarding of the Mavi Marmara by the \n     Israeli Navy, the Mavi Marmara's passengers brutally and \n     violently attacked the members of the Israeli Navy with \n     knives, clubs, pipes, and other weapons, injuring several of \n     them;\n       Whereas the members of the Israeli Navy, under attack and \n     in grave danger, reacted in self-defense and used lethal \n     force against their attackers on the Mavi Marmara, shooting \n     and killing 9 of them;\n       Whereas the incident has fomented unwarranted international \n     criticism of Israel and its blockade of Gaza;\n       Whereas, in the time since the attack, the United Nations \n     has unjustly criticized the actions of the Government of \n     Israel and called for an investigation of such actions; and\n       Whereas the actions of the United Nations are undermining \n     Israel's inherent right to self-defense, compromising its \n     sovereignty, and helping to legitimize Hamas: Now, therefore, \n     be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) that Israel has an inherent and undeniable right to \n     defend itself against any threat to the safety of its \n     citizens;\n       (2) to reaffirm that the United States stands with Israel \n     in pursuit of shared security goals, including the security \n     of Israel;\n       (3) to condemn the violent attack and provocation by \n     extremists aboard the Mavi Marmara, who created a highly \n     destabilizing incident in a region that cannot afford further \n     instability;\n       (4) to condemn any future such attempts to break the \n     Israeli blockade of Gaza for the purpose of creating or \n     provoking violent confrontation or otherwise undermining the \n     security of Israel;\n       (5) to condemn Hamas for its failure to recognize the right \n     of Israel to exist, its human rights abuses against the \n     residents of Gaza, and its continued rejection of a \n     constructive path to peace for the Israeli and Palestinian \n     people;\n       (6) to condemn the Government of Iran for its role, past \n     and present, in directly supporting Hamas and undermining the \n     security of Israel;\n       (7) to encourage the Government of Turkey to recognize the \n     importance of continued strong relations with Israel and the \n     necessity of closely scrutinizing organizations with \n     potential ties to terrorist groups; and\n       (8) to express profound disappointment with the \n     counterproductive actions of the United Nations regarding \n     this incident.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/09/senate-section/article/S4753-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4753]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 4318.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Each year, many people in the United States are injured \n     by defective products manufactured or produced by foreign \n     entities and imported into the United States.\n       (2) Both consumers and businesses in the United States have \n     been harmed by injuries to people in the United States caused \n     by defective products manufactured or produced by foreign \n     entities.\n       (3) People in the United States injured by defective \n     products manufactured or produced by foreign entities often \n     have difficulty recovering damages from the foreign \n     manufacturers and producers responsible for such injuries.\n       (4) The difficulty described in paragraph (3) is caused by \n     the obstacles in bringing a foreign manufacturer or producer \n     into a United States court and subsequently enforcing a \n     judgment against that manufacturer or producer.\n       (5) Obstacles to holding a responsible foreign manufacturer \n     or producer liable for an injury to a person in the United \n     States undermine the purpose of the tort laws of the United \n     States.\n       (6) The difficulty of applying the tort laws of the United \n     States to foreign manufacturers and producers puts United \n     States manufacturers and producers at a competitive \n     disadvantage because United States manufacturers and \n     producers must--\n       (A) abide by common law and statutory safety standards; and\n       (B) invest substantial resources to ensure that they do so.\n       (7) Foreign manufacturers and producers can avoid the \n     expenses necessary to make their products safe if they know \n     that they will not be held liable for violations of United \n     States product safety laws.\n       (8) Businesses in the United States undertake numerous \n     commercial relationships with foreign manufacturers, exposing \n     the businesses to additional tort liability when foreign \n     manufacturers or producers evade United States courts.\n       (9) Businesses in the United States engaged in commercial \n     relationships with foreign manufacturers or producers often \n     cannot vindicate their contractual rights if such \n     manufacturers or producers seek to avoid responsibility in \n     United States courts.\n       (10) One of the major obstacles facing businesses and \n     individuals in the United States who are injured and who seek \n     compensation for economic or personal injuries caused by \n     foreign manufacturers and producers is the challenge of \n     serving process on such manufacturers and producers.\n       (11) An individual or business injured in the United States \n     by a foreign company must rely on a foreign government to \n     serve process when that company is located in a country that \n     is a signatory to the Convention on the Service Abroad of \n     Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or Commercial \n     Matters done at The Hague November 15, 1965 (20 UST 361; TIAS \n     6638).\n       (12) An injured person in the United States must rely on \n     the cumbersome system of letters rogatory to effect service \n     in a country that did not sign the Convention on the Service \n     Abroad of Judicial and Extrajudicial Documents in Civil or \n     Commercial Matters. These countries do not have an \n     enforceable obligation to serve process as requested.\n       (13) The procedures described in paragraphs (11) and (12) \n     add time and expense to litigation in the United States, \n     thereby discouraging or frustrating meritorious lawsuits \n     brought by persons injured in the United States against \n     foreign manufacturers and producers.\n       (14) Foreign manufacturers and producers often seek to \n     avoid judicial consideration of their actions by asserting \n     that United States courts lack personal jurisdiction over \n     them.\n       (15) The due process clauses of the fifth amendment to and \n     section 1 of the 14th amendment to the Constitution govern \n     United States court assertions of personal jurisdiction over \n     defendants.\n       (16) The due process clauses described in paragraph (15) \n     are satisfied when a defendant consents to the jurisdiction \n     of a court.\n       (17) United States markets present many opportunities for \n     foreign manufacturers.\n       (18) Creating a competitive advantage for either foreign or \n     domestic manufacturers violates the principles of United \n     States trade agreements with other countries.\n       (19) In choosing to import products into the United States, \n     a foreign manufacturer or producer subjects itself to the \n     laws of the United States. Such a foreign manufacturer or \n     producer thereby acknowledges that it is subject to the \n     personal jurisdiction of the State and Federal courts in at \n     least one State.\n\n     SEC. 802. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) foreign manufacturers and producers whose products are \n     sold in the United States should not be able to avoid \n     liability simply because of difficulties relating to serving \n     process upon them;\n       (2) to avoid such lack of accountability, foreign \n     manufacturers and producers of foreign products distributed \n     in the United States should be required, by regulation, to \n     register an agent in the United States who is authorized to \n     accept service of process for such manufacturer or producer;\n       (3) it is unfair to United States consumers and businesses \n     that foreign manufacturers and producers often seek to avoid \n     judicial consideration of their actions by asserting that \n     United States courts lack personal jurisdiction over them;\n       (4) those who benefit from importing products into United \n     States markets should expect to be subject to the \n     jurisdiction of at least one court within the United States;\n       (5) importing products into the United States should be \n     understood as consent to the accountability that the legal \n     system of the United States ensures for all manufacturers and \n     producers, foreign, and domestic;\n       (6) importers recognize the scope of opportunities \n     presented to them by United States markets but also should \n     recognize that products imported into the United States must \n     satisfy Federal and State safety standards established by \n     statute, regulation, and common law;\n       (7) foreign manufacturers should recognize that they are \n     responsible for the contracts they enter into with United \n     States companies;\n       (8) foreign manufacturers should act responsibly and \n     recognize that they operate within the constraints of the \n     United States legal system when they import products into the \n     United States;\n       (9) foreign manufacturers who are unwilling to act and \n     recognize as described in paragraphs (6), (7), and (8) should \n     not have access to United States markets;\n       (10) United States laws and the laws of United States \n     trading partners should not put burdens on foreign \n     manufacturers and importers that do not apply to domestic \n     companies;\n       (11) it is fair to ensure that foreign manufacturers, whose \n     products are distributed in commerce in the United States, \n     are subject to the jurisdiction of State and Federal courts \n     in at least one State because all United States manufacturers \n     are subject to the jurisdiction of the State and Federal \n     courts in at least one State; and\n       (12) it should be understood that, by registering an agent \n     for service of process in the United States, the foreign \n     manufacturer or producer acknowledges consent to the \n     jurisdiction of the State in which the registered agent is \n     located.\n\n     SEC. 803.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subpart to \n     implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health \n     care liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. 553.

A court may allow a claimant to file an amended \n     pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the \n     claimant and after a finding by the court, upon review of \n     supporting and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, after \n     weighing the evidence, that the claimant has established by a \n     substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the \n     claim for punitive damages.\n       (3) Separate proceeding.--At the request of any party in a \n     health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a \n     separate proceeding--\n       (A) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award; and\n       (B) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n     If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only \n     to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by \n     applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding \n     to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (4) Limitation where no compensatory damages are awarded.--\n     In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory \n     damages is rendered against a person, no punitive damages may \n     be awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit against \n     such person.\n       (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of \n     punitive damages under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     consider only the following:\n       (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such \n     party;\n       (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by \n     such party;\n       (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;\n       (D) the number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, \n     of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant;\n       (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a \n     result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and\n       (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against such \n     party as a result of the conduct complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages awarded \n     in a health care lawsuit may not exceed an amount equal to \n     two times the amount of economic damages awarded in the \n     lawsuit or $250,000, whichever is greater.

The terms ``drug'' and \n     ``device'' have the meanings given such terms in sections \n     201(g)(1) and 201(h) of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic \n     Act (21 U.S.C. 321), respectively, including any component or \n     raw material used therein, but excluding health care \n     services.\n\n     SEC. 559.
