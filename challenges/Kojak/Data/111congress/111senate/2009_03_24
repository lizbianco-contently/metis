Mr. President, a lot of people are still justifiably \nupset that executives at bailed-out businesses received multimillion-\ndollar bonuses compliments of the American taxpayer. The Senate will \ncontinue to press the question of how to make sure this doesn't ever \nhappen again. But already there are some clear lessons we can draw from \nthis experience. Perhaps the most important one is this: If we can't \nkeep track of $165 million, then it is going to be even harder to keep \ntrack of a trillion dollar stimulus bill, and it is going to be even \nharder still to keep track of the $3.6 trillion that the administration \nis proposing in this budget we will be voting on next week.\n  Americans have already heard enough about this budget to know that it \ntaxes too much. That verdict was validated by an unexpected source last \nweek, when the President's own Transportation Secretary, Secretary \nLaHood, said he doesn't think it is a good idea to raise taxes in a \nrecession.\n  Americans know this budget spends too much, that the spending figures \nare simply staggering, and that much of the spending is borrowed money. \nThey\n\n[[Page S3622]]\n\nknow what this, in the end, means. It means that in the middle of a \nrecession, when most Americans are rushing to pay down their credit \ncards, this budget does the exact opposite; it runs up the national \ncredit card to an extent that we have never seen in our Nation's \nhistory. That is the point about this budget that I want to talk on \nthis morning--that it simply borrows far too much.\n  In all the uproar about bonuses, some people may have forgotten about \nthe budget. But with a vote on this funding blueprint fast approaching, \nit is time to refocus and review where we are.\n  A few weeks ago, with the Nation still reeling from the size of a \ntrillion dollar stimulus bill, the administration unveiled a budget \nthat made the stimulus bill look like pocket change. In the midst of a \nrecession, the administration proposed a budget that involved major \nchanges to education, health care, and energy. To pay for it all, they \nproposed the largest tax hike in history and a new national energy tax \nthat hits everybody who turns on a light bulb.\n  Yet, even with these tax hikes, we still wouldn't be able to pay for \nall these changes--not even close. A few days ago, we learned that the \namount of money we would have to borrow to enact these policies in the \nmidst of a severe economic downturn is even greater than we thought.\n  According to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office, the \nadministration's projections were extremely optimistic. The CBO said \nthat based on its projections, the budget would increase the deficit by \n$2.3 trillion more over 10 years than the administration initially \nclaimed. Now, keep in mind that the total deficit from last year was \n$459 billion, a record-high figure at the time that only a few months \nago everybody agreed was entirely too high for comfort. What we heard \nfrom the CBO is that the discrepancy between the administration's \nbudget estimates and the CBO estimates of a deficit over 10 years was \nmore than 4 times the previous record annual budget deficit.\n\n  So the administration is asking us to borrow an astonishing amount of \nmoney--so much so, in fact, that if we were to pass this budget as it \nis, the Federal Government, in only 4 years, will have to spend $1 out \nof every $8 it receives in tax dollars to make interest payments on the \ndebt. It would be as if every worker in America spent the first hour of \nthe workday, every day of the week, working to pay off the finance \ncharge on his or her credit card. Of course, as debt piles up, it only \nbecomes harder to pay down. Under this budget, the debt piles up even \nmore quickly than it has piled up in recent months as a result of all \nof the spending and all of the bailouts.\n  As the recession took hold, it took 13 months for the Nation's gross \ndebt to rise from $9 trillion to $10 trillion. It took less than half \nthat time under this administration for the debt to reach the $11 \ntrillion mark. The Nation's debt is at its highest level ever, and it \nis growing larger and larger. Under the administration's budget, the \namount of public debt will double in 5 years and triple in 10 years.\n  It used to be that our friends on the other side cared quite a bit \nabout the consequences of debt. All this debt is real, and it will have \nvery real and disturbing consequences for our children and our \ngrandchildren. Americans are worried about it, and the CBO report makes \nthem even more worried.\n  Yet even more worrisome is the fact that so many of our friends on \nthe other side seem completely unfazed by the CBO report that projects \noceans of debt as far as the eye can see. I noticed that the Speaker of \nthe House was quoted yesterday, saying that the CBO report wasn't \nreason to rethink any of the administration's budget priorities. \nRegardless of the CBO report, she said, ``our priorities are the \nsame.''\n  The CBO report should have been a wake-up call to Congress. Instead, \nit is being viewed by some as a mere inconvenience--a distraction from \nthe political goals of those in power. Well, I suggest that if we have \nlearned one thing over the past several months, it is that economic \ndangers need to be addressed early. In the midst of an economic crisis \nthat could have been averted, Americans expect more from their elected \nleaders.\n  This budget borrows too much. Americans are saying so. Congress \nshould listen to those warnings now before it is too late.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/24/senate-section/article/S3622-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3622]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will comment on the Republican \nleader's remarks. I agree with him that this budget borrows too much. \nWe say that publicly on the floor and we say that privately in our \ndiscussions. Many of us are afraid that this 10-year budget is a \nblueprint for our country that our children and grandchildren simply \ncannot afford.\n  First, I will say a word about the President's press conference this \nevening. I hope that during his press conference, the President will \nreject the bill passed by the House of Representatives last week about \nthe AIG bonuses as not the kind of thoughtful and mature response that \nthe American people deserve from Congress in a time of crisis. It is \ncertainly not worthy of approval from the President of the United \nStates.\n\n  I hope the President will focus attention on something that is a \nmature and thoughtful response and is worthy of the attention of the \nPresident of the United States, and that is Secretary Geithner's \nproposal yesterday to use a partnership of public and private resources \nto begin to get the toxic assets out of banks, fix the banks, and get \ncredit flowing again.\n  I voted last October and then again on January 15 to give, first, \nPresident Bush and, next, President Obama the money he needed to fix \nthe banks. I could say, at this point, the proposal of the Secretary \nyesterday at first blush seems to me to be underfunded, \nundercapitalized by tax dollars and too late. But it is more important \nto say I believe it appears to be on exactly the right track, that it \nappears to be well thought out, and that at first blush it seems to be \nattracting support from the private sector, which it needs to do to be \nsuccessful.\n  History shows us some lessons about when we have bank problems--and \nwe have had plenty of them. When I was Governor of Tennessee in the \n1980s, dozens of banks failed because of a problem with the Butcher \nbrothers, who were basically kiting banks. But the Federal Deposit \nInsurance Corporation came in and over the weekend usually \nrecapitalized the banks, got rid of the bad assets, put them back out \nthere, and our economy grew again. That is harder to do today because \nthe businesses are bigger and the crisis is much larger. But the \nfundamental solution to our economic troubles is the same.\n  We need to fix the banks and get credit flowing again, and the way to \nfix the banks is to get enough of the toxic assets out so they can have \nconfidence to lend money, and business can start growing, and people \ncan get jobs again. That is the history lesson.\n  There is another history lesson, and that is that we need the \nPresident of the United States to focus his full attention on fixing \nthe banks and getting credit flowing again. I have used the example of \nPresident Eisenhower going to Korea. Someone said to me: Senator \nAlexander, no one pays attention to history. Well, they ought to.\n  President Eisenhower said in October of 1952: I shall go to Korea to \nfix the Korean war. That was in October. He\n\n[[Page S3623]]\n\nwas elected President, and within weeks he went to Korea. He said: I \nwill concentrate my full attention on this problem until it is \nhonorably ended.\n  President Eisenhower was a very capable man. He was capable of doing \nmore than one thing at a time. But he knew the country needed him to do \none thing and the country needed to have confidence he would do it.\n  President Obama is extraordinarily capable as well. When I, or \nothers, have suggested he is doing more than one thing at a time, he \noften says: I can walk and chew gum at the same time. I don't doubt \nthat. I think we may not have had a more impressive President in terms \nof intellectual ability, and he has impressive people around him.\n  What we need for the President to do--and tonight would be a good \ntime to start--is to assure us, as President Eisenhower did when he \nsaid ``I shall go to Korea,'' and say: I shall fix the banks and get \ncredit flowing again. We know that a President this impressive and this \ntalented, if he decides to throw himself into this problem with \neverybody he's got for as long as it takes, he will wear everybody else \nout and he'll get the job done. From the day he makes that clear, \nconfidence in this country will begin to recover at a fairly rapid \nrate. I say that with great respect to the President and to the \nproposal Secretary Geithner made yesterday, which I think is mature and \nthoughtful and the kind of proposal we ought to be focusing on in a \nbipartisan way.\n  As to the budget, the budget also makes a difference to whether the \neconomy recovers. It is hard for the economy to recover if the Congress \nspends too much, if the Congress taxes too much, and especially if the \nCongress borrows too much. The Republican leader pointed that out in \nhis remarks.\n  This 10-year budget is a blueprint for a country our children and \ngrandchildren cannot afford. It doubles the public debt in 5 years, and \nnearly triples it in 10. It grows the public debt to 82 percent of the \ngross domestic product by 2019. The gross domestic product is the sum \ntotal of all our efforts in a year, all the money we produce, and we \nproduce 25 percent of all the money in the world each year, more or \nless.\n  This 10-year budget creates more new debt than all the Presidents of \nthe United States from George Washington to George W. Bush combined. \nLet me say that again. All the Presidents of the United States, from \nGeorge Washington to George Bush, did not run up as much debt as this \nPresident proposes to do in the next 10 years.\n  By the year 2019, we will be spending more than $800 billion just on \ninterest payments on our debt every year. We only spend $720 billion on \nDefense in that year. We will be spending more on interest than we do \non defense, and we will have enough left over to fund all the Federal \nspending on education. That is too much borrowing.\n  What do we do about that? There are a number of things we can do. I \nsuggest we put a limit on runaway debt so that it cannot be more in any \nyear than 90 percent of our gross domestic product. Another idea would \nbe to enact a bipartisan Conrad-Gregg proposal which would say to \nCongress and the President: We need to set up a special mechanism to \ndeal with entitlement spending--the runaway spending for Medicare, \nMedicaid, and Social Security, which is the biggest part of our debt \nproblem. The proposal would set up a special commission that would \nfigure out how to bring entitlement spending under control, make \nrecommendations to the Congress, and we would vote it up or down, and \nact in the same way we close defense bases, which is also very hard to \ndo. The Conrad-Gregg proposal has broad support in the Senate. It has \nbroad support in the House. The President of the United States says he \nwants to control entitlement spending.\n  The Republican leader of the Senate, Senator McConnell, in his first \naddress this year, went to the National Press Club and said: Mr. \nPresident, I am ready to work with you on entitlement spending. In \nother words, he wants to bring the debt down in the outyears. But so \nfar we have not seen that priority.\n  I think the priority today ought to be to fix the banks and get \ncredit flowing again. I support the President's objective to reform \nhealth care this year. I think health care has to be reformed in order \nto bring entitlement spending under control. But why can't we go ahead \nand work on Social Security? Why can't we pass the Gregg-Conrad bill? \nWhy can't we send sub-signals that we are serious about reducing \nentitlement spending? Instead, this budget would move $117 billion of \nfunding for Pell grants from discretionary spending to entitlement \nspending; in other words, move it from the area where we would spend it \nonly if we can afford it to the area where we automatically spend it \nwithout having to vote on it. We shouldn't be adding anything to \nentitlement spending this year.\n  Finally, new taxation is not good, for this year especially. I care \nabout climate change, but now is not the time to impose a $600 billion \ntax on electric bills and gasoline prices in the middle of a recession.\n  Republicans will offer a clean energy agenda based on conservation, \nnuclear power, electric cars, finding more natural gas, aggressively \nfunding research in solar energy, and finding ways to capture carbon. \nWe can do all that without imposing a new tax on the American people in \nthe middle of a recession.\n  I look forward to the President's remarks tonight. I hope, as I \nbelieve most Americans do, that he rejects the House bill of last week \nand expands on Secretary Geithner's proposal. I applaud him and I \napplaud the Secretary for a mature, thoughtful proposal, and I hope the \nPresident will, as Presidents must, select the most urgent issue before \nus and focus on it with all he has until he fixes the problem. He can \ndo that. Only a President can do it, and this President is especially \ntalented. I believe if he makes clear he intends to do it, the country \nwill have confidence that he will get the job done.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to speak and continue the discussion \nwhich was raised by the Senator from Tennessee and the Republican \nleader earlier on the issue of where the budget that has been proposed \nby the President is going to take us. There are a lot of concerns \nraised by this budget.\n  Most of us have been willing to say we understand the President has \ninherited a very difficult financial situation; that, therefore, we \naccept the fact, in the short run this year and for much of next year, \npotentially a lot of money is going to have to be spent very quickly in \norder to try to refloat the economy. The Federal Government is the only \nplace where there is liquidity right now, and that liquidity is being \nused aggressively to try to get the economy going again.\n  The problem the President's budget has is, as we get past this next \nyear, year and a half of recession and we get further down the road in \nhis budget, the budget he has sent up to us continues to dramatically \nincrease spending, dramatically increase borrowing, and dramatically \nincrease taxes.\n  As we get into the third and fourth year of this budget, instead of \nseeing the numbers come back down to something that is manageable, we \nsee a deficit running in the 4- to 5-percent range of GDP. We see a \npublic debt-to-GDP ratio in the 60- to 80-percent range. These are \nnumbers that cannot be sustained. They add up to massive debt.\n  This chart shows the situation in fairly stark terms. Historically, \nthe national debt has been around 35 percent of GDP. That is a \nsustainable level. I think if you talk to most people in the economic \narea, they will say a government can do quite well if its national debt \ncan be contained at that level.\n  Unfortunately, under President Obama's proposal, that debt goes \nstraight up, and by the end of the 10-year window which his budget \ncovers, it is at 80 percent of gross national product. That is not \nsustainable. That essentially means we are putting on the books a debt \nwhich we have to pay as citizens of this country, which is unaffordable \nfor the citizens in this country. It has a lot of practical \nimplications which are all very serious and about which we should be \nconcerned.\n  The most obvious is that when we run up this much debt, somebody has \nto pay it and that means our kids and our grandkids. They are going to \nhave to pay this debt off. Instead of maybe being able to buy a house, \nsend their\n\n[[Page S3624]]\n\nkids to college or live the lifestyle our generation has lived, they \nare not going to be able to do that because the debt burden on them is \ngoing to be so high that burden will overwhelm their ability to live \nthe same quality of life that we have.\n  Equally important is the effect it probably will have on the value of \nthe money of the United States, the dollar. There are only two ways you \ncan handle it when you run debt up such as this. Either you \ndramatically raise taxes--and you basically make it virtually \nimpossible for Americans to be productive if you raise taxes as much as \nthis debt would cost to pay off--or you do something called monetizing \nthe debt, which is a technical term for creating inflation. Inflation \nis a pretty big evil. If you get on a course of inflation, you quickly \ngo into a spiral that is downward as a nation and as an economy. This \ndebt on this present path, as proposed by the President, will lead us \nto that spot.\n  There is another problem this creates, equally significant and about \nwhich we are already hearing, and that is, for people who are observant \nand people who look at our Nation, especially if they are lending us \nmoney--and the whole world is lending us money, especially the \nChinese--they look at our debt and they say: Is it manageable? Can the \nUnited States maintain this level of debt and still be a productive \ncountry, still be able to be prosperous?\n  There are beginning to be signs of people saying: No, we are not so \nsure that is true. We are not sure that is going to be the best thing \nto happen. So the value of the dollar starts to change and gets \ndecreased. Equally important, people become restive about buying our \ndebt, about financing this great spending spree which this \nadministration has proposed by lending us money. In fact, we have now \nheard two major statements from the Chinese leadership. The Premier of \nChina has specifically said that he is concerned about the value of his \ninvestments in the United States. Remember, China holds the majority of \nour debt. Now we see, from Mr. Zhou--I believe that is how he \npronounces his name--the head of their Federal Reserve, essentially \nthat they are so concerned about our debt situation and our lack of \nmanagement of our fiscal house that they want to change what is \nbasically known as the world currency reserve from dollars into some \nother currency. They are suggesting it be something controlled by the \nIMF, a currency produced by the IMF. That is not a vote of confidence \nin where we are going as a country by our biggest creditor.\n  It is unfortunate, very unfortunate, that we have to listen to the \nviews of China and take them seriously on this issue. It did not used \nto be that way. But, regrettably, whether we like it or not, as we run \nup all this debt we have to find somebody to buy it because this debt \nis operating our Government and we as a nation do not have the \nwherewithal to buy it, we have to sell it to other nations, and the \nprimary nations with currency reserves today are China and Russia and \nsome of your oil-producing states in the Middle East. These are not \nnecessarily nations which are all that sympathetic to our problems, \nespecially when our problems are fairly self-inflicted--and by self-\ninflicted, I mean this administration has sent up a budget which \ndramatically increases spending and dramatically increases taxes at the \nsame time it borrows a huge amount of money.\n  Trying to put this in real-world specifics, if you take all the debt \nthat has been run up in the United States since our Government started, \nsince George Washington--he is over here--through all the Presidents, \nincluding George W. Bush, the amount of debt they have put on the books \nof the American Government, the amount of debt they put on our backs as \nAmerican taxpayers is $5.8 trillion. In the 10-year budget President \nObama is suggesting, he is going to double that number. Essentially, \nPresident Obama's proposal puts more debt on the books--actually, in \nthe first 5 years of his administration--than has been put on the books \nsince the beginning of our Government through George W. Bush. That is \nhow quickly and massively the debt of the United States expands under \nthis budget.\n  At the same time, the tax burden increases significantly under this \nbudget. There is $1.8 trillion of new taxes proposed in this budget. I \nunderstand it is the philosophy of the Government that now is the \nmajority in this Congress and in the White House that Americans should \npay more taxes. I understand that. I do not happen to agree with it. I \nthink the American people are not undertaxed. I think basically we are \na country that has some problems, but they primarily go to \noverspending. But even if you accept the fact that we have to raise \ntaxes on the American people, which is what is proposed in this \nbudget--there are two major tax initiatives. One would hit small \nbusiness and one would hit every American. We call it the light switch \ntax or the national sales tax on energy. You would presume that they \nwould take those revenues and, as good stewards, use them to try to \nreduce this deficit we are facing which is driving this debt up. But, \nno, that is not what happens here. They take all these revenues and \nthey use them to expand the size of Government, so Government grows \ndramatically.\n  Of course, they have now used up the resources which you might be \nable to use to try to bring this debt down for the purposes of \nincreasing the size of the Government. They are increasing the size of \nGovernment so fast that even though they have the largest tax increase \nin history built into this budget, their spending increases so much \nquicker than that, the debt skyrockets.\n  President Clinton when he came into office raised taxes \nsignificantly, too, because that was also his philosophy, but he took \nthose tax dollars and used them--in conjunction, at that time, with a \nRepublican Congress--to reduce the deficit and reduce the debt of the \nUnited States. That was proper. If you are going to raise taxes, that \nis what they should be used for. You should not use them to explode the \nsize of the Government.\n  Where is this Government explosion occurring? Primarily, the \nPresident has proposed to take the spending of the Federal Government, \nwhich has historically been about 20 percent of the gross national \nproduct, up to 23 percent of the gross national product. That spending \nincrease is not for the short run. In the short run, he takes it up to \n28 percent. That spending increase begins in the second and third year \nof his budget and it goes on forever--23 percent, actually creeping up \nevery year, spending by the Federal Government. Over the last 40 years, \nthe Federal Government has only spent about 20 percent of gross \nnational product. That difference between 20 percent and 23 percent on \nour economy is a massive increase in spending. The amount of deficits \nrun up because of that spending over the next 10 years will be over $9 \ntrillion.\n  Just the interest on the Federal debt in the year 2018, as a result \nof this huge explosion of spending which is proposed in this budget, \nwill be $816 billion. That is just the interest on the Federal debt. \nPut that in perspective. In that same year, we will be spending less--\naround $700 billion--on national defense. So we will actually be \nspending more on financing the deficit and financing the debt than we \nwill on national defense. In the same period, we will be spending \nprobably somewhere around $100 billion on education, if you include \nPell grants and student loans. So we will be spending maybe eight times \nwhat we spend on education on financing this debt. That is money that \nis being sent out of the United States. Hopefully, people will still be \nbuying our debt. But it is money being sent out of the United States to \npeople who own our debt. This is just out of control.\n  Some people have been saying the Republicans are being terrible \nnaysayers about this budget. Yes. Yes, we are, because one generation \ndoes not do this to another generation. It is not the tradition of our \nNation that one generation goes out and borrows massive amounts of \nmoney which have to be repaid by the next generation at a rate which \ncan't be afforded by the next generation and then turns the country \nover to that next generation and says: Here, we are going to give you a \ncountry which has less opportunity for you than we received from our \nparents because this country is going to have such a huge debt burden \non it as a result of all this spending and all this borrowing, and the \ntaxing, which doesn't go to basically reduce the deficit at all; it \ngoes to expand the size of the Government.\n\n[[Page S3625]]\n\n  It is not fair, really, for us, our generation, to do that to the \nnext generation. That is why we suggested--OK, we will accept the fact \nthat in the short run, over the next 2 years, there is going to have to \nbe a spike in Federal spending and in the debt. But after that occurs, \nlet's get back to what is an orderly process. Let's get back to numbers \nwhich are acceptable and responsible. Let's bring the public debt down \nfrom 80 percent of GDP, which is where it is when we get out here in \n2016, 2011, and that period--not too far away--down to 40 percent of \nGDP, where it has historically been, down here. Let's take the deficit \ndown from 4 and 5 percent down to 2 percent, which is where it \nhistorically has been. Let's put in place responsible policies, not \ntake the spending up to such levels that they simply cannot be afforded \nbecause of the amount of debt that goes on the backs of the American \npeople that becomes grossly excessive and unaffordable. This is not an \nunreasonable request. We are not suggesting that the administration \ntrim its sails this year. We are suggesting that in the outyears there \nbe a responsible budgeting process around here that leads to a fiscally \nsound policy.\n  Why do the Chinese not have confidence in our currency? Why are they \ntalking about changing from our currency? Why are they asking whether \nthey should continue to invest in our debt? Because they don't see any \npolicies coming down the pike from this administration which discipline \nin any way or limit in any way the spending of the Federal Government. \nJust the opposite--it is an explosion of spending on the entitlement \nside by over $1.2 trillion and an explosion of spending on the \ndiscretionary side by almost $1 trillion.\n  If we did something constructive around here such as set up the \nprocess--which I proposed along with Senator Conrad, and many people in \nthis Chamber support--which would put in place a disciplining event on \nour entitlement spending, then these different nations would look at \nus--and our people could say: Listen, Congress is serious about getting \nthis under control in the outyears. They are not going to pass this \nmassive debt on to our kids. They are actually going to try to put in \nplace some systems to try to address this.\n  But nothing like this is happening. This budget has none of that in \nit. Instead, this budget simply expands the costs of the Government and \nthe borrowing of the Government, and then it raises taxes and spends it \ninstead of using it to reduce the size of the debt. It is a policy \nwhich is not sustainable.\n  The term ``not sustainable'' is used around here occasionally. What \ndoes it mean? Basically it means that when this policy comes to its \nfruition, after this budget is passed--and it will pass. The simple \nfact is, it needs 51 votes and there are 58 Members on the other side. \nIt is going to pass. After it passes and the policies underneath it \ncome in place, the term ``not sustainable'' means we are going to pass \non to our kids a government they cannot afford and which will reduce \nthe quality of their life and which may put at risk the value of our \ndollar and the ability to sell debt, according to the people who are \nbuying it right now, the Government of China.\n  This is serious. This is very serious. We need to take another look. \nWe need to reorient. We need to sit down and say: How can we do this \nbetter? How can we make this work better? How in the outyears--and it \nis not that hard in the outyears--so we start to close these numbers on \nthe deficit and bring down this rate of growth in debt so that it \nflattens out? How can we do that?\n  We are ready to do that on our side of the aisle in a bipartisan way, \nwhether it is something like the Conrad-Gregg bill or something in the \narea of entitlement reform or whether it is a freeze on discretionary \nspending as we move into the outyears; whether it is, if you are going \nto raise taxes, using those taxes to reduce the debt rather than expand \nprograms; living within our means in the area of health care. We are \nwilling to look at all those ideas because if we do not, basically we \nare going to pass on to our kids a government that will fail them and a \ngovernment that will obviously not give them the lifestyle that they \ndeserve and that one generation should pass on to the next generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/24/senate-section/article/S3625-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3625-S3626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise today to state a principle that is \nknown well by those of us who have served in the private sector, and \nthat principle is simply this: What gets measured gets done.\n  This week, as my colleague from New Hampshire has already stated, we \nbegin work on the Federal budget even as we are implementing the \nAmerican Reinvestment and Recovery Act.\n  Both of these actions can either confirm the claims of critics, the \nskeptics who always say that Washington simply is not capable of \nmanaging the taxpayer's money responsibly or it could present us with a \ntailor-made opportunity to demonstrate that we can combine bold action \nwith innovation and transparency as we work to get our economy and our \ncountry back on the right track.\n  In the near term, the targeted investments included in the Recovery \nAct are designed to create millions of new jobs.\n  The President's budget proposals, if they are enacted, will allow us \nto make longer term investments through the expanded use of electronic \nhealth records, the build-out of the smart grid, and through energy-\nsaving improvements to millions of homes and businesses.\n  Now, I do not think the American people expect miracles--but they \ncan, and they should, expect competence.\n  So we must put in place the people with the right skills, insist on \nappropriate measurements, and then demand transparency and \naccountability.\n  When I became Virginia's Governor at the peak of an earlier \nrecession, back in 2002, I inherited a $6 billion revenue shortfall in \nVirginia's $34 billion annual budget.\n  Our administration made the painful spending cuts, but then we did \nsomething else: we used that opportunity to enact long-term budget \nreforms that continue to save taxpayer money today.\n  For instance, we renegotiated a number of our State contracts and \nleveraged our purchasing power. We reduced the cost of light bulbs from \n32 cents to 23 cents. Now, saving nine-cents per bulb will not close a \n$6 billion shortfall, but the State buys an awful lot of light bulbs.\n  We found similar savings in procurement across much of State \ngovernment, bundling our purchasing power the same way many major \nbusinesses do.\n  We examined and then eliminated outdated boards and commissions. We \nconsolidated our State information technology activities. We took a \nwhole new portfolio approach to managing our real estate holdings and \nour vehicle fleet, just as any business would.\n  These business-like reforms produced almost immediate taxpayer \nsavings. And it accomplished something else as well: it created an \nexpectation of transparency and accountability that resulted in \nVirginia being independently designated as the Nation's best managed \nState, and the best State for business investment.\n  I do not rise today to brag on the Commonwealth of Virginia well, \nperhaps a little bit. Instead, I rise today to suggest that this same \napproach--straight talk, tough choices, and an insistence on \ncommonsense reform and accountability--is critically important here and \nnow in Washington, DC.\n  President Obama has made it clear to Governors and mayors across the \ncountry that we need their help for this Recovery and Reinvestment Act \nto succeed. I commend the administration for insisting that \naccountability does not simply stop at the State capital, once a \nGovernor releases funds to localities. We must have the same high \nstandards of accountability at the local level as well.\n  I also am pleased that the administration's recovery.gov Web site \nconveys a lot of useful information to the taxpayers in a clear and \nuser-friendly way. And by midweek, all but a handful of States are \nexpected to launch similar Web sites of their own.\n  But as they launch these Web sites, we must make sure that they have \nstandard metrics so we can actually\n\n[[Page S3626]]\n\ncompare progress from one State to another.\n  It is also imperative that we keep the pressure on officials at every \nlevel of Government to continue to aggressively look for even more \ncreative ways to make these sites more useful.\n  In recent weeks, I have spoken to key administration officials about \nwhat other steps we might take to promote transparency and \naccountability in implementing the Recovery Act.\n  If we do this right, it could build a solid foundation to promote \nlonger term fiscal responsibility as we move forward in the Federal \nbudget process.\n  For instance, I believe we should drill-down and reach consensus on \ncommonsense definitions and metrics. Let me give you an example.\n  When I chaired the National Governors Association in 2005, we \nlaunched a major effort to reform our high schools. I was astonished to \nlearn there was no common definition across the States of `high school \ngraduate.'\n  So we spent months working with educators, academics and policymakers \nto reach a common definition so we could determine whether a high \nschool graduate in Alaska or in New Mexico was meeting the same kind of \nqualifications as a high school graduate in Virginia.\n  That now allows us to look at those programs that work--and those \nthat don't--across all of the States.\n  I believe that experience provides a useful model as we work to \ndevelop a common set of metrics that allows us to honestly and \neffectively track Federal spending, especially with the stimulus \ndollars where we are ramping up so many new initiatives in such a short \ntime-frame.\n  To do this, we will need to work through existing organizations, such \nas the National Governors Association, the Conference of Mayors, the \nNational Association of Counties, and others, as we work to design \neffective measurement tools.\n  For example, most of us agree that expanding high speed Internet \nbroadband to rural communities will create jobs. It will allow folks in \nevery region of our Nation to have an opportunity to compete and win in \nthe global economy.\n  Obviously, as we roll out broadband, we will track our progress by \nnoting how many communities are served and the number of Internet \nconnections that are added.\n  But what if we also came up with a way to capture information about \nhow many rural businesses were able to launch or grow because of this \nexpanded access to broadband? That information would allow us to \nmeasure the true value of broadband to the longer term economic \nviability of our rural communities.\n  Or consider our commitment to dramatically expand weatherization \nimprovements to the homes of lower-income Americans. Now, certainly we \nwill tally the number of structures that undergo these energy-saving \nupgrades, and it should be relatively easy to document the number of \nworkers in the weatherization program.\n  But couldn't we also come up with some way to measure what one would \nreasonably expect to be a reduction in the annual demand for \nGovernment-funded heating and cooling assistance? And wouldn't that \ninformation be helpful as we consider funding levels for LIHEAP and \nsimilar assistance in the years to come?\n  In short, I believe every level of Government should go the extra \nmile in laying out exactly how the Federal dollars are being spent, and \nwe should honestly measure and disclose program outcomes.\n  I also think, as we roll out these major expenditures, it is a good \nidea to link disbursements with predetermined timelines and checkpoints \nto better track our progress. Let's not wait until all of the money is \nspent before we determine whether the program works or not.\n  Consequently, if we do not see appropriate progress, we could delay \nor defer future payments.\n  In addition, Federal and State governments also should be encouraged \nto reach outside their comfort zones and challenge individuals in the \nprivate sector to step-up and provide specialized expertise.\n  Again, within the Recovery and Reinvestment Act, we are going to be \nramping up a series of important new initiatives on a very short \ntimeline.\n  How do we get the expertise from the private sector to engage in this \neffort? For example, this could be part of the Serve America Act, which \nwe will consider and vote on this week, which will promote and expand \npublic service opportunities for our citizens.\n  We must try to draw upon the best and brightest to bring them into \nGovernment service, even if it is on a part-time basis, as we ramp up \nthese new initiatives.\n  I am talking about men and women with proven management capabilities, \nindividuals who can move with the speed of venture capitalists to \nembrace new ideas, or recently retired military leaders who have \nsuccessfully overseen relief efforts.\n  This is the type of expertise we need to draw upon if we are going to \nramp-up these programs successfully. And as we do this, we must also \nhave the courage to cut back or eliminate programs that cannot prove \ntheir worth.\n  As a former Governor who enjoyed line-item veto authority, I \nwholeheartedly support President Obama's pledge to conduct a line-by-\nline review of the federal budget to identify waste and fraud.\n  I also encourage the administration to conduct a broad-based review \nof Governmental programs--a review that is horizontal, not just \nvertical.\n  Based upon my experience as Governor, and the experiences of \ncountless Fortune 500 companies, I know that an enterprise-wide review \ncould reveal additional opportunities to wring-out significant budget \nsavings.\n  Typically, one can find sustainable savings in three areas: \nprocurement, technology, and human resources.\n  That is why it is vitally important that the administration move \nquickly to appoint its chief performance officer, and that CPO must \nhave the authority to act quickly, along with the chief information \nofficer and chief technology officer. These individuals must have a \nmandate to work across multiple Federal agencies, and I hope they \nruffle a few feathers.\n  Mr. President, I will say it again: what gets measured gets done.\n  In the short term, creating an expectation of transparency and \naccountability will maximize our `bang for the buck' as we continue to \nimplement the Recovery Act.\n  And over the longer-term, this focus and genuine commitment to fiscal \nresponsibility will demonstrate that Washington can, in fact, act with \nboth confidence and restraint when it comes to spending the taxpayer's \nmoney.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I rise to pay tribute to the spouse of \none of our colleagues. The entire Senate has now been notified that \nMrs. Christine Sarbanes, the beloved wife of Senator Sarbanes, has \npassed away. I come to the floor with a heavy heart and with fond \nmemories of, indeed, a remarkable person.\n  Christine Sarbanes was quite a woman in her own right. She was a \nwoman of keen intellect, warm heart, and a compassion for the underdog. \nShe was a woman who was a force in her own very quiet, understated way. \nIf you really liked and admired Paul Sarbanes, which all of Maryland \ndid, you also really loved Christine Sarbanes. Senator Sarbanes often \njoked that whenever he would come to an event, they would say: Where is \nChris? Or they would say: Where is Christine? She often represented him \nin and around our State.\n  She had a unique way of talking that brought immeasurable commonsense \nand practicality but yet a connection to people and their day-to-day \nneeds.\n\n[[Page S3627]]\n\n  Theirs was a remarkable relationship that I had the good fortune of \nobserving. I have known the Sarbanes family for more than 30 years. I \nmet the young Paul Sarbanes, a spirited reformer, in Baltimore during \nthe 1960s. Baltimore was dominated by political bosses. There were \nthose of us who were bringing a new day, change that one could believe \nin. We reformers were running for local offices and challenging the \nmachine. The local press nicknamed us the ``shiny brights'' because we \nsaw ourselves as a new force.\n  Paul Sarbanes was the first to beat the machine, running for the \nHouse of Delegates and then for Congress. When he ran for the Senate, I \nfilled the House seat held by Senator Sarbanes. It was the remarkable \nthird congressional seat. That seat was held by Paul Sarbanes, then by \nme, then by Ben Cardin, and now by John Sarbanes.\n  One of the joys of Christine's life was to see John take the oath of \noffice and to take the seat in the House of Representatives that his \nfather held.\n  This was a remarkable couple, as you saw them doing good and having a \nstrong presence in our community. They were really made for each other. \nThese were people who really believed in the life of the intellect, but \nthe life of the intellect lived in the community. They met at Oxford. \nChristine, like Paul, shared a very modest background. Her dad was an \nelectrician; her mother was a waitress. She was a scholarship girl, as \nthey said in those days, to some of the private schools in England that \nthen took her to a scholarship at Oxford where she won both a \nbachelor's degree and a master's degree.\n  The Baltimore Sun has a wonderful article about Mrs. Sarbanes, which \nI ask unanimous consent to print in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Baltimore Sun, Mar. 24, 2009]\n\n                           Christine Sarbanes\n\n                      (By Frederick N. Rasmussen)\n\n       Christine D. Sarbanes, a retired educator, active board \n     member and wife of former Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes, died Sunday \n     of cancer at her Guilford home. She was 73.\n       ``Her life and legacy as a teacher and community servant \n     touched thousands of Mary-landers and reminds us all that a \n     life lived for others is the greatest of gifts,'' Gov. Martin \n     O'Malley said in a statement Monday. ``She believed in the \n     dignity of every individual, and that every person has \n     potential that we, as a community, can unlock through \n     literacy and access to higher learning.''\n       Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin said in a statement that Mrs. \n     Sarbanes' death is a ``tremendous loss to all those who knew \n     her'' and that she had ``enormous grace and presence.''\n       He added: ``She was extremely likable'' and ``had an \n     ability to relate to people and make them feel good.''\n       Christine Dunbar was born in London and raised in Brighton, \n     England, the daughter of an electrician and a waitress. After \n     winning a scholarship, she attended Brighton and Hove High \n     School for Girls.\n       She later earned a bachelor's degree in Literae Humaniores \n     from St. Hugh's College, Oxford University, in 1958, and a \n     master's degree, also from Oxford, in 1974.\n       It was political activism that brought her and her future \n     husband together, when both were attending Oxford in the late \n     1950s. He was a Rhodes scholar.\n       ``She came to a meeting of the American Association I \n     headed. I forget what was on the agenda. All I remember of \n     that meeting was that was where I met Christine,'' Mr \n     Sarbanes told The Sun in a 1987 interview. ``She was involved \n     in trying to get women into the [all-male] Oxford Union, a \n     debating society. I became very interested in that and \n     invited her to tea to talk about it.''\n       Mrs. Sarbanes said in the interview ``People thought it was \n     strange that an American would be so interested in this.''\n       After graduation, she began teaching Latin at Dana Hall \n     School for Girls in Wellesley, Mass.\n       After marrying in 1960, Mrs. Sarbanes became a lecturer in \n     classics at Goucher College.\n       In 1974, she left Goucher. After a four year break, she \n     returned to teaching in 1978, joining the Gilman School \n     faculty, where she continued teaching Latin, Greek and French \n     until retiring in 2000.\n       Lillian Burgunder, who taught Spanish and art history at \n     Gilman, was a longtime colleague and friend.\n       ``She was a wonderful teacher, and her knowledge of Latin, \n     Greek and ancient civilization was remarkable. She was very \n     intelligent and enthusiastic, and she brought that into the \n     classroom,'' Mrs. Burgunder said.\n       ``She was dedicated to making her kids understand, and it \n     was common to see a child in her office she was helping \n     because she wanted to make sure they understood the \n     material,'' she said.\n       Nick Schloeder, a former Gilman teacher and coach, who had \n     been an adviser to Mr. Sarbanes for 40 years, was also a \n     colleague of Mrs. Sarbanes.\n       ``I have a rather loud voice, and Christine had the \n     classroom next to mine. I would hear a tap on the door, and \n     Christine would say, `Mr Schloeder, I'm teaching a Latin \n     class, and you're going to have to lower your voice or get \n     some new stories,' '' he said, laughing.\n       ``There was a great intellectual compatibility between \n     Christine and Paul. Both were very smart, well-educated, and \n     both loved politics,'' he said.\n       ``She was not just a candidate's wife but a member of the \n     inner circle. She was very much a part of Paul's inner \n     circle,'' Mr Schloeder said. ``She was good politically and \n     not afraid to express herself. She had a great political mind \n     and really understood politics.''\n       Mr. Schloeder recalled that the two were inseparable and \n     determined campaigners.\n       ``When Paul ran for the House of Delegates in 1966, and \n     Congress four years later, the two worked the bus stops and \n     would knock on 500 doors in an afternoon,'' he said. ``And \n     they would do that day after day. I can't imagine them any \n     other way than as a couple.''\n       In addition to having a full-time job as a teacher, raising \n     her three children, and assisting her husband in his \n     political life, Mrs. Sarbanes found time to be an active \n     board member.\n       As child growing up in England during World War II, Mrs. \n     Sarbanes developed a life-long love of books, libraries and \n     librarians.\n       ``There weren't a lot of books in her home, and I think she \n     read every book in the library in Brighton,'' said her son \n     Michael A. Sarbanes of Baltimore.\n       For the past decade, Mrs. Sarbanes had been a member of the \n     board of the Enoch Pratt Free Library.\n       ``I do not know of anyone who worked as hard for the \n     libraries of our city. Her commitment and dedication was \n     important to the recent opening of the first two new \n     libraries in Baltimore in over 30 years,'' Mayor Sheila Dixon \n     said in a statement Monday.\n       ``To Christine, libraries were a sanctuary and a place of \n     enlightenment and a place that could change people's lives'' \n     said Dr. Carla D. Hayden, executive director of the Pratt.\n       ``She wasn't just a board member but an active board member \n     who headed many committees, including community services. So \n     much of the community outreach programs are because of her,'' \n     she said.\n       She said the news of Mrs. Sarbanes' death hit her staff \n     ``particularly hard.''\n       ``She was a very warm person, and she mixed that warmth \n     with a practical mind. She was a steady force for us, and \n     everyone knew they could count on Christine,'' Dr. Hayden \n     said.\n       She served on the Walters Art Museum board in the 1980s and \n     continued to lend her expertise and time to several \n     committees.\n       Dr. Gary Vikan, Walters director, recalled a conversation \n     with Mrs. Sarbanes after her return from Dublin, Ireland, \n     when she casually mentioned that museums there didn't charge \n     for admission.\n       ``That conversation took place in October 2005, and the \n     next October, we dropped our entrance fee,'' Dr. Vikan said \n     with a laugh.\n       For more than. 20 years, as a member of the Baltimore \n     Volunteer Group to the U.S. Fund for UNICEF, Mrs. Sarbanes \n     delivered hundreds of presentations and organized fundraisers \n     for the organization statewide.\n       She was an ``eloquent representative of the highest caliber \n     of the U.S. Fund for UNICEF,'' wrote William Van Pelt, who \n     manages the organization's Office of Public Policy and \n     Advocacy in Washington, in a recommendation for an award \n     several years ago.\n       ``Her interest was educating area children to the wider \n     world and culture of the world's neediest children,'' said \n     Mary Jo Marvin, a member of the Baltimore group. ``We called \n     Christine `the Whirlwind' because of her boundless energy and \n     torrent of ideas. She was an inspiration to all of us.''\n       Mrs. Sarbanes was a longtime communicant of the Episcopal \n     Cathedral of the Incarnation. A memorial service will be held \n     at 5 p.m. April 3 at the Enoch Pratt Free Library, 400 \n     Cathedral St.\n       Also surviving are another son, Rep. John P. Sarbanes of \n     Riderwood; a daughter, Janet M. Sarbanes of Los Angeles; and \n     six grandchildren.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It tells the story. Senator Sarbanes has told this \nstory as well. He went to a meeting of the American Association, where \nhe met a young British woman who was interested in getting women in the \nOxford debating union. Women were excluded from the Oxford debating \nunion. He saw Christine. He saw her charm, her charisma, her passion, \nher advocacy for women when it was just coming to the fore. Suddenly, \nPaul Sarbanes became an impassioned supporter of getting women in the \nOxford Union. He was an equally unabashed supporter of getting women in \nthe Senate, which helped me become the first Democratic woman here.\n  That was the Sarbaneses. They met there. They met on a cause. The \ncause began their love for each other and their love of this country \nand the love of making this country a better place.\n\n[[Page S3628]]\n\n  We all know Senator Sarbanes's remarkable career in the Senate, a man \nwe all admired for his honesty, his integrity, his honor, and his \nability to get the job done. Maryland loved him by reelecting him on \nseveral occasions, often being the highest vote getter. Christine came \nback and helped Paul with his career. She also continued her work in \nour community.\n  Mrs. Sarbanes was a gifted teacher, a spirited volunteer, and a civic \nleader, while she was raising a family of four remarkable children: \nthree young men and a wonderful young woman who has a doctorate in \nliterature and is in California. She also was an avid civic volunteer. \nHer great passion was books. She believed books would change lives. \nBooks changed her life. They helped her win a scholarship, they got her \nto Oxford, and this would continue.\n  For her, the world of books was so important, one of her advocacy \nareas was libraries. If you ever wanted to meet someone who believed in \nthe power and the empowerment of libraries, it was Christine Sarbanes \nbecause she believed ideas belong to everybody. Books should be \navailable to everybody. There should be a public institution that no \nmatter who you are, no matter what your economic background, no matter \nwhat Zip Code you were born in, you could have access to the great \nbooks of our world. That is why she devoted herself to that and was on \nthe board of the Enoch Pratt Library.\n  She did a fantastic job there. In fact, her memorial service will be \nheld at the Enoch Pratt Library in a few days.\n  In her work, she also was a teacher. She taught at Goucher College. \nShe taught at one of the more prominent prep schools, and she taught \nthe classics. But in teaching the classics, we should all note that \nMrs. Sarbanes was, indeed, a very classy lady.\n  When we think about her, we will always remember her, again, for \nbeing able to light up a room while she worked so hard to light up the \nlives of others. She will be greatly missed by all of us.\n  As all of you know, Senator Sarbanes and I shared a very special \nrelationship in the Senate, but that relationship was also shared in \nthe Maryland community with Mrs. Sarbanes. Mrs. Sarbanes was there for \neverybody, and everybody in Maryland mourns for her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, when I came to the Senate in 1977, Paul \nSarbanes was a colleague who came with me. There is no doubt that this \nwas one of the true sages of the Senate. He was a great man, a brave \nman, with a tremendous ability, who served with distinction in this \nbody. One of the reasons Paul was so successful in life, not that he \ncouldn't have done it alone, but I think he couldn't have done it as \nwell had it not been for the beautiful and wonderful wife he had. She \nwas a tremendous human being.\n  I am very moved by her death. All of us feel grief and concern for \nSenator Sarbanes. Theirs was a close relationship, one that was \nexemplary to all of us. She was a great supporter of his as he served \nin the Senate.\n  I used to kid Paul all the time: Paul, when are you going to smile? \nWhen are you going to laugh? He was always so serious. I used to dig \nhim all the time about that. He would get a wry grin on his face. He \nknew what I was talking about. But he was serious, and so was his wife. \nShe was a great human being.\n  I personally express my condolences to Paul and his family because I \nknow how close they were. I know how much she meant to him and vice \nversa.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority whip.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, one of the real honors of serving in the \nSenate is meeting some extraordinary people. I was asked several years \nago: Of all the Senators with whom you serve, can you name one you look \nup to time and again? At the time, I said it was Paul Sarbanes of \nMaryland. I liked Paul so much and respected him so much. He made such \na contribution, not just for his State of Maryland but for the Nation \nduring his time of public service.\n  My good fortune was not only to get to know Paul but also to meet and \nget to know his wife Christine. What an extraordinary woman. She was a \ngifted, thoughtful, articulate person whose background and interest was \nin the classics. She would lose me in a hurry when we got into a \nconversation, as we did once or twice, about her area of interest.\n  I can recall traveling once from London Heathrow back to the United \nStates, picking up a book along the way that was titled ``Rubicon,'' a \nstory on the Roman Empire. I sent it to her, as if she needed my advice \nor background in that subject. She wrote me the nicest note afterwards \nthanking me for it.\n  She was a real lady and a great complement to Paul. The two of them \nworked so well together representing the State of Maryland and showing \nwhat a couple could do together working in public service.\n  I was so saddened to learn yesterday that Christine passed away. She \nwas such a fine person. I wanted to add my voice on the Senate floor in \nsympathy for the Sarbanes family and so many people across the State of \nMaryland who came to know and respect her over the years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/24/senate-section/article/S3628-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 1388, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A motion to proceed to the consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1388) to reauthorize and reform the national service laws.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I am pleased to rise once again to speak \ntoday on the Senate substitute amendment to H.R. 1388, the Serve \nAmerica Act. As we heard in the statements last night, this legislation \nhas been in the works for a long time, and I was glad last night to see \nit clear the first hurdle by a wide margin.\n  This is truly a bipartisan piece of legislation. In my opinion, it is \nprobably the most bipartisan bill we will see on the Senate floor this \nyear. At every stage, Republicans and Democrats have been working \ntogether to craft this legislation in order to bring it where we have \nit today. It is my hope that when all is said and done we will see a \nbroad coalition of Senators voting in favor of the bill.\n  However, I do know, as of right now, not everyone in this Chamber is \nconvinced this legislation is the right thing to do. So I want to take \na few moments this morning to address some of the major arguments I \nhave heard by those who appear to oppose the bill. Although many of \nthese concerns appear to be coming from the Republican side of the \naisle, I believe my arguments will be relevant to both sides.\n  One argument I have heard is that the bill will impose mandatory \nservice requirements on our citizens. I mention this claim first \nbecause, quite frankly, it is the easiest to refute. Despite the \nrumblings of the black helicopters some imagine to be circling \noverhead, every program in this bill is 100 percent voluntary. In our \ncountry, no one is compelled to give service, and this bill will not \nchange that. Instead, it will give new and expanded opportunities for \npeople who voluntarily decide to participate.\n  Another more substantive argument I have heard is that given our \ncurrent economic climate and budget deficit, it is simply the wrong \ntime to invest in national service. The Government, these folks argue, \ndoes not have a role in these areas. I respectfully disagree with that.\n  I share the desire of many of my colleagues and, of course, of my \nconstituents to see more fiscal discipline in Washington. But, in my \nview, an important aspect of fiscal discipline is investing in ideas \nthat work. I support this legislation because I believe volunteer \nservice is such an idea.\n  As has been stated, 75,000 national service participants leverage an \nadditional 2.2 million volunteers every year--volunteers who are not \nsubsidized by the Government in any way. That is a significant human \ncapital return on what is, relatively speaking, a modest Government \ninvestment.\n\n[[Page S3629]]\n\n  In addition, there have been a number of studies that have shown that \nfor every $1 invested in national service, there is anywhere from a \n$1.60 to $2.60 return on investment. That is in social benefits paid \nback to our society, whether it is kids being tutored, vacant lots \nturned into playgrounds and parks, homes being built, or in the form of \ndisaster relief. It is an investment that pays for itself.\n  I have also heard people refer to national service as ``paid \nvoluntarism.'' I think this is mostly a question of semantics. We do \nneed to be careful to differentiate between Americans who volunteer for \nfull-time national service and community volunteers who give a few \nhours episodically throughout the year.\n  Most current national service participants are spending a year of \ntheir lives serving their country full time, and their benefits include \na subsistence allowance and an education award. The subsistence \nallowance is barely a survival stipend, a below-poverty payment that is \nenough to cover only the basic needs. The education award is a very \nmodest benefit to encourage people to seek higher education \nopportunities once they have completed their terms of service. But in \nexchange for this small amount of support, these members dedicate \nthemselves full time to solving problems that span the range of human \nlife: from dropouts to elder care, from homelessness to prison \nrecidivism.\n  National service is not a job or a career move for these individuals. \nIndeed, no one is getting rich by participating in these programs. \nThose who join these programs are motivated to give back to their great \ncountry, to engage in their local communities, and improve the lives of \nthose who are in need.\n  Once again, we cannot discount the fact that the work of those in \nnational service programs has a multiplying effect. If the measure of \nthis legislation was solely to provide national service slots for \n250,000 individuals, I do not think we would have much to be proud of. \nBut these national service participants will leverage millions of \ntraditional volunteers and hundreds of millions of dollars of private \ninvestment in the nonprofit sector. The success of the program shall \nnot be measured by the number of people who participate but by the work \nthey accomplish.\n  Other potential opponents of the bill have tried to label this bill \nas another ACORN bill. Of course, they do so without ever even \ninquiring whether ACORN currently receives money under national service \nprograms. Although I am not usually one to spoil a good mystery, it has \nto be stated they do not. In fact, in the first year of the AmeriCorps \nprogram, ACORN was forced to return the grant it received under the \nprogram because it could not keep its political activities separate \nfrom its other work--this was in 1997--and they have not received any \nfunding since.\n  Make no mistake, I share the concerns of a number of my colleagues \nwho do not want taxpayer funds to directly or indirectly benefit \npartisan political organizations, abortion providers, or illegal \nenterprises. While I believe current law prohibits national service \nfunds from being used for such activities, we wanted to make it crystal \nclear that this would continue to be the case. I believe this was \nnecessary in order to ensure the bill continues to enjoy bipartisan \nsupport.\n  So as part of the managers' amendment, we have included a provision \nlisting in detail the prohibited activities for national service \nparticipants. Specifically, under the bill no one will be able to use a \nnational service position to influence legislation, or for union \norganizing efforts, or to participate in protests or boycotts, conduct \na voter registration drive, engage in partisan political activity of \nany kind, or provide abortion services or referrals. In addition, any \norganization that has violated a Federal criminal statute is \ncategorically ineligible to benefit under this legislation.\n  Like I said, I understand the trepidation that some might have \nregarding these issues. Indeed, a number of so-called nonprofit or \nservice organizations engage in what many believe to be objectionable \nactivities. But I believe this language makes it clear that such \nactivities will not be performed by national service participants. That \nbeing the case, I believe every Senator can support this bill without \nsuch reservations. I hope this puts the issue to rest.\n  I am sure we will hear some other arguments raised by skeptics of the \nbill, and I will do my best to address them as they come up. I am sure \nthe distinguished Senator from Maryland, Ms. Mikulski, will as well. I \njust wanted to take a few moments to make sure people know these \nconcerns have not gone unaddressed by the authors of this bill.\n  As every Member of the Senate knows, the process of drafting, \ndebating, and passing legislation is not a scientific one. There is no \nway of calculating all of the variables and finding all the angles in \norder to produce a perfect result. When any group of Senators works \ntogether on a bill--regardless of whether they are from the same or \nopposing parties--the best anyone can hope for is a final product all \nthe parties will proudly stand behind, even if they do not agree on \nevery single section or provision of the bill.\n  The Senate substitute amendment represents the efforts of not only \nSenator Kennedy and myself but of Senator Enzi and Senator Mikulski as \nwell, and others. As I said yesterday, I doubt any bill we consider \nthis Congress will be spearheaded by such a diversity of beliefs and \nideologies. As one coauthor of the bill, I do not claim the bill is \nperfect just the way it is, but I am proud to join my colleagues as we \nstand behind and work to preserve this product.\n  I certainly respect and will work to preserve the rights of any \nSenator to oppose this legislation or propose changes in good faith. \nThe ability of every Member to offer amendments is one of the richest \nand most important traditions of the Senate. That said, it is my hope \nwe can keep the changes and additions to this bill at a minimum. If we \nadd too much or take too much away from the bill, I think we may \njeopardize the coalition we have worked to preserve thus far.\n  Like I said, I do not claim the bill is perfect. But I do believe, as \nit is currently written, it has just the right balance to ensure that \nMembers from both sides of the aisle should be able to get on board.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, first of all, I rise to thank my \ncolleague from Utah for his excellent statement. I think he outlines \nexactly where we are in terms of both the content of the bill and the \nway we have approached this bill.\n  It is my belief, as is the belief of Senator Kennedy, that we govern \nbest when we govern together. That is exactly what the Serve America \nAct exemplifies. The architects of this legislation are Senator Kennedy \nand Senator Hatch, bringing to bear their own passion on Americans \nbeing able to give back to our society. Yet, with 16 years of lessons \nlearned on the running of the Corporation for National Service, we have \nlearned a lot.\n  So this bill, as originally introduced, had not only good ideas and \ngood intentions, but came from lessons learned on how to better focus \nour efforts, get more of a dollar's worth out of our efforts, and, at \nthe same time, be able to harvest this growing desire of people to \nserve. This year, there are far more people who are applying for \nnational service opportunities than at any other time in our history.\n  Senator Hatch has also outlined the very important parameters we have \nset in the bill: no money will be going to participants to engage in \npartisan activities, no money going to participants that cannot \ndemonstrate they are providing viable services and meeting the very \nclear requirements of AmeriCorps.\n  There are other issues both Senators Hatch and Enzi have worked so \nconstructively on to bring to our attention--great yellow flashing \nlights around these issues--and we heard them. We not only heard their \nconcerns, I want to thank them because they brought not only concerns \nto the table but very sound solutions. So I want to thank them for \nthat.\n  I think on our side of the aisle, we have looked at AmeriCorps, we \nhave looked at what President Obama is calling for, along with Senator \nKennedy, and the wonderful contributions of Senator Dodd, and want to \nexpand this program. But we realize there is a\n\n[[Page S3630]]\n\nlimit. There is a limit to the money we can spend, and there is a limit \nto our organizational capacity on what we can undertake.\n  So on our side there was an attempt to find that sensible center to \nbe able to focus exactly on what we want to do in certain basic corps, \nand, at the same time, to merely make sure, increase the number of \npeople volunteering.\n  We have taken a look at the education voucher award. It has been \nfrozen for 16 years. We made a modest increase, and our index will be \nto peg it to the Pell grants. This seems to be a sensible solution. \nThere were those on my side of the aisle who wanted to double or even \ntriple the education award. If we looked at inflation over 16 years, I \nwould have been in that category. Well, in the spirit of compromise and \nconsensus, we all sometimes have to not make the perfect the enemy of \nthe really excellent. Therefore, in 2010, we will raise the education \naward to $5,350--a $500 increase. That would be less than $50 a year \nover the last 16 years.\n\n  So we trimmed what the education award would be. We looked at how we \nwanted to triple the number of volunteers. We knew it couldn't be done \nin a day or a year, so instead, we phase it in over a 7-year period. \nAgain, it was taking what we wanted to do, but organizing it at a pace \nwe knew the taxpayers could afford, and so the corporation could \ndevelop the capacity to be able to expand the programs in a sound way.\n  Then there comes the stewardship idea, which is, how do we make sure \nwe build in certain reporting that really would ensure we were getting \na dollar's worth of service for a dollar's worth of taxes? Senator Enzi \nof Wyoming, the ranking member of the committee, once again brought his \nvery sound accounting skills to the table, and we came up with a way \nto, again, ensure value for the taxpayer, value for the community, and \ndo it in a way that does not create a lot of micro-processes. We have \nput a lot of work into this bill.\n  We don't want to lose sight of the fact that this legislation is to \nintended to really tap into the idealism of our young people. Idealism \ndoesn't know gender, it doesn't know religion, it doesn't come from a \nZIP Code. I believe it is really in the hearts of people everywhere in \nthe world. It is a unique American characteristic to want to help your \nneighbor. Some people call it the Golden Rule--``Do unto others as you \nwould have them do unto you''--but this is more. This is really saying: \nI want to take my life my talent, and put it to work in the community \nand make the community a better place. That is the original purpose of \nthis bill.\n  Yesterday, I don't know how my colleagues felt, but, gosh, I was \nbuoyed when Senator Kennedy came on the floor, when he walked in that \ndoor with his jaunty cane and his good humor. The cheer that he brought \nto this body--it was very edifying, very inspirational, very \nenergizing. Senator Kennedy brings his own unique energy to this.\n  I have been talking to him about this bill. He is so pleased that the \nSenate is taking it up. He has been working with us as we have talked \nback and forth about improvements and so on. I know how strongly he \nfeels about it. If he were on the floor himself today, he would be \nencouraging us. He would be motivating us. He would be inspiring us to \npass this legislation so that we can engage a new generation of young \nAmericans in national service, while at the same time, welcoming the \nlarge-scale participation of all generations to address national needs \nbecause, again, the desire to serve isn't based on age. It is not only \nyoung people who feel it. We all do.\n  Communities across our country face challenges too numerous to count. \nIf Senator Kennedy were on the floor, he would be reminding us about \nrising unemployment, particularly among young people, rising poverty, \nand falling home prices. At the same time, all of us are aware of the \nfiscal challenges many States and schools and communities are facing, \nwhich means they have to cut back on services just when families and \nchildren need them the most.\n  Some of my colleagues believe we can't afford this legislation at a \ntime when our debt is growing and our economy is struggling, but I say \nwe can't afford not to pass this legislation. This bill offers \ninnovative solutions to those challenges by asking more Americans to \ngive their time to serve their country and their community. It answers \nthe economic challenges of communities and families and what they are \nfacing today. It is a carefully developed and focused solution.\n  We have learned a lot in the past 16 years since we passed the \noriginal legislation about what works and what doesn't work. Senator \nHatch spoke eloquently about it a few minutes ago. This bill draws on \nthose lessons and actually puts them to work. We have learned that \nservice can make a big difference in addressing specific challenges and \nthat service opportunities early in life can put young people on the \npath of lifetime service. We have seen that older Americans want to \nserve their communities with skills and experience and that social \nentrepreneurs in the private sector are coming up with very innovative \nways to tackle the challenges we face in a way that is affordable.\n  This bill focuses national service programs where service can do the \nmost good. I will repeat that. AmeriCorps, and these new programs with \nfocused approaches, will focus service programs on where service can do \nthe most good. In other words, following a Marine Corps adage, we are \nsaying to the AmeriCorps volunteers: Be best at what you are best at, \nand be best at what you are most needed for. Be best at what you are \nbest at, and be best at what you are most needed for. That is why we \nare talking about an education corps. That is why we are talking about \na health futures corps, a clean energy corps, a veterans corps, an \nopportunity corps focusing on poverty. This is why we are focusing our \nservice efforts.\n  Social entrepreneurs such as those who started City Year and \nExperience Corps are the ones who are teaching us many of these \nlessons. When City Year began, it was about giving a year of service by \na young person to do good in the community. That was the aegis of \nAmeriCorps. Back then, City Year took on all kinds of programs, but as \nCity Year has matured, they found it is better to focus.\n  City Year focuses primarily on tackling one of our greatest national \nchallenges--the dropout crisis in high schools. In Baltimore City, my \nhometown, only one in three students who starts high school actually \ngraduates. This is a travesty mirrored in inner cities and rural areas \nthroughout our country. City Year focuses on how to deal with that \ndropout rate.\n  Let's talk about Experience Corps. Experience Corps takes older \nadults and uses them as AmeriCorps volunteers. What they found is \nExperience Corps works best by working in schools. They are taking \nadults with years of experience and putting their skills to work, and \nit is making a difference. I have seen Experience Corps work in my own \nhometown of Baltimore in a school called Barclay Elementary School that \nhas had its ups and its downs and its sideways. It has had talented \nteachers, often a good principal, and yet they needed help. In that \nsurrounding community, within the shadow of Johns Hopkins University, \nExperience Corps works, and in many ways it has helped and assisted \nwith volunteers and others coming from Hopkins. With that blend of \nvolunteers, Barclay Elementary School has improved.\n  When I asked the CEO of Experience Corps--because the people in this \nage group can do a variety of things--why education, he told me that's \nwhat Experience Corps could do best, where it was most needed. We have \nlearned from programs like this, which is why AmeriCorps will now focus \non these very specific core programs.\n  We also found that this bill will, of course, encourages service \nlearning opportunities for students, because students want to give as \nwell. Working with Senator Dodd, who has been such a leader on these \nissues, we now have Summer of Service opportunities for middle and high \nschool students. These young people want to do it.\n  College is where so much of our young people's character and \nexperiences are shaped. This bill recognizes that, going the extra mile \nby allowing the designation of 25 campuses of service which will \nundertake activities to help students engage in service that\n\n[[Page S3631]]\n\nwill actually encourage people to go on to public service careers.\n  This legislation also creates Encore Fellows to help adults \ntransition to longer term public service with a nonprofit organization. \nThese adults are volunteering by choice. They have knowledge and \nexperience, and we just need to get them in the door. This is a way to \nbring in people who have retired and who have incredible skills, such \nas that retired accountant who can help a nonprofit get its books \ntogether and maybe find new grant opportunities.\n  Finally, it is to help older Americans get more involved through \nSenior Corps, RSVP, Senior Companions, and Foster Grandparents. These \nare excellent programs.\n  In this bill, we have taken innovation, creativity and lessons \nlearned and come up with a new framework of service.\n  Right now, our country faces an incredible economic challenge. We see \nit in homes, families, factories, farms, and communities all over \nAmerica. But as you look out, you don't see faces of despair. People \nbelieve in this country, and children and grandparents know and even \nbelieve, also, in great possibilities. So while we are facing these \ngreat challenges, we have a great opportunity. This is not the ``me \ngeneration'' of a decade ago; it is the ``we generation.'' I think this \nbill will help us be ``we, the people'' who serve each other.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The junior Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, first, let me congratulate my colleague \nfrom Maryland and my colleague from Utah for their leadership on this \nlegislation. This is extremely important legislation expanding the \nopportunities for people to serve our country in national service. Both \nhave been leaders on this issue for many years. I am pleased that we \nare on the verge of really expanding opportunity, particularly for \nyoung people, to have a meaningful impact in helping their communities.\n  I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Cardin pertaining to the introduction of S. 673 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, as we talk with colleagues and work to \ngather the votes, some of the naysayers, or those who have questions \nabout the efficacy of this bill, say: So what, people go off and do a \nlittle bit of service, they feel good, and then they go off--OK, that \nis nice, but they could do that anyway.\n  Well, they could do that, but what is often overlooked is the impact \nthat service has on changing the lives of people who do service. We \ncould talk about examples on my side of the aisle. We have Senator \nDodd, who joined the Peace Corps. He has given long-term service to the \nNation, including his work in Latin America, where he served as a Peace \nCorps volunteer. He continues that work on the Foreign Relations \nCommittee. Senator Rockefeller went to West Virginia as a VISTA \nvolunteer and was so taken with the poverty and hard times--and \ninspired by the determination of the people of West Virginia--that he \nmade a go of trying to help them with their economic development and \nthe economic empowerment of the people of West Virginia. He went on to \nrun for public office and became a Governor and now is a Senator. We \nknow of his and Senator Byrd's devotion to West Virginia and, again, \ntheir advocacy for those who were left out--the steelworkers, coal \nminers, and so on. Our democratic members bring those experiences with \nthem.\n  My own experience is very interesting as well. Yes, I do have a \nmaster's in social work and, yes, I did work in social programs. When I \ngot my master's, I didn't only work in those programs that paid; I was \nalso involved in those programs where I saw a need. While I was working \nin the streets and neighborhoods of Baltimore as a grassroots community \norganizer, it was very clear to me that people who had addiction \nproblems had very few services to choose from. This was long before we \nhad a drug czar and many of the programs we have today with addiction. \nI teamed up with a priest in the inner-city neighborhoods of Baltimore, \nFather Maloney, a Josephite, and we started something called Narcotics \nAnonymous, to open the doors. Many women came. We found the men and \nwomen together didn't get along. They each had their own story and they \ntold them differently. I ran the women's groups and helped to start \nthem.\n  Those women had a different set of problems. I would go into the \nBaltimore city jail every Monday night to meet with a group of women to \nhelp plan for when they got out of jail. There was no discharge \nplanning. Nobody was saying: How are you going to get a job? How are we \ngoing to keep you off drugs? How are we going to get your kids back \nfrom foster care? How do we make sure there is no abuse or addiction in \nthe home?\n  I would meet with them in the jail and work with Father Maloney when \nthey came out. That was indeed quite an experience for a young social \nworker. I grew up with stories of women who were so poor that many had \nonly gone to the sixth or seventh grade, or they had no education. They \nhad no hope, they had only despair. I worked as a volunteer and helped \nto get them the service they needed. It had a profound impact on me. \nWhen I went to the Baltimore City Council, one of the first things I \ndid was jail reform to try to bring services into the city jail so \nthere would be an organized, systematic way of doing things. So I did \njail reform in the city council, now, chairing the Commerce, Justice, \nand Science Committee, we do prison reform in the Congress and for our \nFederal programs--to make sure our Federal prisons have the staffing \nthey need; to make sure the people who were there have the opportunity \nto turn their lives around.\n  Then, we worked with incredible organizations--often faith-based--for \npost-prison discharge, so people wouldn't go back into prison. I know \nwhat those faith-based programs are. I worked for one of them as a \nvolunteer. My lifelong commitment, starting in the streets and \nneighborhoods and working with Father Maloney, took me behind the bars \nto see what those lives were like. At the same time, now, in the \nCongress, we work for the important addiction services, work to make \nsure we have mental health parity, because so many people had these \nproblems. Those are the kinds of things I did on my own as a volunteer. \nAt the same time, we wondered what happened to the men. I asked, what \nhappens to the men when they come out of jail? There were very few \ngroup homes, and working again with the Episcopal Church, a faith-based \ninitiative, I went on the board of the Valley House. Do you know why it \nwas called that? The 23rd Psalm says: I shall walk through the valley \nof darkness and I shall fear no evil. That is what it was. Those men \nwere walking through and working through their ``valley of darkness'' \nas they followed their 12-step program. I saw a building that was \ntattered, worn, rundown.\n  The very first thing I did was get some other women on the board, get \nmy own volunteers, and we did our own habitat for healing. We worked \nwith the recovering alcoholics and painted, cleaned, scrubbed, and \nwhatever, got a good cook in there, so that when the men went out to \nlook for a job, they came back to at least a hot meal and fellowship. \nWe cleaned up the family at Valley House and shepherded them out of the \nvalley of darkness and we led them to sitting at the table where their \ncups began to overflow.\n  I learned a lot listening to those stories, putting in my own sweat \nequity. It was not about me; it was about the ``we'' whom we inspired. \nThat is what community volunteer work does. While you are involved, it \nchanges you. You listen to the stories and you know what that is. You \nwant to make a lifelong commitment that the people you meet today you \nwill never, ever forget\n\n[[Page S3632]]\n\ntomorrow. Those women I met at the city jail are now grandmothers. I \nhope those children are finishing school, and I hope their lives were \nturned around. I hope the men who were at Valley House went through \nthat valley of darkness and went into the valley of life.\n  As for me, as I tried to help them turn their lives around, they \nhelped give my life direction. That is what we are talking about when \nwe talk about giving back, getting involved, neighbor helping neighbor. \nFor those of us who volunteer, the changes are significant. What I say \nis, each and every one of us can make a difference. But when we work \ntogether we can make change. This is one of the bills that will help do \nit.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                               The Budget\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, next week, the Senate is going to \nconsider the budget resolution for fiscal year 2010. This may be one of \nthe most important debates of our time. For 50 hours on the Senate \nfloor, we are going to debate making a fundamental change in our \neconomy.\n  We need to face the facts. This President and this country have \ninherited the worst economic crisis in 75 years, and I do not \nexaggerate. No President has faced this kind of a challenge. We see it \nevery day in the jobs that are being lost, the businesses that are \nclosing, the homes going into foreclosure. We watched as our savings \naccounts dwindled during the decline of the stock market. Retirement \nplans are being changed. Children are coming back from college because \nfamilies are worried about making the payment for their expenses. \nFundamental decisions about homes, cars, and future expenditures are \nbeing withheld because of the uncertainty of our economy.\n  Passing the economic recovery package that President Obama sent our \nway was the first step to getting this economy back on track, but it is \nnot the last thing, it is not the only thing. The next step is to pass \na smart, fair, responsible budget that makes the economy work again. \nThis is not a separate item. This is a continuing effort that Congress \nneeds to make, joining with President Obama, to show we are serious \nabout putting this economy back on its feet.\n  The President has proposed a budget that accomplishes that. It \nrestores fairness for middle-class families, it reestablishes \nresponsibility in the budgeting process, and it makes some smart \ninvestments in America's future.\n  This budget begins to repair years of neglect in fundamental national \npriorities. It makes critical investments that we need for the economy \nto recover, particularly in the areas of energy, education, and health \ncare.\n  The President has proposed a return to the balance our country once \nenjoyed--careful investments in the future while protecting working \nfamilies who have lost ground over the last decade. If we fail to make \na number of critical investments now, it is going to be tougher for \nAmerica's economy to get back on track.\n  Many experts tell us that in order for our country to fully recover, \nwe have to take a leading role not only in the Nation but in the world. \nWe need to lessen our dependence on foreign oil and develop renewable \nenergy sources that reduce costs and create jobs.\n  America still remembers well $4.50-a-gallon gasoline when those \noverseas who send us the oil decided they would squeeze us, and they \ndid, and we couldn't say anything about it because we have become so \ndependent on foreign sources.\n  We also know that the way we consume energy is affecting the world in \nwhich we live. We know that global warming is a reality, climate change \nis a reality, and if we do not use different practices and different \napproaches with energy, we may leave our kids more than a national \ndebt; we may leave them a planet which is uninhabitable in some places.\n  We also know we need to make it more affordable for Americans to \nextend and improve their education so they can reach their maximum \npotential and compete for good jobs in an increasingly competitive \nglobal economy. And we need to address health care costs. Whether it is \nan individual or a family or a business or a State or the Federal \nGovernment, the escalating cost of health care will break the bank no \nmatter what the President's policies might be. We need to address it. \nPresident Obama has had the courage and I think the vision to say that \nhas to be part of our agenda.\n  This budget allows for critical investments in health care. The \nPresident's budget will begin the transformation of our health care \nsystem by allocating more than $630 billion over 10 years for \nfundamental health care reforms. How many times have we started this \ndiscussion and stopped it? Realizing the health care system in America \nneeds dramatic reform, we find ourselves embroiled in debate and at the \nend of the day have nothing to show for it. President Obama stepped up \nin his budget and said: We are going to put the investment on the table \nto extend health care protection to those who do not have it and make \nit more affordable for those who do. He made that investment in his \nbudget.\n  The budget would also support the adoption of health information \ntechnology and the widespread use of electronic health records. The \nVeterans Administration does this. Because they have electronic \nrecords, they can make a better diagnosis for a patient, they can avoid \nerrors that might occur while someone is hospitalized, and they can \nreduce costs. We should do that for our health care system across the \nboard.\n  The budget also expands research that compares the effectiveness of \nmedical treatment so that patients and physicians have better \ninformation on what works and what doesn't.\n  It would invest $330 million training doctors, nurses, and dentists \nwe need to fill shortages of health professionals, especially in rural \ncommunities.\n  It would invest over $1 billion to step up food safety efforts at the \nFood and Drug Administration to prevent the kinds of outbreaks of \ncontaminated food we have seen recently, the most recent being peanut \nbutter, but before that a long list of outbreaks in food safety that \nconcern Americans and their families.\n  This has been an issue I have pushed for a long time in the House and \nin the Senate, to try to coordinate our food safety effort in \nWashington so we can get more for our dollar and protect more families.\n  These investments will come when we need them. Over 47 million \nAmericans do not have health insurance today--47 million people who \nwoke up this morning realizing they were one accident or one diagnosis \naway from wiping out their savings. One million families in my home \nState of Illinois, a State of 12.5 million people, have at least one \nuninsured family member, including 360,000 of those families who earn \nmore than $50,000 a year. They earn 1,000 bucks a week and do not have \nhealth insurance.\n  If you look at the cost of health insurance, you can understand. For \nsome families, even $50,000 a year makes it difficult to protect \neverybody. Being uninsured is no longer only the concern of the poor. \nIn fact, the poor are taken care of in our Medicaid Program. It is a \nrisk for many of us, many middle-income families. Members of Congress \nare pretty lucky. We get the same health care protection that Federal \nemployees receive. It is the best plan in the Nation. But my people in \nmy home State are not that fortunate.\n  Let me tell you about a fellow in Springfield, my hometown. Doug \nMayol, since 1988, has owned a small business in downtown Springfield. \nHe sells cards, gifts, and souvenirs. He is fortunate that his only \nemployee is over 65 years of age and qualifies for Medicare and also \nreceives spousal benefits from her late husband. If this were not the \ncase, Doug does not think he could possibly provide health insurance \nfor his only employee.\n  As for himself, Doug knows, because he has a preexisting condition, \nthat he faces the real possibility of becoming uninsured. Almost 30 \nyears ago, Doug was diagnosed with a congenital heart valve defect. He \nhas no symptoms. But without regular health care, he is at great risk \nof developing serious problems.\n  Like most Americans, his health care premiums have risen dramatically \nin recent years. In 2001, he paid $200 a month for health insurance in \nSpringfield, IL. In 2005, he paid $400. And after he turned 50 years of \nage last year, his rate shot up to $750 a month. He has a\n\n[[Page S3633]]\n\nlittle business. It is hard for him to pay that.\n  To keep his insurance affordable, he chose a smaller network of \nproviders and higher deductible, which brought the cost down to $650 a \nmonth. Then last year, the payment jumped again to over $1,000 a month. \nOnly by taking the highest deductible has he been able to bring that \ncost down to $888 a month.\n  Think about that for a minute. That is $10,000 a year that this small \nbusiness operator faces for basic health insurance with a high \ndeductible, and he isn't even a costly patient. With his high \ndeductible, the insurance company has never paid a claim for illness or \ninjury beyond routine care. Yet his costs have exploded.\n\n  He cannot afford not to have health insurance. Because of his faulty \nheart valve, he needs antibiotics before undergoing even a simple \nprocedure, such as dental work.\n  Although Doug should see a cardiologist periodically, he avoids it. \nHe fears it would add another red flag to his medical record. Think \nabout that for a second--avoiding basic medical care for fear it will \nraise the cost of health insurance. That is a reality for a lot of \npeople in America.\n  Why, in this wealthiest Nation on Earth, do we accept a system such \nas this, where a small businessman with insurance has to delay \npreventive care simply to avoid short-term costs, even though the long-\nterm costs, if something awful happens, will be far greater?\n  All Americans want the best health care system in the world. Yet we \nall know that reform is not easy. The process will be complicated. We \nwill have to compromise. And we will have to work together. But we have \nto start by laying the foundation. President Obama's budget does that.\n  The President's budget also has a promising vision for education. The \nbudget provides funding for innovations in the classroom, improved \nstudent assessment, improved teacher training, principal preparation, \nprograms that reward teacher performance, and a significant expansion \nof early childhood education. Is there one of these we would question \nif it were our child or grandchild heading off to a school? We would \nwant all of this as part of the curriculum, as part of the schoolday \nfor that child to excel.\n  These initiatives will help build America's education system so we \ncan compete globally, and the budget will also change the way we \nfinance higher education. It would finally end the Federal Family \nEducation Loan, FFELs. This is a program that has proven to be \noutmoded, expensive, inefficient, subject to corruption, and a bad \nchoice for students. A lot of us have known this for a long time.\n  The first person to warn me about this program was the late Senator \nPaul Simon of Illinois who retired 13 years ago. It certainly has been \nan unfortunate situation.\n  The current student loan FFEL program was an unfortunate choice for \nHolly Clark from Chicago. Holly wanted to be a teacher. To pay for \ncollege and graduate school, she borrowed over $60,000 in student \nloans. Think about that. She chose this FFEL program because she \nthought it would lock in low interest rates until she could pay off the \nloans.\n  Because of fluctuating interest rates and changes in the program, she \nnow pays 7\\1/2\\ percent interest each year. That is higher than she \npays for her home mortgage.\n  Holly heard about a Federal program that encourages teachers to work \nin a low-income school for 5 years by forgiving a portion of the debt. \nShe taught for 4 years in an inner-city school, but then the school \nadministrators left and the school became extremely unsafe. She left \nthat job. She still has her loans, and she is not sure what she is \ngoing to do to repay them without giving up her teaching career.\n  That is not what we need. We need young people who will submit \nthemselves to teaching, not walk away from it. We can do better for \nHolly Clark. The FFEL program has proven to be costly for taxpayers and \nsometimes unfair to borrowers. The President's budget shifts the \norigination of student loans to the Federal Direct Loan Program \nstarting in July of next year. We take the middleman out. We take the \nbanker out of the picture because they are taking a profit. That change \nsaves taxpayers $94 billion over the next decade. The banks are going \nto squawk. The people who have these programs are going to be upset. \nThey are going to hire the best lobbyists they can get their hands on \nand come and stand out in the hall and beat on us when we come in to \nvote. But I hope we remember Holly Clark when we are making these \ndecisions and not the folks with the Gucci loafers out in the hallway.\n\n  This budget will also make spending on Pell grants mandatory, freeing \nthis essential student aid program from the political process indexing \nthe grants to inflation.\n  We cannot transform our education system overnight into a world-class \nsystem unless we prepare our young people with the best education.\n  On the issue of energy, the President's budget also provides a \ndownpayment on weaning America from our dependence on foreign energy. \nThe President lays out an aggressive path to reduce the consumption of \nfuels that contribute to climate change. Left unchecked, scientists \npredict global warming will lead to more heat waves and droughts over \nthe next century, will result in lower agricultural productivity, \nthreaten coastal areas with rising waters, increase severe storms and \nflooding and reduce biodiversity. These are real changes, some of which \nwill be irreversible. We have to find a way to address this \nresponsibly.\n  President Obama's budget proposes a cap-and-trade system to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions. We can reduce emissions by 14 percent below \n2005 levels by the year 2020, and by 2050 we can cut emissions by 83 \npercent below 2005 levels.\n  Some say that is not realistic. They also said President Kennedy \nputting a man on the Moon was not realistic. We can do it if we have \nthe political will and the guidance of a good President and the \ncooperation, bipartisan cooperation of Congress.\n  The revenue generated from auctioning greenhouse gas emission \nallowances would be used to fund tax credits for working families and \nprograms to green the economy and $150 billion over 10 years to develop \nclean energy technology that would create jobs. If this budget had \nalready passed and funding were already available, Lee Celske of Aledo, \nIL, might have been able to put a small portion of that funding to good \nuse. He has figured out how to create green temporary houses out of \nrecycled glass--pretty cheap, as low as $30,000 in some cases--quick to \nassemble, and he thinks they are a good option for communities \nrecovering from natural disasters. These are energy-efficient temporary \nhomes that can withstand a category 5 hurricane.\n  The factory that makes the houses would employ 30 high-tech, high-\npaid, green-collar workers. Over the last 14 months, Lee has presold \nnearly $2 million worth of houses, relying on loan guarantees from his \nbank that would underwrite the factory once sufficient sales were in \nplace.\n  But then, suddenly, the bank pulled out. Lee has done nothing wrong. \nThe idea is sound. The small company is ahead of its schedule on growth \ntargets and it would create precisely the kind of green jobs America \nneeds. Yet his progress has been stopped by a freeze in the credit \nmarkets. The President's budget would help finance these entrepreneurs \nin the green economy.\n  This budget could create good jobs. It is a smart investment for our \nfuture. That is what the President brought to us in the stimulus \npackage. This budget can create good jobs. It is a small investment for \nthe future. That is what the budget continues to bring to us.\n  There is another element that is important. For too long the Tax Code \nhas favored the wealthiest people in America. At a time when working \nfamilies, middle-income families are struggling to get by, they were \nnot getting the tax breaks. That was the old way of thinking. That was \nold politics, old policies. The President's way of thinking is to reach \nout to provide a tax cut for every American family earning less than \n$250,000 a year. Ninety-five percent of Americans will not see their \ntaxes increase a single penny under the President's budget. After 8 \nyears of stagnant wage growth for the middle class, with costs for \nhealth care, education, and utilities going up, with the unemployment \nrate above 8 percent and growing, and with as many as 13 million \nfamilies\n\n[[Page S3634]]\n\nat risk for losing their homes, American families need a break. This \nbudget would do that.\n  I have listened to a number of my friends on the Republican side of \nthe aisle criticize this budget. They say it spends too much, taxes too \nmuch, we have to borrow too much. They are ignoring the obvious. This \nPresident is committed to cutting the deficit in half in his first 4-\nyear term. When President Bush was elected, he inherited a surplus from \nPresident Clinton, a surplus in the budget. It had been a 2-year \nsurplus and it was reducing the debt of programs such as Social \nSecurity. We were moving in the right direction. Our national debt that \nwe an accumulated over the history of the United States to that moment \nwhen President George W. Bush took office was about $5 trillion. So the \nPresident, George W. Bush, came in with a $5 trillion national debt \nthat he had inherited from George Washington until his moment in \nhistory and he inherited a budget surplus.\n  What happened over the next 8 years? Sadly, under President Bush, we \nsaw the national debt of America more than double in 8 years. The \naccumulated history of the United States had produced $5 trillion in \ndebt. The 8 years of the Bush administration more than doubled that \ndebt. President Bush took the surplus of the Clinton years and brought \nus to the biggest annual deficits in American history.\n  Many of those who supported the President's approach, many of those \non the other side of the aisle who voted for his budgets--many who \nstood in defense of President Bush when he said I don't want to count \nthe cost of the war; we will set that aside; we will call it an \nemergency; we will not put it in the budget--are the same people who \nmade that excuse for 7 years during the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \nunder President Bush. They saw the accumulated cost of those wars \nexceed $700 billion and none of it was in the budget. None of it was \naccounted for. Many on the other side said that was acceptable.\n  They also supported the President's idea of tax cuts, tax cuts for \nsome of the wealthiest people in America. Taking these things off \nbudget, tax cuts for the wealthy--what happened? We ended up with the \nworst deficits we had seen in our history. That is what this President \ninherited. Now that he has promised to reduce the size of our deficit \nby half in his first 4 years, many on the other side are standing and \nsaying we are destined now for bankruptcy. Where have they been for the \nlast 8 years? Some of the harshest critics of the President's budget \nwere giving a stamp of approval, year after year, to President Bush's \nbudget.\n  What President Obama is doing is an honest budget, a responsible \nbudget that moves us toward reducing the deficit in a time when the \neconomy is in a sorry situation.\n  I think that is important. I think it is important we come together \non a bipartisan basis to pass that. As to those who think this budget \nborrows too much, this President is on the right track of reducing the \ndeficit. They have been on the wrong track for a long time. These are \npolicies that they have offered before that did not work. They are \nyesterday's policies, yesterday's politics. It is time for something \nnew. It is time for real change. Preparing the budget is about making \nchoices and President Obama's budget is a document that makes the right \nchoices. It is a document that is fair, giving tax breaks to working \nfamilies, putting money into investments so their children can see a \nbrighter future. It is a budget that is responsible. It puts the cost \nof the war online in the budget so we can track it as part of our real \ndebt. It is a budget that also makes smart investments in America's \nfuture.\n  It is not just a matter of creating a job, a make-work job. This \nPresident's vision is to create the kind of jobs in energy and new \nenergy for the 21st century; in education, so our kids can compete in \nthis century, and to make sure our health care system is one that gives \nus quality care at the lowest cost. That embodies three sensible goals \nthat we in America share.\n  This budget would bring true long-lasting change to America, and I \ncertainly encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to look \nlong and hard at this budget, realize the good-faith effort President \nObama is making with this budget, and join him in charting a course of \nspending for the next 4 years that will move us out of this recession, \ncreate jobs and businesses and give America a smart investment for our \nfuture.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the bipartisan \nlegislation before us today, the Serve America Act. I would like to \nthank Senators Kennedy from Massachusetts and Hatch of Utah, as well as \nWyoming's Senator Enzi and Senator Mikulski of Maryland for their hard \nwork on this legislation.\n  Last week I held a conference call in my office with two very \nimpressive young men who are a testament to what the Serve America Act \nis all about. Their names are Mark Rembert and Taylor Stuckert. I met \nthem last year in Wilmington, an Ohio city in southwest Ohio that has \nbeen devastated by the closure of the Wilmington Airport where DHL \nemployed about 8,000 people--DHL, Astar, and ABX, three national \ncompanies.\n  Mark and Taylor decided they simply could not sit on the sideline \nwhile their community struggled to absorb this tremendous economic \nblow. Instead they founded Energize Clinton County, a nonprofit focused \non economic development and environmental awareness.\n  In the midst of an economic disaster in their community, these two \nyoung men, Mark and Taylor, decided to serve. They are examples of what \ninspired this bill and what service to our country is all about.\n  I know something personally about City Year, one of the programs \nwithin the Serve America Act. City Year is part of AmeriCorps. My \ndaughter Elizabeth served in City Year Philadelphia about 4 or 5 years \nago. She was paid $700 a month, as were the six or seven roommates she \nhad in an old house on Baltimore Pike near the VA in Philadelphia. They \nmet every Sunday night to talk about how they were going to, after \npaying their rent--about $300 a month each--how they were going to \nfigure out how to eat. They pooled their resources and figured out how \nto do that.\n  During the day--each day of the week, often 6-day weeks, often more--\nElizabeth and other of her colleagues would go into a middle school in \nPhiladelphia and work with local students in some of the poor areas of \nPhiladelphia.\n  This program mattered to those students she helped. It mattered to my \ndaughter who I said was paid $700 a month for this service in City \nYear. It made her more reliable, and it made her more strong. It made \nher more understanding of the community around her, and it taught what \nso many of these programs over the years, so many of these volunteer \nservice organizations have taught us. Whether it is the Peace Corps or \nVista or City Year or Teach America, not just the people who are served \nby these young people but the people who do the serving, it stays with \nthem the rest of their lives. It matters so much to them as they \nunderstand our society even better.\n  The passage of this legislation will mean even more Americans will be \nable to answer President Obama's call to service. The Serve America Act \nwill provide opportunities for Americans of all ages and from all \nbackgrounds to\n\n[[Page S3635]]\n\nserve. It invests in action and it promotes existing voluntarism by \nsupporting and expanding existing community service and development \nprograms to tackle the problems at the root of the economic crisis. It \nstrengthens programs such as AmeriCorps which, contrary to the wholly \nunwarranted and counterproductive partisan attacks some of my \ncolleagues have launched against them, have paid for themselves many \ntimes over.\n  Whether your measure is the impact of these programs on their \nparticipants, enabling individuals to find a productive path and avoid \na less productive path or whether your measure is the tangible work \naccomplished in communities throughout this Nation; whether your \nmeasure is the culture of voluntarism cultivated, choose your measure. \nAmeriCorps and like programs are a cost-effective means of \nstrengthening our Nation and promoting the old-fashioned values of hard \nwork, empathy, and civic responsibility.\n  Across the country, the bill would create 175,000 new service \nopportunities. I am sure successful Ohio programs such as City Year \nColumbus, Ohio College Advising Corps in Cleveland, the Wood County \nCorps in Bowling Green would value additional volunteers, and there is \nno doubt that Ohio would benefit from their work.\n  Service opportunities will be expanded to incorporate and encourage \nAmericans of every age group: programs such as the Summer of Service \nProgram for middle and high school students, the Youth Engagement Zone \nProgram for young people from low-income areas, and Encore Fellowships \nfor retired Americans. This is not only for young people to volunteer \nand to serve.\n  The Serve America Act also invests in nonprofit service organizations \nthat work. These organizations are on the front lines of this Nation's \neconomic crisis. They will play an integral role in our recovery. These \norganizations empower Americans and spur economic growth at the \ncommunity level.\n  Those very organizations embody the values that enable our Nation to \nremain unified when widespread hardship hits and become stronger in the \nprocess of turning that hardship around.\n  The Serve America Act is part of the change this country called for. \nIt not only creates a catalyst for recovery through a renewed service \nmovement, it recognizes the resources and the programs it will take to \nget us there.\n  I was proud to cosponsor the Serve America Act. I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Employee Free Choice Act\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to state my \nposition on the bill known as the Employee Free Choice Act, also known \nas card check. My vote on this bill is very difficult for many reasons.\n  First, on the merits, it is a close call and has been the most \nheavily lobbied issue I can recall. Second, it is a very emotional \nissue with labor looking to this legislation to reverse the steep \ndecline in union membership and business expressing great concern about \nadded costs which would drive more companies out of business or \noverseas.\n  Perhaps, most of all, it is very hard to disappoint many friends who \nhave supported me over the years, on either side, who are urging me to \nvote their way. In voting for cloture--that is to cut off debate--in \nJune of 2007, I emphasized in my floor statement and in a Law Review \narticle that I was not supporting the bill on the merits but only to \ntake up the issue of labor law reform.\n  Hearings had shown that the NLRB was dysfunctional and badly \npoliticized. When Republicans controlled the board, the decisions were \nfor business. With Democrats in control, the decisions were for labor. \nSome cases took as long as 11 years to decide. The remedies were \nineffective.\n  Regrettably, there has been widespread intimidation on both sides. \nTestimony shows union officials visit workers' homes with strong-arm \ntactics and refuse to leave until cards are signed. Similarly, \nemployees have complained about being captives in employers' meetings \nwith threats of being fired and other strong-arm tactics.\n  On the merits, the issue which has emerged at the top of the list for \nme is the elimination of the secret ballot, which is the cornerstone of \nhow contests are decided in a democratic society. The bill's \nrequirement for compulsory arbitration if an agreement is not reached \nwithin 120 days may subject the employer to a deal he or she cannot \nlive with. Such arbitration runs contrary to the basic tenet of the \nWagner Act for collective bargaining, which makes the employer liable \nonly for a deal to which he or she agrees. The arbitration provision \ncould be substantially improved by the last best offer procedure, which \nwould limit the arbitrator's discretion and prompt the parties to move \nto more reasonable positions.\n  In seeking more union membership and negotiating leverage, labor has \na valid point that they have suffered greatly from outsourcing of jobs \nto foreign countries and losses in pension and health benefits. \nPresident Obama has pressed labor's argument that the middle class \nneeds to be strengthened through more power to unions in their \nnegotiations with business.\n  The better way to expand labor's clout in collective bargaining is \nthrough amendments to the NLRA rather than eliminating the secret \nballot and mandatory arbitration. Some of the possible provisions for \nsuch remedial legislation are set forth in the appendix to this \nstatement.\n  In June 2007, the Employee Free Choice Act was virtually monolithic: \n50 Senators, Democrats, voted for cloture; and 48 Republicans against. \nI was the only Republican to vote for cloture. The prospects for the \nnext cloture vote are virtually the same.\n  No Democratic Senator has spoken out against cloture. Republican \nSenators are outspoken in favor of a filibuster. With the prospects of \na Democratic win in Minnesota yet uncertain, it appears the 59 \nDemocrats will vote to proceed, with 40 Republicans in opposition. If \nso, the decisive vote would be mine.\n  In a highly polarized Senate, many decisive votes are left to a small \ngroup who are willing to listen, reject ideological dogmatism, disagree \nwith the party line, and make an independent judgment. It is an \nanguishing position, but we play the cards we are dealt.\n  The emphasis on bipartisanship is misplaced. There is no special \nvirtue in having some Republicans and some Democrats take similar \npositions. The desired value, really, is independent thought and an \nobjective judgment. It obviously cannot be that all Democrats come to \none conclusion and all Republicans come to the opposite conclusion by \nexpressing their individual objective judgments.\n  Senators' sentiments expressed in the cloakroom frequently differ \ndramatically from their votes in the well of the Senate. The Nation \nwould be better served, in my opinion, with public policy determined by \nindependent, objective legislative judgments.\n  The problems of the recession would make this a particularly bad time \nto enact the Employee Free Choice Act. Employers understandably \ncomplain that adding such a burden would result in further job losses. \nIf efforts to give labor sufficient bargaining power through amendments \nto the NLRA are unsuccessful, then I would be willing to reconsider the \nEmployee Choice legislation when the economy returns to normalcy.\n  I am announcing my decision now because I have consulted with a very \nlarge number of interested parties on both sides and I have made up my \nmind. Knowing that I will not support cloture on this bill, Senators \nmay choose to move on and amend the NLRA as I have suggested or \notherwise. This announcement should end the rumor mill that I have made \nsome deal for my political advantage. I have not traded my vote in the \npast and would not do so now.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text be printed in the Record, as \nwell as an appendix with suggested revisions to the National Labor \nRelations Act.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S3636]]\n\n                       Statement by Arlen Specter\n\n       My vote on the Employees Choice Bill, also known as Card \n     Check, is very difficult for many reasons.

Mr. President, today we face very difficult economic \nthreats in our financial industries. It is important that we consider \nthe possibility that our regulatory authorities do not have sufficient \nauthority necessary to deal with potential financial institution \nfailures. As a result, this is not an acknowledgment that anything like \nthat will happen, but there is certainly the threat and concern in our \nfinancial markets as to whether we need to have additional protective \nauthorities.\n  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation protects against the loss \nof insured deposits if a federally insured bank or savings institution \nfails. It is important to note, though, that depositors who have \ndeposits at these institutions are protected by Federal guarantees, and \nthese guarantees are, in the event of a bank failure, immediately \nprotected by the FDIC. It is not the taxpayers but fees and assessments \npaid by the depository institutions themselves that cover the cost of \nthis protection. However, the level of borrowing authority the FDIC has \nto provide this protection has not increased since 1991. At that time, \nthe amount was set at $30 billion. The assets in the banking industry \nunder protection have tripled since that time from $4.5 trillion to \n$13.6 trillion. Yet the borrowing authority of the FDIC has not been \nincreased.\n  This legislation does two significant things. It increases the \nborrowing authority of the FDIC from $30 billion to $100 billion, \napproximating the percentage increase of the assets under protection \nand the growth in the assets under protection since the original level \nwas set in 1991. The bill also authorizes a temporary increase in \nborrowing authority from that $100 billion increased level up to but \nnot to exceed $500 billion based on a process that would require the \nconcurrence of the FDIC, the Federal Reserve Board, and the Treasury \nDepartment, in consultation with the President. The reason for this \nadditional authority is because of the extreme difficulties we are \nfacing in our economy now, and we need to ensure that the FDIC has the \nnecessary capacity to deal with any such threats.\n  This legislation is very important and urgent. The reason I bring it \nforth on this national service legislation is because we don't have \ntime to wait to consider this legislation. It exists in a freestanding \nbill form on a bipartisan basis, with Republicans and Democrats in \nstrong support of the legislation. I believe there is strong agreement \nthroughout the financial industries that this kind of increased \nborrowing authority for the FDIC is helpful and an important piece of \nthe solution to the problems we face today.\n  As a matter of fact, one of the reasons it is urgent is not only \nbecause we need to be sure the FDIC is properly protected or in a \nposition to properly protect depositors and financial institutions but \nalso because in order to deal with this needed fund, the FDIC is \ncurrently considering significant increases in assessments to our \nNation's banks. These increased assessments in many cases, in some of \nour smaller and midsize communities, are creating a terrific financial \nthreat to the banks, which, in turn, then reduces the potential of \nthese banks to engage in lending authority, the type of credit activity \nwe want to see happening. So while Congress waits, we see credit being \nfurther restricted by the failure of Congress to take this action and \nfree up the FDIC authority.\n  Again, another one of the reasons I bring the amendment today is \nbecause this legislation, even though it is supported on a broad, \nbipartisan basis, is being caught up with other issues in the Senate \nthat could delay its consideration and result in the imposition of \nsignificantly increased assessments on our Nation's banks. That is the \ncram-down legislation in terms of bankruptcy proposals that have been \nput forward.\n  Everyone in this body and throughout Congress and the country \nrecognizes that we are having a difficult time dealing with very \ncontroversial proposals about our bankruptcy laws which have become \nknown as the cram-down provisions that may or may not gain support in \nthis Senate for passage. I personally think it is unlikely that the \ncram-down legislation will ultimately gain sufficient support in the \nSenate to be passed, but regardless of whether that happens, it is a \ndifficult, controversial issue. This legislation, which is not \ndifficult and not controversial, is being slowed down by being tied \nwith the bankruptcy cram-down provisions. Because of that, it is \nimperative that we move forward as expeditiously as possible, consider \nthe amendment, and move forward with this piece of the important \nreforms necessary for us to properly address the credit crisis and the \nfinancial threats our Nation faces today.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who seeks recognition?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. I say to the Presiding Officer, it is kind of ironic that \nboth of us, who are from Delaware, are in the Chamber right now, and I \nwant to start off by telling a short story about the University of \nDelaware and a visit I had there not long ago. I was invited, as my \ncolleague has been invited, to speak to students and to host and be a \npart of a townhall meeting a month or two ago.\n  I opened up by talking to the students for a bit of the time, and \nthen I took questions or comments from the students. I felt one of the \nmost poignant questions was asked at the end of the session. Most of \nthe students there were freshmen, sophomores, and juniors.\n  One young lady, who asked a question at the end of the session, was a \nsenior. She is going to be graduating in a couple months. The question \non her mind is, frankly, on the minds of a lot of graduating seniors at \ncolleges and universities inside of Delaware and throughout our \ncountry. I might also add, it is on the minds of a lot of folks who are \nabout to finish high school or who have finished and are still looking \nfor work.\n  The young lady who spoke recently at our forum at the University of \nDelaware said: I am going to graduate in\n\n[[Page S3638]]\n\nMay. I am not sure what I am going to do. She said: There used to be a \nlot of employers who came to this campus and other campuses looking for \npeople to hire, to come and join them at their companies or at their \nworkplaces. She said: Not so much of that is going on this year, for \nreasons I think we all understand.\n  While I am hopeful and encouraged this is not a permanent phenomenon \nbut one that will be short lived, relatively speaking, her concerns are \njustified. I shared with her that when I graduated from Ohio State many \na moon ago I entered a life of service for about 4\\1/2\\ or 5 years with \nthe U.S. Navy. It was a deal I gladly entered into, Navy ROTC. The Navy \nhelped put me through school at Ohio State, and when it was over, I \nowed the Navy some years of my life. I was very pleased to give that \ntime, even in the middle of a hot war in Southeast Asia.\n  What I suggested to the young woman that day at the University of \nDelaware is that if she decided she did not find the job she wants with \na company she wants or some other employer she is excited about working \nfor, she should consider spending maybe not just a couple of months but \nmaybe a year or even two in serving.\n  There are any number of opportunities to serve in Delaware and \nthroughout the country. In fact, in some ways the need for people to \nserve is greater than it has been in a long time because nonprofits and \nothers are cutting back and there is a need for those who will \nvolunteer and step forward and say: Here am I. Send me. Or what can I \ndo to help out?\n  I am not sure to what extent she internalized that message and is \ngoing to go out and look for opportunities to serve, but I know there \nis a great need for people who will serve.\n  For us, part of the challenge is trying to make sure those who want \nto serve can identify the opportunities to serve, those who want to \nmake a difference in their lives are given some help and guidance in \ngetting to places where they can make a difference with their lives.\n  The thing I like most of all about this legislation--we talk a lot \nhere about that we ought to be more bipartisan. And God knows I believe \nthat. I know the Presiding Officer feels that way. But one of the great \nthings about this legislation is that it is about as bipartisan as it \ngets.\n  I want to take a moment to commend a couple of folks who are on the \nfloor. I see Senator Hatch talking with Senator Dodd. Both of them have \nbeen very instrumental in this legislation. I commend Senator Mikulski, \nSenator Hatch, Senator Enzi, Senator McCain--I do not know if he is a \ncosponsor of this bill. He has been a big champion of service over the \nyears. I commend Senator Kennedy, who I believe was here yesterday. He \nis a huge champion of this legislation. This legislation enjoys broad \nbipartisan support.\n  I say to my friend from Connecticut: Good going. Thank you for being \nthe wind under our wings on this issue for a long time and for \ncontinuing to inspire us and encouraging us to go forward.\n  A couple years from now--maybe not even that long--I hope I run into \nthat young woman again who asked that question at the University of \nDelaware a month or so ago. I hope she says to me: I took your advice. \nI looked around and I found a couple of opportunities where I could \nserve, and I decided to do that for a year or so. At the end of my year \nor so, the job market improved, the economy improved, and I went to \nwork for some other employer and went on with the rest of my life.\n  One of the things I look for as an employer, one of the things I look \nfor when there is a downtime, like right now, a downtime in our \neconomy--when a lot of people are looking for employment opportunities \nand maybe not finding them, and they have some space to fill in their \nlives--how do they fill up that space? How do they fill up that dead \ntime?\n  I am always encouraged when I find someone who says: I decided to go \nout and work with young people to help make sure they were going to be \nsuccessful in life. I worked with veterans. I worked with Boy Scouts or \nGirl Scouts. I worked in Boys & Girls Clubs. I mentored. I did all \nkinds of things.\n  The idea behind this legislation is to better ensure that those who \nwant to serve--maybe who do not have a lot to do in their lives right \nnow; they have some free time they have not had for a long time because \ntheir studies are over--we want to make sure they will have some \nopportunities, good opportunities, to serve.\n  I will close with this: These are the words I actually shared with \nthe University of Delaware students the other day. I talked about the \nsources of joy. We always look for joy. Everybody wants to be happy. \nAlmost everybody I know wants to be happy. There are any number of \nsources of joy people turn to from time to time.\n  In my own life, I have always found the best source of joy--the one \nthat never goes away, the one that never disappears, which always can \nbe counted on--the best source of joy in our lives is helping other \npeople, finding ways to give of ourselves to help other people.\n  For those young people in this country who decide to seize on the \nopportunities that will be provided through this legislation's \nenactment, they will have the opportunity to get something. Maybe it \nwill provide good letters of recommendation going forward. Maybe it \nwill provide for a stronger resume going forward. I think even more \nimportantly than that, they are going to do a lot of good for folks \nwith their own lives. They are going to do a lot of good for folks. \nThey are going to help those people who need to be helped, and maybe, \nas important as anything, the one who serves will enjoy a sense of \nsatisfaction that, frankly, is sometimes hard to come by.\n\n  So I again applaud those who provided leadership on this bill, and I \nlook forward to supporting it as we go forward this week. Thank you \nvery much.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me begin by thanking my colleague from \nDelaware for his generous comments. He has been an advocate and strong \nsupporter of the notion of service, and for that I thank him. I also \ncommend my colleague from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, as well as \nSenator Hatch, Senator Ted Kennedy, and Senator Enzi, who have all been \nstrong supporters, over the years, of the idea of providing venues and \nopportunities for people to serve our country in one capacity or \nanother.\n  I rise this afternoon to offer my support for the Kennedy-Hatch Serve \nAmerica Act. Four and a half decades ago, I was with my parents on a \nvery cold January 20, not very far from where I am standing today, \nwatching a young man by the name of John F. Kennedy, at the age of 43, \nbecome the President of the United States on the east front of the \nCapitol. It was a bitter cold day--we had a terrible snowstorm on the \nday before that January 20, 1961. As a very young boy of 12 or 13 years \nof age, I listened to the President excite a generation to get involved \nin things larger than ourselves. I was so motivated by his remarks, as \nwere millions of others, that a few years later when I finished \ncollege, I joined the Peace Corps. I traveled to the Dominican \nRepublic, not far from the Haitian border, where I spent 2 years in the \nmountains of that country working with the people in the small village \nof Benito Moncion in the province of Santiago Rodriguez. It was a life-\nchanging experience. I came back from that experience a very different \nperson than when I had left.\n  I was joined by millions of others, who went off and joined VISTA, \nthe military, and community action organizations all across the \ncountry. I have been asked so many times over the years why I joined \nthe Peace Corps. Why did other people go into the Marine Corps, the \nJustice Department, and serve their country? The reason I have given \nover these last four and a half decades is, because an American \nPresident asked me to. It's not any more complicated than that. Someone \nasked me to serve, and the thought that someone believed I could do \nsomething to make a difference was a form of flattery, I suppose, but \nit also provided the opportunity for me to meet that challenge. It did \nso by creating the structures that allowed us to step into a program \nthat gave us the opportunity to serve.\n  That is what we are doing again here today: providing the structure \nthat will allow for people today--who are no different from any other \ngeneration of\n\n[[Page S3639]]\n\nAmericans over our two centuries as a Republic--to be asked to serve. \nPeople today want to serve, and they have the same desires and \nambitions to make a difference for our country in their local \ncommunities, in our States, and in our Nation.\n  What Senator Mikulski, Senator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, and Senator \nEnzi have done with this bill is to create the architecture by which \nwhen we ask people to serve, they have a place to come. We have a spot \nfor you. We have a place where you can make a difference in our \ncountry. That is the brilliance of this idea. This bill expands \nopportunities not only to college graduates or to those out of graduate \nschool; we actually begin in this bill by offering you the opportunity \nto serve as a middle school student, a high school student, or someone \nwho does want to go on to higher education. Maybe most exciting of all, \nwe offer these opportunities to people who perhaps have the most to \ngive--the retirees in our country. The individuals who have been at \nwork providing for their families, engaged in business practices by \nwhich they developed their wisdom and expertise over the years, and who \nhave now reached a point in their lives where they would like to share \nthat. What a wonderful opportunity for our country to reach out to that \ngeneration of retirees and say: Here is an opportunity for you to \ncontinue to make a difference.\n  After I finished the Peace Corps, I came back and served for 6 years \nin the Army Reserves, the National Guard. That was a good experience. \nIt was very different, obviously, to go off to basic training at Fort \nDix, NJ, but nonetheless a very worthwhile experience. So service \ncovers a wide range of activities. In my case, it was the Peace Corps, \nthen it was the Army Reserves, and then it was Big Brothers Big \nSisters. I was a Big Brother in my State of Connecticut. So service has \nbeen a major part of my life.\n  I would like to think today that to the extent I have made a \ndifference in this job, it was affected certainly by my family, first \nand foremost, but also by the people, whose names will never be known \nby others, who had a huge influence on me. People in that small village \nin the Dominican Republic, people in my community in Connecticut, \npeople I met in the military service--all have shaped me and taught me \nthe lessons of how serving each other, making a difference in each \nother's lives, can make a significant difference for many more.\n  In Connecticut, community members, both young and old, are giving \ntheir time.\n  In Hamden, CT, older Americans such as Mozelle Vann, a retired social \nworker, are working to make sure elementary school students don't fall \nthrough the cracks--one example, one woman, making a difference, \naffecting the lives of students who are going to be enriched and lead \nbetter lives because Mozelle Vann is giving something back.\n  High school students in Waterbury, CT, are giving back to their \ncommunities by taking part in the Youth Health Service Corps created by \nthe Connecticut Area Health Education Center. This organization works \nwith disadvantaged high school students interested in pursuing health \ncareers. Lord knows we need people to move into professions relating to \nhealth care. These students complete rigorous training and dedicate \ntheir time to working with nursing home residents. So these high school \nstudents, in the midst of determining what their futures will hold, are \nbeing offered the opportunity to learn about health care services, \nmaking a difference in a nursing home that is most likely shorthanded, \nand serving people in that community.\n  This past year, residents worked with students to create a Martin \nLuther King, Jr., commemorative quilt and together discussed Dr. King's \nimpact on our Nation.\n  There are as many examples as there are communities and individuals \nwhom we represent of people who want to serve and want to give \nsomething back.\n  Senators Thad Cochran of Mississippi, my good friend, and I have \noffered four ideas to this bill, and I am very grateful to Senator \nMikulski, Senator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, and Senator Enzi as well, for \ntheir willingness to accept these ideas. Representative Rosa DeLauro, \nthe Congresswoman from New Haven, CT, is the author of these ideas in \nthe House of Representatives.\n  The first of these we call the semester of service, giving students a \nchance to give something back, learning early the benefit and the value \nof volunteering, of stepping up and serving your community. The \nSemester of Service Act is one that will allow the opportunity for \nchildren within the educational system to serve our communities. This \nservice-learning will take place right alongside math problems and book \nreports. With a semester of service, we ask our students to not only \nconsider themselves residents in their communities but resources to \nthem. Just as mine did, I have no doubt that the younger generation \nwill respond to that call.\n  The Summer of Service Act is also a large part of the bill. The bill \nprovides our middle and high school students unique opportunities to \nserve during the summer months. Already in Connecticut, more than 5,500 \nstudents take part in community service activities linked to academic \nachievement. With this legislation, that is something we will be able \nto do across the country.\n  The bill also includes many parts of the Encore Service Act, a bill \nSenator Cochran and I authored to help harness the enormous experience \nand wisdom older Americans have to offer in their communities, as I \nmentioned a moment ago. We have all heard about the challenges posed by \nthe 78 million baby boomers nearing retirement age. Yet Americans are \nliving longer and healthier lives than at any time in our history, and \nit is time to look at that growing population of experienced, capable \nAmericans of different professions and backgrounds as the asset it is, \nand to realize what a difference it can make in our country.\n  Together, the programs included in this bill will encourage older \nAmericans to serve communities with the greatest need, whether through \nAmeriCorps or through the Silver Scholars Program. The legislation also \noffers Encore Fellowships for older Americans who have already had \nfull, successful careers to lend their professional expertise and \nexperience to the cause of community and public service. It expands the \ncapacity and builds on the success of current senior programs. So I \nagain commend my colleagues for including that language.\n  And finally, we can't talk about expanding service opportunities \nwithout talking about the AmeriCorps program, which is the heart of \nnational service in our country. The Serve America Act will expand \nAmeriCorps to include 250,000 members, allowing many more Americans to \nserve each other. Last year alone, 75,000 AmeriCorps members gave back \nto their communities, and they brought reinforcements. Those 75,000 \nmembers--and this statistic can't be repeated often enough--those \n75,000 AmeriCorps members recruited 2.2 million community volunteers. \nYou talk about a ripple effect--having 75,000 people across our country \nin AmeriCorps who then went out and recruited 2.2 million people in \ntheir communities to get deeply involved and serve those communities. \nThat is the benefit. Some discuss the cost of the 75,000 AmeriCorps \nmembers, but the fact that they were able to attract 2.2 million people \nto also serve is tremendously worthwhile. Which is why I am pleased \nthat in this bill, we increase the AmeriCorps education award and peg \nits increases to the Pell Grant.\n  I again thank the authors of this bill, of which I am proud to be a \nleading cosponsor, for the accomplishments they have achieved. As I \nsaid a moment ago, this bill is creating the opportunity for Americans \nto serve. Just as when I was standing on the steps of the east front of \nthe Capitol, 45 or 46 years ago, and heard an American President not \nonly ask us to serve, but provided with opportunities to do so, today \nwe need to provide that same structure, that same ability for people to \nserve. They want to. People are anxious to. It is something all \nAmericans take pride in, and it transcends party, partisanship, \npolitics and ideology. People want to serve our country. We are \nbenefitting from it in ways we can't even imagine. We need to see to it \nthat this generation is going to achieve or have the same opportunities \nto fulfill that desire as well.\n\n[[Page S3640]]\n\n  For all of the reasons I have mentioned, this bill is very worthy of \nour unanimous support, and I hope it will enjoy that. This is one of \nthose moments when I think all of us, despite our political differences \nfrom time to time, recognize the value of this. Whether it is in faith-\nbased organizations, whether it is in community organizations, we are a \nricher, stronger, more vibrant nation because people have the \nopportunity to serve each other. There is nothing more gratifying, \nnothing you will ever do that will give you a greater sense of \ngratification than knowing you have helped another human being. \nParticularly in times such as these when people are struggling--losing \njobs, homes, savings--they want to know if anybody can help. Every \nsingle one of us can make a difference in the life of somebody else. \nProviding that opportunity today, with the structure that Senator \nMikulski, Senator Kennedy, Senator Hatch, and Senator Enzi have \ncreated, is just what we need. So I commend them for it.\n  Let me mention as well that I know Mike Crapo, the Senator from \nIdaho, my good friend and a very valuable member of the Banking \nCommittee, came to the floor and has offered an amendment, a proposal \nto deal with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Let me say that \nI support what Senator Crapo wants to do. This is an idea that I \nbelieve is necessary. The problem here is twofold.\n  One is, obviously, for this bill, we are hoping to move through \nwithout amendments. Members have worked very closely together to \nconstruct this bipartisan bill. That in no way diminishes the point \nSenator Crapo is making. In fact, we are working on another bill that \nincludes more than just the Crapo amendment, which will be an important \naddition over the next number of days. We are trying to work it out. I \nhear there are some differences. I would say respectfully to my \ncolleague from Idaho that I would hope he might reconsider offering the \namendment on this bill for the reasons I have mentioned, not because \nhis idea lacks merit--I support the idea--but if we add amendments to \nthis bill, then it is going to make it that much more difficult to get \nit done.\n  Secondly, there is more to do than just what the Crapo amendment \nwould suggest, and that is going to require a little more time to put \nthat together. There is no immediate emergency here. I have been \nguaranteed by the FDIC, that although they would like it to get done, \nit is not something--I have been told--that in the next number of days \nor so that unless we act, there is a catastrophic event that could \noccur. But clearly we need to move on this. He and others have my \ncommitment that we are going to achieve that, but at this hour, at this \nmoment on this bill, I would respectfully urge my colleagues, if \nrequired, to table this amendment and preferably to have the amendment \nwithdrawn so we wouldn't have to be in that situation.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, before the Senator from Connecticut \nleaves, I wish to thank him for his contribution and remarks in two \nareas, both on the Serve America Act and his comments on the Crapo \namendment.\n  First, on the Serve America Act, I wish to say on the Senate floor \nthat we really appreciate the contribution he has made to this bill. \nWhen Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch were working on it, I know they \nhad three goals: how we could reinvigorate national service, how we \ncould refocus it in a contemporary way, as well as how we could \nreenergize it.\n  I think the Senator's ideas were some of the best, involving middle \nschool children and so on. They have been outstanding. That is no \nsurprise because the Senator has been involved with this not only in \nhis own personal life--walking his own talk as a Peace Corps volunteer. \nI remember when we were putting the original national service bill \ntogether, Senator Dodd was the Senator who reminded the committee that \nthe poor needed to serve as well. They are not just passive \nbeneficiaries. We always think maybe it is only the affluent and the \nyoung who can serve. The Senator from Connecticut was the one who said: \nWait a minute. Everybody can serve. It doesn't matter what your age or \nyour income is.\n  I think the original bill was better because of the philosophy of the \nSenator. Now we can see that here. It is a philosophy about the \nempowerment of people. We thank the Senator for that.\n  On the banking bill, I, too, agree with the Senator. He can offer the \namendment, but this could sink the bill in the process. I hope he will \nwithdraw this amendment and offer it on a more appropriate vehicle.\n  Again, I thank the Senator for his work today and for his work as a \nSenator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nGeorgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am glad the Senator from Connecticut \nand the Senator from Utah are on the Senate floor. I rise to speak in \nfavor of the National Service Act and to commend the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee for the diligent work they did on this \nreauthorization.\n  There are a lot of people who will poke fun at voluntarism or at \nprograms or say we are always creating new things and spending more. \nThis bill, with a bipartisan effort by Senators Enzi, Dodd, Mikulski, \nand others, is to ensure that the 40 programs we had under the National \nService Act are brought down to 24 programs and to see that meaningful, \ngood programs are empowered.\n  This bill doesn't pay people to volunteer. It provides capital for \nthe infrastructure for communities to develop the programs for \nvolunteers; for example, Hands on Georgia and Hands on Atlanta. Hands \non Atlanta is a program of volunteers that addresses the 52 percent of \nthe young children in Atlanta elementary schools who are not reading at \ngrade level. Volunteers have been mobilized over the last 4, 5 years to \ngive the greatest gift of all--the gift of literacy--and improve the \nstanding of our children.\n  It is no small secret that one of the reasons our school \nsuperintendent in Atlanta was selected the superintendent of the year \nrecently by the national association was because of the dramatic \nprogram of bringing people into the school system to help uplift our \nstudents. So voluntarism is important to us in the United States, and \nit is important to our reputation around the world.\n  Secondly, I support this legislation because I have an affinity for a \nyoung lady named Michelle Nunn. A former U.S. Senator from Georgia, Sam \nNunn, was a distinguished leader here for 24 years and served our State \nwell. He is personally a good friend of mine. His daughter Michelle has \ndedicated her life to the organization of volunteer efforts in this \ncountry to improve the plight of other people. She now heads the Points \nof Light Foundation, started by George Herbert Walker Bush, which helps \npeople around the country. For Michelle's everlasting support and \ncontribution to voluntarism, I give her credit.\n  I also want to take a minute--Senator Dodd served in the Peace Corps, \nand I wanted him to hear this because I want to acknowledge his support \non this effort, along with Senators Hatch and Kennedy. This past \nSaturday, I attended one of the most moving ceremonies of my life--\nmoving in a sad way but also in an uplifting way.\n  Unfortunately, a wonderful young lady, 24 years old, from Cumming, \nGA, Kate Puzey, was killed in Benin, Africa, on March 11. She was a \nPeace Corps worker who graduated first in her class in high school, was \nan honors graduate from William and Mary, and she studied French in \nParis to learn the language that led her to be able to go to this part \nof the world and teach this poor African nation about agriculture and \nother skills. She served since July of 2007 and was in the last 2 \nmonths of her service in Benin.\n  I went to this service because I felt moved. I am ranking member of \nthe African Subcommittee on Foreign Relations. Paul Coverdell, who \nserved in the seat I now hold, was a director of the Peace Corps. I \nfelt moved that morning when I got to go to the service and sit in the \nback of the room and pay my respects to a great American. I left having \nlistened to 12 eulogies by young people whose lives were changed by \nKate. The acting director of the Peace Corps, Ms. Jody Olsen, delivered \na beautiful eulogy.\n  I realized how much voluntarism means to the United States, not just \non\n\n[[Page S3641]]\n\nour shores but in Africa and on continents around the world. I commend \npeople such as Senator Dodd who have given time in the Peace Corps. I \nask the Senate to give its unanimous support to this legislation. I \ndedicate this speech in honor of Kate Puzey, to her life, and what she \ndid as a Georgian and as a volunteer. She joined the Peace Corps and \nchanged the plight, the lives, the hopes, and in fact the future of \nchildren in that small country on the west coast of Africa.\n  God bless the Peace Corps and the life of Kate Puzey. And thanks to \nthose who have volunteered and to the committee that has brought this \nNational Service Act reauthorization to the floor of the Senate.\n  Mr. DODD. If my colleague will yield.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Yes.\n  Mr. DODD. I thank him for his gracious comments about this young \nwoman. My nephew graduated from college a few years ago and was in \nAfrica for approximately a year and a half. He spent 6 months in Guyana \nworking with the people there, increasing awareness on issues such as \nHIV/AIDS. These are wonderful examples, like the young woman the \nSenator described, of people who make a difference.\n  The great thing about the Peace Corps is not just helping people in a \nstruggling country get back on their feet but it is the experience of \nreturning home from service. It is the lessons learned that we bring \nback to our communities. There are 180,000 of us who are returned \nvolunteers since the first group left from the south lawn of the White \nHouse to go to Ethiopia, and how blessed we are with the richness of \nopportunities here and the lessons learned.\n  I commend my colleague for being at that ceremony and reflecting on \nthe impact this one individual made, this young woman, in service of \nour country. I can't think of a more compelling argument on why this \nbill being offered by our colleagues deserves our unanimous support. \nAgain, I thank the Senator for his comments.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, the Senator and I are precisely the same \nage, and he and I were both inspired by President Kennedy's inaugural \naddress and the establishment of the Peace Corps. It is ironic that the \nnext President who embraced voluntarism in his office happened to be \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush. So we had a great Democrat and a great \nRepublican who encouraged us to volunteer to help the plight of others. \nIt is a great tribute to this bill and to America.\n  Mr. DODD. It is also not widely known--Senator Isakson mentioned \nPresident Bush and the Thousand Points of Light Program, which he \nsponsored--that President Ronald Reagan was a strong supported of the \nPeace Corps, increasing the budget significantly. Loret Ruppe was the \ndirector. I served with her husband, who was a Congressman from \nMichigan. She was a magnificent director of the Peace Corps. Every year \nof Ronald Reagan's Presidency, he supported the Peace Corps program. So \nit is a joy to see the bipartisan support that my colleague has \nmentioned.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the Chair and yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished Senator from \nGeorgia. He has been a prime sponsor of this legislation. There are \nvery few people around here I admire any more than I admire him. He is \na terrific addition to the Senate. I am honored that he would be on \nthis bill and be willing to speak for it. That means a lot to me, and \nit is going to mean a lot to the folks in his home State and all over \nthis country. It is the right thing to do. I thank him personally for \nbeing such a great Senator.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I wish to take a moment to discuss the role \nof the State service commissions under this bill and the existing \nnational service system. One of the things that was very important to \nme when we drafted this legislation was to make sure the States were \ngiven a primary role in the program so we would have 50 State \nlaboratories using this program. We didn't just want to add a level of \nFederal bureaucracy. Time and time again, it has been shown that State \ngovernments are more responsive and in tune with the needs of their \ncommunities and, with this bill, we will put that resource to good use.\n  For those who do not know, State service commissions are Governor-\nappointed public agencies or nonprofit organizations made up of more \nthan 1,110 commissioners--private citizens helping lead the Nation's \nphilanthropic movement. The Nation's 52 State service commissions \ncurrently grant more than $220 million in AmeriCorps funds and $28 \nmillion in State-based initiatives with State or private funds to \nsupport citizen service and voluntarism in America.\n  In Utah, this role is filled by the Utah Commission on Volunteers, \nwhich is overseen by our Lieutenant Governor, a great Lieutenant \nGovernor named Gary Herbert. They oversee the work of more than 8,000 \nUtahans who participate in national service programs, including the \nAmeriCorps, Learn and Serve, and, of course, Senior Corps programs, to \nmention a few.\n  The Serve America Act will triple the oversight and programming for \ncommissions over the course of the next 5 years, increasing \nparticipants from 75,000 to 250,000. Effective grants oversight and \nplanning by commissions is essential to the integrity of these new \nprograms. The State commissions will administer five new corps, five \ngrant competitions, and the Serve America fellows program, which is an \nindividual placement program that will be administratively intensive \nbut vital to get members to rural communities and small organizations.\n  Increasingly, State commissions take the lead role of managing \nvolunteers and donations in response to natural disasters, which has \nbeen particularly important in the gulf coast hurricane recovery and \nMidwest flood relief.\n  For example, the Iowa Commission on Volunteer Service last year set \nup eight volunteer reception centers, staffed with AmeriCorps members, \nthat helped increase and better utilize traditional volunteers in \nIowa's historic flooding and tornadoes of last summer. Those centers \nconnected over 800,000 volunteer hours to families who called in for \nhelp. These centers became the central points for deployment for faith-\nbased groups, schools, and businesses that sent volunteers to help.\n  AmeriCorps members often led teams of unaffiliated volunteers after \ntraining them to gut and muck out houses, as well as clear the miles of \ndebris that littered the Iowa landscape. This effort was valued at over \n$13 million by FEMA in savings to the taxpayers, and it is still going \non today. In fact, two of the centers are being run for the rebuilding \nphase and over 1,000 AmeriCorps members will help support the massive \nrebuilding efforts of this past summer.\n  I think it is clear the State service commissions are up to the task \nof overseeing much of the work that will be done under the Serve \nAmerica Act. I certainly will be glad to see them take on this much \nlarger role that this bill gives them the opportunity to do.\n  I am a firm believer of one reason why our economy has run so well in \nthe past and one reason why we have a Federal Republic that has lasted \nall these years is because we recognize that with these 50 States, we \nhave 50 State laboratories to test out these programs. Then we can pick \nand choose which ones are the most successful and why. It is great to \nhave them competing against each other, having them setting examples \nfor each other, having them open doors for each other. There is a lot \nto that. This bill basically turns over the effective running of all \nthese funds to State representatives and to State volunteer movements \nand commissions, State service commissions, if you will.\n  We will learn a lot from this. We have already learned a lot, but we \nwill learn even more, and as we move toward 250,000 volunteers under \nthis program, that will be extended to probably at least 7 million or 8 \nmillion more volunteers, none of whom will be paid for giving this type \nof service--at least these 7 million or 8 million. We do pay people a \nsmall stipend that is less than\n\n[[Page S3642]]\n\nthe minimum wage, less than the poverty level, but that extrapolates \ninto as many as 7 million people, maybe even more--we hope more--who \nwill actually volunteer at no cost to the Government and save trillions \nof dollars over the years.\n  This is a conservative program in many respects and it is a liberal \nprogram in the sense that it helps so many people. Conservatives want \nto help all these people too. I guess the best thing to say is it is \nneither conservative nor liberal, although it has the best instincts of \nboth sides who come together in the best interest of helping their \nfellow men, women, and children in this great country.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I am sure there are others who wish to speak \non the Crapo amendment. However, either speaking on the Crapo amendment \nor the bill, we ask people to come over and talk on it. In the \nmeantime, we would be willing to set this amendment aside. If there are \nother amendments the minority wishes to offer, we are certainly not \ngoing to stop them from doing that. I think we should get all the \namendments we can on this legislation.\n  So if there are other amendments people have, there is no stopping \nthem from offering them.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I would like to begin by thanking my \ndistinguished colleague, Senator Mikulski, for her effective leadership \nsteering this bill through the HELP Committee while gaining bipartisan \nsupport.\n  The strong support this bill enjoys is not surprising given her \nstewardship and, of course, the hard work of Senator Kennedy who \nbrought us to this point.\n  I would also like to thank Senators Hatch and Enzi for their work on \nthis bill.\n  When we work together across the aisle, the end result is a better \nbill and good governance.\n  I can think of no bill that better represents the values of America \nthan the Serve America Act.\n  It will expand the opportunities for Americans to serve their \ncommunities and their Nation.\n  It makes me--and I think all of us here proud that each year over 60 \nmillion Americans volunteer, donating over 8 billion hours of their own \ntime, their own lives--to make our country--and the world--a better \nplace.\n  We are in a time of crisis. Right now, our country needs those \nvolunteers at our schools, hospitals, and shelters more than ever. \nNonprofits are doing all that they can to help those who have lost \ntheir jobs, their houses, their savings, their retirement.\n  This bill recognizes the need to reinforce and strengthen this system \nin a number of ways.\n  I recently spoke here in the Senate about the need for our country to \nreset its focus on how best to change the culture of our economy away \nfrom a Wall Street profit-first mentality to one that prioritizes jobs \nand careers that will help our Nation tackle the challenges it \ncurrently faces.\n  I believe that the vitality of our economy rests with our ability to \nbe the world's leader in innovation, and I believe this means that we \nmust do more to attract the best and the brightest to careers in \nscience and engineering.\n  Those who have dedicated themselves to these fields have much to \ncontribute beyond making our economy competitive; they also contribute \nto our communities' well-being.\n  This bill, I am proud to say, recognizes the important role that \nengineers can play in bettering our communities.\n  I would like to commend the HELP Committee for expanding the purpose \nof the bill to include providing service opportunities for our Nation's \nretiring professionals, including those retiring from the science, \ntechnical, engineering, and mathematics professions--also known as \n``STEM'' jobs.\n  Not only will this allow us to tap the unique skills and knowledge of \nour retired STEM workforce, but it will allow us to strengthen the STEM \neducation pipeline.\n  This bill will send retired engineers into communities, classrooms, \nand after school programs, allowing them to share their wisdom and \nexperience with students.\n  Ultimately, they will help these young people understand not only the \nimportant role that science and math can play in their careers, but how \nthey can use their expertise in those fields to solve our country's--\nand the world's--greatest challenges.\n  This bill also acknowledges that innovative, community-based service- \nlearning programs that integrate STEM are a successful strategy to \nengage middle- and high-school students in meaningful hands-on learning \nopportunities that also help them meet their community's needs.\n  It specifically allows funds to be used to integrate service-learning \nprograms into STEM curricula at the elementary, secondary, and \npostsecondary schools levels and then draw on practicing or retired \nSTEM professionals to work in these programs.\n  In this case, electrical engineers might participate in a program \nthat helps students apply lessons from their math and science classes \nto expand and improve broadband access in rural communities.\n  Linking the classroom to real-world applications will help students \nbetter understand the role and responsibilities of engineers and \nscientists in the workplace.\n  The third way that this bill draws on the expertise and knowledge of \nengineers is that it allows ``Professional Corps'' programs to be \ncreated. These ``Professional Corps'' programs will recruit and place \nqualified professionals, like engineers, in communities that don't have \nan adequate supply of these professionals.\n  For example, an employer would sponsor an individual and pay their \nsalary to be placed in an organization that works with the community to \nconduct green energy audits of local public buildings or homes in \ndisadvantaged communities.\n  This would not only reduce a community's carbon footprint; it would \nalso help improve public awareness of engineering's critical role in \nsolving our Nation's greatest challenges--like energy efficiency and \nenergy dependence.\n  We must--once again--capture the attention of our students and let \nthem see the numerous ways that STEM contribute to our economy and can \nimprove the lives of their fellow citizens--in America and abroad.\n  Just as I decided to study engineering because I was inspired by \n``Sputnik'' and the race to put a man on the Moon, we must inspire our \nstudents to work on issues of critical need as well.\n  The underrepresentation of so many groups in STEM fields is \ntroubling, since diversity is widely acknowledged to spur innovation \nand creativity.\n  Innovation and creativity in turn spur the development of new \nproducts and new markets, which are essential to maintaining a \ncompetitive economy.\n  Engineers and scientists can have a tremendous impact on the lives of \nthese traditionally underrepresented groups by serving as mentors in \ntheir communities.\n  This bill will encourage our Nation's scientists and engineers to \nwork in and with economically disadvantaged communities to ensure that \nthese fields include rather than exclude, and encourage rather than \ndiscourage, traditionally underrepresented groups from pursuing a STEM \neducation.\n  The Serve America Act will help our young people identify those \nchallenges and provide them with real opportunities to make a \ndifference--opportunities like improving energy efficiency, working \ntoward energy independence for America, bolstering disaster \npreparedness and response, promoting environmental sustainability, \nstrengthening our education and health care infrastructure, and \nimproving opportunities for economically disadvantaged individuals.\n\n[[Page S3643]]\n\n  These challenges are daunting, yet I know that if asked, a new \ngeneration of engineers and scientists will rise to the occasion.\n  I stand in proud support of the Serve America Act, as it will inspire \nmultiple generations to volunteer and to engage in national service.\n  Their generosity will not only strengthen America--but the world. I \nappreciate my colleagues' allowing me the opportunity to explain how \nthe service opportunities this bill creates are also opportunities for \nour practicing and retired engineers to serve their fellow citizens--\nensuring that that our country's future STEM workforce is strong \nenough, diverse enough, and motivated enough to tackle the greatest \nchallenges facing America.\n  I will close by once again thanking Senators Mikulski, Kennedy, \nHatch, and Enzi for their leadership.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call be \nrescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Nebraska). Without objection, it \nis so ordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I wish to speak for few minutes on the \nServe America Act. I think this is a great opportunity to talk about \nwhat is good about a lot of the Members of the Senate. I certainly \nappreciate and applaud the sponsors of this bill for their good \nintentions and know their hearts are in the right place. Some of my \nbest friends are supporting this bill. But I think, as we look at what \nis good about the hearts of many Members of the Senate, we need to \nrecognize this bill does represent a lot of what is wrong with our \nFederal Government today--a lot of our philosophies, and a lot of our \ndepartures from a constitutional form of government.\n  What works in America today is our civil society--a lot of the \nvolunteer groups that many of us have been a part of. I know for years \nI spent more time in United Way and a lot of the charity groups, being \non their boards back in my community, and I saw what the volunteer arts \ngroups and PTAs and health groups did to build a strong community. \nCivil society works in America. They are small groups. They are the \ntrue engines of character in our country. They promote service and \npatriotism. In this time where we have seen some of our economic \ninstitutions let us down, we have certainly seen our Government and our \npolicies let us down, civil society does not let us down. It works in \nAmerica today.\n  It is understandable why Congress would want to get involved. We see \nthat passion to serve, that desire to do something that is greater than \nyourselves. We look at that working in our civil society and we want to \nget involved and expand it.\n  Unfortunately, our history shows us when Government gets involved, it \ntends to take something that is working and make it not work nearly as \nwell. Civil society works because it is everything Government is not. \nIt is small, it is personal, it is responsive, it is accountable. Civil \nsociety must be protected from any effort to make it more like \nGovernment.\n  That is what we are doing with this bill today. This bill centralizes \ncontrol of important functions of our civil society. There is a \ndownside to good intentions here in Government. The Founders created a \nlimited government and our oath to support and defend the Constitution \nmeans that is our focus here. Our oath is to a limited government. The \nFounders wanted the people to be free from our good intentions. \nGovernment charity is anathema to what our Founders intended and what \nour Constitution stands for. Despite our good intentions, where we try \nto implement those good intentions and our compassion through the force \nof Government, we are effectively violating our oath of office here.\n  Well-intended legislation has left more than half of all Americans \ndependent on the Government. Today in America over half of Americans \nget their income from the government or a government source. About 20 \npercent of the country works for the government or an entity that gets \nits primary source of revenue from government. Another 20 percent gets \ntheir income and health care from Medicare or Social Security. Once you \nadd in welfare and other subsidies, you make it so over half of all \nAmericans are already dependent on the Government. This bill proposes \nto spend nearly $6 billion over 5 years, which means it will be \nprobably $10 billion, probably more, over a 10-year period. It will \nhave nearly a quarter of Americans working for it, which means it will \nbe the 14th largest company, as far as employees, in the entire world.\n  What have we done here that suggests we can manage anything like \nthat? Do you see anything in our history as a Federal Government that \nshows we have the ability to effectively manage something like that \nwithout extreme levels of waste and fraud and abuse? Look what we have \ndone recently with the stimulus plan and the bailout plans. As soon as \nit comes to light what is actually happening with that money, people \nare outraged at what is going on. Despite the good intentions of this \nbill, we are creating a huge new government entity that will be \nunmanageable and violates some of the core principles of our civil \nsociety. Every time the Government steps in to solve a problem, it \ncreates three new problems in its place.\n  This bill is everything wrong with how Congress sees the world. \nGovernment will make service organizations less effective, less \nresponsive, and less personal. When the French historian de Tocqueville \ncame to the United States not long after we were founded, one of the \nthings that amazed him about our country that was so different from \nFrance was that in his home country when there was a problem, people \nwould say: Someone ought to do it and government should do it; but in \nAmerica we were different. When someone saw a problem, they went and \ngot a friend and formed a small group and solved the problem \nthemselves. Much of that was motivated by religious convictions that \nour place in this world is not only to help ourselves but to love and \nhelp those around us. That was key.\n  Jefferson called it little democracies, when he saw these little \ngroups all around America voluntarily doing things to solve problems \nand make communities better. Burke called them little platoons. Most \npeople who understand America know that those voluntary groups are what \nmade our country great and what sustain us even today. Civil society \nbinds communities, not by its fruits, but by its motives--charity, \ndonations, giving without thought of getting anything in return. This \nis the selfless sacrifice that happens throughout America today. This \nis what works.\n  What does not work is what we are doing right here. The big \ndifference is private service organizations exist for the people who \nreceive the aid. Government service organizations exist for the people \nwho give it--in this case, for the people who are paid to do it. You \ncannot pay people to volunteer and expect the organization to remain \nfocused on its mission. Charity is a private, moral impulse, not a \ngovernment program.\n  Government will not and, by definition, cannot strengthen and replace \nthe civil society. Volunteerism is something that works in America. \nWhen we think of America, we do not think of Congress and Presidents, \nwe think of Little League games and PTA meetings and bake sales.\n  Civil society is America. It responds to needs, meets challenges, and \nsolves problems because it is free from Government. Because volunteers \ndonate their time and money, accountability is acute. I have seen it. I \nhave sat on a United Way board. Every year we evaluate every program \nand every dollar we have given to someone, and we determine is it \nworking or can we make it more efficient.\n  If the program is not working, the money goes away immediately. That \ndoes not happen here. If the program does not work here, we add more \nmoney to it. That is going to happen with every program we start, \nincluding the one we are talking about today.\n  Projects that do not work in a civil society get cut. Organizers who \nlose or abuse funds are dismissed. It is voluntary. So everyone is \ninvested in its success. We know the large groups throughout America, \nthe Boy Scouts, the Girl Scouts, the United Way, the Salvation Army, \nthe YMCA, Catholic\n\n[[Page S3644]]\n\nCharities, fraternal orders, groups such as Kiwanis, Rotary, Knights of \nColumbus. These are large organizations, but they work because they are \nlocally controlled.\n  Smaller groups, local arts councils and community theatres, PTAs, \nyouth sports leagues, the animal rescues, the book clubs, crisis \npregnancy centers, soup kitchens, food and other clothes drives that go \non, church service groups, they are everywhere.\n  Those are the little platoons, the little democracies that make this \ncountry work. For us to presume, in the Congress, that somehow we are \ngoing to reach out into all these groups and make it work better is \npretty presumptuous based on our history.\n  Why now? Why at a time in economic crisis with unimaginable debt and \nspending do we come in and say: We need to spend another $10 billion \nover the next 10 years to create another Government program to do \nsomething that is already working.\n  At the same time, we are talking about creating this new bureaucracy \nto replace private voluntarism with Government programming. We are \nactually cutting some of the incentives for people to give to charity \nand for the private sector to work. The President's budget actually \ncuts the charitable donations of the people who give the most to \ncharity in this country. So look at what we are doing. We are making it \nharder for the private sector to work.\n  You also look at what we have done over the years, forgetting that a \nlot of private charity and the motivation to serve God and community is \na religious-based motivation. What have we done in this country?\n  We have essentially tried to purge that motivation from our country. \nMost public schools, or at least a lot of them, used to sponsor Boy \nScout groups. But after being sued for years because the Boy Scouts \nhave God in their pledge and they set standards for their leaders that \nsome do not agree with, the threat of lawsuits essentially means our \nGovernment schools have thrown out the Boy Scouts.\n  More than half our astronauts, half our FBI agents, a lot of the most \nsuccessful people in this country were trained in the Boy Scouts to \nserve their community, where their character was developed. But this \nFederal Government has forced them out of public places. For years we \npurged religion from our society. Religion was the primary motivation \nfor a lot of civic groups, a lot of services, a lot of charities, a lot \nof hospitals that were formed, a lot of schools.\n  But we have said that has no place. Because we have unleashed the \nACLU and other groups to constantly sue and intimidate groups, that \nreligious motivation has been moved, has been purged in many cases.\n  Now we are going to come in and help solve the problem we have \ncreated. We want to promote voluntarism, we want to promote community \nservice, when what we have done over the last several decades is \nessentially tried to destroy the motivation for people to serve a cause \nthat is greater than themselves.\n  We cannot replace private charity with Government programs. If we \ntry, a lot of people are going to miss meals, suffer cold winters, and \nleaky roofs. I wish to go back to where I started. I appreciate the \nmotivation, the heartfelt sense of compassion and the patriotism that I \nknow my colleagues feel in sponsoring this legislation.\n  But I think we need to come to a point as a government that we \nrecognize we cannot do everything. That is why we take the oath to the \nConstitution to defend and protect the very limited form of Government. \nThis Congress, this Government, does not need to start or expand an \norganization to a quarter million people, when we are paying people to \ndo work that we decided needs to be done and take those decisions out \nof the hands of millions of Americans who look around every day and see \nwhat they can do to make their families, their communities, and their \ncountry a better place to live.\n  These are not Government decisions. We need to focus on what we were \nset up to do and do it much better than we are doing, instead of every \nweek coming in here, bringing our good intentions and our compassion \nand every problem we see across the country we say something needs to \nbe done. Then we say: The Government needs to do it.\n  That is the fatal flaw of the Congress today, is we forget that \nsacred oath of office that says: We will protect and defend the \nConstitution which says this Federal Government has a very limited \nfunction. And those functions that are not prescribed in the \nConstitution are left to individuals and to the States.\n  This is a huge well-intended mistake we are making. It serves a point \nthat we need to realize this Government needs to stop spending and stop \nborrowing, stop taxing, and let America work.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, almost every group that the distinguished \nSenator from South Carolina has mentioned is helped by this bill, and \nevery one of them wants this bill. This bill is basically run by the \nStates. I agree with the Senator, they do it better than anybody else.\n  As we close today's debate, I want to take this opportunity to focus \non the economic case for national and community service, to articulate \nwhy the Serve America Act makes sense from an economic standpoint, and \nto highlight why the bill will generate a good return on investment \nright when the country and so many individuals need it most.\n  In today's environment, every bill we consider must be viewed through \nan economic lens. What role does the legislation play in fueling our \neconomic recovery? How can we cost-efficiently make Government a \npartner with the private and nonprofit sectors? How can we ensure we \nsupport efforts that are effective and shut down those that are not? \nWhat are the short- and long-term effects of what we do?\n  Unfortunately, the economic recession has had a dramatic effect on \nour nonprofit sector and civil society. In the wake of the downturn, \nsenior centers, soup kitchens, nursing homes, nursery schools, and \nother nonprofit organizations serving the vulnerable have seen a \nthreefold crisis. As the markets have fallen, wealth has evaporated and \ndecimated charitable donations. By the way, I do not agree with the \nPresident's recommendation to cut back on tax benefits to those who \ngive to charity. The State and local budget crunch has hit the \nnonprofit sector especially hard. And the human need for help from \ncommunity-serving institutions is skyrocketing right at a time when \ntheir resources are shrinking. One report called it America's ``Quiet \nCrisis.'' I believe that we here in the Senate should give this crisis \nmore public attention and ensure that our civil society and our \nNation's volunteers, which are the bedrock of efforts to meet needs in \nour country, remain strong. We need to help give more Americans \nopportunities to do good works in hard times.\n  Research has uncovered disturbing evidence of civil society's growing \ntroubles. Churches, which are typically our Nation's great engines of \ncompassion, deliver social services to the poor and needy. Our country \ndepends on faith-based institutions to meet needs that they are \nuniquely equipped to meet, far better than distant Government \nbureaucracies. Unfortunately, churches raised $3 to $5 billion less \nthan anticipated in the last quarter of 2008, crippling efforts to keep \npace with growing humanitarian needs. Other nonprofit budgets are \nshrinking. Chicago's Meals on Wheels, which delivers hot meals to \nhomebound seniors, trimmed its budget by 35 percent; and half of all \nMichigan nonprofits say their financial support has dropped.\n  Meals on Wheels is a Federal program. It would not exist without \nsupport from the Federal Government. It is handled very well at the \nlocal level.\n  These trends are occurring just as need for help is rising. United \nWay call centers saw a 68-percent increase over the past year in the \nnumber of calls for basic needs, such as securing food, shelter, and \nwarm clothing, and is receiving 10,000-15,000 more calls every month \nthan in 2007.\n  Lorna L. Koci, services director for the Utah Food Bank, recently \nvisited my office to talk about increasing needs in my home State. The \ntop three reasons people dial 2-1-1 in Utah to reach the United Way \ncall center is for emergency food assistance followed by health care \nand housing needs. In the\n\n[[Page S3645]]\n\npast 6 months, calls requesting food assistance have doubled and food \npantry visits by Utah families are up at least 30 percent. Now you can \nimagine what that is in other States. Utah takes care of our people. My \nown church has a church welfare plan. No one in my faith should go \nwithout food, shelter or clothing. Most of the people served are the \nworking poor, but many families are seeking assistance for the first \ntime. These people were contributors and are now recipients. At \nalarming rates, needs are growing in Utah and across the Nation.\n  Addressing this quiet crisis in our civil society is a matter of \njobs, not just charity. The nonprofit sector accounts for 5 percent of \nGDP and 11 percent of the American workforce, with 9.4 million \nemployees and 4.7 million volunteers nationwide. For perspective, the \nnonprofit sector is greater than the auto and financial industries \ncombined. It contributes more than $322 billion in wages and its \nworkforce outnumbers the combined workforces of the utility, wholesale \ntrade, and construction industries. What happens to our nonprofit \nsector will have a big effect on our country, both from the standpoint \nof employment and meeting needs of the most vulnerable in our society.\n  We have spent a lot of time on the floor of this Senate discussing \nways to ``bailout'' industries and to get our economy moving again. I \ncertainly have not agreed with the levels of spending, and I worry \nabout the long-term effects of our actions on the Federal deficit and \nthe national debt. I don't think many of our actions have been wise, in \nthe short term and certainly not for the long term. Thomas Jefferson \nwarned of the moral problem of leaving a crippling debt to future \ngenerations. With the changing demographics in this country and the \ngrowth of entitlements, we are setting ourselves up for a fiscal crisis \nof tremendous significance.\n  Yet the economic debate has almost completely ignored the platoons of \ncivil society, those individuals, volunteers and nonprofit institutions \nin local neighborhoods and communities that do most of the social \nservice work in our country to meet vital needs and do it at low cost \nto governments and society.\n  There also has been so much talk of ``bailouts'' in our debates, \nlet's just bail out this industry or that industry. We need to move \nfrom talk of bailouts to a spirit of challenge in our country. Where is \nthe personal responsibility? Where is the support for efforts that \ntruly enlist Americans in local communities to step forward to lend a \nhand? Our answers are not going to be found in the Federal Government. \nOur Government can offer resources, but it cannot love a needy child, \noffer the hand of compassion to help the elderly live independently in \ntheir homes with dignity, or help provide the deft human touch that \ngives hope in times of despair.\n\n  So our debates on this floor should no longer exclude our nonprofit \nsector and civil society and the citizens who stand ready to help in \ntimes of trouble. No sector, quite frankly, offers more bang for the \nbuck and generates a better return on investment than investments in \nour Nation's most precious asset--the talents and skills and enterprise \nof our people.\n  Let's first talk about the important task of getting Americans into \nproductive work. Community and national service efforts target two \npopulations that have been hit particularly hard by the economic \ndownturn--our Nation's young people, including college graduates, and \nolder Americans. While unemployment rose for all age groups during \n2008, the increase was dramatic for America's young people. And we know \nfrom research that youth unemployment rates are a good barometer of the \noverall health of the economy, since young people typically face the \ngreatest difficulties in finding steady employment, due to their lack \nof experience. By February 2008, the overall unemployment rate had \nreached 8.1 percent. The youth unemployment rate for individuals 16 to \n19 years old was nearly triple that at 21.6 percent. In particular, \nAfrican-American youth were the most likely to be unemployed at a rate \nof more than 36 percent. Remember, during the Great Depression, we saw \nrates of unemployment for the adult population hovering around 25 \npercent.\n  High rates of youth unemployment are detrimental not only to jobless \nyouth but to our economy as a whole. An individual who experiences \nearly unemployment is more likely to have lower future earnings as well \nas repeated spells of joblessness. This is not the future we want for \nour young people. The demoralizing effects of long-term unemployment \nmay lead to risky behaviors, such as crime and drug use.\n  Unemployment rates for college graduates are increasing. In fact, the \ncollege graduate unemployment rate has broken the record for college \ngraduates, and some researchers predict the rate, which is at 4.1 \npercent, will exceed 5 percent in 2009.\n  Our economic troubles are not just affecting the young. Many older \nAmericans are quickly finding themselves out of work. In January 2009, \n5.2 percent of workers 55 and older were unemployed, an increase of 63 \npercent from last year, with 1.5 million older workers now facing \njoblessness. In October 2008, one out of every three jobless Americans \nage 55 and older had been out of work for at least 27 weeks. A decline \nin the value of retirement funds--nearly $3 trillion from America's \nretirement accounts over the past 14 months, with the average American \nlosing 34 percent on retirement holdings--has forced many older \nAmericans to return to the job market.\n  Investing in community and national service to put America--\nparticularly younger and older Americans--into productive work is a \nlow-cost solution to fight unemployment and a vital bridge to \npermanent, higher paying employment in the private sector. Since the \nbeginning of full-time and part-time national and community service in \n1993, an initiative that began with the Commission on National and \nCommunity Service under President George H.W. Bush, more than 540,000 \nAmericans have tackled the Nation's most challenging problems, not \nthrough Government, but through an extensive network of nonprofit \norganizations working at the local level. Well known nonprofits such as \nHabitat for Humanity that builds homes for low-income Americans, Teach \nfor America, which sends bright teachers to the highest need \ncommunities, and City Year, which puts young Americans into productive \nwork meeting needs in our Nation's cities.\n  Every year since 2004, thanks to President George W. Bush's \ncommitment to ramp up national and community service through his USA \nFreedom Corps after 9/11, our Government has offered 75,000 \nopportunities to adults of all ages to serve not through some \ngovernment bureaucracy, but through nonprofit organizations created by \nthe innovation of our people. These public-spirited Americans who give \na year of their lives in service to community and country are given a \nbelow-poverty monthly living stipend and receive a small award to help \ndefray the costs of college at the end of their year of service.\n  In addition to creating jobs at lower cost to Government or the \nprivate sector, national and community service programs and members \nleverage impressive resources within their communities. These 75,000 \nnational service participants leveraged 2.2 million traditional \nvolunteers who receive nothing from government to work on behalf of \nmeeting the needs of a nation. As I stated earlier, that is nearly a 1 \nto 30 ratio of national servicemembers to traditional volunteers. In \nfact, this is the power of so many nonprofit partnerships today.\n  It bothers me when I hear comments such as those recently made on the \nfloor: We are forcing Government into everybody's lives. My gosh, we \nare providing a means of support for people--without making it the \nminimum wage or without giving them welfare--by helping them become \nservants and servers to the community at a lower cost. Millions are \nserved without any pay at all because of these programs. How can \nanybody find fault with these programs?\n  Imagine placing one national servicemember in a Habitat for Humanity \nbuild. That individual, who organizes the building project, recruits, \ntrains and puts to work volunteers, dozens of them at no cost to \nGovernment, to ensure home after home rises to meet the needs of low-\nincome Americans. It is a great model. And it is not only about \nincreasing the number of volunteers. In\n\n[[Page S3646]]\n\n2007, our national service programs leveraged an impressive $231 \nmillion in financial resources to meet local needs. It is a successful \nmodel of a public-private partnership, where the private participation \nin the form of resources and volunteers together outpaces the public.\n  National service programs also have been shown to meet critical needs \nin communities. Independent evaluations have shown that teachers in \nTeach for America have made greater gains in math among their students \ncompared to other teachers; participants in Citizen Schools show higher \nschool attendance, a significant predictor of whether a student will \nstay on track to graduate from high school, and higher math and English \ngrades; and third graders working with Experience Corps members scored \nhigher in reading tests and exhibited better behavior in schools than \nchildren in control schools. African-American men in Youth Corps \nprograms were more likely to have experienced more employment and \nhigher earnings, to have voted in the last election, and scored higher \non measures of personal and social responsibility than members in a \ncontrol group. And 75 percent of former participants in the YouthBuild \nprogram, most of whom are high school dropouts, had found gainful \nemployment, were going to school, or were training for jobs. Research \nhas also shown that participants in Youth Corps programs were more \nlikely to secure better employment after completing their service and \nthat former members, particularly African-American and Hispanic males, \nhad higher wages than their peers not in the program.\n  These are the programs we are helping; programs that are doing all \nthis work for free and making a difference in the lives of children and \nfamilies. These are the programs that enlist seniors who would like to \ngive back to the community. How can the argument be made that these \nprograms should not be in effect?\n  The economic benefits of traditional volunteering are also \nsignificant. In 2007, more than 60 million Americans--or more than 26 \npercent of the adult population over 16--gave 8.1 billion hours of \nvolunteer service. The cost of that service, had it been done by paid \nworkers, would have amounted to approximately $158 billion. \nVolunteering in America rose significantly after 9/11, I believe thanks \nin no small measure to the leadership of President George W. Bush, who \nasked every American to give 2 years of service to the country over \ntheir lifetimes. Volunteering rose from 59.8 million Americans the year \nafter 9/11, which was a very high baseline, given that we knew \nvolunteering would rise in this year, to 65.4 million Americans from \n2004 to 2005. The story here is that America did respond to 9/11 and \nsustained the wave of service and patriotism for which the President \nand we in the Congress had hoped. The Mormon mission--which is often \nfor a period of 2 years in service abroad or domestically--was one of \nthe inspirations for the President's 2-year call to service. Almost \nevery young Mormon male serves, as do many adults and females. They \nlearn to care for people and give to communities. The spirit of service \nremains strong today at around 61 million volunteers within the last \nyear.\n  We clearly have room to grow the pool of volunteers and the \nServiceNation coalition, consisting of more than 125 organizations from \nthe AARP to Colin Powell's America's Promise Alliance for Youth, has \nendorsed this effort to increase our volunteer base from 61 million to \n100 million every year. According to a recent report by AARP, entitled \n``More to Give: Tapping the Talents of the Baby Boomer, Silent and \nGreatest Generations,'' a majority of older Americans are healthy and \nfree of caregiving obligations, and tens of millions of them are \nprepared to increase their volunteer service in a world they believe \nthey are leaving in worse condition than they inherited. This may be \nthe first generation to believe this and they want to make it right. \nThey have the capacity to do so. The 77 million baby boomers are the \nlongest-living, best educated, healthiest, and most highly skilled \ngeneration in our history and represent enormous potential to meet \nsignificant needs throughout our country. We should be more creative in \nenabling more of them to serve.\n  As the Nation's economy continues to sputter and organizations \ncontinue to operate on shrinking budgets, volunteers will become even \nmore essential to the Nation's work. We need to do all we can to \nharness this productive capacity in these difficult times, and \nAmericans seem very willing to shoulder more responsibilities to get \nthe country moving again.\n  The Serve America Act gives our country a hat trick--it puts \nAmericans into productive work at low cost to Government, meeting the \nneeds of the Nation, and with no new bureaucracy, since volunteers work \nthrough an established network of well-known and trusted nonprofit \norganizations created by the social enterprise of innovative people. \nThe legislation also targets the two populations most in trouble from \nthe economic downturn--our young people and older Americans. A new \nvolunteer generation fund will tap, train and help deploy more \ntraditional volunteers to meet needs identified by local communities. \nWe saw the wellspring of American compassion in the aftermath of \nHurricane Katrina. We need more of those efforts every day, not just in \ntimes of disaster.\n  The bill also creates 175,000 more opportunities for full-time and \npart-time national and community service, mobilizing our people to \ntackle problems like the high school dropout epidemic and growing \npoverty. These 175,000 members, if current leverage ratios continue, \nwould mobilize approximately 5.25 million traditional volunteers to \nhelp in these and other vital efforts. Together with the 75,000 who \nalready leverage 2.2 million Americans, we could have around 8 million \nAmericans participating every year in efforts to address specific \nchallenges in education, healthcare, poverty, energy, and the \nenvironment. In hard times, we could use their good works.\n  The Serve America Act also fosters a culture of service among younger \nand older Americans. Service-learning opportunities in our Nation's \nschools have been shown to boost student attendance and engagement, \nwhich in turn have a positive effect on keeping students on track to \ngraduate from high school. On the other end of the spectrum, the bill \nalso provides Encore Fellowships to older Americans who want to use \ntheir lifetime of skills and talents to help meet the country's needs. \nAnd national and community service programs will engage not just the \nyoung, but older Americans in their full-time and part-time efforts.\n  Times of trial have always summoned the greatness of the American \npeople. These are such times. Putting millions of Americans into \nproductive work, not through the instrument of the government, but \nthrough the innovation of nonprofit and other community serving \norganizations, is a smart way to foster a spirit of challenge in the \ncountry and tap the innovation and expertise of our people. Government \ncannot stand on the sideline; it has an important role to play in \npartnering with the private and nonprofit sectors to further enable \nthis innovation and release the energy of more Americans to give back \nin times of trouble. By putting hundreds of thousands of Americans to \nwork in full-time and part-time national and community service; \nleveraging millions of additional volunteers to help meet urgent \ncommunity needs; fostering innovation among the next generation of \nsocial entrepreneurs; and engaging nonprofit institutions in helping to \nmeet challenges in key areas, we can help strengthen our economy and do \nsomething this country has always done well since its founding--release \nthe energy of millions of Americans to do more good works in hard \ntimes.\n  Mr. President, the distinguished Senator from Colorado is in the \nChamber. I know he wishes to speak, so I will turn the time over to the \ndistinguished Senator from Colorado.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I am happy to yield to the \nSenator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at the conclusion of the remarks of the \nSenator from Colorado the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Johanns, be \nrecognized,\n\n[[Page S3647]]\n\nthen I be recognized, and then the Senator from Hawaii, Mr. Akaka, be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I presided over the last hour \nand listened to the speeches about this important Serve America Act, \nand I felt compelled to rise and express my strong support for the \nlegislation as well.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation, and I want to \nparticularly thank my colleagues--Senators Kennedy, Hatch, Mikulski, \nand Enzi--for working in a bipartisan manner to bring this important \nlegislation to the Senate floor.\n  During these challenging times, we forget that every day millions of \nvolunteers give their time and energy to help others and to make their \ncommunities more livable. Thousands of recent college graduates help \neducate young people in poor and rural schools through the Teach for \nAmerica program. Millions of men and women join together to build \naffordable homes or improve health services for those in need \nthroughout America through the AmeriCorps program. Tens of thousands of \nseniors are foster grandparents to our young people or companions to \nthose who need help with everyday tasks through the Senior Corps \nprogram.\n  These volunteers, as we have been hearing most of this afternoon, are \nthe best of what our country has to offer and the very essence of the \nAmerican spirit. By working together to pass this bill, we are doing \nhonor to their commitment to civic engagement and public service.\n  Service to community and country is something that has been an \nimportant part of my life. Prior to my career in politics, I served as \nthe executive director of the Colorado Outward Bound School. Outward \nBound provides participants with opportunities to test themselves--both \nphysically and mentally--by confronting obstacles and surviving the \nelements. At the same time, the school teaches participants to rely on \neach other for support, assistance, and to work better as a team to \nmeet all the challenges that Mother Nature can throw at you.\n  As part of the Outward Bound program, we considered it important to \npromote volunteering because we believed it helped strengthen our \ncommunities.\n  Voluntarism also enables young people to develop personal confidence \nand self-respect, to avoid the temptation to utilize violence to settle \ndifferences by instead learning skills and helping others.\n  I also had the opportunity to work in the House of Representatives \nwith my fellow House Member Tom Udall, where we introduced legislation \nto promote volunteer efforts on our public lands. The goal of our piece \nof legislation called the SERVE Act was to enhance the stewardship of \nthe natural and cultural resources for the millions of people who visit \nthem for recreation and education every year.\n  We also worked together to give the Peace Corps the resources to \nexpand their ranks. After more than 40 years, the Peace Corps remains \none of the most admired and successful initiatives ever put in place. \nThe Peace Corps offers an avenue to better understand other cultures \nand to do a better job of promoting an understanding of American values \nby citizens abroad.\n  Many Coloradans have dedicated themselves to community and national \nservice. For example, Colorado has one of the highest levels of \nrecruitment of Peace Corps volunteers nationwide, including my mother, \nwho served in the Peace Corps in Nepal from the age of 56 to 61.\n  So we have a great volunteer spirit in this country, and we can do \nmore to expand the opportunities for people who would like to give \ntheir time to help others in our communities. The bill before us today, \nthe Serve America Act, does that by building on the very strong \nfoundation built by AmeriCorps and other service programs.\n  Let me discuss a couple of the important elements of this important \npiece of legislation.\n  First, it establishes the Youth Engagement Zone to Strengthen \nCommunities program and the Campus of Service program. By engaging high \nschool students and out-of-school youth in community opportunities, we \ncan instill a spirit of service in our young people that will stay with \nthem for a lifetime.\n  Secondly, the Campus of Service program recognizes colleges and \nuniversities with outstanding service-learning programs, and provides \nresources to support students who want to pursue careers in public \nservice. So many adults who work in Government, nonprofits, and other \npublic service careers got started because of opportunities they had \nwhen they were in school. This program will expand the options \navailable to students, so more young people can find rewarding \nvolunteer experiences, and so we can increase the number of young \npeople who want to pursue careers in public service.\n  Third, the bill creates a set of focused corps: the Education Corps, \nthe Healthy Futures Corps, the Clean Energy Futures Corps, the Veterans \nCorps, and the Opportunity Corps.\n  I wish to take a minute to address one, the Clean Energy Futures \nCorps. In this program, the participants would do a variety of jobs to \nhelp make our communities more energy efficient and to preserve our \ncountry's natural beauty. These volunteers might help weatherize low-\nincome households to help residents save money or to help clean and \nimprove parks, trails, and rivers.\n  I was fortunate I was born into a family with a long tradition of \nworking to protect our country's majestic public lands so future \ngenerations could enjoy the spectacular scenery and outdoor recreation \nactivities we appreciate today. So I am pleased that Senators Kennedy, \nHatch, Mikulski, and Enzi included preserving our national treasures as \na core principle of the Clean Energy Futures Corps.\n  I am also very pleased the corps will encourage energy efficiency and \nweatherization efforts. Energy efficiency must play a key role in \nhelping us use energy in a more responsible and sustainable way. If you \nthink about it, the most affordable kilowatt of energy is the one that \nis not used. This is important, especially for families struggling to \nget by each week. Energy efficiency and weatherization efforts will \nhelp ensure these families do not have to choose between paying their \nheating bill and putting food on their table.\n  Community service enriches everyone who participates--those who are \nbeing helped and those who are offering their service. Volunteers can \nchange a neighbor's life or transform our entire country.\n  I support the mission of this bill. I commend President Obama as the \ndriving force in promoting service opportunities for Americans of all \nages.\n  Mr. President, as I conclude, I want to offer some additional remarks \nthat amplify what my good friend from Utah, Senator Hatch, said in \nresponse to our good friend from South Carolina.\n  The Senator from South Carolina came to the floor and expressed his \nconcerns about this important legislation. He suggested that civil \nsociety is everything government is not. Well, with all due respect to \nmy friend from South Carolina, I could not disagree more. I think civil \nsociety and government are not mutually exclusive. In fact, the \nFounders designed our formal democratic government systems based on \nwhat they learned in the civil society of the early days of our \ncountry.\n  Lincoln--probably our greatest President, the founder of the \nRepublican Party--if I can paraphrase him--said: What we cannot do \nalone, we do together in self-government to accomplish.\n  There is an increasing demand clearly in our society that Senator \nMikulski, Senator Kennedy, Senator Enzi, and Senator Hatch have heard \nand want to tap into. Senator Isakson was on the floor earlier talking \nabout creating an infrastructure of volunteers that this bill would so \nimportantly promote. He talked about that the corps' participants are \nonly paid stipends and small, cover-your-expenses salaries. So this is \nnot an expensive program for the benefits that are generated.\n  The Senator from Utah talked about how this is the best of the \nliberal and conservative philosophies combined. The Senator from South \nCarolina talked about the great French historian de Tocqueville who \nidentified this\n\n[[Page S3648]]\n\nwonderful spirit in America of voluntarism way back in the 1820s and \nsuggested somehow that could only be pursued through what he called the \ncivil society. Well, that spirit is unique to America, I believe, and \nit is alive and well, and it can be promoted by civil society, by \nprivate society, as well as by this private-public partnership that is \nenvisioned in this important legislation.\n  In closing, I cannot help but think of my friend, a mentor, a leader, \nthe Senator from Arizona, Mr. McCain, who, in expressing the lessons he \nhad learned in his life, talked about why he joined the military. And \nhe put it simply. He said in order to build his self-respect, he wanted \nto dedicate himself to a cause greater than his own self-interest. That \nis what this important legislation will do, and it will allow millions \nof Americans to have that opportunity, to dedicate themselves to causes \ngreater than their own self-interests.\n  I urge swift passage so we can go to work.\n  Mr. President, I thank you and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 693 To Amendment No. 687\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to send an \namendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Johanns] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 693 to amendment No. 687.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: to ensure that organizations promoting competitive and non-\ncompetitive sporting events involving individuals with disabilities may \n receive direct and indirect assistance to carry out national service \n                               programs)\n\n       On page 115, line 15, strike ``1 percent'' and insert ``2 \n     percent''.\n       On page 115, line 20, strike ``$10,000,000'' and insert \n     ``$20,000,000''.\n       On page 213, after line 21, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1613. AVAILABILITY OF ASSISTANCE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Special Olympics is a nonprofit movement with the \n     mission to provide year-round sports training and athletic \n     competition in a variety of Olympic-type sports for children \n     and adults with intellectual disabilities, giving them \n     continuing opportunities to develop physical fitness, \n     demonstrate courage, experience joy, and participate in a \n     sharing of gifts, skills, and friendship with their families, \n     other Special Olympics athletes and the community.\n       (2) With sports at the core, Special Olympics is a leader \n     in the field of intellectual disability, and is making \n     impressive strides in the areas of health, education, family \n     support, research, and policy change for people with \n     intellectual disabilities.\n       (b) Amendment.--Subtitle F of title I is further amended by \n     inserting after section 184 the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 184A. AVAILABILITY OF ASSISTANCE.\n\n       ``Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act relating \n     to eligibility, a reference in subtitle C, D, E, or H of \n     title I regarding an entity eligible to receive direct or \n     indirect assistance to carry out a national service program \n     shall include an organization promoting competitive and non-\n     competitive sporting events involving individuals with \n     disabilities (including the Special Olympics), which promote \n     the quality of life for individuals with disabilities.''.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the need to \nsupport programs which help individuals with developmental disabilities \nsuch as Special Olympics. The care and treatment of people with \ndevelopmental disabilities has always been a priority of mine. In fact, \nit is probably the major reason I am in public service today.\n  When I was Governor of Nebraska, I made it a priority to reform a \npiece of the system delivery in our State. Many of these citizens had \nmental illness and developmental disabilities. One of my major \nachievements was signing a bill into law which increased the use of \ncommunity-based services for these citizens.\n  In Nebraska today, these citizens are much more likely to receive \ncare at a specialized day treatment program or other local residential \nfacility. This legislation was a victory for those Nebraskans and their \nloved ones who suffer from mental illness, giving them a chance to more \nfully participate in everyday life and to make a contribution to their \ncommunities.\n  Our efforts to aid the most vulnerable among us, though, must be a \nnational as well as a local goal. And Government is only a part of the \nsolution. There are many impressive private organizations which assist \npeople with disabilities, but perhaps none as impressive as the Special \nOlympics.\n  Special Olympics is a nonprofit organization dedicated to helping \nthis population become physically fit and productive by participating \nin sports training and competition. For over 40 years, Special Olympics \nhas used sports to help bring people together and provide a venue for \nathletes with disabilities to compete with each other as equals.\n  But as anyone who has been involved with Special Olympics can tell \nyou, it is much more than just the competition. The camaraderie and the \nsense of accomplishment felt by these very special citizens and \nathletes gives them self-confidence in every aspect of their lives. \nThis is critically important work.\n  Special Olympics and similar organizations are vital to our \nfundamental national principles of human equality and our basic common \ndignity. It takes many volunteers to drive the success of an \norganization such as Special Olympics. In fact, when the National Games \ncome to Nebraska next year, they are going to need 8,000 volunteers to \nserve 3,000 athletes, 15,000 family and friends, and 30,000 fans who \nwill attend.\n  I am very proud our home State is taking on the challenges associated \nwith this sporting event. Special Olympics has raised $1.5 million in \nprivate local funding for the 2010 National Games, which should \nindicate the State's level of enthusiasm for the event. To encourage \nthe American volunteer spirit and help Special Olympics reach its goal \nof 8,000 volunteers for the 2010 games, I am very pleased to introduce \nan amendment which would increase the funding authorization for service \nprograms assisting people with disabilities. I can think of no more \nworthwhile endeavor.\n\n  My amendment would double the amount of funding authorized under the \nNational and Community Service Act that is set aside for such purposes \nand double the limit of such funding to $20 million. It must be the \ntask of all of us to care for those most at risk. Helping people with \ndevelopmental disabilities lead productive and fulfilling lives \nbenefits our entire Nation and should thus be a national priority. I \nhope the Senate will agree with me on this and vote to pass my \namendment.\n  Thank you, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, first of all, I say to the Senator from \nNebraska, I wish to thank him for his compassion. This side of the \naisle, and I know the other cosponsors of the Serve America Act, are \nvery much interested in working with him to accomplish the goal he so \neloquently stated in his very compassionate statement. I would ask \nrespectfully if we could--before I make a request--lay the amendment \naside, and the staff on both sides of the aisle would like to work with \nthe Senator to achieve these objectives. We want to be sure we don't \ninadvertently negatively impact either senior programs or some other \nprograms for the disabled. Would the Senator be agreeable to that?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, may I inquire as to whether the esteemed \nSenator from Maryland would be willing to guarantee a determination on \nthe amendment so we get a resolution of the issue?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Absolutely. The Senator will get a determination on his \namendment. I give him my word. Is that agreeable?\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, that is agreeable. We will work together \nand make sure we are not displacing another program and work toward a \ndetermination.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Johanns \namendment on the Special Olympics be temporarily laid aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank the Chair.\n\n[[Page S3649]]\n\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 680 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, it is my great honor and privilege to speak \nin support of the Serve America Act. I want to thank my dear friend and \ncolleague Senator Kennedy, as well as Senators Hatch, Mikulski, and \nEnzi, for their commitment and dedication to this legislation, which \ncelebrates our national legacy of service and volunteerism--a legacy \nwhich has made this country great.\n  In my home State of Hawaii, children are taught from an early age the \nimportance of nurturing and strengthening bonds between people. Each \nmember of an `Ohana--or extended family--is expected to make a \ncontribution--no matter how great or small--and to use their unique \ntalents to benefit the community. Through this legislation we can \nincrease this same sense of community responsibility throughout the \nNation.\n  In my role as chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on the \nOversight of Government Management, the Federal Workforce, and the \nDistrict of Columbia, I have advocated for programs and policies that \nencourage talented young people to join the Federal workforce. As we \nwork to increase opportunities for national and community service, it \nis worth emphasizing that Federal Government service is a valuable way \nto contribute.\n  I am pleased that this bill includes language that encourages post-\nsecondary students to pursue careers in public service through the \nCampuses of Service program. By supporting efforts to develop and \nimplement models of service-learning, the Campuses of Service programs \nwill help us build a new generation of public servants in the Federal \nworkforce. This will help us prevent a future leadership gap as more of \nour Nation's long-serving, dedicated Federal employees become \nretirement eligible.\n  As chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee, I am supportive of the \nprovision in this Serve America Act that creates a Veterans Corps. This \nprogram will help our nation's veterans--members of our Armed \nServices--and their families through the creation of community-based \nprograms designed to address their unique needs. This is a great way to \ngive back to the community: to assist the men and women who have \nbravely risked their lives in defense of our Nation, by providing \ncomfort to their families while their loved ones are deployed, or by \nhelping disabled veterans back home. I am also pleased that the \nVeterans Corps will encourage our veterans to become volunteers \nthemselves. As former members of our military, these dedicated men and \nwomen have gained experience and skills that can be used to benefit our \nNation through community service.\n  In Hawaii, we have a saying, 'a'ohe hana nui ke alu 'ia, which means \nthat no task is too big when done together by all. This bill helps \ncreate opportunities for all of us to work together now and to teach \nthe value of collaboration to younger generations. Please join me in \nvoting in favor of passage of the Serve America Act. mahalo--Thank you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in a few moments, I will ask that an \namendment be pending. First, I will speak on the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I rise today to offer an amendment that will \nstrengthen small charities around our country, especially in places \nwhere resources are scarce.\n  My amendment will create a ``Nonprofit Capacity Building Program.'' I \nam pleased to have worked with my colleague Senator Grassley to develop \nthis program. I have worked with Senator Grassley for several years on \noversight of tax-exempt organizations and efforts to strengthen the \nnonprofit sector.\n  Our amendment will connect Government funds with private-sector funds \nto provide education and training to small and midsize charities.\n  Small charities around our country serve people in need of food or \nclothing, run afterschool programs, provide housing counseling, and \nother services that are vital to our communities. But in many cases, \nthese small charities lack access to education opportunities where they \nmight learn how to manage the charity's finances, fundraise \neffectively, accurately file tax forms, adopt new computer programs or \nplan a long-term budget.\n  In nonprofit circles, folks would say these small nonprofits lack \n``capacity,'' and training in these areas is called ``capacity-\nbuilding.''\n  Our amendment will add $5 million per year over 5 years to the budget \nof the Corporation for National and Community Service to make matching \ngrants to larger organizations so they will, in turn, provide training \nto small and midsize charities throughout their State or region.\n  These kinds of training opportunities are especially rare for \ncharities located in rural areas. Folks running a charity in a rural \narea may never have the chance to attend a grant-writing training or a \nclass on nonprofit budget management.\n  That is why our amendment states that nonprofit training \nopportunities should be targeted at charities in areas with these \nresource challenges.\n  The amendment also requires the grants to be dollar-for-dollar \nmatching grants. The match must come from non-Federal sources, such as \nprivate foundations or corporate giving programs. It is important that \nboth the Federal Government and the private sector pitch in to provide \nthis support.\n  Government and private giving must coordinate better in support of \npeople and communities. The underlying bill, the Serve America Act, \nsupports the development of public-private solutions to problems facing \nour country. Some of my colleagues believe that the private sector must \nsolve every problem facing our communities. Many others believe that \nGovernment is essential to solve the same problems. I believe that we \nneed a combination of the best ideas from both. That is the spirit \nbehind this amendment.\n  I hear from folks in my home State of Montana on a weekly basis in \nsupport of this idea.\n  The National Council of Nonprofits, Independent Sector, and the \nAlliance for Children and Families have voiced their strong support for \nthis amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Baucus-Grassley \nnonprofit capacity building amendment.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 692 to Amendment No. 687\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendment be \ntemporarily set aside so I may call up my amendment No. 692.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus], for himself and Mr. \n     Grassley, proposes an amendment numbered 692 to amendment No. \n     687.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I hope Senators will support this at the \nappropriate time. Pending that moment, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I compliment the Senator from Montana on \nhis amendment. I understand his amendment is also a bipartisan \namendment; is that correct?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes, that is correct.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Both he and the Senator from Iowa, Mr. Grassley, are \ncosponsors. I believe the Senator's amendment has identified a very \nspecific need, particularly for the small, primarily rural \norganizations that sometimes are not looked at when we do a big \nnational framework. I want to be as supportive as I can of the \nSenator's amendment. I want to examine it more closely. In order to \nfollow the framework, I need to discuss it with my colleague, Senator \nHatch, and also Senator Enzi of Wyoming. As many know, Senator Enzi has \nbeen trapped in a snowstorm. He will be here tomorrow. We will have a \nchance to review this and determine our ability to work with the \nSenator from Montana and the Senator from Iowa to see whether we can \nfind some comity to adopt the amendment. I thank them for their spirit \nof bipartisanship. We will continue to follow that same framework.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I deeply thank the Senator from Maryland, who is a strong \nadvocate for Serve America, a wonderful program. I think this will make \nit a little better. It is bipartisan, as she said. This helps more \npeople. I thank the Senator.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

Mr. President, we can all be proud that we \nlive in a country where citizens volunteer to serve their Nation. We \ncan see this especially after any tragedy, be it national, be it local, \nhow our citizenry responds.\n  I am heartened to see the number of young people responding to serve. \nThere is quite a contrast I have seen in the young people today and \nwhat we have seen over the last several decades. If we go back as far \nas my generation, four decades ago, we were very interested in public \nservice. We wanted to be public servants. We wanted to contribute \nsomething to our country. It was very attractive, as a young person \ngrowing up, to want to go into government and serve the public that \nway. We were inspired by a young President, President Kennedy.\n  Then along came those events that so soured so many of our young \npeople--first of all, the split in the Nation over an unpopular war, \nVietnam. We had three major assassinations over a short period, \nincluding two brothers of one family. Then this Nation went through the \nprocess of the resignation of a President. That was about the time of a \nlot of the protests and the drug culture. It was a tough time. There \nwas a lot of cynicism bred out of that time. A lot of young people got \nturned off to public service.\n\n[[Page S3651]]\n\n  I am beginning to see it again, young people really getting \ninterested in public service. If you have that heart for service, it is \nthe exact opposite of what Time magazine chronicled on the cover of its \nmagazine back in the late 1960s, the ``me generation.'' It was \nconcerned about me, me. Now we see so much interest in helping our \ncommunities as being more the ``we generation.'' Now we see a lot more \nyoung Americans applying to the Peace Corps and its domestic \ncounterpart, AmeriCorps, and so many other national service programs.\n  Our new President has issued a call for all Americans to devote at \nleast 1 year of their lives to national service. If I had my druthers, \nI would want every young person to have an obligation to serve at least \n1 year in some capacity to their country. This would have tremendous \nbenefits down the road. They could choose the military, the Peace \nCorps, AmeriCorps, a teacher's aide--a host of these things in helping \nout our communities. Of course, we are not at a point, especially with \nthe economic condition we are in, that we can afford that as a \nmandatory obligation. So what the new President has called for is for \nall Americans to devote at least 1 year of their lives to national \nservice.\n  We come today to discuss legislation that is an acknowledgment across \nthe political divide of our President's call to engage people in \nnational service. This is going to be the first substantial investment \nin our Nation's service programs in nearly two decades. What this bill \nis going to do is triple the number of participants in our national \nservice programs from 75,000 to 250,000. These volunteers are going to \nserve as tutors and mentors. They are going to do that for children. \nThey will help build affordable housing. They will teach marketable \ncomputer skills. They will repair our parks and waterways. They will \nrun afterschool programs and help respond to disasters in communities.\n  The legislation would create several new volunteer corps with \nspecific missions in areas of national need such as education, health \ncare, clean energy, and caring for veterans. We have commended over and \nover our colleagues, Senators Kennedy and Hatch, in crafting \nlegislation that will inspire and encourage citizens of all ages, not \njust the young, and all occupations and backgrounds to engage in \nnational service.\n  Let me say where I see this example of public spiritedness. I see it \nin senior citizens, who have already had their professional lives, who \nare now enjoying the fruits of their labors, and they in turn want to \nrespond and are very much as valuable in this national service as the \nyoung people.\n  This bill should be seen as an important national achievement and a \ngood example of how we can come together and overcome the challenges \nthat lie ahead.\n  Marian Wright Edelman, the first African-American woman admitted to \nthe State bar of Mississippi, said it is a time for greatness, not for \ngreed. She said:\n\n       It's a time for idealism--not ideology. It is a time not \n     just for compassionate words, but for compassionate action.\n\n  Heeding those words, Mr. President, it is time for us to take action \nand to pass this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/24/senate-section/article/S3651-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT\n\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, the Employee Free Choice Act is vital \nlegislation for achieving fairness in the workplace for hardworking men \nand women across America, and for strengthening the Nation's middle \nclass. I have the deepest respect for my colleague from Pennsylvania, \nSenator Specter, and I welcome his recognition of the need for labor \nlaw reform. But I am also disappointed that my friend feels he cannot \nsupport the bill in its current form.\n  I remain deeply committed to moving this important bill forward. \nMillions of Americans are looking to us to make their workplaces fairer \nand safer, and their jobs more secure. They deserve better than they \nhave today, and we can't leave them behind.\n  The Senator from Pennsylvania says that we should not take up the \nEmployee Free Choice Act now because of the challenges facing our \neconomy. I disagree. It is precisely because of the economic crisis \nthat we must take new action to strengthen workers' rights.\n  Working Americans are suffering in ways we have not seen since the \nGreat Depression. Wages are falling and benefits are disappearing. \nWorkers are losing their jobs, their homes, and their hopes. Now more \nthan ever, workers deserve a voice in the hugely important decisions \nthat will affect their jobs and their families in the years ahead.\n  Unions were fundamental in building America's middle class, and have \na vital role today in preserving the American dream. History shows us \nthat strong unions mean strong economic growth that both businesses and \nemployees can share. Protecting the right to form a union today will \nhelp countless working families achieve greater economic security and \nbuild a better and brighter future. I hope very much that all of us on \nboth sides of the aisle can work together to pass the best possible \nbill to put working families back on track.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/24/senate-section/article/S3651-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Several years ago, the President, in his State of the Union \n     message, noted that our nation was ``addicted to oil''. Well, \n     that is the first step of recovery, to admit you have a \n     problem, but it is not recovery. My wife and I decided to do \n     something about it. We built a smaller home (downsized from \n     3,300 to 1,600 sq feet) right on the Greenbelt in the \n     Waterfront District of Garden City. That cut our commute down \n     from about 7 miles, one way, to 3-4 and eliminated a 300 foot \n     climb/descent. Before the move, we already owned small, fuel \n     efficient vehicles and bike commuted about 50 percent of the \n     time. Now we rarely drive and find we get places faster than \n     by car and do not have to worry about parking. Both of our \n     cars sit in the garage and we plan to sell one shortly.\n       Our monthly auto fuel bill has gone from about $60 to \n     almost nothing. Our home gas bill went from near $100/mo to \n     under $30. Electric is down to $30 from $90. Water is down to \n     $30 from over $200 in summer and it takes me about 10 minutes \n     to mow my small lawn with a push mower.\n       The Greenbelt is my highway now, and I get in about 100 \n     miles per week just peddling around town. I look forward to \n     my commutes along the river where I dodge geese and squirrels \n     instead of road warriors on the Connector. The exercise \n     improves both my mental and physical health.\n       I still interact with cars when I head cross town and am \n     amazed at the madness in the streets. It feels like drivers \n     are in such a hurry, and it appears that Idaho's current \n     public transportation policy seems to be ``one multi-tasking \n     in a hurry somewhat angry person per SUV''.\n       Remaining addicted to oil can create a host of problems \n     including:\n       Driving up the price of fuel for everyone (simple supply/\n     demand equation)\n       Adding to our rapidly deteriorating air quality in the \n     Treasure Valley\n       Creating the need for additional roads and parking (and \n     more taxes)\n\n[[Page S3652]]\n\n       Creating windfall profits for oil producing (and not always \n     friendly) nations including Saudi, Russia and Venezuela\n       Adding to global warming\n       Creating a need to ``defend'' oil resources around the \n     world\n       Now that gas prices are going up, I hear that Americans are \n     beginning to make changes. They are driving less and taking \n     advantage of alternative transportation. Let us build on that \n     momentum and not feed our addiction to oil by rushing to \n     lower prices. I just read about America's most bike friendly \n     cities including Portland, Seattle and even Chicago. Instead \n     of spending Billions to build more roads and parking lots, \n     let us bust our addiction to oil by making Idaho America's \n     most bike friendly state. And while we are at it, let us \n     create the best public transit system in the world. Let us \n     seize the future instead of clinging to the past.\n     William.\n                                  ____\n\n       The cost of fuel this year has impacted my family heavily; \n     I have actually had to change over to working from home at a \n     reduced income as fuel expenses reached a point that I was \n     spending more on fuel to get to work than I was earning.\n       I have not filled up my truck with diesel since it was at \n     $3.65 a gallon, and currently it is an average of $4.77 to \n     $4.85 a gallon. To think that this time last year I was \n     paying $2.39 a gallon for the same thing; that is an \n     astonishing increase of $2.46 a gallon in 1 year. (When I had \n     first purchased my truck in early 2007 it cost me around $65 \n     to fill it up, and now it costs closer to $140.)\n       The fuel prices have also had a severe impact on my finding \n     better paying employment as I cannot afford to get out and \n     look for work that is not within walking distance and have \n     been told by several prospective employers that they cannot \n     hire me due to fuel costs cutting their budget by up to half.\n       I have much more I would like to say, but would prefer to \n     keep this short as I know you are a busy man, I will however \n     point out a book to you for your consideration that deals \n     with this very issue, unfortunately it is out of print due to \n     threats to the author's family but I have found a website \n     with it available to read. I hope that you will read it and \n     glean the same insight out of it that I have, and be able to \n     take action that I am unable to regarding it: http://\nwww.reformation.org/energy-non-crisis.html.\n       America desperately needs to break itself of foreign oil \n     dependency and lift the blocks on domestic drilling and \n     refining.\n     Daniel.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for this opportunity to send you my thoughts and \n     opinions on a very important subject--Energy in Idaho!\n       I am in a position to offer you some unique feedback based \n     on my current employment and the issues I am addressing. I \n     realize that skyrocketing gas and diesel prices are on \n     everyone's mind, but there are other areas in the energy \n     picture that are also very challenging. I wish to address the \n     quickly rising costs of utilities in our state. Everything \n     from how buildings and homes are heated and cooled to drawing \n     the electricity we need to live our daily lives.\n       I speak with people every day from all walks of life in \n     Idaho who are concerned about future costs of heating and \n     cooling their home as well as turning on the lights or \n     running the A/C in the summertime. They are serious about \n     wanting to make a change to a more sustainable lifestyle. \n     They just need a small financial push to get them to the \n     other side.\n       My company designs, installs and services renewable energy \n     systems for homes, commercial and industrial buildings as \n     well as farms and other agriculture uses. I field phone calls \n     and e-mails from almost every walk of life (doctors, lawyers, \n     school teachers, government workers, businessmen, housewives, \n     farmers, religious etc.). There is no stereotype or \n     classification one can use to identify people interested in \n     renewable energy--it is everyone!\n       Our company has been in business almost five years, and we \n     install wind, solar and geoexchange (aka geothermal) systems \n     in Idaho. We have worked from Twin Falls to Coeur d'Alene, \n     and have spoken with many in between about their sincere \n     desire to obtain renewable energy solutions in their lives. \n     People want to look up at their solar array on their roof or \n     the wind turbine out on their property and feel a sense of \n     comfort that they are in control over a portion of their \n     energy usage per year. Others are paying $700 to $900 a month \n     to heat their modest-sized homes on propane or fuel oil. They \n     come begging for help through our geoexchange systems. Over \n     and over, the main hurdle is upfront costs. As you may know, \n     renewable energy generally requires a person to invest \n     upfront in a system such as a wind turbine, solar array or \n     geoexchange.\n       Many of the states around us (Oregon, Washington and Utah \n     that we have researched), offer substantial financial \n     assistance to citizens wishing to make the transition to \n     renewable energy. Idaho currently sticks out as a sore thumb \n     when it comes to helping its people invest and obtain \n     renewable energy systems. Both the state and the state's \n     utilities could do more to help people make this critical \n     transition to a more sustainable life style. I would ask you \n     to please support any well written pieces of legislation that \n     allow Idahoans to obtain something they really want--\n     renewable energy!!!\n       Thank you for your time and I would be more than happy to \n     expand further on our experiences and knowledge as it relates \n     to this very important topic.\n     Jeff, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       My family has set travel needs for work and some other \n     obligations that cannot be changed for obvious reasons; just \n     going for a recreational ride has long ago been cut out of \n     our budget. Now with the horrendous increases in gasoline and \n     food we are scrambling to keep our heads above water. We can \n     cope with this condition very long without serious \n     consequences.\n       If there were no options available that would be one thing, \n     but to think that our government is not allowing the oil \n     companies to go after the resources that are available in our \n     own country and place this burden on our citizens for the \n     foolishness of the global warming fraud or the slogan of \n     being green, is unconceivable in my opinion. The Congress \n     needs to stop trying to socialize the oil companies and all \n     of us for that matter, we are not stupid, and we can see what \n     they are trying to do.\n       Our government is not listening to its constituents and it \n     time for the people to find a way to remind the governing \n     body that they work for the people and not the other way \n     around. This not the way the framers of the Constitution \n     intended it to work.\n     Craig.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thanks for the email concerning the price of high gas. I \n     feel that a lot of times our Representatives could care less \n     about the lower income people in the United States and more \n     about keeping the foreign policies in place. It is really \n     appreciate that you still care.\n       I live on a small farm in Newdale. It is about fifteen \n     miles east of Rexburg and near the Teton Dam. I have to \n     travel to work every day 30 miles round trip. Because of the \n     nature of my job, there is no other job closer. I try to \n     carpool with other employees when possible and drive a car \n     that gets very good gas mileage. However, it is still hurting \n     our way of live because of the price of gas. We have changed \n     our buying habits and are very careful about the amount of \n     trips we make to town and try to do as much in each trip as \n     we can to avoid making more trips.\n       The problem we are facing is in our livestock business. We \n     raise sheep and it is a very good responsibility for my \n     children to have these chores to do daily. With the price of \n     gas and the high cost of feed, we are looking at having to \n     sell out simply because the profits are gone and we cannot \n     keep them losing money. We, as adults, can adapt to some of \n     these changes, but I am afraid with the loss of the \n     livestock, my children are going to suffer with \n     these responsibilities. What is going to happen to our \n     children if these prices keep going up and someone does \n     not make some changes? I hope the people we elect and put \n     on Capitol Hill will keep future generations of Americans \n     in mind when they make decisions. Thanks again for your \n     concern on this issue and keep up the good work.\n     John, Newdale.\n                                  ____\n\n       Although I can empathize with many Americans at the lowest \n     income levels about the rising cost of energy, we need to \n     keep in mind we still pay less than many countries around the \n     world; e.g. $10 a gallon in Europe is not uncommon. We have \n     also exacerbated the problem by our choices; (extraordinarily \n     large houses, SUVs, frequent flying, etc.) In fact, Congress \n     actually approved a tax benefit in the not-too-distant past \n     that encouraged businesses to purchase higher weight \n     vehicles; i.e. SUVs. And as long as I see teenagers racing \n     past me in their cars, I have to question if the price has \n     become high enough.\n       Drilling more oil just ``enables'' our wasteful habits. And \n     it will not put much of a dent in our total fuel consumption, \n     especially in the short term. It is time we get a grip on how \n     much energy all of us consume. And Congress needs to be \n     allocating funds towards energy research with a future (i.e. \n     Hydrogen, tidal, solar, etc.) versus energy with no future \n     that does not serve the American people; (i.e. ethanol.) I \n     have to amusingly ask myself how it was possible to get to \n     the moon in less than 10 years, yet we have not been able to \n     find a cheap, reliable energy alternative since the last \n     crisis that occurred in the 1970s? How quickly we forget once \n     we get on the other side of a crisis. The best short-term \n     solution is probably to encourage conservation until we get \n     through this ``bubble.'' We will produce more of a surplus \n     quicker than trying to drill our way out of this. But in the \n     long run, we need to have a serious commitment to alternative \n     energy and, frankly, alternative habits. Ironically, \n     increased gas taxes earmarked for alternative energy research \n     may be necessary at some point.\n       With that said, my family has made these choices:\n       We use scooters as our primary commute vehicle--75-100 mpg.\n       We live in a smaller house (despite the urgings of our real \n     estate agent that we can afford so much more).\n       We plan our errands to reduce fuel consumption.\n       We limit use of air conditioning in the summer and keep our \n     house between 65 and 70 in the winter.\n       We do not exceed speed limits on the freeway and, in fact, \n     often go somewhat slower.\n       We live close to our needs; work, shopping, entertainment, \n     etc.\n       We limit the use of plastics and recycle as much as \n     possible.\n\n[[Page S3653]]\n\n       We keep our waste to a minimum; (garbage truck idle time \n     while emptying barrels consumes fuel too!).\n       We are polite to other motorists to reduce their wait/idle \n     time.\n       We turn off lights/appliances/etc. when not in use.\n       Reduced other expenditures to allocate more to energy where \n     necessary.\n       I do not have time to continue; you get the idea. We did \n     not get into this mess in the short term; we will not get out \n     of it in the short term. Quit trying to politicize this; come \n     up with an achievable long-term plan and be honest about the \n     realities we face to the American people. But get a plan and \n     do it soon.\n     John, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       My wife and I both have most of our extended family living \n     in Utah. Usually we visit two times per year. This year we \n     will not be going at all. Not only are plane flights becoming \n     unaffordable, but the cost it would normally take to go down \n     and back 10-12 hours is becoming unaffordable. We had planned \n     on going to Seattle this summer to see the sights because we \n     have never been there, but that too has been cancelled. \n     Because gas prices are up, so are hotels, eating out and \n     everything we purchase at the store.\n       What we used to get grocery shopping for $200 now takes at \n     least $240-260. That adds up. We used to go out to eat more \n     frequently, but are doing so less and less because we have to \n     spend and have more to spend on gas to fill up. I used to let \n     my vehicles occasionally get below a half tank, but now, I \n     cannot afford to ever let them get below a half a tank before \n     filling up.\n       My brother recently filled up his diesel truck which is \n     only 3 years old. It cost him $170 to fill it up. How \n     ridiculous is that? In a nutshell, because it costs more at \n     the pump, I travel less, eat out less, spend less on \n     groceries, which if you times that with all the other just \n     50,000 other people living in my community greatly affects \n     our economy. The owner of our Ford dealership in town \n     recently confided that he has not sold a truck in almost a \n     month. He is just one dealer, but imagine all the other \n     dealers nationwide who are feeling the impact of high gas \n     prices. It is hurting every aspect of our economy.\n       What we as commonplace Americans get tired of is our \n     government leaders fighting amongst themselves so much and so \n     often that they cannot agree on a policy to help us with this \n     crisis. [Too many wealthy people don't have any idea of what \n     middle class Americans face,] so the price of a gallon of gas \n     does not really get taken into consideration because he or \n     she does not usually fill up their own cars; they are \n     chauffeured everywhere. Some of them have always been \n     chauffeured everywhere and are still ignorant of what we as \n     middleclass Americans are suffering. They live in houses and \n     drive cars 99% of us will never be able to afford. But, the \n     99% of us who struggle are getting tired of politicians not \n     legislating policy to build new refineries or freeing up some \n     of our reserves so gas prices can come down. We know \n     inflation exists, but this is insane!\n       Nine out of the ten solutions that I hear being discussed \n     recently on the news will have no impact on the price at the \n     pump I am paying for at least five to ten years. Not to burst \n     your bubble, but we commonplace Americans [want leaders who \n     will do something now, not five or ten years from now]. If a \n     gallon of oil costs 5 cents when it pumped out of the ground \n     and between the time it leaves Saudi Arabia and gets to the \n     US, it escalates to over $3 a gallon, who is ripping us off? \n     The distributors are ripping us off, and they are the ones \n     who need to be penalized immediately.\n       If you as our leaders [want] this great nation to come to a \n     grinding halt in travel, [if] you want most of the \n     restaurants, and movie theaters, and amusement parks, and \n     small businesses to keep declining in their profits, go ahead \n     and keep doing what you have been doing about escalating gas \n     prices, nothing But if you still have a heart left in you, \n     you will come up with solutions that will impact what we pay \n     at the pump--now!, not five, ten or twenty years from now \n     when gas will be so unaffordable that only the super rich \n     will be able to do anything!!\n       Please do something now!\n     Chris, Lewiston.\n                                  ____\n\n       Yes, Senator, the increase in fuel prices affects us. We \n     have not been able to take our family on a real vacation in \n     years, and we certainly will not this year with the \n     outrageous cost of gas.\n       Having said that, it is just as important to me to see the \n     Idaho Delegation do something to save our wild salmon runs. I \n     get very frustrated that these ``hot'' issues receive so much \n     attention while we throw away billions on a barge and dam \n     system that does not work. If you and the rest of the Idaho \n     delegation continue to do nothing on this issue, your legacy \n     will be the extinction of Columbia/Snake salmon, the runs \n     that once were the most abundant in the world. And Idaho \n     river towns and fishing outfitters will continue to languish \n     economically because the runs are not healthy.\n     Ted.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am taking a few minutes to respond to a request from \n     fellow Idahoans as to fuel costs. As you already know, Idaho \n     is not a greatly populated state (and that is not a bad \n     thing!).

These awards are sponsored by the \nKentucky Historical Society and recognize exceptional achievements by \nindividuals, business and civic leaders, communities, museums, and \nhistory organizations throughout the commonwealth in the field of \nhistory. Several projects and individuals that have demonstrated \ntremendous efforts to promote the preservation, awareness, and \nappreciation of state and local history were honored at this ceremony.\n  These awards serve as an opportunity to recognize the dedication and \nhard work of those who cherish Kentucky history.

Dr. Carstens received the Lifetime \nDedication To History Award for his service. During the time leading up \nto this award, Dr. Carstens received numerous teaching recognition \nawards, chaired many significant committees on Murray State \nUniversity's campus, and conducted research for the college's contract \narchaeology program.

Mr. President, sixty years ago today, Senator \nGeorge Aiken, one of the great statesmen in\n\n[[Page S3654]]\n\nthe history of Vermont and indeed our entire Nation, spoke to a group \nof rural Vermonters in the remote and sparsely populated northeastern \ncorner of our State. As he spoke about the rugged region of the Green \nMountain State he called it ``the Northeast Kingdom,'' a name which has \nlasted to this day as the way in which we in our State refer to this \nregion. Today I celebrate the anniversary of this pristine area's \nunique and poetic name and to make a few observations about its land \nand its inhabitants.\n  The Northeast Kingdom is Vermont at its most strikingly beautiful. \nBeckoning tourists are the glacial formations of Willoughby and Crystal \nLakes, the farmland and forests along the Upper Connecticut River, and \nthe northernmost reaches of the Green Mountains along the Canadian \nborder. Vermont is one of the most rural States in the Nation, and the \nNortheast Kingdom is our most rural region. While it makes up more than \none-fifth of the State's total geography, it has barely 10 percent of \nVermont's total population. In fact, my first home in Vermont was in \nthe Northeast Kingdom, in the town of Stannard, a town with a \npopulation of 200.\n  As we look for new dawn in this time of economic difficulty, I am \nreminded of this fiercely independent region of which Senator Aiken \nspoke so eloquently 60 years ago. The Northeast Kingdom is inhabited by \nworking Americans, solid and proud Vermonters: it is from their hardy \nspirit, and the spirit of people like them, that our country's strength \nhas always come. It is my hope that not only will the rugged beauty of \nthe forests and lakes of the Northeast Kingdom survive, but so will \nthat strong and independent spirit that we can turn to as a catalyst \nfor rebuilding our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/24/senate-section/article/S3654-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/24/senate-section/article/S3654-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3654]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/24/senate-section/article/S3654-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3654-S3657]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-1010.

A bill to allow certain newspapers to be treated as described \nin section 501(c)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt \nfrom tax under section 501(a) of such Code; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, Thomas Jefferson, a man who was vilified \nby newspapers daily, once said ``If I had to choose between government \nwithout newspapers, and newspapers without government, I wouldn't \nhesitate to choose the latter.'' Like Jefferson, I believe that a well-\ninformed public is a core foundation of our democracy. Watergate. AIDS. \nTobacco. ENRON. AIG. News stories, uncovered by journalists, bring the \nmost important stories of our nation's history to the front page, and \nthus into public debate.\n  I rise today to introduce the Newspaper Revitalization Act, to help \nour disappearing community and metropolitan papers by allowing them to \nbecome non-profit organizations. Newspapers across the country are \nclosing their doors, slashing their staff, and shuttering bureaus in \nthe United States and around the world. The Philadelphia Inquirer, The \nSeattle Post-Intelligencer, The Rocky Mountain News, the Philadelphia \nDaily News, the San Francisco Chronicle, and my own Baltimore Sun are \neither in bankruptcy, or facing bankruptcy and closure. The Los Angeles \nTimes has reduced its newsroom by one-half, the Miami Herald and \ntwenty-eight other dailies have laid off at least one-quarter of their \nworkforces in the past year. At the largest daily newspaper in New \nJersey, The Star-Ledger, 45 percent of the editorial staff took buyouts \nwhen the owner threatened to sell the newspaper. Increasing numbers of \nmetropolitan regions may soon have no local daily newspapers.\n  The economy has caused an immediate problem, but the business model \nfor newspapers, based on circulation and advertising revenue, has been \nweakening for years. At the end of 2008, advertising revenue was down \nby about 25 percent and according to a December forecast by Barclays \nCapital, advertising revenue will drop another 17 percent in 2009. \nCirculation is also down because of the many other sources for news. \nToday we have the internet, television, radio and blogs around the \nclock. Now, some might say these are all reasons why we may not need \ndaily print newspapers anymore. But they are wrong.\n  While Americans have quick access to the news, there remains one \nclear fact, when it comes to original in-depth reporting that records \nand exposes actions, issues, and opportunities in our communities, \nnothing has replaced a newspaper. Most, if not all sources of \njournalistic information, from Google to broadcast news or punditry, \ngain their original news from the laborious and expensive work of \nexperienced newspaper reporters diligently working their beats over the \ncourse of years, not hours. According to the Pew Research Center's \nProject for Excellence in Journalism, a typical metropolitan paper ran \n70 stories a day, counting the national, local and business sections, \nwhereas a half-hour of television news included only ten to twelve. \nResearch further shows that broadcast news follows the agenda set by \nnewspapers, often repeating the same items with less detail. Newspaper \nreporters forge relationships with people; they build a network, which \ncreates avenues to information.\n  These relationships and the information that follows are essential in \na free, democratic society. Without it, accountability is lost. In a \n2003 study published in the Journal of Law, Economics, and \nOrganization, the relationship between corruption and ``free \ncirculation of daily newspapers per person'' was examined. The study \nfound that the lower the circulation of newspapers in a country, the \nhigher it stands on the corruption index. In another study, published \nin 2006, it is suggested that the growth of a more information-oriented \npress may have been a factor in reducing government corruption in the \nUnited States between the Gilded Age and the Progressive Era. \nNewspapers provide a form of accountability. They provide a ``check'' \non local governments, State governments, the Federal Government, \nelected officials, corporations, school districts, businesses, \nindividuals and more. We need to save community newspapers.\n  The Newspaper Revitalization Act provides help. It will allow \nnewspapers to operate as non-profit organizations, if they choose, \nunder 501(c)(3) status for educational purposes, much like public \nbroadcasting. These newspapers would not be allowed to make political \nendorsements, but would be allowed to freely report on all issues, \nincluding political races. Advertising and subscription revenue would \nbe tax exempt and contributions to support coverage or operations could \nbe tax deductible.\n  While this may not be an optimal choice for some major newspapers or \ncorporate media chains interested in profit, it should be an option for \nmany local newspapers fast disappearing in our States, cities and \ntowns. This option should cause minimal revenue loss to the Federal \nGovernment as most newspaper profits have been falling for years. In \nthis economic climate, and with the real possibility of losing \ncommunity newspapers, this would be a voluntary option for owners to \nsave their paper. It is also a model that could enable local citizens \nor foundations to step in and preserve their local papers. I want to \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation and take action to save \nnewspapers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 673\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend chapter 41 of title 5, United States Code, to \nprovide\n\n[[Page S3660]]\n\nfor the establishment and authorization of funding for certain training \nprograms for supervisors of Federal employees; to the Committee on \nHomeland Security and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce the Federal \nSupervisor Training Act to enhance Federal employee and manager \nperformance.\n  Performance is essential to the success of our Federal Government. \nHowever, we cannot expect employees and managers to perform well if we \ndo not invest in them through training and professional development. In \nparticular, Federal employees deserve the support and guidance of well-\ntrained managers who empower them to perform effectively, and managers \ndeserve tools to successfully motivate and supervise employees.\n  For managers and supervisors in the Federal Government, few things \nare more important than training. Supervisor trading programs improve \ncommunication, promote stronger manager-employee relationships, reduce \nconflict, and cultivate efficiency in the federal workforce. While the \nfederal government encourages management and supervisory training, the \ndevelopment and implementation of training programs is left to the \ndiscretion of individual agencies. This leads to inconsistent guidance \non training and sometimes inadequate training due to an agency's other \npriorities and limited resources.\n  According to the 2002 report Making Public Service Work: \nRecommendations for Change, the Merit Systems Protection Board reported \nthat poor supervisors or managers are the most common reason employees \nleave a position. The U.S. Office of Personnel Management 2008 Federal \nHuman Capital Survey also shows the need for improvement: only 40 \npercent of Federal employees believed that their organization's leaders \ngenerate high levels of motivation and commitment to the workforce; \nonly 42 percent said they are satisfied with their leaders' policies \nand practices; and only 48 percent of Federal employees said they were \nsatisfied with the information they get from management.\n  Given the growing number of Federal managers who are eligible to \nretire, it is increasingly important to train new supervisors to manage \neffectively. Good leadership begins with strong management training. It \nis time to ensure that Federal managers receive appropriate training to \nsupervise Federal employees.\n  The Federal Supervisor Training Act has three major training \ncomponents. First, the bill will require that new supervisors receive \ntraining in the initial 12 months on the job, with mandatory retraining \nevery three years on how to work with employees to develop performance \nexpectations and evaluate employees. Current managers will have three \nyears to obtain their initial training. Second, the bill requires \nmentoring for new supervisors and training on how to mentor employees. \nThird, the measure requires training on the laws governing and the \nprocedures for enforcing whistleblower and anti-discrimination rights.\n  In addition, my bill will: set standards that supervisors should meet \nin order to manage employees effectively; assess a manager's ability to \nmeet these standards; and provide training to improve areas identified \nin personnel assessments.\n  I am delighted that my bill has received support from the Government \nManagers Coalition, which represents members of the Senior Executives \nAssociation, the Federal Managers Association, the Professional \nManagers Association, the Federal Aviation Administration Managers \nAssociation, and the National Council of Social Security Management \nAssociations; the American Federation of Government Employees; the \nNational Treasury Employees Union; the International Federation of \nProfessional and Technical Engineers; the AFL-CIO, Metal Trades \nDepartment; as well as the Partnership for Public Service.

A bill to reauthorize and improve the Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention Act of 1974, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am introducing today important \nlegislation designed to protect our communities and particularly our \nmost precious asset, our children. I am pleased to be joined by Senator \nSpecter and Senator Kohl, who have been leaders in this area of the law \nfor decades, and Senator Durbin, who is the new Chairman of the Crime \nand Drugs Subcommittee. Our legislation is intended to keep children \nsafe and out of trouble and also to help ensure they have the \nopportunity to become productive adult members of society.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee reported this important bill last \nJuly. I was disappointed that Republican objections prevented this \nvital bipartisan legislation from passing the Senate in the last \nCongress, but we will redouble our efforts to pass this bill this year.\n  The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act sets out Federal \npolicy and standards for the administration of juvenile justice. It \nauthorizes key Federal resources for states to improve their juvenile \njustice systems and for communities to develop programs to prevent \nyoung people from getting into trouble. We are recommitting ourselves \nto these important goals with this proposed reauthorization. We also \npush the law forward in key ways to better serve our communities and \nour children.\n  The basic goals of the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nAct remain the same: keeping our communities safe by reducing juvenile \ncrime, advancing programs and policies that keep children out of the \ncriminal justice system, and encouraging states to implement policies \ndesigned to steer those children who do enter the juvenile justice \nsystem back onto a track to become contributing members of society.\n  The reauthorization that we introduce today augments these goals in \nseveral ways. First, this bill encourages states to move away from \nkeeping young people in adult jails. The Centers for Disease Control \nand Prevention has concluded that children who are held in adult \nprisons commit more crimes, and more serious crimes, when they are \nreleased, than children with similar histories who are kept in juvenile \nfacilities. After years of pressure to send more and more young people \nto adult prisons, it is time to seriously consider the strong evidence \nthat this policy is not working.\n  We must do this with ample consideration for the fiscal constraints \non states, particularly in these lean budget times, and with deference \nto the traditional role of states in setting their own criminal justice \npolicy. We have done so here. But we also must work to ensure that \nunless strong and considered reasons dictate otherwise, the presumption \nmust be that children will be kept with other children, particularly \nbefore they have been convicted of any wrongdoing.\n  As a former prosecutor, I know well the importance of holding \ncriminals accountable for their crimes with strong sentences. But when \nwe are talking about children, we must also think about how best to \nhelp them become responsible, contributing members of society as \nadults. That keeps us all safer.\n  I am disturbed that children from minority communities continue to be \noverrepresented in the juvenile justice system. This bill encourages \nstates to take new steps to identify the reasons for this serious and \ncontinuing problem and to work together with the Federal Government and \nwith local communities to find ways to start solving it.\n  I am also concerned that too many runaway and homeless young people \nare locked up for status offenses, like truancy, without having \ncommitted any crime. In a Judiciary Committee hearing last year on the \nreauthorization of the Runaway and Homeless Youth Act, we were reminded \nof the plight of this vulnerable population, even in the wealthiest \ncountry in the world, and inspired by the ability of so many children \nin this desperate situation to rise above that adversity.\n  This reauthorization of the Juvenile Justice Act takes strong and \nsignificant steps to move away from detaining children from at-risk \npopulations for status offenses, and requires states to phase out the \npractice entirely in three years, but with a safety valve for those \nstates that are unable to move quite so quickly due to limited \nresources.\n  As I have worked with experts on this legislation, it has become \nabundantly clear that mental health and drug treatment are fundamental \nto making real progress toward keeping juvenile offenders from \nreoffending. Mental disorders are two to three times more common among \nchildren in the juvenile justice system than in the general population, \nand 80 percent of young people in the juvenile justice system have been \nfound by some studies to have a connection to substance abuse. This \nbill takes new and important steps to prioritize and fund mental health \nand drug treatment.\n  The bill tackles several other key facets of juvenile justice reform. \nIt emphasizes effective training of personnel who work with young \npeople in the juvenile justice system, both to encourage the use of \napproaches that have been proven effective and to eliminate cruel and \nunnecessary treatment of juveniles. The bill also creates incentives \nfor the use of programs that research and testing have shown work best.\n  Finally, the bill refocuses attention on prevention programs intended \nto keep children from ever entering the criminal justice system. I was \nstruck when Chief Richard Miranda of Tucson, AZ, said during our \nDecember 2007 hearing on this bill that we cannot arrest our way out of \nthe problem. I heard the same sentiment from Chief Anthony Bossi and \nothers at the Judiciary Committee's field hearing last year on young \npeople and violent crime in Rutland, Vermont. When seasoned police \nofficers from Rutland, Vermont, to Tucson, Arizona, tell us that \nprevention programs are pivotal, I pay attention.\n  Just as the last administration gutted programs that support state \nand local law enforcement, so they consistently cut and narrowed \neffective prevention programs. It would have been even worse had it not \nbeen for Senator Kohl's efforts. We must work with the\n\n[[Page S3662]]\n\nObama administration to reverse this trend and help our communities \nimplement programs proven to help kids turn their lives around.\n  I thank the many prominent Vermont representatives of law \nenforcement, the juvenile justice system, and prevention-oriented non-\nprofits who have spoken to me in support of reauthorizing this \nimportant Act, and who have helped inform my understanding of these \nissues. They include Ken Schatz of the Burlington City Attorney's \nOffice, Vermont Juvenile Justice Specialist Theresa Lay-Sleeper, and \nChief Steve McQueen of the Winooski Police Department. I know that many \nJudiciary Committee members have heard from passionate leaders on this \nissue in their own states.\n  I have long supported a strong Federal commitment to preventing youth \nviolence, with full respect for the discretion due to law enforcement \nand judges, with deference to states, and with a regard for difficult \nfiscal realities. I have worked hard on past reauthorizations of this \nlegislation, as have Senators Specter and Kohl and others on the \nJudiciary Committee. We have learned the importance of balancing strong \nlaw enforcement with effective prevention programs. This \nreauthorization pushes forward new ways to help children move out of \nthe criminal justice system, return to school, and become responsible, \nhard-working members of our communities. I hope all Senators will join \nus in supporting this important legislation.\n   Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the bill text be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Recordm as follows:\n\n                                 S. 678\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING AMENDMENT.\n\n       The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 \n     is amended by striking title V, as added by the Juvenile \n     Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act of 1974 (Public Law \n     93-415; 88 Stat. 1133) (relating to miscellaneous and \n     conforming amendments).\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I rise today with Senator Leahy and Senator \nSpecter to introduce the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nReauthorization Act. The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention \nAct, JJDPA, has played a key role in successful state and local efforts \nto reduce juvenile crime and get kids back on track after they have had \nrun-ins with the law. This legislation will reauthorize and make \nsignificant improvements to these important programs.\n  A successful strategy to combat juvenile crime consists of a large \ndose of prevention and intervention programs. Juvenile justice programs \nhave proven time and time again that they help prevent crime, \nstrengthen communities, and rehabilitate juvenile offenders. The JJDPA \nhas always had a dual focus: prevention and rehabilitation.\n  The JJDPA has successfully focused on intervening in a positive \nmanner to work with those teens that have fallen through the cracks and \nhave had a few scrapes with the law. Many of the juveniles who come \ninto contact with the justice system are not violent offenders or gang \nmembers. Rather, they are young people who have made mistakes and \ndeserve a second chance to succeed and lead healthy lives. In fact, \nseventy percent of youth in detention are held for nonviolent charges. \nResearch has shown that youth who come into contact with the justice \nsystem can be rehabilitated, and we have an obligation to support \nsuccessful programs that do just that.\n  While putting young people on the right path after they have had run-\nins with the law is tremendously important, we would all prefer to keep \nthem from getting into trouble in the first place. Title V, of course, \nis the only federal program that is dedicated exclusively to juvenile \ncrime prevention. Evidence-based prevention programs are proven to \nreduce crime. Because each child prevented from engaging in repeat \ncriminal offenses can save the community $1.7 to $3.4 million, reducing \ncrime actually saves money. Research has shown that every dollar spent \non effective, evidence based programs can yield up to $13 in cost \nsavings.\n  Since the last reauthorization in 2002, research and experience have \nrevealed that there is still room for improvement. That is why we are \nproposing a number of changes to the Act.\n  Under Title II, the existing JJDPA requires states to comply with \ncertain core requirements that are designed to protect and assist in \nthe rehabilitation of juvenile offenders. This legislation makes \nimprovements to four of the core requirements--removal of juveniles \nfrom adult jails, preventing contact between juvenile offenders and \nadult inmates, the deinstitutionalization of status offenders, and \ndisproportionate minority contact, DMC.\n  The legislation would amend the jail removal and sight and sound \nrequirements to ensure that juveniles charged as adults are not placed \nin an adult facility or allowed to have contact with adult inmates \nunless a court finds that it is in the interest of justice to do so. \nResearch has shown that juveniles who spend time in adult jails are \nmore likely to reoffend. Therefore, it is critical that we get judges \nmore involved in this process to ensure that it is in everyone's best \ninterest, but particularly the juvenile's best interest, to place that \nyoung person in an adult facility.\n\n  This measure would also place important limitations on the valid \ncourt order exception to the deinstitutionalization of status \noffenders. Under the current JJDPA, courts can order status offenders \nto be placed in secure detention with minimal process and no limit on \nduration. We seek to change both of these. This bill would place a 7 \nday limit on the amount of time a status offender can spend in a secure \nfacility, and ensure that juvenile status offenders have significant \nprocedural protections.\n  In addition, the legislation will push states to take concrete steps \nto identify the causes of disproportionate minority contact and take \nmeaningful steps to achieve concrete reductions.\n  The bill also focuses a great deal of attention on improving \ncooperation between the states and the Federal Government in the area \nof juvenile justice. It directs the Administrator of the Office of \nJuvenile Justice to conduct additional research. It seeks to strengthen \nthe amount of training and technical assistance provided by the Federal \nGovernment, particularly workforce training for those people who work \ndirectly with juveniles at every stage of the juvenile justice system.\n  The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Reauthorization Act \nwould improve treatment of juveniles in two important respects. It \nseeks to end the use of improper isolation and dangerous practices, and \nit encourages the use of best practices and alternatives to detention.\n  This measure also places a greater focus on mental health and \nsubstance abuse treatment for juveniles who come into contact, or are \nat risk of coming into contact, with the juvenile justice system. \nResearch has shown that the prevalence of mental disorders among youth \nin juvenile justice systems is two to three times higher than among \nyouth who have not had run-ins with the law. Taking meaningful steps to \nprovide adequate mental health screening and treatment for these \njuveniles is a critical part of getting them on the right track, and \nneeds to be a part of federal, state and local efforts to rehabilitate \njuvenile offenders.\n  Finally, and possibly most importantly, the key to success is \nadequate support. Funding for juvenile justice programs has been on a \ndownward spiral for the last 8 years. Just 6 years ago, these programs \nreceived approximately $556 million, with more than $94 million for the \nTitle V Local Delinquency Prevention Program and nearly $250 million \nfor the Juvenile Accountability Block Grant program. Last year, the \nBush administration requested just $250 million for all juvenile \njustice programs, which represents more than a 50 percent cut from \nfiscal year 2002. Local communities do a great job of leveraging this \nfunding to accomplish great things, but we cannot say with a straight \nface that this level is sufficient. We look forward to working with \nPresident Obama to ensure that these vital programs once again receive \nthe adequate funding they deserve.\n\n[[Page S3670]]\n\n  Therefore, we are seeking to authorize increased funding for the \nJuvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act. The bill will \nauthorize more than $272 million for Title V and nearly $200 million \nfor Title II in fiscal year 2009. Then, funding for each title will \nincrease by $50 million each subsequent fiscal year. These programs are \nin desperate need of adequate funding. It is money well spent, and this \nincrease in authorized funding will demonstrate Congressional support \nfor these critical programs.\n\n  In addition to increased funding for traditional JJDPA programs, we \nhave created a new incentive grant program under the Act. This program \nauthorizes another $60 million per year to help local communities to \nsupplement efforts under the Act, and in some cases go above and beyond \nwhat is required of them. Specifically, this funding will support \nevidence based and promising prevention and intervention programs. It \nwill enhance workforce training, which will improve the treatment and \nrehabilitation of juveniles who come into contact with the system. \nLastly, a significant portion of this funding will be dedicated to \nmental health screening and treatment of juveniles who have come into \ncontact, or are at risk of coming into contact, with the justice \nsystem.\n  The Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act is an incredibly \nsuccessful program. The fact that it is cost efficient is important. \nBut the most important thing is that it is effective. It is effective \nin reaching the kids it is designed to help. The evidence based \nprevention programs it funds are able to touch the lives of at-risk \nyouth and steer them away from a life of crime. For those who have \nunfortunately already had run-ins with law enforcement, its \nintervention and treatment programs have successfully helped countless \nkids get their lives back on the right track and become productive \nmembers of society.\n  It is beyond dispute that these proven programs improve and \nstrengthen young people, as well as their families and their \ncommunities. For that reason, we urge our colleagues to support this \nimportant measure to reauthorize and improve these programs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mr. Kohl):\n  S. 679. A bill to establish a research, development, demonstration, \nand commercial application program to promote research of appropriate \ntechnologies for heavy duty plug-in hybrid vehicles, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I am introducing the Heavy Duty \nHybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act, along with \nmy colleagues from California and Wisconsin, Senator Feinstein and \nSenator Kohl. This bill will accelerate research of plug-in hybrid \ntechnologies for heavy duty trucks.\n  The Federal Government, through the 21st Century Truck Partnership, \nhas for some years provided funding to conduct research and development \nfor the modernization of this industry, in association with a \ncollection of private industry partners. Despite the significant \npotential benefits of hybrid trucks, however, research in this area was \neliminated recently to emphasize a focus on passenger vehicles. This \ndecision was shortsighted.\n  In 2008, truck operators in Maine and around the country were hard \nhit by increases in the price of diesel fuel. While fortunately there \nhas been some relief in 2009, it is likely that as our Nation recovers \nfrom the current economic downturn, the demand for and prices of diesel \nfuel will increase again in the future. Given that our Nation relies \nupon the trucking industry to keep our economy running by providing \ntimely delivery of food, industrial products, and raw materials, we \nmust develop alternatives that make the industry less susceptible to \ndramatic changes in oil prices. Hybrid power technologies offer \ntremendous promise of reducing this critical industry's dependence on \noil.\n  Trucks consume large amounts of our imported fuels. Successfully \ntransitioning trucks to hybrid power technology will reduce our \nNation's oil consumption and improve our energy security. The Heavy \nDuty Hybrid Vehicle Research, Development, and Demonstration Act \ndirects the Department of Energy to expand its research in advanced \nenergy storage technologies to include hybrid trucks as well as \npassenger vehicles. Current hybrid technology works well for cars that \ncan be made with lightweight materials and travel short distances. \nTrucks need to be constructed with heavy materials commensurate with \nthe heavy loads they carry and, if they are going to be plug-in \nhybrids, travel relatively long distances between charges. Thus \nadvances in battery and other technologies are needed to make plug-in \ntrucks commercially viable and may require more advanced technology \nthan is required for passenger cars.\n  Grant recipients will be required to complete two phases. In phase \none, recipients must build one plug-in hybrid truck, collect data, and \nmake performance comparisons with traditional trucks. Recipients who \nshow promise in phase one will be invited to enter into phase two where \nthey must produce 50 plug-in hybrid trucks and report on the \ntechnological and market obstacles to widespread production. The bill \nwill also sponsor two smaller programs to deal with drive-train issues \nand the impact of the wide use of plug-in hybrid technology on the \nelectrical grid. In total, the bill authorizes the expenditure of \n$16,000,000 for each of fiscal years 2010, 2011, and 2012.\n  We need a comprehensive approach to modernize commercial \ntransportation in the 21st century. The Heavy Duty Hybrid Vehicle \nResearch, Development, and Demonstration Act is one vital piece of that \napproach. I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 679\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to limit Federal emergency economic assistance \npayments to certain recipients; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, last week Congress was consumed in \nexpressing its justified outrage over the bonuses for AIG executives. \nThe House passed a bill that would tax those bonuses at 90 percent to \nget the money back. The Senate may consider something similar this \nweek, and I think it is the Senate's job to proceed carefully as we do \nso. Though I think all of us would support taking back the payments, we \nneed to give due consideration to the means by which we do this. The \nconstitutionality of the House version is certainly questionable at \nbest.\n  Now, the reason many are seeking expedited consideration of the AIG \nbonus bill is clear enough--to cover up the past mistakes of the \nmajority party and the Treasury Secretary. We should recall the process \nthat created the stimulus bill: No time to review the final bill before \npassage, a photo op masquerading as a conference committee, hasty \nconsideration, no bipartisan input, and huge decisions about billions \nand billions of dollars being made behind closed doors by the majority. \nIt was this process that allowed the provision to give out the AIG \nbonuses to find its way into law. There was a provision very deep in \nthe Democratic stimulus bill that allowed these bonuses to be paid, and \nit was inserted at the behest of Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner.\n  This gets us to the root of the problem: The bailout approach that \nSecretary Geithner epitomizes. The American people object to the \nmidnight rescue packages, the ad hoc approach, the ``say one thing, do \nanother'' programs. There is a complete lack of any policy framework, \nexplanation of principles or coherent approach in dealing with our \nfinancial situation. I believe there is a lack of any transparency \nwhatsoever and a seeming indifference to the taxpayers' interests.\n  Now, the $700 billion bailout bill last October was congressional \nratification of Tim Geithner's approach to big banks: to bail them out. \nI objected to that at that time and I was in shock that 75 Members of \nthe Senate voted to give an unelected bureaucrat, without any \nconstraints, $700 billion to do with as he wished. Now, that was bad \nenough. It all started with Bear Stearns a year ago. The initiator of \nthe Bear Stearns deal was not Secretary Paulson, it was not Chairman \nBernanke, it was the--they signed off on it, but it was Timothy \nGeithner. After the deal was announced, Robert Novak reported in his \ncolumn that an unnamed Federal official confided in him at the time: \n``We may have crossed\n\n[[Page S3672]]\n\na line'' in bailing out Bear Stearns. Mr. Novak wrote that was an \nunderstatement and that we wouldn't know the ramifications of this \ndecision for a long time.\n  Well, I think we better understand those ramifications today. We are \nnow trillions of dollars past that line and we are beginning to \ncomprehend the course on which that decision has set us. I, personally, \nbelieve that trillions of dollars past that line, we are no better off. \nThat is enough. Tim Geithner's bailout approach has taken us too far. \nInstead of Congress using the AIG bonus issue to cover up Tim \nGeithner's mistakes in allowing those bonuses, we should take it as an \nopportunity to fundamentally reevaluate the bailouts thus far and put \nan end to any more bailouts. Now, with the revelations of how AIG is \nbeing used to funnel money to foreign banks to make them whole on bad \ninvestments at the expense of the U.S. taxpayers, we need to put an end \nto the Geithner approach on bailouts. The taxpayers deserve no less.\n  The debate over the AIG bonuses, though extremely important, only \nscratches the surface of some much deeper issues. First, the furor over \nAIG bonuses obscured some other, perhaps more important, news about the \nAIG bailout regarding counterparties--or creditors--counterparties, to \nsome of AIG's more exotic transactions. Second, the AIG bonus issue \nreveals a significant problem with Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner's \nbailout approach to failing financial institutions.\n  Under Tim Geithner, the $150 billion in taxpayer money AIG has \nreceived is being used to funnel money to AIG's counterparties, mostly \nbig investment banks and foreign banks. Taxpayers are right to be angry \nabout the bonuses, but they should be even angrier about how their \ntaxpayer dollars used to bail out AIG are being distributed by them. \nUnder the contracts AIG entered into with other big banks and foreign \nbanks, AIG needs to come up with billions and billions of dollars when \ntheir investments are downgraded. Now, that is where all the AIG \nbailout money is going. AIG is basically being used as a front to \nfunnel taxpayer moneys into large foreign banks that are taking no \nloss--no loss--on their investments. It is the taxpayer who is bearing \nthe loss that these banks should have been able to take. Treasury \nSecretary Geithner needs to explain to the American people why foreign \nbanks are getting 100 percent on their investment while the American \npeople are taking the loss. Why can't any of these banks take a haircut \non their AIG investments?\n  Now, I guess it is hard to explain to people because it doesn't sound \nbelievable, but what is happening is we have foreign banks--and I will \nname a few of them in a second--that have put their money into an \ninvestment into AIG. They planned to make a profit. If they had made a \nprofit, I dare say they wouldn't have come back to say to our United \nStates of America: We will write you a check for the profit we made. \nInstead of that, they wait until they take a loss, and then the \nAmerican taxpayers have to come in.\n  I think the American people are getting completely fleeced on their \n$150 billion AIG investment. Secretary Geithner needs to explain to us \nwhy relatively healthy firms such as Goldman Sachs aren't taking any \nloss on a clearly bad investment in AIG. Why are all these foreign \nbanks getting 100 percent of their investment at the expense of the \nU.S. taxpayer?\n  Here is a sample of the banks that are getting made whole by U.S. \ntaxpayers--that is our taxpayers--people who elect us to office: The \nBank of Montreal, Canada, $1.1 billion; the Societe Generale, France, \n$11.9 billion; investments made by a French bank. This is a French bank \nthat bought an interest in AIG, they lost their money, they come back \nto us, and we pay them back for their loss. The BNP Paribas, $4.9 \nbillion; the Deutsche Bank in Germany, $11.8 billion; the ING, \nNetherlands, $1.5 billion; Barclays, of the UK, $8.5 billion. This is \njust a sampling of the over $50 billion that foreign banks have gotten \nfrom AIG. In other words, $50 billion in taxpayers' money has gone to \nforeign banks. I don't think many people have caught on to that yet. \nThe taxpayers are picking up the tab. Meanwhile, some U.S. banks are \ngetting the same treatment. Goldman Sachs has received $12.9 billion. \nThese are all investments in AIG. Merrill Lynch, $6.8 billion; Bank of \nAmerica, $5.2 billion; Citigroup, $2.3 billion. All told, the U.S. \nbanks have gotten around $45 billion through AIG from the U.S. \ntaxpayer. What is interesting, as bad as it is that U.S. banks are \ngetting back $45 billion for bad investments, the foreign banks are \nactually getting back more than the U.S. banks are. Not one of these \nbanks I have mentioned has taken a dime of loss in their AIG \ninvestments--not one. AIG's counterparties have been made whole across \nthe board by the U.S. taxpayer. Why is that? Why can't any of these \nbanks take any of the loss on their AIG investment? Why is the taxpayer \nbeing asked to bear the full cost of all these bad investments? The \nAmerican taxpayers have a right to know and Secretary Geithner needs to \nexplain this.\n  I say this because I know people are outraged in my State of Oklahoma \nabout the fact that there have been bonuses that have been made, but \nthis is even far worse than that was. The American people are getting \ncompletely fleeced on their $150 billion AIG investment, $700 billion \nbailout of Wall Street, and billions in ad hoc bailouts, of which we \nhave still not seen the end. Only this week, Secretary Geithner has \nannounced that the Government will work with private investors to \npurchase between $500 billion and $1 trillion of toxic assets.\n  Now, at this point I would say, remember back when we were being sold \na bill of goods, I voted against it, but 75 percent of the Senate voted \nfor it--$700 billion to be given to an unelected bureaucrat to do with \nas they wished. We all remember that. What was that supposed to be used \nfor? The bad part of the bill was not just the amount of money; there \nwere no guidelines, no accountability. That was supposed to be used to \nbuy toxic assets. I could quote right now things they said at that \ntime: This money has to be spent for toxic assets, and if you don't do \nthat, the whole country is going to go down and we are going to have \nanother depression again. So the President's budget includes a \nplaceholder for billions in additional banking bailouts. The American \npeople have said enough a long time ago. We have to put an end to the \nGeithner approach on bailouts.\n  Looking back since last fall, more and more I feel I may have been \noverly critical of Secretary Paulson, at least when compared to \nSecretary Geithner. Geithner's handling of the $700 billion Wall Street \nbailout has been worse than Paulson's. Whether it is Paulson or \nGeithner, handing $700 billion over to an unelected bureaucrat to do \nwith what he pleases is bad enough when three-fourths of the Senate \nvoted to do it last October, and it is an even worse idea with Tim \nGeithner at the helm. What has happened with the taxpayers' investment \nin AIG is clear evidence of that. No matter how you look at it, it has \nbeen a bad deal for the U.S. taxpayers.\n  Now, in light of all of this, I have introduced legislation to do \nmore than deal with the bonuses. This is S. 680, just introduced. S. \n680 gets to the root of this problem. Of the $150 billion we have \nalready given to AIG, it is my understanding that there is $30 billion \nmore for AIG from TARP that has been agreed to by the Treasury \nSecretary but has not yet been drawn down. My legislation would prevent \nthat from going forward. The taxpayers have given AIG about $150 \nbillion so far. I think it is completely reasonable to say that once a \nsingle company gets $150 billion from the taxpayers, it should be cut \noff from getting more. There has to be a point beyond which Government \ncannot go, and there has to be an end to the road that is fleecing \nAmerican taxpayers. This provides that end.\n  There is no other vehicle out there to do it. I can tell my \ncolleagues right now, if this isn't brought up and voted on, the \ntaxpayers of America are going to put another $30 billion into AIG to \nbe used to pay off foreign banks. This is the only way we can stop it \nis with this legislation, so I encourage the leadership to help us \nbring this up for a vote. I can assure my colleagues it would pass with \nan overwhelming majority. That is S. 680, the only vehicle out there \nthat would keep AIG from using taxpayer money to pay off other foreign \nbanks.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Ms. Collins, Mr. Whitehouse, Mr.\n\n[[Page S3673]]\n\n        Levin, Mr. Schumer, and Ms. Stabenow):\n  S. 682. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to improve \nmental and behavioral health services on college campuses; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Colleges and universities take many steps to support \ntheir students and ensure that they succeed. Financial aid offices find \nways for students to afford tuition and textbooks, housing offices \nprovide safe places for students to live, and tutoring centers provide \nacademic supports for students who are struggling to keep up in class. \nBut there is another critical service that many students require to \nsucceed, and it is much less frequently discussed. I am talking about \nmental health services and outreach provided by college counseling \ncenters.\n  For a long time, we have overlooked the mental health needs of \nstudents on college campuses. We know now that many mental illnesses \nstart to manifest in this period when young people leave the security \nof home and regular medical care. The responsibility for the students' \nwell-being often shifts from parents to students, and the students \naren't always completely prepared. It is easier for a young person's \nproblems to go unnoticed when he or she is away at college than when \nthey are at home, in the company of parents, old friends, and high \nschool teachers. College also provides a new opportunity for young \npeople to experiment with drugs or alcohol.\n  The consequences of not detecting or addressing mental health needs \namong students are real. Forty-five percent of college students report \nhaving felt so depressed that it was difficult to function. Ten percent \nhave contemplated suicide. We have even seen tragedies on the scale of \nshootings at Northern Illinois University in February 2008 and at \nVirginia Tech in April 2007. These heartbreaking and traumatic \nincidents demonstrated the tragic consequences of mental instability \nand helped us recognize we need to do more to support students during \nwhat can be very tough years.\n  Fortunately, many students can succeed in college if they have \nappropriate counseling services and access to needed medications. These \nservices make a real impact. Students who seek help are 6 times less \nlikely to kill themselves. Colleges are welcoming students today who 10 \nor 20 years ago would not have been able to attend school due to mental \nillness, but who can today because of advances in treatment.\n  But while the needs for mental health services on campus are rising, \ncolleges are facing financial pressures and having trouble meeting this \ndemand. As I have travelled around my State, I have learned just how \nthin colleges and universities are stretched when it comes to \nproviding. counseling and other support services to students.\n  Take Southern Illinois University in Carbondale. SIUC has 8 full-time \ncounselors for 21,000 students. That is one counselor for every 2,500 \nstudents. The recommended ratio is one counselor for every 1,500 \nstudents. And there is another problem. Like many rural communities, \nCarbondale only has one community mental health agency. That agency is \noverwhelmed by the mental health needs of the community and refuses to \nserve students from SIUC. The campus counseling center is the only \nmental health option for students. The eight hard-working counselors at \nSIUC do their best under impossible conditions. They triage students \nwho come in seeking help so that the ones who might be a threat to \nthemselves or others are seen first. The waitlist of students seeking \nservices has reached 45 students.\n  The story is the same across the country. Colleges are trying to fill \nin the gaps, but because of the shortage of counselors, students' needs \nare overlooked. A recent survey of college counseling centers indicates \nthat the average ratio of professional-staff-to-students is 1 to 1,952, \nand at 4-year public universities it is 1 to 2,607 students. Although \ninterest in mental-health services is high, the recession has put \npressure on administrators to cut budgets wherever they can. At times, \ncounseling centers are in the cross hairs. Ten percent of survey \nrespondents said their budgets were cut during the 2007-8 academic \nyear, half said their budgets stayed the same, and nearly a quarter \nreported that their funds increased by 3 percent or less.\n  With so many students looking for help and so few counselors to see \nthem, counseling centers have to cut back on outreach. Without \noutreach, the chances of finding students who need help but do not ask \nfor it go down. This is a serious problem. We know that some students \nexhibit warning signs of a tortured mental state. But faculty and \nstudents do not always know how or where to express their concerns. \nOutreach efforts by campus counseling centers can help educate the \ncommunity about warning signs to look for as well as how to intervene. \nOf the students who committed suicide across the country in 2007, only \n22 percent had received counseling on campus. That means that of the \n1,000 college students who took their own lives, 800 may never have \nlooked for help. How many of those young lives could have been saved if \nour college counseling centers had the resources they needed to \nidentify those students and help them? Our students deserve better.\n  We need to help schools meet the needs of their students, and that's \nwhy I'm introducing the Mental Health on Campus Improvement Act today. \nThis bill would create a grant program to provide funding for colleges \nand universities to improve their mental health services. Colleges \ncould use the funding to hire personnel, increase outreach, and educate \nthe campus community about mental health. The bill also would direct \nthe Department of Health and Human Services to develop a public, \nnation-wide campaign to educate campus communities about mental health.\n  Reflecting on the loss of his own son, the well-known minister Rev. \nWilliam Sloan Coffin once said, ``When parents die, they take with them \na portion of the past. But when children die, they take away the future \nas well.'' I hope the bill I am introducing today will help prevent the \nunnecessary loss of more young lives and bright futures.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 682\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Mental Health on Campus \n     Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) The 2007 National Survey of Counseling Center Directors \n     found that the average ratio of counselors to students on \n     campus is nearly 1 to 2,000 and is often far higher on large \n     campuses. The International Association of Counseling \n     Services accreditation standards recommend 1 counselor per \n     1,000 to 1,500 students.\n       (2) College counselors report that 8.5 percent of enrolled \n     students sought counseling in the past year, totaling an \n     estimated 1,600,000 students.\n       (3) Over 90 percent of counseling directors believe there \n     is an increase in the number of students coming to campus \n     with severe psychological problems. The majority of \n     counseling directors report concerns that the demand for \n     services is growing without an increase in resources.\n       (4) A 2008 American College Health Association survey \n     revealed that 43 percent of students at colleges and \n     universities report having felt so depressed it was difficult \n     to function, and one out of every 11 students seriously \n     considered suicide within the past year.\n       (5) Research conducted between 1989 and 2002 found that \n     students seen for anxiety disorders doubled, for depression \n     tripled, and for serious suicidal intention tripled.\n       (6) Many students who need help never receive it. \n     Counseling directors report that, of the students who \n     committed suicide on their campuses, only 22 percent were \n     current or former counseling center clients. Directors did \n     not know the previous psychiatric history of 60 percent of \n     those students.\n       (7) A survey conducted by the University of Idaho Student \n     Counseling Center in 2000 found that 77 percent of students \n     who responded reported that they were more likely to stay in \n     school because of counseling and that their school \n     performance would have declined without counseling.\n       (8) A 6-year longitudinal study of college students found \n     that personal and emotional adjustment was an important \n     factor in retention and predicted attrition as well as, or \n     better than, academic adjustment (Gerdes & Mallinckrodt, \n     1994).\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend title XIX of the Social Security Act to \nprovide individuals with disabilities and older Americans with equal \naccess to community-based attendant services and supports, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I am joining with Senator Specter \nand others to introduce the Community Choice Act. This legislation is \nneeded to truly bring people with disabilities into the mainstream of \nsociety and provide equal opportunity for employment and full \ninvolvement in community activities.\n  The individuals affected by the Community Choice Act are those \npersons who require an institutional level of care to manage their \ndisabilities. The question is whether they will receive these services \nonly in an institutional setting--typically, a nursing home--or whether \nthey will also have the choice to receive these services in their \ncommunities, where they can be part of community life and close to \nfamily and friends.\n  Under the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 1999, \nindividuals with disabilities have the right to choose to receive their \nlong-term services and supports in the community, rather than in an \ninstitutional setting. This year marks the 10-year anniversary of the \nOlmstead decision.\n  Unfortunately, under current Medicaid policy, and despite much effort \nto ``rebalance'' the system, the deck is still stacked in favor of \nliving in an institutional setting. The reason for this is simple. \nDespite the Olmstead decision, Federal law only requires that States \ncover nursing home care in their Medicaid programs. There is no similar \nrequirement for providing individuals the choice of receiving their \nservices and supports in a community-based setting.\n  Overall about 60 percent of Medicaid long-term care dollars are still \nspent on institutional services, with about 40 percent going to home \nand community-based services. In 2007, only 11 States spent 50 percent \nor more of their Medicaid long-term care funds on home and community-\nbased care.\n  The statistics are even more disproportionate for adults with \nphysical disabilities. In 2007, 69 percent of Medicaid long-term care \nspending for older people and adults with physical disabilities paid \nfor institutional services. Only 6 States spent 50 percent or more of \ntheir Medicaid long-term care dollars on home and community-based \nservices for older people and adults with physical disabilities, while \nhalf of the States spent less than 25 percent. This disparity continues \neven though, on average, it is estimated that Medicaid dollars can \nsupport nearly three older people and adults with physical disabilities \nin home and community-based services for every person in a nursing \nhome.\n  Although 30 States have already recognized the benefits of community-\nbased services, and are providing the personal care optional benefit \nthrough their Medicaid program, these programs are unevenly distributed \nand only reach a small percentage of eligible individuals. Many of \nthese programs serve only persons with certain disabilities. They have \nlong waiting lists. They have financial caps. None of them allow the \nrecipients to retain their benefits if they move to other States. \nIndividuals with the most significant disabilities are usually afforded \nthe least amount of choice, despite advances in medical and assistive \ntechnologies and related areas.\n\n  This current imbalance means that individuals with disabilities do \nnot have equal access to community-based care throughout this country. \nAn individual with a disability should not have to move to another \nState in order to avoid needless segregation. Nor should that \nindividual have to move away from family and friends because the only \nchoice is an institution.\n  The right to live in the community is too important a right to be \nleft to State discretion. Instead, it should be left to the individual \nto decide, as the Supreme Court has recognized.\n  The majority of individuals who use Medicaid long-term services and \nsupports prefer to live in the community, rather than in institutional \nsettings.\n  I think of my nephew Kelly, who became a paraplegic after an accident \nwhile serving in the U.S. Navy. The Veterans Administration pays for \nhis attendant services. This allows Kelly to get up in the morning, go \nto work, operate his own small business, pay taxes, and be a fully \ncontributing member of our economy and society. This country is rich \nenough to provide these same opportunities to every American who needs \nattendant services.\n  We in Congress have a responsibility to help States meet their \nobligations under Olmstead, to level the playing field, and to give \neligible individuals equal access to the community-based services and \nsupports they need.\n  The Community Choice Act is designed to do just that, and to make the \npromise of the Americans with Disabilities Act a reality. It will help \nrebalance the current Medicaid long-term care system, which spends a \ndisproportionate amount on institutional services.\n  Federal Medicaid policy should reflect the goals of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act that Americans with disabilities should have \nequal opportunity, and the right to fully participate in their \ncommunities. No one should have to sacrifice their ability to \nparticipate because they need help getting out of the house in the \nmorning or assistance with personal care or some other basic service.\n  The Community Choice Act can substantially reform long-term services \nin this country, consistent with the Olmstead decision, by allowing \npeople with disabilities who need an institutional level of care the \nchoice of receiving their services and supports in their\n\n[[Page S3676]]\n\nown communities, rather than in an institution. With appropriate \ncommunity-based services and supports, we can transform the lives of \npeople with disabilities. They can live with family and friends, not \nstrangers. They can be the neighbor down the street, not the person \nwarehoused down the hall. This is not asking too much. This is the bare \nminimum that we should demand for every human being.\n  Community-based services and supports allow people with disabilities \nto lead independent lives, have jobs, and participate in their \ncommunities. Some will become taxpayers, some will get an education, \nand some will participate in recreational and civic activities. But all \nwill be given a chance to make their own choices and to govern their \nown lives.\n  The Community Choice Act will open the door to full participation by \npeople with disabilities in our workplaces and economy. It will give \nthem better access to the American Dream.\n  As has been true with all major disability-rights legislation going \nback to the ADA, this is a strictly bipartisan bill. I urge all my \ncolleagues to come together on this important measure. I especially \nwant to thank Senator Specter for his leadership on this issue and his \ncommitment to improving access to home and community-based services for \npeople with disabilities. I also thank Senators Kennedy, Durbin, Kerry, \nSchumer, Stabenow, Dodd, Brown, Sanders, Casey, Tester, Bennet, and \nGillibrand for joining me in this important initiative.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 683\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Long-term services and supports provided under the \n     Medicaid program established under title XIX of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) must meet the abilities \n     and life choices of individuals with disabilities and older \n     Americans, including the choice to live in one's own home or \n     with one's own family and to become a productive member of \n     the community.\n       (2) Similarly, under the United States Supreme Court's \n     decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), \n     individuals with disabilities have the right to choose to \n     receive their long term services and supports in the \n     community, rather than in an institutional setting.\n       (3) Nevertheless, research on the provision of long-term \n     services and supports under the Medicaid program (conducted \n     by and on behalf of the Department of Health and Human \n     Services) continues to show a significant funding and \n     programmatic bias toward institutional care. In 2007, only 42 \n     percent of long-term care funds expended under the Medicaid \n     program, and only about 13.6 percent of all funds expended \n     under that program, pay for services and supports in home and \n     community-based settings.\n       (4) While much effort has been dedicated to ``rebalancing'' \n     the current system, overall about 60 percent of Medicaid \n     long-term care dollars are still spent on institutional \n     services, with about 40 percent going to home and community \n     based services. In 2007, only 11 States spent 50 percent or \n     more of their Medicaid long-term care funds on home and \n     community-based care.\n       (5) The statistics are even more disproportionate for \n     adults with physical disabilities. In 2007, 69 percent of \n     Medicaid long term care spending for older people and adults \n     with physical disabilities paid for institutional services. \n     Only 6 states spent 50 percent or more of their Medicaid long \n     term care dollars on home and community based services for \n     older people and adults with physical disabilities while \\1/\n     2\\ of the States spent less than 25 percent. This disparity \n     continues even though, on average, it is estimated that \n     Medicaid dollars can support nearly 3 older people and adults \n     with physical disabilities in home and community-based \n     services for every person in a nursing home.\n       (6) For Medicaid beneficiaries who need long term care, \n     services provided in an institutional setting represent the \n     only guaranteed benefit. Only 30 States have adopted the \n     benefit option of providing personal care, or attendant, \n     services under their Medicaid programs.\n       (7) Although every State has chosen to provide certain \n     services under home and community-based waivers, these \n     services are unevenly available within and across States, and \n     reach a small percentage of eligible individuals. Individuals \n     with the most significant disabilities are usually afforded \n     the least amount of choice, despite advances in medical and \n     assistive technologies and related areas.\n       (8) Despite the more limited funding for home and \n     community-based services, the majority of individuals who use \n     Medicaid long-term services and supports prefer to live in \n     the community, rather than in institutional settings.\n       (9) The goals of the Nation properly include providing \n     families of children with disabilities, working-age adults \n     with disabilities, and older Americans with--\n       (A) a meaningful choice of receiving long-term services and \n     supports in the most integrated setting appropriate to the \n     individual's needs;\n       (B) the greatest possible control over the services \n     received and, therefore, their own lives and futures; and\n       (C) quality services that maximize independence in the home \n     and community.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are the following:\n       (1) To reform the Medicaid program established under title \n     XIX of the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.) to \n     provide services in the most integrated setting appropriate \n     to the individual's needs, and to provide equal access to \n     community-based attendant services and supports in order to \n     assist individuals in achieving equal opportunity, full \n     participation, independent living, and economic self-\n     sufficiency.\n       (2) To provide financial assistance to States as they \n     reform their long-term care systems to provide comprehensive \n     statewide long-term services and supports, including \n     community-based attendant services and supports that provide \n     consumer choice and direction, in the most integrated setting \n     appropriate.\n       (3) To assist States in meeting the growing demand for \n     community-based attendant services and supports, as the \n     Nation's population ages and individuals with disabilities \n     live longer.\n       (4) To assist States in complying with the U.S. Supreme \n     Court decision in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999), and \n     implementing the integration mandate of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act.\n\n            TITLE I--ESTABLISHMENT OF MEDICAID PLAN BENEFIT\n\n     SEC. 101.

A bill to provide the Coast Guard and NOAA with additional \nauthorities under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, to strengthen the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, 20 years ago today, the tanker Exxon \nValdez, en route from Valdez, Alaska to Los Angeles, failed to turn \nback into the shipping lane after detouring to avoid ice. At 12:04 am, \nit ran aground on Bligh Reef in Prince William Sound.\n  Within 6 hours, the Exxon Valdez spilled 11 million gallons of crude \noil into the Sound's pristine waters and wrote itself into the history \nbooks as the worst oil spill ever in U.S. waters. Eventually, oil \ncovered 11,000 square miles of ocean.\n  The environmental and economic damage is impossible to both fathom \nand assess; countless seabirds, marine mammals, and fish were killed. \nAs a result, companies like the Chugach Alaska Corporation went \nbankrupt. There were huge losses to recreational sports, fisheries, and \ntourism. Today, 20 years later, there is still oil in the area.\n  But most of all, Exxon Valdez showed us just how unprepared we were. \nToday, this disaster serves as a constant reminder that we cannot allow \ncomplacency to drive the ship when it comes to protecting our oceans \nfrom oil spills.\n  This is why I rise today--on the anniversary of this catastrophe--to \nintroduce the Oil Pollution Prevention and Response Act of 2009.\n  This legislation is designed to address some of the events that \nperfectly aligned to make the Exxon Valdez disaster possible. It will \nput mechanisms in place that will work to protect our Nation's \nenvironment and economy from this kind of devastation, and add another \nlayer to our oil spill safety net.\n  Because while our oil spill safety net has come a long way since \n1989, it could still be stronger.\n  In response to the Exxon Valdez oil spill, Congress passed the Oil \nPollution Act of 1990 to say once and for all that complacency has no \nplace in this country's oil shipping industry. It revolutionized oil \nspill risk management, and demonstrated that prevention, preparedness, \nand response were the key to filling some of the gaps.\n  The probability of a major spill has been greatly reduced.\n  In my home State of Washington, the Coast Guard's District 13 leads \nthe Nation in oil spill prevention and works closely with the State of \nWashington, tribal governments, and industry.\n  But while the probability of a spill has decreased, the potential \nimpacts are greater than ever, and just one spill could \ncatastrophically damage our pristine waterways, ecosystems, and \neconomy.\n  This is especially true in places like Washington State's Puget \nSound, where every year, 600 oil tankers and 3,000 oil barges travel \nthrough the Sound, carrying about 15 billion gallons of oil. Or in a \nplace like the Port of Seattle, where port facilities and activities \nsupport more than 190,000 jobs in the region and generate more than $17 \nbillion in revenue for businesses.\n  Alarmingly, in 2005, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer identified 650 \nnear-miss incidents, including traffic violations, collisions, and \ngroundings that occurred in the Sound between 1985 and 2004.\n  Unfortunately, these close calls are not all we have to worry about.\n  According to Coast Guard data, although the number of oil spills from \nvessels has decreased enormously since passage of OPA 90, the volume of \noil spilled nationwide is still significant.\n  In 1992, vessels spilled more than 665,000 gallons of oil.\n  In 2004, the total was higher, at almost 723,000 gallons.\n  In 2004, there were 36 spills from tank ships, 141 spills from \nbarges, and 1,562 spills from other vessels, including cargo ships.\n  I know that many of my colleagues have examples of their own, as \nthere have been recent spills involving significant amounts of oil off \nthe coasts of Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, Oregon, Virginia, Hawaii, \nand Washington.\n  In the last 2 years, we have seen oil on the beaches of San Francisco \nand the shores of the Mississippi River in Louisiana.\n  We must learn from these incidents, from Exxon Valdez, from every \nclose call. We must pass iron-clad policies that show there is no room \nfor complacency.\n  The Oil Pollution and Prevention and Response Act of 2009 is designed \nto do just that.\n  It builds on previous efforts, like the Commerce Committee \nSubcommittee on Fisheries and Coast Guard field hearing I chaired in \nSeattle in 2005. This hearing focused on improving our oil pollution \nprevention and response capabilities, and as a result of the testimony \nfrom many people during that hearing and conversations with the Coast \nGuard and other stakeholders, I introduced the Oil Pollution Prevention \nand Response Act in March of 2006.\n\n  This bill updates that effort and includes additional provisions to \nreinvigorate our commitment to oil spill prevention and strengthen our \noil spill safety net.\n  This bill will strengthen navigational measures in sensitive areas by \nrequiring the identification of natural resources of particular \necological or economic importance--such as fisheries, marine \nsanctuaries, and important estuaries. Because if we know where the \ncritically important resources are, we can re-route ships away from \nthem.\n  It will improve the Coast Guard's coordination with State Oil Spill \nPrevention and Response.\n  The bill will mandate the Coast Guard to further reduce the risks of \noil spills from activities that have been put on a back burner in the \npast; such as the potential for a spill when oil is transferred between \nvessels.\n  The bill will augment the Coast Guard's vessel inspection manpower.\n  It will require the Coast Guard to track and report on instances of \nhuman error, the most frequent cause of accidental spills.\n  This is an important step in the right direction for our Nation's oil \nspill safety net.\n  It is a proclamation that we are not going to allow complacency back \nat the wheel, nor are we going to allow politics to get in the way of \ndoing what's right.\n  Twenty years ago we saw exactly what can happen. Today it is up to us \nto ensure that this country's environment, economy, and people never \nhave to witness the aftermath of another Exxon Valdez.\n  The truth is, until we move this country away from its dangerous \ndependence on oil and toward a cleaner,\n\n[[Page S3681]]\n\nmore affordable, sustainable energy future, oil spills will be \ninevitable. So while we must continue to fight for a new energy future, \nwe must also take responsibility and precautions for the symptoms of \nour actions today.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 684\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Oil released into the Nation's marine waters can cause \n     substantial, and in some cases irreparable, harm to the \n     marine environment.\n       (2) The economic impact of oil spills is substantial. \n     Billions of dollars have been spent in the United States for \n     cleanup of, and damages due to, oil spills; while many \n     social, cultural, economic, and environmental damages remain \n     uncompensated.\n       (3) The Oil Pollution Act of 1990, enacted in response to \n     the worst vessel oil spill in United States history, \n     substantially reduced the amount of oil spills from vessels. \n     However, significant volumes of oil continue to be released, \n     and the potential for a major spill remains unacceptably \n     high.\n       (4) Although the total number of oil spills from vessels \n     has decreased since passage of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, \n     more oil was spilled in 2004 from vessels nationwide than was \n     spilled from vessels in 1992.\n       (5) Waterborne transportation of oil in the United States \n     continues to increase.\n       (6) Although the number of oil spills from tankers declined \n     from 193 in 1992 to 36 in 2004, spills from oil tankers tend \n     to be large with devastating impacts.\n       (7) While the number of oil spills from tank barges has \n     declined since 1992 (322 spills to 141 spills in 2004), the \n     volume of oil spilled from tank barges has remained constant \n     at approximately 200,000 gallons spilled each year.\n       (8) Oil spills from non-tank vessels averaged between \n     125,000 gallons and 400,000 gallons per year from 1992 \n     through 2004 and accounted for over half of the total number \n     of spills from all sources, including vessels and non-vessel \n     sources.\n       (9) Recent spills involving significant quantities of oil \n     have occurred off the coasts of Alaska, Maine, Massachusetts, \n     Oregon, Virginia, and Washington, and involved barges, tank \n     vessels, and non-tank vessels. The value of waterfront \n     property, sport, commercial and tribal treaty fisheries, \n     recreation, tourism, and threatened and endangered species \n     continue to increase.\n       (10) It is more cost-effective to prevent oil spills than \n     it is to clean-up oil once it is released into the \n     environment.\n       (11) Of the 20 major vessel oil spill incidents since 1990 \n     where liability limits have been exceeded, 10 involved tank \n     barges, 8 involved non-tank vessels, 2 involved tankers, and \n     only 1 involved a vessel that was double-hulled.\n       (12) Although recent technological improvements in oil \n     tanker design, such as double hulls and redundant steering, \n     increase tanker safety, these technologies are not a panacea \n     and cannot ensure against oil spills, the leading cause of \n     which is human error.\n       (13) The Federal government has a responsibility to protect \n     the Nation's natural resources, public health, and \n     environment by improving Federal measures to prevent and \n     respond to oil spills.\n       (14) Environmentally fragile coastal areas are vitally \n     important to local economies and the way of life in coastal \n     States and federally recognized tribal governments. These \n     areas are particularly vulnerable to the threat of oil \n     spills. Coastal waters contribute approximately 75 percent of \n     all commercial shellfish and finfish catches, and over 81 \n     percent of all recreational fishing catches in the United \n     States, outside of Alaska and Hawaii.\n       (15) The northern coast of Washington State and entrance to \n     Puget Sound is the principal corridor conveying Pacific Rim \n     commerce into the State, to Canada's largest port, and to the \n     United States' third largest naval complex. The area contains \n     a National Marine Sanctuary, a National Park, and many \n     National Wildlife Refuges contiguous with marine waters.\n       (16) State, local, and tribal governments have important \n     human resources and spill response capabilities which can \n     contribute to response efforts in the event of a significant \n     oil spill. State, local, and tribal governments may have \n     unique local knowledge of natural resources which can improve \n     the quality of spill response. For these reasons, State, \n     local and tribal governments need appropriate information to \n     have knowledge of spills, as well as incidents and activities \n     that may result in a spill, which can impact State waters.\n\n     SEC. 4.

A bill to require new vessels for carrying oil fuel to have \ndouble hulls, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation.\n\n[[Page S3686]]\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. President, this is a very significant day in \nenvironmental history in our world, particularly in our country. While \nthe debate goes on about what corporate America has done and what they \nhave not done and how we should treat them in trying to get our economy \nback on track, we have heard questions raised about corporate behavior.\n  I came out of the corporate world when I came to the Senate. It seems \nto me that things were different years ago.\n  Over the last few days, we have heard many in these Chambers, here \nand in the House of Representatives, call on companies to be better \ncorporate citizens.\n  Today I rise to point out what may be the greatest abandonment of \ncorporate citizenship in our Nation's history, and that was displayed \nby the Exxon Corporation, one of the most profitable companies in \nAmerican history. Twenty years ago this day, one of their ships ran \naground in Alaska. Still Exxon refuses to live up to the obligations it \nobtained when that ship ran aground, and it damaged the environment \nsubstantially.\n  It was 20 years ago today the Exxon Valdez crashed into the Bligh \nReef in Alaska's Prince William Sound. That ship spilled 11 million \ngallons of crude oil, damaging 1,300 miles of shoreline, and ruining \nthe lives of thousands of Americans.\n  Now, as chairman of a subcommittee with appropriations jurisdiction \nover the Coast Guard, I was taken to Alaska by the Coast Guard and \narrived there 3 days after the Exxon Valdez ran aground. To see the \ndamage was horrific. But also during those days there, during that \nfirst day, I saw so many of the people who worked for the Government.\n  This is a discussion we often have about Government servants and \ntheir obligations--and I would say, having come from the corporate \nworld, there are few who are more mindful of their obligations than \nthose who work for Government. That day I saw from the helicopter in \nwhich I was flying so many of our people committed to their \nresponsibilities, dealing with the problem, brave people traveling to \ntiny islands by helicopter and small boats. Their mission was to save \nthe wildlife.\n  I saw many of them fairly close up taking birds, and mammals--the \nyoung mammals, particularly--and fish into their hands and wiping the \noil off to try to save the lives of these victims. One by one, wherever \nthey could, they were saving animal lives. It was devastating to see.\n  It was obvious, as one looked at the waters of Prince William Sound, \na beautiful place, surrounded by glaciers, that this lure, this almost \nseductive lure of color and cover that came from the oil was at the \nsame time doling out poisons.\n  There are many portions of Prince William Sound today that remain \ncontaminated. The cannery workers, fishermen, and people whose lives \ndepended on Prince William Sound are still paying a price. The local \neconomy is still reeling. Think about it. So much time has passed since \nthis spill that as many as 6,000 people injured by that disaster have \nalready passed away. These people were never ever fully compensated for \ntheir loss.\n  Exxon was responsible for this mess. But the company fought at every \nstep to shirk its responsibilities. And ever since the disaster, Exxon \nhas defaulted on its obligations as a corporate citizen and refused to \nrepair whole communities and innocent lives that have been damaged.\n  Instead, during all of this period, Exxon has fought tooth and nail \nto deprive the victims of proper compensation, spending as much as $400 \nmillion to retain lawyers and keep things bottled up in court.\n  Exxon took its fight all the way to the Supreme Court, and last year, \n19 years after the tragedy, the Justices confirmed that Exxon owes \npunitive damages to the victims, although they and their skillful \nhordes of lawyers succeeded in a constant effort to reduce the amount \nof compensation.\n  Still, even today, 20 years later, the company continues to stonewall \nthe victims by trying to avoid paying the interest that fell on these \ncharges. Exxon's actions are the height of corporate irresponsibility. \nAs a former CEO of a major corporation, I understand the drive to \nsucceed. But there is nothing more reprehensible than a company evading \nits obligations to our country's people just to make a quick buck and \nto avoid the legitimate responsibility that is a giant factor in our \neconomy and social well being. They have that responsibility.\n  Exxon had record profits last year of $45 billion. Even last quarter, \nwhen companies across the country were suffering, this company, Exxon, \nposted a profit of nearly $8 billion in a single quarter--$8 billion.\n  Now, it would have been a drop in the bucket for this corporation to \nhave fully compensated the victims who were so severely hurt. All the \nmoney, energy, and time that Exxon has wasted should have been spent \nmaking local communities whole again and helping to fix the \nenvironmental and economic damage done to Alaska's Prince William \nSound.\n  The truth is, Exxon needs to change its ways, and today, the 20th \nanniversary of the Exxon Valdez disaster, is a perfect opportunity.\n  On this anniversary, we are also reminded how dangerous transporting \noil can be. That is why I have introduced a bill this day that will \naccelerate the use of double-hulled vessels by shippers.\n  Oil spills are absolutely catastrophic to the environment and seaside \ncommunities and influence wide geographic areas beyond those \ncommunities. After examining the costs of past spills, we have written \na bill to substantially reduce the possibilities of future spills. So I \nlook forward to seeing this bill passed by this Chamber and to working \nwith colleagues to make sure that disasters like the one we saw 20 \nyears ago this day will never happen again.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MIKULSKI:\n  S. 686. A bill to establish the Social Work Reinvestment Commission \nto advise Congress and the Secretary of Health and Human Services on \npolicy issues associated with the profession of social work, to \nauthorize the Secretary to make grants to support recruitment for, and \nretention, research, and reinvestment in, the profession, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. President, I rise today to introduce two important \nsocial work bills; the Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. \nSocial Work Reinvestment Act and the Clinical Social Work Medicare \nEquity Act of 2009. I am proud to sponsor these pieces of legislation \nthat will improve the shortage of social workers and properly reimburse \nsocial workers for the services they provide.\n  Social workers play a critical role combating the social problems \nfacing our nation and are an integral part of our healthcare system. As \nwe move into an era of unprecedented healthcare and social service \nneeds, we must have the workforce in place to make sure that our \nreturning soldiers have access to mental health services, our elderly \nmaintain their independence in the communities they live in, and abused \nchildren are placed in safe homes. Social workers support physical, \npsychological and social needs. They provide mental health therapy, \ncaregiver and family counseling, health education, program \ncoordination, and case management. In these tough economic times social \nworkers play a more important role than ever to keep communities \ntogether and help individuals and families cope with the new stresses \nthey are facing.\n  The Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work \nReinvestment Act reinvests in social workers by providing grants to \nsocial workers, reviewing the current social workforce challenges, and \ndetermining how this shortage will affect the communities social \nworkers serve. I am honored to introduce this bill named after two \nsocial visionaries, Dorothy I. Height and Whitney M. Young. Dorothy \nHeight, a pioneer of the civil rights movement, like me began her \ncareer as a case worker and continued to fight for social justice. I am \nparticularly honored to introduce this bill today, on Dorothy Height's \nbirthday. Whitney Young, another trailblazer of the civil rights \nmovement, also began his career transforming our social landscape as a \nsocial worker. He helped create President Johnson's War on Poverty and \nhas served as President of the National Association of Social Workers.\n\n[[Page S3687]]\n\n  This bill is about reinvesting in social work. It provides grants \nthat invest in social work education, research, and training. These \ngrants will fund community based programs of excellence and provide \nscholarships to train the next generation of social workers. The bill \nalso addresses how to recruit and retain new social workers, research \nthe impact of social services, and foster ways to improve social \nworkplace safety. This bill establishes a national coordination center \nthat will allow social work education, advocacy and research \ninstitutions to collaborate and work together. It will facilitate \ngathering and distributing social work research to make the most \neffective use of the information we have on how social work service can \nimprove our social fabric. This bill also gives social work the \nattention it deserves. It creates a media campaign that will promote \nsocial work, and recognizes March as Social Work Awareness Month.\n  Today 30,000 social workers specialize in gerontology, but we will \nneed 70,000 of these social workers by 2010. I want to make sure that \nwhen the aging tsunami hits us, we have the workforce in place to care \nfor our aging family members, the Alzheimer patients, and the disabled.\n  The Clinical Social Work Medicare Equity Act of 2009 ensures that \nclinical social workers receive Medicare reimbursements for the mental \nhealth services they provide in skilled nursing facilities. Under the \ncurrent system, social workers are not paid for the services they \nprovide. Psychologists and psychiatrists, who provide similar \ncounseling, are able to separately bill Medicare for their services.\n  Since my first days in Congress, I have been fighting to protect and \nstrengthen the safety of our nation's seniors. Making sure that seniors \nhave access to quality, affordable mental health care is an important \npart of this fight. I know that millions of seniors do not have access \nto, or are not receiving, the mental health services they urgently \nneed. Nearly 6 million seniors are affected by depression, but only \none-tenth ever receive treatment. According to the American Psychiatric \nAssociation, up to 25 percent of the elderly population in the United \nStates suffers from significant symptoms of mental illness and among \nnursing home residents the prevalence is as high as 80 percent. These \nmental disorders, which include severe depression and debilitating \nanxiety, interfere with the person's ability to carry out activities of \ndaily living and adversely affect their quality of life. Furthermore, \nolder people have a 20 percent suicide rate, the highest of any age \ngroup. Every year nearly 6,000 older Americans kill themselves. This is \nunacceptable and must be addressed.\n  This bill protects patients across the country and ensures that \nseniors living in underserved urban and rural areas, where clinical \nsocial workers are often the only available option for mental health \ncare, continue to receive the treatment they need. Clinical social \nworkers, much like psychologists and psychiatrists, treat and diagnose \nmental illnesses. In fact, clinical social workers are the primary \nmental health providers for nursing home residents and seniors residing \nin rural environments. Unlike other mental health providers, clinical \nsocial workers cannot bill Medicare directly for the important services \nthey provide to their patients. Protecting seniors' access to clinical \nsocial workers ensures that our most vulnerable citizens get the \nquality, affordable mental health care they need. This bill will \ncorrect this inequity and make sure clinical social workers get the \npayments and respect they deserve.\n  Before the Balanced Budget Act of 1997, clinical social workers \nbilled Medicare Part B directly for mental health services they \nprovided in nursing facilities for each patient they served. Under the \nProspective Payment System, services provided by clinical social \nworkers are lumped, or ``bundled,'' along with the services of other \nhealth care providers for the purposes of billing and payments. \nPsychologists and psychiatrists, who provide similar counseling, were \nexempted from this system and continue to bill Medicare directly. This \nbill would exempt clinical social workers, like their mental health \ncolleagues, from the Prospective Payment System, and would make sure \nthat clinical social workers are paid for the services they provide to \npatients in skilled nursing facilities.\n  This bill is about more than paperwork and payment procedures. This \nbill is about equal access to Medicare payments for the equal and \nimportant work done by clinical social workers. It is about making sure \nour nation's most vulnerable citizens have access to quality, \naffordable mental health care. The overarching goal we should be \nstriving to achieve for our seniors is an overall improved quality of \nlife. Without clinical social workers, many nursing home residents may \nnever get the counseling they need when faced with a life-threatening \nillness or the loss of a loved one. I think we can do better by our \nnation's seniors. I am fighting to make sure we do.\n  As a social worker, I have been on the frontlines of helping people \ncope with issues in their everyday lives. I started off fighting for \nabused children, making sure they were placed in safe homes. Today I am \na social worker with power. I am proud to continue to fight every day \nfor the long range needs of the nation on the floor of the U.S. Senate \nand as Chairwoman of the Aging Subcommittee of the Health, Education, \nLabor and Pensions Committee.\n  The Clinical Social Work Medicare Equity Act of 2009 and the Dorothy \nI. Height and Whitney M. Young, Jr. Social Work Reinvestment Act is \nstrongly supported by the National Association of Social Workers. I \nalso want to thank Senator Stabenow and Senator Murray for their \ncosponsorship of the Clinical Social Work Medicare Equity Act of 2009. \nI look forward to working with my colleagues to enact these two \nimportant pieces of legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 686\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Bureau of Labor Statistics states that employment \n     of social workers is expected to increase. The increase is \n     expected to be greater than the average increase in \n     employment (estimated to be 22 percent) during the period of \n     2006 through 2016, demonstrating a substantial need for \n     social workers. The need is even greater for social workers \n     in the area of aging. The National Association of Social \n     Workers Center for Workforce Studies estimates that 9 percent \n     of, or 30,000, licensed social workers specialize in \n     gerontology. By 2010, as more people reach the age of 65, the \n     National Institute on Aging projects that 60,000 to 70,000 \n     social workers will be needed.\n       (2) Social work salaries are among the lowest for \n     professionals in general and for those with master's level \n     educations in particular. A survey conducted by the John A. \n     Hartford Foundation found that between 1992 and 1999 the \n     annual rate of wage growth for degree-holding social workers \n     was 0.8 percent. According to the National Association of \n     Social Workers Center for Workforce Studies, 60 percent of \n     full-time social workers earn between $35,000 and $59,999 per \n     year, with 25 percent earning between $40,000 and $49,999 per \n     year. Social workers who earn lower salaries are more likely \n     to work in challenging agency environments and to serve more \n     vulnerable clients. They are also more likely to leave the \n     profession.\n       (3) According to one study by the Council on Social Work \n     Education, 68 percent of individuals surveyed who held a \n     master's degree in social work graduated with an average\n\n[[Page S3688]]\n\n     debt of $26,777. Additionally, the United States Public \n     Interest Research Group states that 37 percent of public 4-\n     year graduates have too much debt to manage as a starting \n     social worker. While social workers may be in positions that \n     are personally fulfilling, due to their high loan debt and \n     low income, many struggle financially.\n       (4) Social work can be a dangerous profession. According to \n     the American Federation of State, County, and Municipal \n     Employees, 70 percent of caseworkers report that front line \n     staff in their agency have been victims of violence or have \n     received threats of violence. Social workers are considerably \n     safer when measures such as use of global positioning \n     systems, self-defense training, and conflict prevention are \n     implemented.\n       (5) According to a study by the University of Michigan, \n     approximately 1 in 7 adults over the age of 70 have some form \n     of dementia, and 9.7 percent (or 2,400,000) of those found \n     with dementia were also found to have Alzheimer's disease. \n     Social workers in gerontology settings work with older \n     adults, including those with dementia, to support their \n     physiological, psychological, and social needs through mental \n     health therapy, caregiver and family counseling, health \n     education, program coordination, and case management. Those \n     professionals also assist the hundreds of thousands of older \n     persons who are abused, neglected, frail, or vulnerable. \n     Between 2000 and 2004, there was a 19.7 percent increase in \n     the total number of reports of elder and vulnerable adult \n     abuse and neglect.\n       (6) The Children's Defense Fund states that every 36 \n     seconds a child is confirmed as abused or neglected. The \n     Administration for Children and Families states that 510,000 \n     children were in the United States foster care system in \n     2006. Most of the children in foster care are placed in \n     foster care due to parental abuse or neglect. Research shows \n     that social workers in child welfare agencies are more likely \n     to find permanent homes for children who were in foster care \n     for 2 or more years. Unfortunately, fewer than 40 percent of \n     child welfare workers are social workers.\n       (7) The Department of Health and Human Services estimates \n     that 26.2 percent of (or 1 in 4) individuals in the United \n     States age 18 or older experiences a diagnosable mental \n     health disorder. Additionally, 1 in 5 children and \n     adolescents experiences a mental health disorder. At least 1 \n     in 10, or about 6,000,000, young people have a serious \n     emotional disturbance. Social workers provide the majority of \n     mental health counseling services in the United States, and \n     are often the only providers of such services in rural areas.\n       (8) The Department of Veterans Affairs estimates that there \n     are 23,977,000 veterans in the United States. More than \n     1,100,000 members of the Armed Forces have been deployed to \n     Iraq or Afghanistan since 2001. A once declining veteran \n     population is now surging and is in dire need of mental \n     health treatment to address issues such as post traumatic \n     stress disorder, depression, drug and alcohol addiction, and \n     suicidal tendencies. Veterans make up 25 percent of homeless \n     people in the United States, even though veterans comprise \n     only 11 percent of the general population. Social workers \n     working with veterans and their families provide case \n     management, crisis intervention, mental health interventions, \n     housing and financial counseling, high risk screening, and \n     advocacy among other services. The Department employs over \n     5,000 social workers and is the single largest employer of \n     social workers in the Nation. Social workers in the \n     Department also coordinate the Community Residential Care \n     Program, the oldest and most cost effective of the \n     Department's extended care programs.\n       (9) The American Cancer Society estimates that there were \n     1,437,180 new cases of cancer and 565,650 cancer deaths in \n     2008 alone. The incidence of cancer will increase \n     dramatically as the population grows older. The Centers for \n     Disease Control and Prevention report that at the end of 2003 \n     there were 1,039,000 to 1,285,000 people living with HIV or \n     AIDS in the United States. In 2006, 1,300,000 people received \n     care from hospice providers in the United States. Health care \n     and medical social workers practice in areas related to all \n     of those circumstances and provide outreach for prevention of \n     health issues, help individuals and their families adapt to \n     their circumstances, provide grief counseling, and act as a \n     liaison between individuals and their medical team, helping \n     patients make informed decisions about their care.\n       (10) The National Center for Education Statistics states \n     that in 2005 the national dropout rate for high school \n     students was 9.3 percent. White students dropped out at a \n     rate of 5.8 percent. African-American students dropped out at \n     a rate of 10.7 percent. Hispanic students dropped out at a \n     rate of 22.1 percent. Some vulnerable communities have \n     dropout rates of 50 percent or higher. Social workers in \n     school settings help students avoid dropping out through \n     early identification, prevention, intervention, counseling, \n     and support services.\n       (11) According to the Department of Justice, every year \n     more than 650,000 ex-offenders are released from Federal and \n     State prisons. Social workers employed in the corrections \n     system address disproportionate minority incarceration rates, \n     provide treatment for mental health problems and drug and \n     alcohol addiction, and work within as well as outside of the \n     prison to reduce recidivism and increase positive community \n     reentry.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Res. 84\n\n       Whereas the Government of Canada permits an annual \n     commercial hunt for seals in the waters off the east coast of \n     Canada;\n       Whereas an international outcry regarding the plight of the \n     seals hunted in Canada resulted in the 1983 ban by the \n     European Union of whitecoat and blueback seal skins and the \n     subsequent collapse of the commercial seal hunt in Canada;\n       Whereas the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. \n     1361 et seq.) bars the import into the United States of any \n     seal products;\n       Whereas, in recent years, the Minister of Fisheries and \n     Oceans of Canada has authorized historically high quotas for \n     harp seals;\n       Whereas more than 1,000,000 seals have been killed during \n     the past 4 years;\n       Whereas harp seal pups can legally be hunted in Canada as \n     soon as they have begun to molt their white coats, at \n     approximately 12 days of age;\n       Whereas 97 percent of the seals killed are pups between \n     just 12 days and 12 weeks of age;\n       Whereas, in 2007, an international panel of experts in \n     veterinary medicine and zoology was invited by the Humane \n     Society of the United States to observe the commercial seal \n     slaughter in Canada;\n       Whereas the report by the panel noted that sealers failed \n     to comply with sealing regulations in Canada and that \n     officials of the Government of Canada failed to enforce such \n     regulations;\n       Whereas the report also concluded that the killing methods \n     permitted during the commercial seal hunt in Canada are \n     inherently inhumane and should be prohibited;\n       Whereas many seals are shot in the course of the hunt and \n     escape beneath the ice where they die slowly and are never \n     recovered;\n       Whereas such seals are not properly counted in official \n     kill statistics, increasing the likelihood that the actual \n     kill level is far higher than the level that is reported;\n       Whereas the few thousand fishermen who participate in the \n     commercial seal hunt in Canada earn, on average, only a tiny \n     fraction of their annual income from killing seals;\n       Whereas members of the fishing and sealing industries in \n     Canada continue to justify the seal hunt on the grounds that \n     the seals in the Northwest Atlantic are preventing the \n     recovery of cod stocks, despite the lack of any credible \n     scientific evidence to support this claim;\n       Whereas the consensus in the international scientific \n     community is that culling seals will not assist in the \n     recovery of fish stocks and that seals are a vital part of \n     the fragile marine ecosystem of the Northwest Atlantic;\n       Whereas polling consistently shows that the overwhelming \n     majority of people in Canada oppose the commercial seal hunt;\n       Whereas the vast majority of seal products are exported \n     from Canada, and the sealing industry relies on international \n     markets for its products;\n       Whereas 10 countries have prohibited trade in seal products \n     in recent years, and the European Union is now considering a \n     prohibition on trade in seal products; and\n       Whereas the persistence of this cruel and needless \n     commercial hunt is inconsistent with the well-earned \n     international reputation of Canada: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) urges the Government of Canada to prohibit the \n     commercial hunting of seals; and\n       (2) strongly supports an unconditional prohibition by the \n     European Union on trade in seal products.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, on March 18th, 2009, just weeks before its \nhunting season was scheduled to begin, Russia announced that it would \nban the hunting and killing of baby seals. Youri Trutnev, Russia's \nMinister of Natural Resources, who was quoted in the New York Times \nlast week, graphically depicted the shameful practice, saying: ``The \nbloody sight of the hunting of seals, the slaughter of these \ndefenseless animals, which you cannot even call a real hunt, is banned \nin our country, just as well as in most developed countries.''\n  In addition, the Internal Markets and Consumer Protection Committee \n(IMCO) of the European Parliament approved a prohibition on trade in \nseal products in the European Union. This measure may now be considered \nby the full European Parliament in the coming months.\n  Yet, in Canada, the largest commercial slaughter of marine mammals in \nthe world continues. According to the Humane Society of the United \nStates (HSUS), over one million seals have been killed over the past \nfour years. In Canada, seal pups as young as 12 days old can legally be \nkilled. The vast majority of seals killed in these hunts are between 12 \ndays and 12 weeks of age.\n  Canada has officially opened another seal hunting season, paving the \nway for hundreds of thousands of baby seals to be killed for their fur \nin the coming weeks, when the harp seal hunt begins in earnest. So \ntoday I am pleased to be joined by Senator Collins in submitting a \nresolution that urges the Government of Canada to end this senseless \nand inhumane slaughter.\n  The U.S. Government has opposed this senseless slaughter, as noted in \nthe January 19, 2005, letter from the U.S. Department of State, in \nresponse to a letter Senator Collins and I wrote to President Bush, \nurging him to raise this issue during his November 30, 2004, visit with \nCanadian Prime Minister Paul Martin.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that support material be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                          Department of State,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, January 19, 2005.\n       Dear Senator Levin: This is in response to your letter to \n     the President of November 24, 2004, regarding Canadian \n     commercial seal hunting. The White House has requested that \n     the Department of State respond. We regret the delay in \n     responding. Unfortunately, this letter was not received in \n     the Department of State until mid-December, well after the \n     referenced meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister \n     Paul Martin of Canada.\n       We are aware of Canada's seal hunting activities and of the \n     opposition to it expressed by many Americans. Furthermore, we \n     can assure you that the United States has a long-standing \n     policy opposing the hunting of seals and other marine mammals \n     absent sufficient safeguards and information to ensure that \n     the hunting will not adversely impact the affected marine \n     mammal population or the ecosystem of which it is a part. The \n     United States policy is reflected in the Marine Mammal \n     Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA) which generally prohibits, with \n     narrow and specific exceptions, the taking of marine\n\n[[Page S3692]]\n\n     mammals in waters or lands subject to the jurisdiction of the \n     United States and the importation of marine mammals and \n     marine mammal products into the United States.\n       The United States has made known to the Government of \n     Canada its objections and the objections of concerned \n     American legislators and citizens to the Canadian commercial \n     seal hunt on numerous occasions over recent years. The United \n     States has also opposed Canada's efforts within the Arctic \n     Council to promote trade in sealskins and other marine mammal \n     products.\n       We hope this information is helpful to you. Please do not \n     hesitate to contact us if we can be of assistance in this or \n     any other matter.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nancy Powell,\n       (For Paul V. Kelly, Asst. Secretary, Legislative Affairs).\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 19, 2009]\n\n                  Russia to Ban Hunting of Baby Seals\n\n                          (By A.G. Sulzberger)\n\n       Russia announced on Wednesday that it would ban the hunting \n     of baby seals, effectively shutting one of the world's \n     largest hunting grounds in the controversial trade in seal \n     fur.\n       The decision is yet another blow to an age-old industry \n     that has been losing a public relations battle in recent \n     years to animal-rights groups, who have gained public support \n     by using stark photographs of harp seal pups less than a \n     month old being clubbed to death on blood-stained ice flows.\n       In addition, the European Union is considering a ban of all \n     seal products--similar to one that the United States adopted \n     decades ago--which would eliminate a key trade route and end \n     market for the furs. And even in Canada, where the world's \n     largest seal hunt is scheduled to begin later this month and \n     top leaders vigorously defend the industry, a legislator for \n     the first time introduced a proposal to curtail sealing.\n       ``It's highly significant,'' Rebecca Aldworth, director of \n     Humane Society International in Canada, said of the political \n     developments. ``It shows that world opinion is moving away \n     from commercial seal hunting. There's hope on the horizon \n     that this may be the last year that we ever have to witness \n     this cruelty.''\n       In Russia, where the number of new pups has dropped sharply \n     in recent years because of the hunts as well as shrinking ice \n     in the White Sea, the government initially announced a ban on \n     the killing of the very youngest and most highly prized \n     seals, known as ``whitecoats.'' The seals shed the white fur \n     in about two weeks, with the resulting silver coat also \n     coveted.\n       But the government announced in unsparing language that it \n     intended to extend the ban to include all seals less than a \n     year old. (While adult seals are also hunted in smaller \n     quantities, their coarse, scarred fur is generally not used \n     in clothing.) The move, publicly backed by Prime Minister \n     Vladimir V. Putin and coming just weeks before the hunting \n     season was to begin, could save as many as 35,000 seals, \n     according to a spokesman for the International Fund for \n     Animal Welfare.\n       The Associated Press quoted the natural resources minister, \n     Yuri Trutnev, as saying in a statement: ``The bloody sight of \n     the hunting of seals, the slaughter of these defenseless \n     animals, which you cannot even call a real hunt, is banned in \n     our country, just as well as in most developed countries, and \n     this is a serious step to protect the biodiversity of the \n     Russian Federation.''\n       Masha Vorontsova, the head of the International Fund for \n     Animal Welfare in Russia and a biologist who has been pushing \n     for a ban since the fall of the Soviet Union, credited an \n     outpouring of public support for ending the hunt. ``It's a \n     fantastic achievement,'' she said.\n       In contrast, Gail Shea, Canada's Minister of Fisheries and \n     Oceans, did little to disguise her frustration at moves \n     taking aim at the industry both abroad and at home, which she \n     attributed to ``mistruths and propaganda'' spread by special \n     interest groups.\n       ``For some reason the European Union will not recognize \n     what the actual facts are because it's an emotional issue and \n     a political issue,'' she said in an interview.\n       Ms. Shea, who earlier flew to Europe to lobby against a \n     European Union ban, warned that such a move could violate \n     international trade law. An industry spokesman said that \n     nearly all Canadian seal products passed through Europe on \n     their way to major consumers like Norway, Russia and China. \n     It is unclear whether Russia will also ban the import and \n     sale of seal products.\n       Commercial sealing also takes place in a handful of other \n     counties, including Norway, Greenland and Namibia.\n       In Canada, last year's catch of 207,000 seals--or roughly \n     one in every five pups born that year--earned the roughly \n     6,000 licensed sealers a total of $7 million, down from $33 \n     million in 2006, according to Phil Jenkins, a spokesman for \n     the Canadian fisheries department. The hunting decreased, he \n     said, largely because of a sharp drop in prices for the \n     pelts, from $97 to $33, for a perfect specimen. Seals are \n     killed by rifle or by club.\n       The harp seal population level has held steady at about 5.6 \n     million for the last decade, he said, but anti-sealing groups \n     contest that figure.\n       However, the Canadian industry came under rare official \n     scrutiny last week, when Mac Harb, a senator from Ontario, \n     introduced the legislation to cancel the coming hunt.

Mr. President, I rise to thank my colleagues for the \nexpeditious approval of former Washington Gov. Gary Locke as the 36th \nSecretary of Commerce.\n  I have known Gary Locke for more than 20 years and I can say to my \ncolleagues you did the right thing tonight by approving him for this \njob.\n  He has helped our State with broadband service delivery to rural \ncommunities. Under his leadership, Washington State used E-rate funds \nto help develop a K-20 network, a high-speed, high-capacity network \nlinking K-12 schools and universities across the State of Washington.\n  He has been involved with both public and private sector trade \nmissions in helping to promote U.S. products abroad. At the \nInternational Trade Administration within Commerce, he will put that \nexperience to good use. Part of that agency's mission is to provide for \nadvocacy for American companies abroad, and it can mean the difference \nbetween whether major foreign sales opportunities go to U.S. companies \nor to foreign competitors.\n  At NOAA, which is over half the Department of Commerce's budget, \nGovernor Locke's prior experience with the complexities of Puget Sound, \nendangered salmon species, and the hazards of oil spills, will all be \ninvaluable. As Governor, Gary Locke dealt with many of our most trying \nfishing issues and was in charge of appointing members to the North \nPacific Fisheries Management Council.\n  Fisheries in the North Pacific have been recognized by many \norganizations, including the U.S. Oceans Commission and the Pew Oceans \nCommission, as some of the best managed fisheries in the world.\n  In addition to that effort, Governor Locke has dealt with the \ncomplexities of endangered salmon species and getting the first locally \ndeveloped regional salmon recovery plan for Washington State. I know \nthat this expertise will be put to good use at NOAA.\n  Many of my colleagues understand that there are challenges at the \nDepartment of Commerce, including management challenges--from the set-\ntop box program for the digital television transition, to getting the \nNOAA satellite program back on track, to wisely investing the $4.7 \nbillion of broadband grants as part of the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act.\n  I know Governor Locke, who has never shied away from management \nchallenges, will put his expertise to good work in making sure these \nprograms are implemented effectively.\n  He worked with Democrats and Republicans in our State after the tech \nbubble crisis to come up with a budget and spending reduction proposals \nthat were certainly unpopular at the time, but what the State budget \nneeded. I know he will continue in the same bipartisan fashion as \nSecretary of Commerce.\n  I believe Governor Locke will help round out the President's economic \nteam. He is someone who understands the challenges many Americans face \nas we try to stabilize our economy. Governor Locke was born and raised \nin public housing. He combined an intense work ethic with part-time \njobs and financial aid, and graduated from Yale University and received \na subsequent law degree from Boston University.\n  He became the first Chinese American elected Governor in the United \nStates when he was elected to be Governor of the State of Washington.\n  He is a testament to the American dream.\n  So I hope that as we have approved this nomination, he will get \nstarted immediately on helping our economy return to robust growth and \nuse the great resourcefulness he has demonstrated as Governor of \nWashington State. He will make sure the Commerce Department plays a key \nrole in getting our economy moving.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I join my colleague from Washington \nState, Senator Cantwell, this evening to congratulate Gary Locke on his \nconfirmation now as our next Secretary of Commerce. This confirmation \ncomes at an important time in our Nation's history as we all work very \nhard to recover from the worst economic downturn since the Great \nDepression. We need a Commerce Secretary with the dedication and \nexpertise to carry out policies that are going to strengthen our \neconomy far into the future. Gary Locke is uniquely qualified for that \ntask because he does have a lifetime of experience built on hard work, \na wealth of knowledge, and a unique appreciation of the American dream.\n  Governor Locke understands the importance of the American dream \nbecause he lived it. His grandfather emigrated from China, and he \nworked as a servant about a mile from the Governor's mansion in Olympia \nthat one day his grandson would call home. There are a lot of reasons \nwhy Governor Locke is an ideal Commerce Secretary, but I wish to tell a \npersonal story this evening that I think illustrates his commitment to \npublic service and to making sure we make the best decision for our \ntaxpayers.\n  I first met Governor Locke when he was in the Washington State \nlegislature and he was chair of the House Appropriations Committee and \nI was a new State Senator trying to get a piece of legislation passed \nthat was critical to my constituents. As part of getting that bill \npassed, I had to go before then-Gov. Gary Locke as chair of that \nAppropriations Committee, and it was one of the toughest political \nexperiences of my lifetime. He knew the\n\n[[Page S3735]]\n\nbudget inside and out. He ran me through the paces. He grilled me about \nwhat my bill would do and how much it would cost and what kind of \nimpact it would have on the taxpayers. He was very tough. But \nultimately, because he asked those hard questions and made me defend my \nlegislation, we improved the focus of that legislation and we got it \npassed. Governor Locke has brought that level of expertise and \ndedication to the taxpayers in every single position he has held, and \nit makes him an ideal person now to lead the Commerce Department.\n  So let me say a few words about the experience Governor Locke brings \nto this position. One of the most critical jobs the Commerce Secretary \nperforms is finding markets for American products and technologies. He \nunderstands how important this is, and he knows how to do it \nsuccessfully. As the two-term Governor of the Nation's most trade-\ndependent State, he spent 8 years breaking down trade barriers and \npromoting our American products, from airplanes to apples to operating \nsystems. He has led numerous successful delegations to our Asian \ntrading partners to help build those relationships. He also understands \nthat the health of the environment has a direct impact on our quality \nof life and on our economy.\n  All of Governor Locke's experience means he is going to hit the \nground running as our Commerce Secretary as we confront global climate \nchange and other environmental concerns, including the management of \nour fisheries. So I was very pleased to help support the confirmation \nof Gary Locke. He won unanimous approval from our Commerce Committee, \nand today he won unanimous approval from the Senate. He has served the \npeople of Washington State well, and he will bring that same level of \ncommitment and intelligence to this administration.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/24/senate-section/article/S3735-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3735]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       HONORING GALLAUDET UNIVERSITY ESTABLISHMENT AUTHORIZATION\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of S. Res. 83, which was submitted earlier \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 83) designating March 25, 2009, as \n     National Cerebral Palsy Awareness Day.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to submit \na resolution to designate March 25, 2009, as National Cerebral Palsy \nAwareness Day.\n  Cerebral palsy is a group of chronic, neurological disorders that \nappear in infancy or early childhood and permanently affect body \nmovement and muscle coordination necessary to maintain balance and \nposture. Cerebral palsy is caused by damage to one or more specific \nareas of the brain, usually occurring during fetal development; before, \nduring or shortly after birth; or during infancy. The top two risk \nfactors for the disorders are premature births and multiple births, and \ndespite the introductions of modern prenatal testing, improved \nobstetric care, and newborn intensive care technologies, the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, estimates that every year \n10,000 babies born in the United States will develop cerebral palsy. \nThese disorders are not caused by problems in the muscles or nerves \nbut, instead, damage to motor areas in the brain.\n  Cerebral palsy currently affects children at a rate of 1 in 278 and \nan estimated 800,000 Americans. The majority of children who have \ncerebral palsy are born with it, rather than developing the disorder \nover time; however, it may not be detected for months or years. Over 75 \npercent of individuals with cerebral palsy also have one or more \nadditional developmental disability including epilepsy, intellectual \ndisability, autism and visual impairments or blindness. The disorders \nare not progressive and are noncommunicable.\n  Currently, there is no cure for cerebral palsy. There are treatments, \nhowever, which can serve to alleviate some of the symptoms. Treatments \nnow include physical and occupational therapy; speech therapy; drugs to \ncontrol seizures, relax muscle spasms, and alleviate pain; surgery to \ncorrect anatomical abnormalities or release tight muscles; braces and \nother orthotic devices; wheelchairs and rolling walkers; and \ncommunication aids such as computers with attached voice synthesizers.\n  It is essential that more research be conducted on ways in which to \nprevent and treat cerebral palsy. As chairman and ranking member of the \nLabor, Health and Human Services, and Education Appropriations \nSubcommittee, I led the effort to successfully double funding for the \nNational Institutes of Health, NIH. Funding for the NIH has increased \nfrom $11.3 billion in fiscal year 1995 to $30 billion in fiscal year \n2009. In addition, I cosponsored an amendment to H.R. 1, the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act to provide an additional $10 billion to \nthe NIH. In 2008, the NIH provided $28 million for cerebral palsy \nresearch, which is a $16.5 million increase over 2000, when the NIH \nprovided $11.5 million. The Department of Health and Human Services' \n``Healthy People 2010'' report identified cerebral palsy as one of the \nimportant public health conditions to be monitored, and the CDC \nregularly conducts studies on the prevalence of cerebral palsy across \nthe nation. This report will help the CDC to provide a more \ncomprehensive picture of cerebral palsy and advance efforts to provide \nbetter services for these children.\n\n[[Page S3736]]\n\n  Raising awareness of cerebral palsy is integral in the fight against \nthis debilitating condition. I encourage my colleagues to work with \nSenator Casey and me to designate March 25, 2009, as ``National \nCerebral Palsy Awareness Day.''\n  Mrs. MURRAY.
