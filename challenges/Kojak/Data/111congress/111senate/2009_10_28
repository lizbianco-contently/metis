Mr. President, following leader remarks, there will be a \nperiod of morning business for up to 2 hours, with Senators permitted \nto speak for up to 10 minutes each. The majority will control the first \nhour, the Republicans will control the second hour. Following morning \nbusiness, the Senate will proceed to the motion to proceed to H.R. \n3548.\n  I would direct a question to the Chair. What time does the 30 hours \npostcloture run out?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time expires at 12:26 a.m. \nThursday.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I hope we can work something out with the \nRepublicans. We are going to have that vote as soon as we can. I am \nsorry that we might have to do it in the morning. I think we should be \nable to avoid that. The vote was held later than I wanted it because a \nSenator was quite ill. I hope we can work something out. We have \nbipartisan support, and that is just not words.\n  We have significant numbers of Republicans and Democrats who want to \ndo two things--one, to do something about the first-time home buyers \ntax credit. There has been general agreement by a significant number of \nSenators, Democrats and Republicans, to get this done. The legislation \nis before this body now. We also have the loss carryback, which is \nextremely important for businesses at this time, also widely agreed \nupon. It was originally sponsored by Senator Bunning, and now Senator \nBaucus and others have agreed to this--not two or three Senators but \nsignificant numbers on both sides. We could get those done. We have \ngiven the Republicans a request to do it in 2 hours, and Senators said \nthey don't even need that much time to get this done.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, would the majority leader yield?\n  Mr. REID. I would be happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I would just say to my friend, we have a lot of fights \naround here over things we disagree on, but on this particular measure, \nthis is an unnecessary impasse that we have. We have come very close to \na very modest number of amendments. My side would be more than happy to \naccept time agreements on all of the amendments. I want to second what \nthe majority leader says, that I hope we can indeed work out an \nagreement for a modest number of amendments with time agreements and \nwrap up this bill because I certainly share his view that most Members \nsupport the underlying measure and the additions to which the majority \nleader has referred.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, first of all, the other amendments are \nvexatious. They are argumentative. They are not germane. They are not \nrelevant to this legislation. But it seems that this year, every time \nwe get where we try to get something done, we have had stalling. We had \na Senator out here yesterday who had done the work to find out how many \ntimes we have been stopped from doing things. Almost 60 times on \nabsolute filibusters we have had to invoke cloture and 30-some-odd \ntimes on just objecting to legislation going forward.\n  The other amendments the Republican leader has suggested are \namendments that are not related to this legislation, and there is wide \ndisagreement from Republicans and Democrats.\n\n[[Page S10794]]\n\nWhy do we need to do that? We don't need to. It is only an effort to \nslow things down. We are not going to agree to that. It is not \nnecessary.\n  Let's get these things done. We will move to something as quickly as \nwe get rid of this, and they can move the nongermane, nonrelevant \namendments on those, but let's get this done. I don't know when we can \ndo this legislation for the first-time home buyers. It has been a \ntremendous boon to real estate all over America today. Has it been a \nperfect program? Of course not. But the good part of the amendments--\ntwo amendments we are talking about--is they are fully paid for. It \ndoesn't run up the national debt by 10 cents--by nothing. Let's get \nthis done and then move on and start arguing about other things. There \nis nothing to argue about here. We are not going to go to those \namendments.\n  I had a caucus yesterday in which the Presiding Officer and a number \nof other Senators throughout the Chamber were there. We have done this \ntime after time, and quite frankly we are tired of it. It is not \nnecessary. There is no reason to have these amendments that are just \nrifleshots at trying to embarrass people, and these two amendments \ndon't embarrass anyone. They are good for the country. I hope we can \nget them done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/28/senate-section/article/S10794-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my good friend the majority leader used \nto say frequently when he was in the minority that the price of being \nin the majority in the Senate is you have to take votes in order to \nadvance bills in a smooth process.\n  My understanding is that we were within one amendment of reaching an \nagreement several days ago. I think we are not that far away from an \nagreement that would allow us to expedite consideration of the bill, \nmove it along, and be fair to the minority. I think everyone knows it \nis not uncommon in the Senate--in fact, it is routine--for there to be \namendments offered by both sides that are not directly related to the \nbill. So there is nothing extraordinary about this.\n  Let me repeat, we would be more than happy to enter into a short time \nagreement on the amendments we were discussing with the majority and \ntry to wrap up this bill at the earliest possible time, certainly \nearlier than we would wrap it up if we let all of this time run until \nafter midnight tonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/28/senate-section/article/S10794-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HEALTH CARE WEEK XV, DAY III\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, after months of hearing that Americans \ndon't want government-run health care, Democratic leaders in Washington \nhave made their decision: They are going to include it in their health \ncare bill whether Americans want it or not.\n  Supporters of the government-run plan say they are only advocating \none more option among many. What they don't say is that the option they \nare advocating would soon be the only option. The others would simply \nfade away.\n  It is not that hard to understand. Private health plans would fade \naway because a government-run plan would use the deep pockets of the \nFederal Government to set artificially low prices or absorb a loss, \nmaking it impossible for private plans to compete. Private plans would \neither become so expensive that only the very wealthy could afford them \nor they would go out of business altogether.\n  If you want to know what happens after that, just ask somebody who \nlives in a country that has already gone down the road of government-\nrun health care for all. What we have seen in those countries is what \nwe would see here: rationing, denials, and delay. In the United \nKingdom, for example, a government board sets guidelines on who gets to \nuse certain drugs and treatments. This means that even if a treatment \nis effective, it can be withheld from patients because of the amount of \nmoney it costs the government. This is what happens when government \ngets involved in the health care business.\n  A government plan won't come cheap either. We don't know all the \ndetails that Democratic leaders put into their bill behind closed \ndoors, but we do know it will cost over $1 trillion in the middle of a \nterrible recession. It will cost $1 trillion at a time of near 10 \npercent unemployment; $1 trillion just a few weeks after the Treasury \nDepartment said the administration ran up the largest annual deficit in \nU.S. history; $1 trillion at a moment when the U.S. Government is \nfinancing 9 out of 10 new mortgages and already owns most major U.S. \nautomakers, along with large parts of the finance and insurance \nindustries. It will cost $1 trillion at a time when government spending \naccounts for a bigger share of the national economy than at any time \nsince the Second World War. It will cost $1 trillion when Congress is \nabout to make a public admission that it can't handle its own finances \nby raising the debt ceiling.\n  Now is not the time for a $1 trillion experiment in government health \ncare. Now is the time to buckle down financially and to find \ncommonsense reforms in the area of health care that actually save \npeople money by driving down costs.\n  Americans asked for lower costs, and they didn't get it. What they \ngot instead was more government, more spending, more debt. This is why \nso many Americans feel as though they have been taken for a ride in \nthis debate, and it is also why a lot of our friends on the other side \nare concerned about the bill that is headed to the Senate floor. \nAmericans have issued their verdict. They have been clear. They have \nsaid that enough is enough--no government plan, no more debt, no more \ngovernment takeovers.\n  Democratic leaders may continue to insist on a bill that most \nAmericans oppose, but it is the wrong approach. A government-owned, \ngovernment-operated insurance plan was a bad idea before, and it is a \nbad idea now.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/28/senate-section/article/S10794-4", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, for the next hour, I will be joined on \nthis floor by my freshman colleagues as we talk with the American \npeople about the importance of health reform. We are committed to \nending the status quo. We have had enough of constituents being denied \ncoverage because of existing conditions. We are tired of skyrocketing \nhealth insurance premiums hurting small business. We have had it up to \nhere with the lack of choices and affordability in our States. So today \nmy colleagues and I will be talking about why health reform will work \nand how it is working already.\n  There are many pilot programs, State initiatives, and private \nprograms showing results right now. There are other very good ideas \npending in the health reform bills. Our general theme this morning is \ninnovation that works.\n  First, we will hear from the Senator from New Mexico, Tom Udall, who \nwill discuss how we must address the very real health care challenges \nfacing rural Americans. Senator Udall will share with us rural health \ninnovation that works.\n  I yield time to Senator Udall.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I seek recognition.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator\n\n[[Page S10795]]\n\nfrom Alaska for being down here and helping all of the freshman \nSenators work through these health care issues we have been discussing. \nWe have had Senator Warner play that role, I think, and several others. \nI think Senator Shaheen from New Hampshire has also done that. It is \nimportant to realize that all of us in the freshman class believe we \nneed health care reform. We have to have health care reform.\n  Last week, during our gathering of freshman Senators in this Chamber, \nI talked about how health care reform must benefit rural America.\n  As I explained then, rural Americans face unique challenges in \nfinding quality, affordable health care. And rural health care systems \nface increased strain due to doctor shortages and inefficient and \ninsufficient funding.\n  Successful reform hinges, in large part, on how we meet the \nchallenges of health care in rural America. But what many may not \nrealize is that rural America, precisely because of these challenges, \nhas become an incubator for the very innovation that will help us \nachieve our goal.\n  Rural America is trying to meet these health care challenges head-on \nwith innovative programs in communities across the country. In the \nprocess, they are offering a blueprint for the Nation as we work to \nenact reform that will benefit all Americans, no matter where they call \nhome.\n  In my home State, several innovative programs are already paying \ndividends. The two I wish to talk about today are the result of \npartnerships between our rural communities and one of our key academic \ninstitutions, the University of New Mexico, our big teaching hospital \nin New Mexico.\n  Academic health centers, such as the one at UNM, have the potential \nto be hubs of knowledge and expertise, not just for the communities \nwhere they are physically based but for the entire State.\n  UNM recognized this potential and reached out to partners in rural \nareas throughout New Mexico. They asked two basic but often overlooked \nquestions: What do you need? How can we help?\n  What emerged from these conversations was the development of a \nstatewide Health Extension Rural Office program. Through this program, \nwhich we call HERO for short, agents live and work in communities they \nserve, and they act as liaisons and resources to health partners in the \narea. We know this extension model for agriculture, and we are proving \nit can work for health services too.\n  Here is one example. In the frontier county of Hidalgo, in southwest \nNew Mexico, HERO agents discovered the community needed help recruiting \nlocal health professionals.\n  To meet that need, HERO helped establish a partnership between UNM \nand community providers to offer free local housing for UNM medical \nresidents during their regular rural rotation.\n  It was a win-win for everybody. Hidalgo County got increased access \nto doctors and other specialists. The doctors got free housing during \ntheir rural rotations. UNM increased its profile and reputation in \nHidalgo County. The communities got the opportunity to persuade these \nyoung doctors to continue their medical careers in that area.\n  That is just one example of HERO's work.\n  In addition to increasing the number of doctors in a community, HERO \nalso helps develop plans for addressing health issues such as diabetes \nand teen pregnancy, for retaining pharmacy services after a community \nloses its only pharmacist or for establishing a one-stop-shopping model \nfor medical, dental, behavioral health, and social services.\n  In addition to its work with the HERO project, UNM also is achieving \nbreakthroughs in the delivery of medical care through a project founded \nby one of its physicians, Dr. Sanjeev Arora. It is called Project ECHO, \nwhich is short for Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes.\n  Back in 2002, Dr. Arora was a physician specializing in hepatitis C. \nHe had become increasingly frustrated with the lack of treatment \noptions for the thousands of New Mexicans suffering from the disease.\n  Many of these patients lived in the States' rural and frontier areas. \nThere weren't enough specialists to treat them, and local providers \noften didn't have the expertise to provide treatment themselves.\n  What Dr. Arora did was establish what he calls a one-to-many \nknowledge network, which includes a specialist and up to 40 rural \nproviders. The doctors meet by videoconference to co-manage patients \nand to eventually teach these rural medical professionals to be \nminispecialists themselves.\n  Over the years, what began as a program designed to treat hepatitis C \npatients has grown and expanded. Today, it includes more than a dozen \nknowledge networks and telehealth clinics on a wide variety of \nspecialties, including HIV, diabetes, pediatric obesity, and \npsychotherapy.\n  In closing, I believe these two programs, along with the other \ninitiatives discussed by my freshman colleagues today, are strong \nreminders that American innovation doesn't always begin in the Halls of \nCongress or down the street on Pennsylvania Avenue.\n  Historically, the greatest American innovation is a grassroots \nphenomenon, bubbling up from individuals and communities across \nAmerica, from enterprising folks who recognize a problem and work \ntogether to develop a solution that best meets their needs.\n  This health care reform remains a work in progress. It is our job as \nlegislators to seek out programs such as HERO or Project ECHO, to seek \nout these best practices, to find programs that work, and to expand \nthat knowledge and ingenuity for the benefit of all Americans.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Udall for his comments \nabout ECHO and HERO. It shows what is happening at the grassroots \nlevel. We are for innovation that works and brings quality of care, \nlowers the cost, and getting better delivery of the services out there. \nI thank the Senator for bringing those examples of what is working in \nhis own State to the American people and stating what we are for in \nthis process.\n  Next, my colleague from Illinois will join us, Senator Burris, who \nwill discuss the important competition in the health care reform debate \nand how it can improve innovation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I thank my colleagues. I join my \ncolleagues this morning to speak out on this very important issue.\n  I am proud to join my freshman colleagues on the floor once again. \nAnd I am glad to be talking about the innovation that will come with \nmeaningful health care reform.\n  I agree with the points my colleagues have raised on this issue. \nHealth reform will certainly spark employer innovation, to the great \nbenefit of the American consumer. And that is a good reason to support \nreform. But few people are talking about the kind of innovation that \nwill come about only if we include a public option in our reform \npackage.\n  So that is what I would like to discuss today.\n  A public option means competition in the private market. As any \nbusinessman will tell you, competition breeds innovation. But this is \nespecially true of the competition we can expect with a public option. \nThat is because a public plan will not only encourage reform and \ninnovation in private companies--it will actually step up and take the \nlead, just as Medicare has done in the past.\n  In fact, a recent study shows that many private companies have \nadopted the innovations, such as improved payment methods and rigorous \nreviews of technology and treatment, that were developed under the \nMedicare system.\n  That speaks volumes about the potential for innovation under a new \nplan that has the broad base, accountability, and transparency that \nonly a public option could provide.\n  The public option would be in a position to test and implement \nmeaningful changes to the way health coverage works. These innovations \nwill help to streamline the health care system, save money, and reduce \nthe administrative costs that have run rampant among private insurance \nproviders.\n  The public sector will lead the way, and private companies will adopt \ntheir innovations. We have already seen this with Medicare--and with a \nbroader\n\n[[Page S10796]]\n\npublic option, this trend is bound to increase. That is because, \nwithout competition, private corporations simply don't have any \nincentive to innovate.\n  There is no reason to spend money on research when you have a virtual \nmonopoly over the insurance market. There is no reason to develop new \nways to improve coverage when you can increase premiums at will without \nincurring much risk.\n  Certainly, private companies specialize in finding innovative ways to \ndeny people's coverage--but that is the only kind of innovation we're \nlikely to see from them. And I think America has had enough of that.\n  A public plan would be entirely different. The recent study indicates \nthat a public option would be at the forefront of improving coverage, \nthrough innovations such as:\n\n     pioneering technologies and inventive treatments, improving \n     efficiency, expanding access, lowering costs, evaluating the \n     quality of care to help payers and purchasers get maximum \n     value, coordinating care for those with chronic illnesses, \n     and finding better ways to reward high-quality primary care \n     providers.\n\n  These are only a few of the innovations we could hope to see with a \npublic option. And all of these developments would be shared with the \nprivate sector. This would help reduce costs, restore accountability, \nand improve health outcomes for every American.\n  Mr. President, that is why we need the competition and innovation \nthat only a public option can provide. It is time to lower the cost of \nhealth coverage. It is time to restore accountability to the system. It \nis time to make sure every American has access to quality, affordable \nhealth care.\n  A public option will spur new innovations that will help us get \nthere.\n  That is why I will not back any insurance plan that does not carry \nwith it this major issue of a public option.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Burris for his comments. \nThe words he uses--``rewards quality, innovation, reduced costs, \naccountability, and competition''--are what we stand for. The other \nside does not. By the comments the Senator has laid out, he has \ndetailed his views and what competition can do in controlling the \ncosts.\n  Next is Senator Shaheen, who will join us to discuss three health \ncare innovations in her State of New Hampshire. She will share the \nsuccess of the Center for Informed Choice, the medical home pilot and \ncommunity partnership for improved public health.\n  I yield to Senator Shaheen.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to, once again, join my \nfreshman Democratic colleagues to make the case for health care reform. \nI wish to recognize and thank Senator Begich for his leadership and \ncoordination of this effort this morning.\n  Today, as you have heard, I will discuss three exciting initiatives \nin New Hampshire that are transforming our health care system. These \ninnovative ideas are shaping the debate and are changing the way we \nthink about health care. They are revolutionizing how we deliver \nnecessary health care services, and they are transforming our payment \nmechanisms. Most importantly, these initiatives go to the heart of this \ndebate. They focus on the needs of patients, they make the system more \nefficient, and they use our dollars more wisely.\n  The Center for Informed Choice at the Dartmouth Institute for Health \nPolicy and Clinical Practice is dedicated to one simple idea: that \npatients deserve to be equal partners in making choices about their \nhealth care.\n  We know when patients and their families have good information about \nprocedures, treatments, and therapies, they make good decisions. The \nresearchers at Dartmouth found that 40 percent of the time, patients \nwho are fully involved in the decisionmaking process during the course \nof their medical care choose the less invasive and lower cost medical \nprocedures. Forty percent of the time, patients choose the less \ninvasive, lower cost procedures.\n  More importantly, their research shows these patients have better \nclinical outcomes and higher rates of satisfaction as the result of \ntheir treatment. The providers at Dartmouth put this research into \npractice. They recognized it can be hard to decide whether to have \nsurgery, to have a test, or to continue with a treatment. So they offer \npatients a variety of resources to help. Patients can talk to a \ncounselor. They can do research in the library or talk to medical \nprofessionals. They can find out all their treatment options. They can \nlearn what other people have done and fully understand recovery time \nand the impact on their quality of life. And they can do all of this \nonline.\n  I have been to the center. It is very impressive what they do. Soon \nthis information is going to be available to the public online.\n  Armed with information, these patients become empowered and equal \npartners in their health care. This is the direction that health care \nreform must take.\n  Another exciting initiative in New Hampshire is our medical home \npilot program. With close to 40,000 patients involved, the medical home \nis changing the way health care is delivered in New Hampshire. You see, \na medical home is about collaboration. It is about a team of health \nprofessionals who are working together to provide individualized care \nfor each patient.\n  In New Hampshire, our medical home pilot has integrated the use of \nelectronic medical records that import hospital, radiology, and \nlaboratory tests directly into the patient's record. New Hampshire \nmedical home model offers two important services to patients, including \nsame-day scheduling and secure e-mail communications with their \ndoctors. Unquestionably, the pilot is changing the way health care is \ndelivered in New Hampshire.\n  My third initiative I wish to talk about deals with changes that are \nhappening at the local level to improve health in New Hampshire. In the \nwestern part of New Hampshire is a small city called Keene that has set \nits goal on becoming the healthiest community in America by 2020. So \nfor all my freshman colleagues, they have to share this with the cities \nin their States and let them know we plan to be first in Keene, NH.\n  The citizens of Keene took a look at the data and found out that our \nState's leading cause of death is heart disease related to tobacco use, \npoor diet, and physical inactivity. The folks in Keene realized that we \nspend a disproportionately high amount of money on our medical costs \ninstead of focusing on prevention and wellness.\n  The citizens of Keene took action. Led by a local hospital, Keene \nestablished a coalition of partners from all sectors of the community, \nincluding education, private business, nonprofit organizations, and \nmunicipal and State government. This coalition, which is called Keene \nVision 2020, has made it a priority to engage citizens in healthy \nlifestyles. They have sponsored educational briefings, screenings, \nhealth clinics, health fairs, and Keene's Vision 2020 promotes the \nlocal farmer's market, and it has established a local walking group. \nAll of this is done with one goal in mind: to be healthy.\n  I have no doubt that Keene will be a healthier community in 2020, and \nI have no doubt that the preventive measures in which citizens have \nbecome engaged will lower our health care costs well into the future. \nWe should all applaud and encourage this sort of community-wide \ncommitment to prevention and wellness and to public health.\n  This is an exciting time. Congress is closer than ever before to \npassing comprehensive health reform. Time and time again we have heard \nwe cannot continue on the present trajectory. I am pleased to point out \nthese exciting initiatives underway in New Hampshire that demonstrate \nwe can improve the quality of care and lower our health care costs.\n  I yield back to Senator Begich.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New Hampshire \nagain for addressing innovative health care, to reward quality, create \ninnovation, reduce costs and making sure we are accountable for our \nactions in regard to health care. This is what this side of the aisle \nis for--innovation and new ideas to bring some competitiveness to the \nprocess and lowering the cost of health care.\n  Next, we will hear from Senator Merkley of Oregon. My fellow freshman \njoins us to discuss how critical it\n\n[[Page S10797]]\n\nis for the Senate to act now on health care reform because the cost of \ninaction is too great.\n  I yield time to Senator Merkley.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Begich.\n  My colleagues have been pointing out the importance of innovation. \nSenator Burris addressed how competition and the public option would \nincrease innovation. Senator Shaheen just noted some of the models and \nefforts in her State. We need to share the insights of that throughout \nthis Nation so we can take the best practices to produce the best \nquality results in every corner of our Nation.\n  I rise to speak about a different aspect of innovation; specifically, \nthat in order for our citizens to benefit from this innovation, health \ncare needs to be affordable. Currently, health care is on a road to \nunaffordability and inaccessibility. If we do not pass health care \nreform, costs will eat up a bigger and bigger share of the gross \ndomestic product and our families' budgets.\n  More families will lose their insurance because they simply cannot \nafford it. Many other families will be forced into personal bankruptcy \nas medical bills spiral out of control. And, much worse, some Americans \nwill die because of inadequate or delayed care. We cannot continue on \nthis path.\n  First, health care has become increasingly unaffordable and will only \nget worse. This is true whether we look at it through a macroeconomic \nperspective, the family perspective, or the small business perspective. \nLooking at the economy as a whole, in 2008, health care spending in the \nUnited States reached $2.4 trillion. It is projected to reach $3.1 \ntrillion by 2012, and if it continues in that fashion, it will reach \n$4.3 trillion by 2016. Add up those 10 years and what we find is we \nwill be spending $30 trillion to $40 trillion for health care in just a \n10-year period.\n  If we frame this through the family perspective, the cost increases \nare felt all over the Nation through double-digit annual increases in \npremiums. Workers are paying $1,600 more in premiums annually for \nfamily coverage now than they did 10 years ago. To put it differently, \nfor many families, the cost has doubled over the last 8 years, and the \ncost will double again over the next 8 or 10 years. The result is that \nfamilies who could afford health care a few years ago cannot afford it \ntoday, and many who can barely afford it today will not be able to \nafford it tomorrow.\n  Our small businesses feel the pain as well. At the Hawthorne Auto \nClinic in Portland, the cost of premiums has gone from 9 percent of the \npayroll to 18 percent of the payroll in the last 5 years. That is a \nhuge amount of money diverted from hiring more staff or increasing \nwages for the staff or from investing in more capital equipment. These \ncosts are hurting our families and damaging our small businesses.\n  Second, as costs go up, more and more Americans will lose coverage. \nWe are used to hearing there are 45 million Americans uninsured. But a \nrecent study from the University of North Carolina estimates that 6 \nmillion Americans have been added to the ranks of the uninsured since \n2007--6 million more uninsured since 2007--putting the number of \nAmericans uninsured at 51 million to 52 million.\n  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, more than 80 percent of \nthe uninsured are from working families. Members of the family have \njobs.\n  Take Karen Jeffrey from Ashland, OR. When she moved to Oregon from \nHawaii, she tried to buy new insurance. Because she had suffered from a \nbroken hip and a bout of cancer 15 years earlier, she could not find \naffordable coverage. So Karen is simply waiting until she can qualify \nfor Medicare at age 65. If a medical emergency strikes before that \narrives, that medical incident will be devastating. If we do not act \nnow, rising health care costs will cause financial ruin for millions of \nfamilies.\n\n  A recent study in the American Journal of Medicine found that 62 \npercent of all bankruptcies filed in 2007 were from medical expenses. \nOf those who filed for bankruptcy due to medical problems, about three-\nfourths had health insurance. Even with insurance, many Americans are \nunderinsured and devastated by a medical emergency. The impact of these \nbankruptcies reverberates throughout our families, throughout our \neconomy. Every year 1.5 million families lose their home to foreclosure \nas a result of unaffordable medical costs.\n  We also know families pay with their lives. In September, a Harvard \nMedical School study showed that 45,000 people die in the United States \neach year, 1 every 12 minutes, because of a lack of health insurance \nand cannot get good care--45,000 Americans each year. That is more than \nthe number of Americans who died in the Revolutionary War. It is \nroughly equal to the number of our soldiers who died in combat in \nVietnam over a 16-year period. It is the equivalent of 30 Titanics \nsinking every year--Americans dying because of unaffordable health \ncare.\n  We need health care reform that drives innovation. We have a \ntremendous number of models around the States to promote and improve, \nbut we need to make health care affordable in order to get that \ninnovation into the hands and benefits of our citizens. That is why we \nmust proceed with health care reform now. There is no time to waste.\n  Mr. President, I thank Senator Begich for moderating this discussion \nand putting in the spotlight the role and importance of innovation.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I was here at the opening of the session, \nand I heard the Republican leader say--and I agree with his actual \ncomment--that the American people have been taken for a ride. The \nSenator from Oregon just described the ride--the ride right over the \ncliff of cost of insurance that is no longer affordable, with 45,000 \npeople who die every year because of their inability to access \naffordable health care. The Republican leader is right, the American \npeople have been taken for a ride--a ride over the cliff.\n  What we are showing today is innovation, new ideas, new approaches \nthat bring quality, affordable health care to millions of Americans and \nthe 45,000 Senator Merkley talked about who die each year because of \nlack of health care.\n  I thank the Senator from Oregon for reminding us of those statistics \nand making sure we do not forget what we are here to do.\n  Next, I am pleased to hear from Senator Kirk. The Senator from \nMassachusetts joins us to discuss the Community Living Assistance \nServices and Support Act, or the CLASS Act. Yesterday, the Senator made \nhis first speech on the floor of the Senate. It was enjoyable, \nexciting, and very to the point when it came to health care.\n  Today I look forward again to his comments regarding health care, \nespecially the CLASS Act. I yield time to Senator Kirk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Massachusetts is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I thank Senator Begich for his leadership \nthis morning on important issues that are concerning the American \npeople. I thank the Senator from Alaska and my other colleagues in the \nfreshman class for advancing the important measures that the American \npeople are anxious to see enacted to improve their health security \nfuture and their economic future as well. I also thank my colleagues \nfor their kindness and courtesies in welcoming me to the Senate and to \nbe a part of this impressive and distinguished team as we do what is \nour responsibility for the American people.\n  This morning I wish to address a legislative initiative that will \nassist our senior or infirm citizens as part of our health care reform \ninitiative.\n  Today in the United States, there are approximately 200 million \npeople who are elderly or disabled. These individuals are some of our \nmost vulnerable and often they are forgotten. But they always had a \nfriend and advocate in Senator Ted Kennedy. He was the premier \nlegislative innovator.\n\n  Senator Kennedy understood the current system is not working; that it \ncried out for innovation. He knew it was wrong that in order for \nindividuals with disabilities and the elderly to receive the services \nand support they needed, they had to stop working, spend down their \nsavings, abandon their dreams, abandon their homes, and possibly go \ninto a permanent facility--all the wrong incentives for individuals who \ndeserve dignity in those fragile years. All this, he felt, was directly \ncontrary to our idea of living the American dream.\n\n[[Page S10798]]\n\n  Senator Kennedy was not one to sit idly by. He acted. He acted to try \nto help as many of these men and women as possible. The Community \nLiving Assistance Services and Supports Act--known as the CLASS Act--\nwas at the heart of his efforts to help people with functional \nlimitations and their families obtain the services and support they \nneeded in order to keep their independence and continue as active \nmembers of their communities. I am honored to take up that worthy \ncause.\n  Here is how the CLASS Act will help the middle class. Under the act, \na worker in Massachusetts or any other State can choose to pay into a \nvoluntary insurance program through affordable payroll deductions. \nAfter 5 years of those deductions, they would be eligible for a daily \ncash benefit of $50 if they became disabled. That money can make a huge \ndifference in allowing a disabled person to live with independence and \nwith dignity. For example, it can pay for having a ramp installed in \ntheir home or pay for needed transportation or purchase a computer to \nwork from home and remain self-sufficient.\n  Some have said this innovation is unsustainable; that it is just \nanother government benefit that will become unaffordable in the years \nto come. But the Congressional Budget Office and other independent \nauditing agencies estimate the CLASS Act will be able to maintain its \nsolvency for 75 years. The plan is self-funded and is a cost saver for \nMedicaid since fewer people would need to push themselves into poverty \nin order to enroll in Medicaid and receive the care they need. The \nCLASS Act will correct that disincentive.\n  The CLASS Act is a realistic answer to the serious problems of our \ncurrent system and it is important to the lives of millions of \nAmericans. Disability could suddenly strike any of us in the years \nahead. As we work to provide health insurance to the tens of millions \nof Americans who do not have it, it is hard to understand why we should \nnot meet the needs of millions of people with disabilities and the \nelderly who desperately need our help.\n  I hope very much that our colleagues will support the CLASS Act as an \ninnovative and necessary part of the current health reform bill, and I \nlook forward to further opportunities to advance this measure, and \nultimately as a part of the needed health reform bill that is coming to \nthe floor that will help and serve the American people through its \nultimate enactment.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Kirk for describing the \nCLASS Act, an important program for long-term care, and the legacy of \nSenator Kennedy and his work regarding that innovation.\n  At this time, we will hear from my colleague from North Carolina, \nSenator Hagan, who will discuss how wellness programs are a key \ncomponent of comprehensive health care reform and how they have an \nimpact on long-term outcomes for American citizens.\n  Senator Hagan.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I am joining my colleagues on the floor \ntoday to discuss how health care reform will support innovative private \nsector programs that will save taxpayers money and make our Nation \nhealthier in the long run. I wish to take this opportunity to discuss \ngroundbreaking work at SAS, a software company based in Cary, NC.\n  Since 1985, SAS has established itself as a global leader in \nemployer-sponsored wellness programs. Although SAS provides health \ninsurance for its employees, almost 90 percent of their families use \nthe company's on-site health care center, and more than 50 percent, \nincluding the company's CEO, use the health care center as their \nprimary care provider.\n  SAS started providing wellness programs to its employees because the \ncompany realized the value of having healthy employees--they are more \nproductive, they are more loyal--which translates into low employee \nturnover and reduced recruitment and retention costs. Disease \nprevention and wellness also translate into lower health care costs for \nthe company as employees take better care of themselves.\n  Recently, one SAS employee--a man in his 30s--was told he had early \nsigns of Type 2 diabetes. Through their diabetes self-management \nprogram and other onsite SAS resources, this man was able to make real \nchanges in his lifestyle, eating habits, weight and exercise, and now \nhe no longer meets the diagnostic parameters for diabetes.\n  I also recently visited Lenoir Memorial Hospital in Kinston, NC, \nwhere this hospital provides their employees and members of this \ncommunity with access to a gym and a wellness program. More than 40 \npercent of the hospital's employees participate because of incentives \nthe hospital provides for basic preventive screenings. People who don't \nwork at the hospital--people in the community--can pay a low monthly \nfee to use the gym, including its indoor and outdoor track, weights, \nand yoga classes. Many of the people who use the facility are middle-\naged and older. Health care staff monitor the facility and help create \na comfortable and safe environment for everyone who comes to exercise. \nThis opportunity is a benefit to the entire community.\n  Two weeks ago, I visited the showroom of the North Carolina furniture \nmanufacturers Mitchell Gold and Bob Williams. This company currently \nemploys 550 North Carolinians, and for the past 10 years the company \nhas provided their employees with a free annual health fair, where \nemployees can receive preventive exams at no cost. This spring, more \nthan 200 women received free mammograms from a mobile unit that came to \nthe plant. The company recently started a part-time, onsite medical \nclinic to address their employees' medical needs.\n  Companies such as SAS, Lenoir Memorial Hospital, and Mitchell Gold \nand Bob Williams reap tremendous economic benefits from their \ninvestments in these wellness programs. In 2008 alone, SAS saved more \nthan $5 million in productivity and insurance costs as a result of its \nonsite health care center.\n  Businesses across our country can improve worker productivity and \nsave money by encouraging their employees to adopt healthier \nlifestyles. Obesity, chronic heart disease, and diabetes continue to \nrise in America at a significant cost to our health care system. The \ntime to be innovative is now.\n  In the health care reform bill, we are building on these successful \nwellness programs and encouraging all employers to invest in the health \nand well-being of their employees. Specifically, in the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee bill, employers can offer their \nemployees who participate in a wellness program a discount of up to 30 \npercent in their health insurance premiums. Currently, the average \nemployee insurance premium is $250 a month, or $3,000 a year. This 30-\npercent discount would mean a savings of $900 per year to that \nemployee.\n  Expanding employer wellness programs will bring the cost of health \ncare down and will make America a healthier nation.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank Senator Hagan for once again showing this morning \nanother innovative approach to reducing health care costs for Americans \ntoday and into the future; and how wellness and prevention are critical \nfor the long-term benefits of the American people in reducing health \ncare costs--not by just a small amount but significant amounts, as she \nlaid out.\n  Next we will hear from our colleague from Colorado, Senator Bennet, \nwho joins us to discuss how innovation and patient-centered care can \nimprove our health care system.\n  I yield time to Senator Bennet.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska for \norganizing this presentation this morning. It is a pleasure to be here \nwith my freshman colleagues to talk about health care reform in this \ncountry, something that is long overdue if we are going to end the \ndouble-digit cost increases our working families face every year and if \nwe are to see small businesses continue to grow and thrive in this \ncountry and lead us out of the recession we are in.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, in our State we have suffered a lot \nfrom a health care system that doesn't work.\n\n[[Page S10799]]\n\nWe see more and more of our families losing their insurance and fewer \nand fewer of our employers able to offer insurance, which is something \nthey want to do for their employees. So it is high time for us to get \nthese costs under control, and that will take innovation. In our State, \nwe haven't waited on Washington. There are great examples of Coloradans \nwho have pulled together to deliver high-quality health care at a lower \ncost.\n  A great example of what I am talking about is in Mesa County where \nGrand Junction is located. They have instituted what they call \ntransitional care, where they have reduced the readmission rates at the \nhospital to about 2 percent. The national average is roughly 20 \npercent. One out of every five Medicare patients who is released from \nthe hospital winds up in the hospital in the same month they were \nreleased. There are a lot of reasons for that. Those of us who have \nsmall children or are caring for parents know how many times we have to \ntell the same story over and over as we make our way from one doctor's \noffice to the next. Many people forget to fill out their prescriptions \nor they do not have the kind of instructions they need to be able to \ntake responsibility for their own care. In Mesa County they have solved \nthat problem by creating a transitional model that makes sure when \npatients leave the hospital they do so with a coach--a coach who helps \nthem go from the emergency room to their primary care physician and \ntheir mental health provider to get the care they need over a period of \ntime.\n  I was very pleased that Chairman Baucus included in the Finance \nCommittee version of this health care reform legislation the piece I \nwrote based on the work in Grand Junction that will compensate--\nreimburse--providers who set up a model such as the one in Mesa County \nthat actually saves money. That is truly what this is all about--this \ntortuous path we have been on to try to get health care reform done--to \nhave a very excellent end point which makes sure we are reducing the \ncost to our working families and, at the same time, increasing quality; \nthat we are making sure we are not devoting a fifth of our gross \ndomestic product to health care when every other industrialized country \nin the world, with whom we are competing, is devoting less than half \nthat to health care.\n  There are probably a lot of details in this legislation that still \nneed to be worked out, and I am sure there is room for improvement--\nthere is always room for improvement--but the American people cannot go \nthrough one more decade like the last decade of having poorer and \npoorer coverage at a higher and higher cost. That is not the way our \nsystem should work. We can do better than that as Americans. We have \nshown we can do better than that in Colorado, in our State, and I am so \npleased there are going to be communities all over the country that \nwill have the opportunity to learn from each other and provide better \ntransitional care for patients and more patient-centered care as we \nmove through this health care debate.\n  I thank the Senator from Alaska for organizing this, and I yield the \nfloor to him.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado for \ntalking about the importance of why we need to do this but also \nreminding us of the small business component of all this and how \nimportant it is not only for the individual policyholder but the small \nbusiness that is struggling every single day.\n  I thank him for reminding us, and I will now make my comments, and \ntalk a little about what people have said today but also to hopefully \nblunt a few of the myths.\n  I want to thank my freshman colleagues who have spoken this morning. \nIt is truly wonderful to hear the many different ideas, innovative \nreforms that are already working, and about the new proposals that will \nhelp us achieve the overall goal of reform: Tens of millions more \nAmericans covered, with access to more choices and premiums that \nindividuals and small businesses can afford.\n\n  In these final few moments of my time, I want to preempt what may \ncome on the floor from the other side of the aisle later today, from \nthose who will have listened to these presentations about innovation \nand excellence. They are likely to respond the way they have always \nresponded to reform ideas--by just saying no.\n  The bill is still being written, but we have already seen the tactics \nof the other side. They say this is a purely partisan exercise and that \nthe Democrats are not listening to Republicans. They bring a big, \nthick, mock bill to the floor and say it is too big and we will never \nread it. They say the bills need to be on the Internet or democracy is \nsomehow in jeopardy.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues on the other side, the \nRepublicans, I beg to differ. For starters, I brought my prop--actually \nit is not a prop; it is the real deal. What I am holding are the actual \nRepublican amendments that were accepted to the HELP bill; 161 \namendments, 300 pages of the bill--almost a third came from them. This \nis the stack that doesn't even include the additional Republican \namendments accepted in the Finance Committee. These are not proposed \namendments; these are the Republican amendments that were accepted and \nreported out of the HELP Committee.\n  I have two questions. First, are the critics of health reform saying \nthat the size of the eventual bill really matters, that the Senate \nleadership somehow should be embarrassed because a major piece of \nlegislation that will affect one-sixth of our entire economy is not \noffered in some big-type Cliff Notes? We are already hearing that. By \nthe way, all the bills have already been on the Internet for weeks, in \nsome cases for months. The merged Senate version will be on the \nInternet and so will the final bill from the conference committee after \nthe House and Senate work out their differences.\n  My second question is this: I wonder how many of my colleagues across \nthe aisle have actually read these Republican amendments, because there \nare some very good ideas. I know the Republicans are quick to say the \ncommittee only accepted technical amendments, but that doesn't appear \nto be true for all cases.\n  An amendment by Senator Burr says the HELP Committee's community \nhealth insurance option must follow State insurance regulation. This is \nnot trivial. It refers to important matters such as solvency, consumer \nprotection, and much more. The amendment helps to ensure a level \nplaying field between the public option and all the other health plans \nin each State's insurance market. That is hardly technical.\n  The bipartisan amendment supported by Senators Gregg and Enzi and \nAlexander allows employers to give bigger incentives to employees who \nparticipate in workplace wellness programs, which I think is a great \nidea. It is something I implemented when I was the mayor of Anchorage, \nAK.\n  My own Alaska colleague, Senator Murkowski, had other good ideas to \nadd to the HELP bill, including improving student loan repayments to \nhelp medical professionals who agree to work in medically underserved \nareas--another very good idea.\n  I hope my point is clear. There is a lot to be done by all of us, and \nthere has already been good work by Members on both sides of the aisle. \nSo let's talk about the merits of health reform, let's debate the \npolicy, and let's lay out our legitimate differences and then work \ntogether on solutions.\n  My freshman colleagues have described it well over the past hour. \nWhen it comes to reform, there are many examples of excellence already \nunderway. We need to support such innovation, expand it, and make it \npart of a nationwide effort to give all Americans access to health \ninsurance and basic medical care. There is still time for all of us to \nwork together. We need health reform now, and we know it will work.\n  I yield time at this point to the Senator from Colorado, Mark Udall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alaska \nfor convening the important discussion we have had here this morning. \nAs you have heard and we have all heard over the last hour, my \ncolleagues and I agree that the point of health care reform is to bring \naffordable, quality health care to all Americans. The bill\n\n[[Page S10800]]\n\nwe will debate here on the floor in the coming weeks will include \nimportant insurance reforms to make that a reality.\n  I want to ask you though, Mr. President, and everybody watching, will \nwe have succeeded in our mission if we merely put an insurance card in \nevery American's pocket? Comprehensive health care reform needs to be \nabout a lot more than that. We have heard about the difficult fiscal \nchallenges that await us if we do nothing. Putting our economy on a \nsustainable path for the future means we have to address this \nunsustainable growth in health care spending that you so eloquently \naddressed earlier in your remarks.\n  One of the best ways we can do that is by preventing illness in the \nfirst place. The good news is that many communities and providers all \nover the country are doing just that. We can recognize their innovative \nsuccesses and incentivize others to follow in this reform package. If \nwe do that, we will have a big impact on patient health as well as on \nthe Nation's bottom line.\n  I wish to talk about a program in Colorado that has been getting \nresults. The Northwest Colorado Visiting Nurse Association, which has \nbeen working with the Department of Public Health, local physicians, \nand others, operates the Aging Well program. It focuses on prevention, \nand it connects rural Coloradans over age 50 with services and \ninformation to help them remain active, healthy, in their homes, and \nout of the hospital. Patients receive health screenings, exercise \nclasses, and courses on managing conditions such as arthritis or \nchronic pain. Aging Well has been a great success. Listen to these \nnumbers from a recent survey: 98 percent of participants reported \nimproved fitness, 60 percent visited their doctor less often, and 18 \npercent reduced their medication needs. This saves dollars and improves \nlives.\n  Health insurance reform legislation includes funding to start similar \nprograms aimed at keeping those just shy of their Medicare years--I \nhave to confess, like me--active and healthy. The goal is to allow \nAmericans to avoid spending their golden years worrying about illnesses \nthat could have been prevented in the first place. To complement these \nprograms, additional grants would give these organizations the tools to \npromote healthy living for all ages, reduce obesity, tobacco use, and \nmental illness.\n  Health reform would also require insurers to provide full coverage \nfor preventive services at no cost to enrollees. That is music to the \nears of any American who has skipped a recommended mammogram or an \nannual physical exam because the cost was too great.\n  Let me talk about children as well. There are grants in our health \nreform package for school-based health clinics so that children who \nlack easy access to a doctor can get preventive care right at school. \nThese clinics have been shown to save $2 for every $1 they spend. This \nresults in fewer emergency room visits and hospital visits, and we \ndeliver health care before problems become more serious.\n  Let me turn back to adults in the workplace. Reform would bring \nwellness programs to the workplace by providing grants for employers. \nCompanies that have implemented wellness programs have already seen big \nsavings. PepsiCo is one such company. They offer onsite screenings, \nprograms to help employees lose weight, exercise incentives, and other \nmeasures. As a result, they have saved nearly $120 per participating \nemployee per month, which has resulted in a 2-year savings of over $22 \nmillion. Even better than the dollars involved here, participants \ndemonstrated lower health risks and better health outcomes. This is one \nmore way reform will pave the way and provide incentives for more \ncompanies to follow suit for their employees.\n  Reform is also a great deal for seniors. For the first time, Medicare \nwill pay for annual wellness visits. Reform would create incentives for \nMedicare patients who alter their behavior in order to lower their \nblood pressure and better control their diabetes. Medicare will cover \nrecommended preventive services now, which is at no additional cost to \nseniors. In sum, contrary to what we have heard from some on the other \nside, Medicare benefits will be improved by the reform that is being \nproposed.\n  Let me conclude by pointing out that this legislation makes the wise \nchoice of building on our wellness efforts that are already working. We \nknow preventive care enables doctors and other health care providers to \ndetect diseases earlier, when treatment is the most effective, averting \nmore serious and costly problems later on. But it also empowers each \nand every one of us to take charge of improving the quality of our \nlives, and when done correctly it is a crucial component of efficiently \nand responsibly addressing health care spending.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I thank Senator Udall for once again \npointing out how prevention and wellness works and how some real hard \ndollars make a difference in health care. As I close, I again thank my \ncolleagues, the freshmen, for once again coming this week and making \nour point clear on innovation and the impact it will have on bringing \naccountability and a better product for the consumer, ensuring that we \nreduce costs through innovation.\n  I heard this morning some one-liners from the other side that say \n``rationing, delay, deny'' is what we are all about over here. \nAbsolutely wrong. What we are about is ensuring that the current \nrationing going on by insurance companies, the delay by insurance \ncompanies, and the denials by insurance companies stop so our consumers \nhave good-quality, long-term health care.\n  As I said earlier when the Senator from Oregon was talking, I heard \nagain this morning that the American people were being taken for a \nride. My comment was that I agree with the other side; they are--right \nover the cliff. It is time to take action and have health care reform.\n  Is it a perfect bill when we are all here on the floor at some point \ndiscussing it? It may not be. But is it better than where we are today? \nAbsolutely, because today is literally taking the American people right \nover the cliff. So it is in the best interests of the American people \nto move forward and create a better system that is more accountable \nwith better quality.\n  I appreciate my freshman colleagues for standing up today and laying \nout new, innovative approaches that are working across this country.\n  I yield my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask to be recognized as in morning business for 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/28/senate-section/article/S10800-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10800-S10805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, one of the first rules in health care that \ndoctors learn and health care providers learn is to do no harm. So, as \nwe move down the road of this health reform effort, I think we ought to \nhave that as our watchword also. The health reform effort which we \npursue should do no harm to a lot of the elements of our health care \nsystem which are doing pretty well.\n  For example, there are a large number of Americans who get health \ninsurance from the private sector--about 170 or 180 million--who are \nquite happy with their health care. They may have concerns with their \ninsurance companies, legitimately, but they think their health care is \npretty good. In fact, American health care is excellent.\n  As we move down this road toward health reform, we should not harm \nthose folks. We should not push them into a public plan by creating a \nsystem which basically disincentivizes their employers to give them \nhealth care, incentivizes employers to pay a penalty rather than pay a \nhealth care premium, and moves people over to what are called health \nexchanges in a public plan. But that is exactly what the bill did as it \nleft the HELP Committee, and who knows what it is going to do when it \ncomes out of the secret room where it is being written right now, but I \nwouldn't be surprised if that is exactly what it does when it returns \nfrom this secret room. That will be harmful--harmful to all Americans \nwho have health insurance and like what they have. They like the \ndoctors they see, and they don't want to have the Federal Government \nbasically supplying their health care and putting them\n\n[[Page S10801]]\n\nunder a bureaucracy where the Federal Government stands between them \nand their doctors.\n  There are also a lot of senior citizens in this country today who are \non something called Medicare Advantage. They find this to be an \nexcellent Medicare Program. It gives them a lot of options they don't \nhave under traditional Medicare, and they like it.\n  Under the Finance Committee plan, Medicare Advantage would have been \neviscerated. Most Americans who get Medicare Advantage would lose it--\nthat simple--because the Finance Committee is anticipating a $400 \nbillion reduction in Medicare spending, with the vast majority of \nthat--or the majority of that coming out of the Medicare Advantage \nprogram, essentially eliminating Medicare Advantage as an option. \nPeople who are on Medicare Advantage would be pushed back into \ntraditional Medicare. I don't think they are going to be very happy \nwith that. That does them harm. That should not happen.\n  As part of the ``do no harm'' we should be pursuing in health care, \nwe should not cut Medicare in order to fund a brandnew entitlement for \npeople who are younger and who are not on Medicare, for the most part--\nwho obviously are not on Medicare--and cause people who are on Medicare \nand who are quite comfortable with what they are getting under \nMedicare, specifically Medicare Advantage, to lose that option in order \nto fund a brandnew entitlement with $400 billion in Medicare cuts.\n  In the new ``do no harm'' issue, there is the issue of innovation. \nInnovation is one of the great advantages our health care system has. \nYou do not see innovation in England, of any significance, where they \nhave a nationalized system. You do not see innovation in Canada, where \nthey have a nationalized system, because innovation takes investment. \nTo bring a new drug to the market requires 12 years and almost $1 \nbillion. Someone has to put up that billion dollars. Somebody has to be \nwilling to take a risk with their money, that they are willing to \ninvest in this very chancy undertaking of trying to bring a new drug to \nthe market, a new drug which will help millions of Americans, \npotentially.\n  But it takes money and it takes a willingness to invest in that type \nof research. Money follows return. If you set up a government-run \nprogram--which, inevitably, in order to reduce costs has to control \nprices--you reduce returns. It is absolutely guaranteed that if this \ncountry moves to a single-payer, government-run system, the innovation \nthat is occurring in the area of pharmaceuticals and biologics, in the \narea of devices, will be dramatically chilled because there is not \ngoing to be the investment capital to pursue that type of innovation.\n  Granted, the government can try to do it through government research. \nBut we know government research can never replace the creativity of the \nprivate sector and the risk-taking of a broader market that involves \nbillions of dollars of investment.\n  But we also know investment follows return. If you use a government \nplan, which essentially can only save money by controlling prices and, \nthus, reduces returns significantly or reduces the number of years \ncompanies have control over the drug they produce, as is being proposed \nby the majority under the biologics-generic proposal down to 4 or 5 \nyears, then you will not get the initial investment. Those dollars will \ngo somewhere else. They will go into software, they will go into some \nother technology or some other activity where the return will be \nsomething they think is better.\n  So innovation will be chilled, significantly chilled. That does harm. \nThat will do significant harm because one of the great things about our \nsystem, as I mentioned earlier, is that we are bringing these new drugs \nto the market, these new pharmaceuticals, these new biologics, these \nnew devices which are saving lives and making people's lives better.\n  No other country is doing that at the rate we are doing it because \nour country has a system which encourages that sort of entrepreneurship \nand innovation. But that will be dramatically affected if we go down \nthe road as proposed, at least by the bill that was produced by the \nHELP Committee, which the majority leader said he endorses, a bill that \nhas a public plan in it.\n  In the ``do no harm'' category, who are the people we want to have \ntake care of us? I know when I was in high school and in college, the \nbest and brightest people I ran into wanted to be doctors. I liked that \nbecause I knew those folks, who were a lot smarter than I was, were \ngoing to be taking care of myself and my family if I went to see a \ndoctor.\n  Almost universally we know the best and brightest people in our \nsociety, for the most part, go into medicine. They become doctors. That \nhas been our culture for a long time. But that culture will change, \nchange fundamentally, when every doctor in this country is working for \nthe government, when basically the doctors become bureaucrats. What \nsort of incentive is there going to be for the best and brightest to \nmove into medicine then? I think we do significant harm if we undermine \nthat character of our culture.\n  Lastly--and this is the point I wished to talk about mostly--doing no \nharm, in a financial sense, means not creating programs which we cannot \nafford, for which we end up passing the bill on to our children. We \nknow the proposal, as passed by the Finance Committee, costs between $1 \nand $2 trillion.\n  They will tell you: Oh, it only costs $800 billion. But that is \nbecause they used ``Bernie Madoff'' accounting. They said: We have a \n10-year bill. We are going to spend 5 years on the program. We are \ngoing to pay for 5 years of the program, but we are going to have 10 \nyears of income to pay for it. We are going to score as if it is a real \nbill over 10 years.\n  That is absurd. You would go to jail if you did that in the private \nsector, which Bernie Madoff did. But he has been released. He is on \nwork release, I think, down here working with the Democratic majority \non how to score this bill.\n  But as a practical matter, you have to match the full 10 years of \nexpenditures with the full 10 years of what is alleged to be income. So \nif you have this plan fully phased in over 10 years, the cost, by our \nestimate, the Budget Committee staff estimate on the Republican side--\nand it is a reasonable cost estimate--is about $1.8 trillion. The \nincome alleged to occur under this bill--remember, it is coming from \nMedicare reductions and from taxes and fees--is alleged to be about \n$900 billion.\n  If you give them the benefit of the doubt, if they get all the income \nthey claim they are going to get, you are still about $1 trillion off. \nWell, who pays for that? That goes on the debt. Our kids pay for that.\n  By the way, we skipped over one little item, which costs $250 \nbillion, called the doctors fix. That is not even scored in this \nexercise, but we know we have to do it--more sleight of hand on the \naccounting side, a little bit more Bernie Madoffism. The real price of \nthis bill is somewhere between $1 and $1.5 trillion, unpaid for. The \ntotal bills' real cost is somewhere over $2 trillion. We are talking \n10-year figures here.\n  So you are going to grow the government by $2 trillion because you \nare going to create this brandnew entitlement, and you are going to \ntake $400 billion from the Medicare recipients and use that to pay for \nit. Then you are going to take $500 billion in fees and taxes and you \nare going to use that to pay for it.\n  Well, you are about $1.2 trillion short. So who pays for that? Our \nkids. More debt. The problem we have today is, we have too much debt. \nWe have too much debt. The debt is the threat to this country.\n  I ask for an additional 2 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. We are facing a situation where our national debt is \nrising so fast because we are running deficits of over $1 trillion a \nyear for the next 10 years. That is what is projected in the \nPresident's budget. We are essentially going to put ourselves in a \nposition where we are going to be similar to a dog chasing its tail. We \ncan never catch up with the amount of debt we are putting on the books.\n  Now we are talking about putting a $2 trillion expansion of the \ngovernment on top of a government that already has a projected debt of \n80 percent of gross domestic national product, which means our kids are \ngoing to inherit a\n\n[[Page S10802]]\n\ncountry they cannot afford to live in because their standard of living \nwill be reduced in order to try to meet the obligations we are putting \non their backs. It is not fair. It is not right.\n  Clearly, if we are going to do health reform, it should be done in a \nfiscally responsible way. It is not fiscally responsible to grow this \ngovernment by $2 trillion, take money from Medicare to pay for it, and \npass the majority of the cost of that bill on to our kids with more \ndebt. It is not a responsible thing to do.\n  So in the arena of ``do no harm,'' what is presently proposed around \nhere is going to do a lot of harm. That is unfortunate.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask to be informed when I have spoken for 9 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be informed.\n  Mr. KYL. Let me say, the Senator from New Hampshire has it right on \ntarget. I asked a bunch of my constituents how many believe, if we \ncreate a new $1 trillion health care program, it is not going to run up \nthe public debt. Not one hand went up.\n  I think the American people realize what the Senator from New \nHampshire said is absolutely right. You cannot create this kind of a \nnew government takeover of health care in this country and health \ninsurance and not have it cost a lot of money, No. 1, and not have it \nrun up the debt, No. 2.\n  In fact, one of two things is true. You know, half of this is paid \nfor allegedly by cutting Medicare $500 billion, although we do not know \nwhat the final bill will be. Maybe it is $450 billion, but let's say \n$\\1/2\\ trillion to round it off. One of two things is true: Either \nCongress will end up not making all the cuts in Medicare because we \nhave never had the ability to do that in the past because we know it \nwill cut benefits for seniors, in which case we are going to run up \nanother $500 billion debt--the American people know that--or, for the \nfirst time, we are going to make the cuts and seniors are going to see \ntheir Medicare benefits cut.\n  One of those two things is true. Yet our friends on the other side \nsay: Oh, no, no, no. We are not going to have any new debt. Besides \nthat, we are not going to lose any benefits. Well, one of those two \nthings is going to happen. Either we are going to be more in debt or we \nare going to lose a lot of benefits for seniors.\n  This week, of course, all the talk is about a new government-run \ninsurance plan. It has lots of different names. It is called opt-out or \nopt-in or trigger or co-op or consumer or public option.\n  The Speaker of the House this morning was talking about this. She \nsaid: I do not think we should call it public option. I think we should \ncall it consumer option.\n  Well, let's dwell on this for a second. Is this being paid for or run \nby consumers? No. It is being run by the U.S. Government here in \nWashington. Is it being run by the public? No, it is not being run by \nthe public. It is being run by the government here in Washington. This \nis government-run insurance. That is what it is. It is a government \ninsurance company that they want to compete with the private companies.\n  The supporters of this are very honest about this. They say they want \nthem to compete. After all, why shouldn't the private insurance \ncompanies have some competition from a government-run insurance \ncompany? So let's stop the phony characterization of it in some way \nthat sounds a little better, that sounds like it is not government-run \ninsurance. It is government-run insurance. Let's call it by what it is.\n  Strangely, when it comes to Medicare, these same people who are all \nfor competition suddenly go silent. They are not so much for \ncompetition in Medicare. That is what we created with a program called \nMedicare Advantage. We have the government-run part of Medicare, and \nyou can have that if you want it or you can buy one of these private \ninsurance plans called Medicare Advantage. Well, people on the other \nside of the aisle do not like Medicare Advantage because it is private. \nIt is a private insurance company. Usually, they are health maintenance \norganizations or HMOs. They provide a lot of extra benefits to their \nenrollees and the enrollees love it.\n  I get all kinds of letters from Arizonians who are on Medicare \nAdvantage and they do not want us to eliminate it. Of course, that is \nwhat is going to happen under this legislation. They cut $120 billion \nout of Medicare Advantage because they do not want the private \ninsurance companies that provide Medicare Advantage to be competing \nwith Medicare, the government-run entity.\n  So we are all for competition in the private sector today. We need to \nhave a new government insurance company competing. But we are not for \ncompetition when it comes to Medicare, we want to keep that government \nrun. The bottom line is this: The left, in this body and in the other \nbody and in the country at large, wants a single-payer government \nsystem. They know they cannot get there in one jump. So they are going \nto do it in two jumps.\n  First will be with all the government involvement in this bill, \nincluding a government-run insurance company. Then, when everybody gets \ncovered under that, they can move to a single-payer system and, voila, \nyou no longer have a viable private sector.\n  This is not just me talking. The Lewin Group, probably the most \nrespected health care consulting firm, had a study earlier this year in \nwhich they said 119 million Americans would be signed up within, I \nbelieve it is, 2 or 3 years, under this legislation, with the \ngovernment-run insurance company.\n  But here is the interesting figure: 88 million of those people \nalready have insurance. They do not need a new government-run program. \nThey have insurance provided by their employer. The dirty little secret \nis, when the President and others say: If you like your insurance, you \nget to keep it, that is not right. Because all the incentive is for \nyour employer to shift you to the government-run plan. That is a lot \ncheaper for the employer to do that. So you may like your plan, you may \nwant to keep it, but you do not get to keep it if your employer says: \nSorry, it is cheaper for me to put you on the government plan. I am not \ngoing to offer you coverage anymore.\n  Lewin says that will happen to 88 million Americans. This is not a \nsmall matter. Of course, it is also true on Medicare Advantage. If you \nlike your Medicare Advantage plan, as my constituents do, Arizona has \none of the highest percentages of seniors signed up with Medicare \nAdvantage, well, that is tough.\n  We are going to cut $120 billion out of Medicare Advantage and the \nvalue of that plan is going to be cut by about--from roughly $140-\nsomething in value down to roughly $40-some dollars in value, meaning \nyou are going to be losing just under $100 in actuarial value off your \nMedicare Advantage plan because of what we are doing here.\n  All this because those on the left do not like the private sector \nproviding insurance and want it eventually to go all government. The \nfirst step to that is this government-run insurance.\n  On Monday, the majority leader announced a new tweak on this, a new \nvariation. In order to try to placate some who do not like the \ngovernment-run concept, he will say: Well, we will let the States opt \nout. What exactly does that mean? Nobody knows. Somebody has written a \nbill or at least has written a concept. Nobody that I know of has seen \nit. Certainly Republicans have not seen it. This was cooked up in the \nmajority leader's office with people from the administration and some \nother Democratic Senators, and they came up with the idea that maybe it \nwould not sound so bad if they let States opt out.\n  What exactly does that mean? Well, first of all, I do not know. But \ndoes it mean everybody has to pay for it, but if you do not want to \naccept the benefits, you can opt out of the benefits? How many States \nare going to go for that? Who knows what it means?\n  Somebody said: Well, how about an opt-in? I said: Well, you ought to \nask the Democrats that. It would seem to make more sense than an opt-\nout if you are going to have the program. Of course, you should not \nhave it in the first place, but at least, if you have it, shouldn't you \ngive people the option of deciding whether they want it and whether \nthey have to pay for it? If they do not want to pay for it and do not \nwant the benefits, well, maybe then it is a little different \nproposition. But that is not a good idea either, because you are still \ncreating the basic government-run insurance company, and that\n\n[[Page S10803]]\n\nis also what is wrong with the so-called trigger.\n  The idea of the trigger is, well, if the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services decides in her opinion that not enough people can get \ninsurance at the right cost, then we are going to have the government-\nrun insurance company take over. National, paid for by the Federal \nGovernment, created by the Federal Government--this is government-run \ninsurance.\n  A co-op. That idea seems to have pretty well fallen off.\n  But all of these ideas--whether it is a co-op or consumer or public \nor opt-in or opt-out, it all amounts to the same thing: It is \ngovernment-run insurance. We do not need it. It is bad. It is a \nproblem--or a solution looking for a problem.\n  There are times where there is not that much competition. Why? \nBecause they are generally small States without very much population. \nThe last thing they need is one more insurance company coming in \nsplitting up the pie. They need a large risk pool to provide the basis \nfor them to be able to write insurance. And you split the risk pool up \neven more with yet another insurer, and you are not solving any kind of \na problem.\n  The final thing they said: Well, we need the government-run insurance \nto keep the insurance companies honest. That is what the State \ninsurance commissioners are for. We have several former State insurance \ncommissioners--the Senator from Maine, Ms. Collins; the Senator from \nNebraska, Mr. Nelson; the other Senator Nelson--all former insurance \ncommissioners, and they know their job was to keep the insurance \ncompanies honest. I have not heard anybody say the insurance companies \nare not honest. I heard them say: Well, they make way too much money. \nWell, obviously, that to some extent can be controlled by the \nindividual States. But it is also the case----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed 9 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. I appreciate that, Mr. President. I will conclude with this \npoint: A study that came out in the papers earlier this week \ndemonstrated that insurance companies ranked 35th on the list of the \nmost profitable companies, making a profit of something like 2 percent. \nSo the bottom line is, people say: Well, we either want to punish the \ninsurance companies or give them more competition or keep them honest. \nAll of these are excuses for offering government-run insurance that, at \nthe end of the day, is simply a step toward a single-payer system in \nthis country. That is not the kind of reform Americans want.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I appreciate the comments of my colleague \nfrom Arizona and before him my colleague from New Hampshire in pointing \nout what happens when you deal with a Federal Government insurance \ncompany. If you want to call it Federal Government, Inc., whatever you \nwant to call it, what you are essentially talking about when the \nFederal Government takes greater control of any part of our economy but \ncertainly one-sixth of our economy with health care, which is what \nhealth care represents--$1 in every $6 of our economy is spent on \nhealth care in this country--what you typically get is fewer choices \nand higher costs. That is certainly the case here because you are going \nto see fewer choices.\n  I think most Americans realize that if the Federal Government has \nmore control, more intervention, more involvement in health care in \nthis country, it is going to ratchet down the availability of choice \nand there will be fewer freedoms for people in this country because the \nFederal Government is going to start saying what has to be in a certain \nhealth care policy. It is going to start getting in the way of that \nfundamental relationship between physicians and their patients. You are \ngoing to have more and more governmental intervention, and that \nultimately is something I think most Americans have great reservations \nand great apprehension about.\n  In fact, if you look at the bills, the various bills that are before \nthe Congress today--and there are three that have been reported out in \nthe House, two now in the Senate--they vary a little bit in terms of \nparticulars, but they are consistent in terms of their overall themes. \nThey are all going to raise taxes. They are going to raise taxes not \njust on the rich, not just on people with high incomes, they are going \nto raise taxes on ordinary Americans. All the studies bear that out. \nThe Congressional Budget Office says that. The Joint Tax Committee says \nthat. They are going to cut Medicare for seniors, particularly those \nwho have Medicare Advantage. So Medicare benefits are going to be \nslashed if this bill becomes law. And they are going to all lead to \nhigher premiums. That is the remarkable thing about this legislation. \nAll these bills that are before Congress right now, which propose to \ncontrol costs and to lower costs for people in this country, all lead \nto the same result; that is, higher costs for health care in the form \nof higher premiums.\n  I want to point out something in the bill the Finance Committee \nproduced.\n  By the way, they are still merging these bills behind closed doors. \nThere are a handful of people who are writing this bill. Contrary to \nthe assertions of the President last year when he was campaigning that \nthis was going to be on C-SPAN, it was going to be a wide-open process, \nand the American public was going to be able to participate and engage \nin this, this is all occurring behind closed doors. The specifics of \nthis legislation are being written right now and probably will end up \nbeing hundreds of pages, perhaps even thousands of pages. But they all \ncome back to the basic characteristics I mentioned earlier: higher \ntaxes, Medicare cuts, and higher premiums for Americans.\n  What is interesting about this chart I have in the Chamber is there \nare Americans who will be put into an exchange who would be able to get \nsome subsidies to help purchase insurance. Obviously, there are a lot \nof people in this country who do not have access to insurance today, \nand that is what we all--Members on both sides in the Senate--want to \naddress: How do we provide more Americans access to affordable health \ncare in this country? So there are some who get subsidies and who would \nbe able to buy insurance through an exchange. That is about 18 million \nAmericans. But if you are among the 185 million Americans who currently \nhave health insurance, you will pay higher taxes and your premiums will \nend up going up.\n  What is ironic about this is 18 million Americans will get subsidies \nthrough these exchanges, but there are still 25 million Americans under \nthe Finance Committee bill who will not have insurance when this is all \nsaid and done. So you actually have more people without insurance than \nwould actually get subsidies under this plan that is being proposed by \nthe Finance Committee, financed by the 185 million people who are going \nto pay higher taxes and also who are going to see their premiums go up. \nNow, I am not saying that. That is what the Congressional Budget Office \nand the Joint Tax Committee have said. That is what every independent \nstudy that has looked at this has said.\n  By the way, last week there was an analysis that came out, done by \nthe Actuary at the Department of Health and Human Services here in \nWashington, DC, that said overall spending on health care under this \nproposal--and when I say ``this,'' I am talking about the House \nproposal. Again, they are very similar in their characteristics, and in \nsome of the particulars they differ. But in the House proposal, it \nwould go up by 2.1 percent. If you remember, today we spend about $1 in \nevery $6 in our economy on health care. At the end of the 10-year \nperiod, according to the Actuary at the Department of Health and Human \nServices, we are going to be spending more than $1 in every $5. So 21.3 \npercent of every $1 in our economy is going to go to health care \nbecause under these proposals, health care costs are going to go up \nover and above the rate of inflation. In other words, if we do nothing \ntoday, you are going to have normal inflationary health care costs, \nwhich are going to increase the cost of health care. Enacting this \nlegislation would increase the cost of health care 2.1 percent above \nthat, or $750 billion over 10 years. That is what the Actuary at the \nHealth and Human Services Department said--$750 billion in spending on \nhealth care above and beyond what would be normal if we did nothing \nwith health care inflation in this country. So it would add 2.1 percent \nto the\n\n[[Page S10804]]\n\namount we spend as a percentage of our GDP, to where 21.3 percent of \nour entire economy would be spent on health care.\n\n  So you have health care costs going up, you have taxes going up, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax \nCommittee, on people who are making less than $200,000 a year. And even \nhalf of the tax burden, over 50 percent, according to the Joint \nCommittee on Taxation, would be borne by those who make less than \n$100,000 a year.\n  The amazing thing about this, from the analysis that has been done, \nis that someone who is making 150 percent of the poverty level, which \nis $32,200 a year, because of the way the provisions in this bill would \ninteract, would actually end up with an effective marginal tax rate of \n59 percent--a 59-percent tax rate--because they would lose subsidies as \nthey make more money. So the incentive for someone in a lower income \ncategory to make more money is going to go away because with every \ndollar they make, their effective marginal tax rate is going to go up. \nIt would be 59 percent for someone making $32,200 in this country \ntoday. That is for people whose income is 150 percent of the poverty \nlevel.\n  So to suggest for a minute these tax increases and these tax policies \nand the way this bill is financed are not going to impact average \nAmericans, working-class Americans, is absolutely wrong. It is false. \nThat is what the Joint Tax Committee and the Congressional Budget \nOffice have said.\n  But probably the worst thing: If you are one of these 185 million \nAmericans, as shown right here, who are paying the burden in the form \nof higher taxes, you are going to see, at the end of all this, that \nafter all the promises that we are going to get costs under control, \nyour health care costs are going to go up and your taxes are going to \ngo up. If you are a senior citizen, your Medicare benefits go down. And \nguess what. Your health care costs, your insurance premiums are going \nto go up. That is what has been said consistently.\n  Doug Elmendorf, the Director of the Congressional Budget Office, \nsaid:\n\n       Our judgment is that piece of the legislation would raise \n     insurance premiums.\n\n  He goes on to say:\n\n       Those projected premium amounts include the effect of the \n     fees that would be imposed under the proposal on \n     manufacturers and importers of brand name drugs and medical \n     devices, on health insurance providers, and on clinical \n     laboratories. Those fees would increase costs for the \n     affected firms, which would be passed on to purchasers and \n     ultimately would raise insurance fees by a corresponding \n     amount.\n\n  That is a direct quote from the Congressional Budget Officer \nDirector, Doug Elmendorf.\n  He also said, when asked the question about, Would these taxes be \npassed on in the form of higher premium, that roughly dollar for dollar \nthey would be passed on in the form of higher premiums.\n  Some of the independent studies that have been done out there suggest \nthat if you are buying in the individual market as an individual, you \nare going to see up to a 73-percent increase in your health insurance \npremiums; if you are a small business, up to a 20-percent increase. The \nstudies vary. I have looked at my State. They break it down, some of \nthese analyses, State by State. In my State of South Dakota, if you are \nbuying in the individual marketplace as an individual, you would see a \n49-percent increase. If you are buying in the individual marketplace as \na family, you would see a 50-percent increase. If you are someone who \nis in a small group market, you would see smaller increases but still \ndouble-digit increases--14 percent, 15 percent above the normal rate of \ninflation. In other words, if we do nothing, if we do absolutely \nnothing, you are going to have normal inflationary increases in health \ncare costs, which I think are hurting a lot of small businesses. But if \nwe do what is being proposed here, it is going to be way worse because \nthe overall cost of health care, according to the Actuary at the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, the overall cost of health \ncare above and beyond the rate of inflation is going to be $750 billion \nover 10 years or a 2.1-percent increase in overall health care costs. \nIt translates, as I said earlier, into individuals, small businesses, \nand families paying higher health insurance premiums, higher costs for \ntheir health care, higher taxes.\n  If you are among the 185 million Americans, again, who are not in the \nexchange, who do not get subsidies, you are going to pay higher taxes \nand you are going to see your health insurance premiums go up.\n  There are a lot of people--a total of 282 million people--who are not \ngoing to be in the exchange. There are a lot of people who derive their \nhealth care through the government: Medicare and Medicaid. So there are \na total of about 282 million people in this country who are not going \nto get subsidies and 18 million who will.\n  By the way, again, 25 million Americans will still not be covered. \nThere will be more not covered than would be able to get subsidies \nthrough these exchanges to buy insurance.\n  The Democrats are saying: Trust us. They said that on the stimulus. \nThey said unemployment would not go above 8 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time is expired.\n  Mr. THUNE. I will wrap up with this, Mr. President. ``Trust us'' is \nnot enough for the American people. The American people need real, \nmeaningful health care reform that will drive costs down, not up. These \nproposals drive it up.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to say that the presentation by the \nSenator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune, is a strong one and a compelling \none. I am also very impressed with his knowledge of the facts and his \nin-depth analysis of what we are apparently facing. I say \n``apparently'' because so far, as has unfortunately been the case, the \nmajority leader has not shared with at least this side of the aisle or \nanyone I know of on this side of the aisle any of the specifics of the \nlatest proposal. That is very unfortunate.\n  As the Senator from South Dakota mentioned, the President of the \nUnited States, when campaigning, stated categorically that there would \nbe C-SPAN cameras, that there would be Republicans, there would be an \nopen process, and he was specifically addressing the issue of health \ncare reform.\n  Americans grow cynical from time to time about the things we say \nduring political campaigns. I can only conclude that the statement made \nby the President during the campaign contributes mightily to not only \nthe issue of health care reform but also the cynicism about real change \nin Washington. Change has not taken place; the majority rules.\n  I certainly agree those abuses were committed when Republicans were \nin the majority in this body, and I saw it, and I fought against it. \nBut it was stated just a little over a year ago that when health care \nreform came to its period of consideration by the Senate, when the \nnegotiations went on, C-SPAN cameras and Republicans would be present \nso the American people would be able to see, in the President's words, \n``who is there representing the pharmaceutical companies and who is \nrepresenting the American people.''\n  Well, if we open it up now, if we opened the doors not far from here, \nwe would see that already a deal has been cut with the pharmaceutical \ncompanies. It is an $80 billion deal done in return for $100 million or \nso in positive ads and in return for punishment to average American \ncitizens because the administration agreed to a prohibition of \nimportation of prescription drugs from Canada that could sometimes save \nas much as 60 percent on lifesaving pharmaceutical drugs; as well as \nthe elimination of or opposition to competition amongst drug companies \nto provide prescription drugs to Medicare recipients.\n  So what they have done by buying off the pharmaceutical companies--by \nthe way, according to the latest reports I read this morning, the head \nof the pharmaceutical lobby makes over $2 million a year--we have now \npenalized the American people by preventing them from having choice, as \nwell as seeing the influence of special interests in this country and \nin our deliberations. It is very unfortunate.\n  There is a great deal of cynicism out there amongst the American \npeople. It is manifest through tea parties and in other ways. Polling \ndata shows the great dissatisfaction the American people have about the \nway we do business.\n\n[[Page S10805]]\n\nThat cynicism has been authenticated by the process we are going \nthrough.\n  I would again urge the majority leader to invite us in to sit down. \nWe have some constructive ideas. We have some thoughts as to how we can \nreform health care in America. We know there needs to be reform. We \nhave people such as my colleagues, two doctors--Dr. Coburn and Dr. \nBarrasso--on our side of the aisle, who have extensive hands-on \nexperience with these issues. Why can't we at least at some point--\nwhich we should have done a long time ago--be allowed to have input \ninto the behind-closed-doors process that is taking place as we speak?\n\n\n                           H1N1 Preparedness\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to also say a few words this morning about an \nissue that is of great concern to me and is of greater concern \nthroughout the country; that is, the availability of vaccines in order \nto combat swine flu, known as H1N1. There are long lines around the \ncountry. There is scarcity. There is great concern amongst the American \npeople about this problem. Unfortunately, just last week, in a hearing \nbefore the Homeland Security Committee, the Secretary of Health and \nHuman Services assured us that it was no problem and that there would \nbe plenty of supplies on hand.\n  The previous administration conducted the initial analysis, as we \nknow, and worked with the World Health Organization to estimate the \nmagnitude of this worldwide pandemic. A plan was put in place and \nstakeholders began executing their roles in protecting the public \nhealth.\n  In the fall of 2005, in response to the government's lessons from \ncombating avian flu, Congress provided $6.1 billion in the 2006 \nsupplemental appropriations for pandemic planning across several \nFederal departments and agencies. Since then, annual funding has been \nprovided to the Centers for Disease Control and the FDA and activities \nin Health and Human Services to continue work on vaccine development, \nstockpiling of countermeasures, and assistance to States.\n  In late April of this year, Margaret Chan, the World Health \nOrganization's Director General, declared ``a public health emergency \nof international concern'' when the first cases of the H1N1 virus were \nreported in the United States. National and State plans were in place \nand orders for vaccines were processed. Among other actions, officials \nreleased antiviral drugs from the national stockpile, developed and \nreleased diagnostic tests for the H1N1 virus, and developed guidance \nfor the clinical management of patients and the management of community \nand school outbreaks. The administration requested $9 billion in \nemergency supplemental appropriations to address the situation.\n  On June 26 the President signed an appropriations bill which provided \n$1.9 billion immediately and an additional $5.8 billion contingent upon \na Presidential request documenting the need for and proposed use of the \nadditional funds. In total, from 2004 through 2009, Health and Human \nServices alone has received almost $9 billion for pandemic flu \npreparedness. Again, this doesn't account for the other billions to \nother agencies.\n  However, for the $9 billion and counting the government has spent on \npreparing for pandemic outbreaks, Americans have only experienced \nfrustration at vaccine shortages and the long lines for the limited \nsupply of H1N1 vaccines that are available. This should make all \nAmericans extremely nervous about the government possibly taking \ncontrol of our health care system.\n  Three months ago we were told--this is important. Three months ago we \nwere told the CDC expected 120 million to 160 million doses by the end \nof October. Two months ago the administration's estimate of vaccine \navailability dropped to 40 million by mid October, with 20 million \nadditional doses rolling out every week. Last week, the estimate \ndropped again. Now only about 28 million doses are expected to be \navailable by the end of October. Yet the CDC estimates there are at \nleast 45 million high-risk Americans, including pregnant women and \nchildren, in need of the vaccine. So according to my math, we are about \n20 million doses short.\n  Unfortunately, the outbreak of the flu is widespread and deaths are \naccumulating. The Washington Post reported yesterday:\n\n       As of October 17, 46 States were reporting ``widespread'' \n     influenza activity and many doctors' offices have been \n     swamped with swine flu patients . . . The U.S. Government has \n     ordered enough vaccine to make up to 251 million doses if \n     needed, but production has been slower than originally \n     anticipated. A total of 11.3 million doses of vaccine have \n     been shipped to U.S. doctors and hospitals and clinics as of \n     Wednesday, according to the CDC, out of a total of 14.1 \n     million doses that manufacturers had shipped to warehouses by \n     that time. By Friday, 16.1 million doses of vaccine had been \n     shipped to warehouses.\n\n  In Arizona, State officials estimated a need of 900,000 to 1 million \nvaccines for my State's 6.5 million residents.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. However, Arizona has only received 263,000 vaccines as of \nyesterday. According to the Arizona Republic, the swine flu vaccine was \nonly available at 35 of the 113 planned clinics in Maricopa County. The \narticle quoted the county's director of public health as stating:\n\n       It's a very frustrating situation where we are just not \n     getting what we need. Right now, it is completely out of \n     everyone's control.\n\n  On October 24, the Arizona Republic reported:\n\n       The lines were long, but the desire intense Saturday as \n     hundreds, possibly thousands, of people waited up to three \n     hours to get in one of today's rarest experiences: a swine-\n     flu shot.\n\n  The doses available represented a little more than 1 percent of \nMaricopa County's population. People were turned away if they did not \nfall into the high-risk group.\n  Congress needs to know more information. Obviously, the hearing we \nhad in the Homeland Security Committee last week was, at best, \nmisleading as to the magnitude of this problem. We need more \ninformation from the government, and we need to act now and find out \nhow we are going to get enough swine flu vaccine to take care of the \ncitizens of this country. We have already invested $9 billion. I don't \nthink we have a lot to show for it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I will be recognized for the remainder of \nour time. Would the Chair tell me when I have 1 minute left, please?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator will be informed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/28/senate-section/article/S10805-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10805-S10807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I listened the last few weeks on the \nSenate floor to many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle. I \nhappen to be one of two physicians in the Senate. I still practice. I \nsaw 11 patients Monday morning in an office in Muskogee, OK. I saw some \nsick kids, saw some women, some senior citizens, saw people having \ndifficulties with pregnancies. I was kind of struck, as I watched and \nlistened, to where we are in the country today.\n  We have a lot of problems in front of us, including the financial \nproblems, our unemployment problems, the fact that we need to get our \neconomy up and going. But I saw something my staff sent me that \nexplained and gave a great big, huge answer to me. It became crystal \nclear. It was a guy holding a poster. I have added a few things to his \nposter, but in essence here is what it said.\n  On the top line it said: ``Medicare is broke.'' That is true. We all \nknow that. It runs a negative cash balance, total negative cash balance \nstarting in 2017, probably 2014. So 5 years from now, the vast majority \nof the funds from Medicare are not going to come from Medicare taxes. \nThey are going to come from the citizens of this country through their \nregular taxes or we are going to borrow it from our kids.\n  The States are broke because they have Medicaid, and they are all \nstruggling mightily right now, so Medicaid is broke.\n  What else is broke? The Post Office is broke. We know that. We just \ngave them $2 billion to get them out of their cash flow, but they are \ngoing to run about an $8 billion, $10 billion deficit next year.\n  The census is broke. We know that. It is going to cost 2\\1/2\\ times \nwhat it\n\n[[Page S10806]]\n\ncost the last time, and we are not even sure we are going to get an \naccurate census.\n  The highway trust fund is broke. We are getting ready to have a bill \non the Senate floor in the very next few days or weeks that will extend \nthe life of the highway trust fund. It is going to take $248 billion \nfrom our grandkids with a wink and a nod and say it is not broke. It is \nnot any different from what we were trying to do on the Medicare doctor \nfix, on the reimbursement fix. So the highway trust fund is broke.\n  Fannie Mae is broke. Freddie Mac is broke. Medicare is broke. \nMedicaid is broke. The country is broke.\n  Here in the midst of all of this, we are getting ready to add a $1 \ntrillion program run by the very same individuals who have Medicare \nbroken, Medicaid broken, highway trust fund broken, Post Office broken, \ncensus broken, Fannie Mae broken, Freddie Mac broken, and we are \nsupposed to trust us to design a system to fix the problem.\n  There is no question there are some problems in health care. The \nbiggest problem is that it costs too much. I see that every day when I \npractice medicine. I have seen it for 25 years. It is exacerbated now.\n  Most people won't agree with my assessment, but one of the reasons \nthe costs are so high isn't just technology--and certainly it isn't the \ninsurance industry--it is the demands we place on the system through \nMedicare and Medicaid. I get to experience that every day--the added \ncosts that go into the health care system because I have to do \nsomething the way Medicare wants me to do it, not the way I would do it \nnormally. I have to cross the T's and dot the I's for Medicare.\n  It is ironic that right now, as we are sitting here, there is a \nhearing going on on strategies to address Medicare fraud. We have a \nbill that is getting ready to come to the floor that doesn't have any \nof that in it. Why didn't we have that hearing 6 months ago when we \nasked for it? Or a year ago when we asked for it? Two years ago, we did \nhave one in my subcommittee, where we found out that HHS doesn't even \nknow how much Medicaid fraud there is, and they underestimate their \nMedicare fraud by 50 percent, according to GAO. We are almost at 20 \npercent fraud. And now we are having a hearing, after a bill is \nwritten, to find out new strategies for it.\n  Why? It is because there is no defense that we could ever muster or \nmaintain against the accusation that we have allowed a system to have \nthis kind of fraud in it. Yet we are supposed to turn around and ask \nthe American people to trust us to fix what is wrong in health care. \nThere are significant things wrong in Medicare. It costs way too much. \nIt doesn't have to cost way too much. But we have put that into the \nsystem.\n  Let me, for a minute, defend American medicine. If you are sick \nanywhere in the world, the best place to get sick is in this country. \nWe have a 30- to 50-percent higher cancer cure rate than anybody in the \nworld. If you have an acute coronary syndrome, heart attack, or stroke, \nwe have the best hope for the best outcome and the best survivability \nfor you. If, in fact, you have an orthopedic problem, whether it is a \nfractured hip or leg, or you need a new joint, this is the best place \nin the world to get the best care with the least complications, with \nthe best outcome of anyplace in the world.\n  There have been a lot of people critical of the bad parts in health \ncare, and they should be. But what we are about to do is to damage the \nvery best health care in the world to fix what is wrong with that \nsystem. So rather than to preserve what is good, we are going to take \nover--we are already at 61-percent government-run health care; 61 \npercent of all health care is run by the government today. Add it up--\nwhether it be military health care, Indian health care, VA health care, \nMedicaid, Medicare, SCHIP, or the Federal employees health care, FEHBP. \nSixty-one percent of health care is run through the government today. \nYou may say, how in the world can we have the cost go out of line? It \nis because we have health care bills that will not address the real \ncosts.\n  Instead of having a monstrous bill that costs $1 trillion--actually \nfar more than that, about $2.8 trillion the full first 10 years it is \nin effect. Rather than doing that, we ought to fix the easy things \nfirst, such as the fraud in Medicare. It is not hard to fix. We pay and \nchase. We have known that for years. We tried to do something about it, \nbut we cannot do anything about it. We assume that when you bill \nMedicare, you bill them right and we pay you. If you don't do it right, \nwe try to figure out, rather than having active live intervention to \ndetermine that you did a certified procedure or used a certified \nproduct. So we could save, in health care, $60 to $70 billion a year \njust in government programs if we fix the fraud.\n  We can save another $100 billion a year if, in fact, we incentivize \nor change the tort system in this country, because what we know is that \n80 percent of all lawsuits are frauds in health care. They all get \ndropped. They never get paid attention to. But they get filed, hoping \nto extort money out of our insurance companies that cover doctors. Of \nthe remaining 20 percent, 89.9 percent of those are found in favor of \nthe providers. So what that says is less than 3 percent of all the \nsuits that are filed are legitimate, and those poor people who win the \n3 percent--60 percent of the money doesn't go to them; it goes to the \nsystem.\n  What else could we do? We can change the Tax Code so that if you are \nan individual, you get the same tax benefit that corporations do when \nthey buy their employees health insurance. No, we won't do that. We \nhave not done that in this bill. So if, in fact, you are well-to-do or \nyou have the benefit of employer-paid health care, you get $2,700 worth \nof health benefit a year; but if you are a single man or woman trying \nto raise a child, and are self-employed, you get $100 worth of tax \nbenefit. So we totally side with those who are well-to-do, in terms of \nthe tax benefits in this country, rather than help the people out there \ntrying to buy individual health insurance.\n  We can create a transparent market. We can mandate tomorrow that for \nall insurance sold you have to put out the quality, your payment terms, \nand you have to put out the prices you will pay, and the same with \nevery provider in health care, so that you can know what you are going \nto get, what it will cost, and the likelihood of the outcome \nbeforehand.\n  Finally, we could encourage the sale of insurance products across \nState lines to force competition into the insurance market. There is no \nquestion they need competition. They have it inside, but it is mandated \ndown to the State level. So the only way you will ever create real \ncompetition and force competition in health care is to make them all \ncompete against each other, which will give you the ability to buy what \nyou want for your family, what you think you need, and get the care you \nwant, at a price you can afford. We are not going to do that with this \nplan or any of the plans that have been offered. We are going to see \nthe cost of insurance go up, not down.\n  Finally, we could have group health associations, where businesses \ncan come together across State lines and join an association and have \nbuying power in the insurance industry. That has been blocked in this \nbody for 4 years.\n  So we can do four or five things, and none of those would cost any \nmoney. None of that would require us to steal money from Medicare \nAdvantage and Medicare to create a new program, rather than to fund the \nsustainable portion of Medicare. So as we look at health care--and \nthere is no question we have problems, and I want to see them fixed--it \nis important to put it into perspective. We have failed at everything \nwe have done, in terms of being effective stewards, when it comes to \nhealth care programs through the Federal Government. They are neither \nefficient nor highly effective. We are getting ready to ask the \nAmerican people to trust us with another couple trillion dollars over \nthe next 10 years to create a new system, demonstrating the fact that \nwe don't know how to run and won't be responsible for the systems we \nhave. We are going to create a new system, and the idea is to just \ntrust us. Our actions which have demonstrated a lack of financial \nstewardship of the health care programs today ought to give us all \ngreat caution that somehow the Federal Government knows what it is \ndoing when it comes to health care. The proof is that we absolutely \nhave no idea what we are\n\n[[Page S10807]]\n\ndoing. That is why there is an $85 trillion unfunded liability on \nMedicare. That is why there are over $100 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities when it comes to Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, and \nSCHIP that we will never be able to take care of, which we will shove \nover onto our kids and grandkids. But trust us, we can get it right \nthis time.\n  We can create 88 new programs--that is what is in this--new \nbureaucracies, new government programs, with 150,000 new employees. And \nif you think that 150,000 employees won't stand between you and your \nprovider, you have another thought coming. They are going to write \nrules and regulations that will cripple the ability for you to make \ndecisions about your health care in your family. It is going to slow \nyour access to health care and raise your cost of health care.\n  There are ways to get out of this. There are ways to lower the costs. \nThere are ways to not grow the government and make more health care \navailable to hundreds of thousands and millions of American citizens. \nThe first health care bill introduced was the Patients Choice Act, \nfiled in this Congress by myself and Richard Burr. It saves money \nrather than costing money. It saves $70 billion in the first 10 years. \nIt saves the States $1 trillion in the first 10 years. It is the \nopposite of what we have coming. It is a patient-centered plan rather \nthan a government-centered plan. It puts patients in charge rather than \ngovernment bureaucrats and Senators. The last thing I want to happen to \nmy patients and me--I am 61 years old, and it will not be long before I \nam eligible for Medicare--is somebody in Washington making a decision \nabout what my family and I can get. And whether I can afford it is up \nto me. But what I can get, and where I can get it, ought to be totally \nand 100 percent left in my hands as an individual who is free in this \ncountry.\n\n  I have one final point. In this bill is a mandate that you have to \nbuy insurance. You have to buy insurance. If you own your own home, you \ndon't have to buy homeowners insurance. If you don't want to have \ngeneral liability on your property, you don't have to do it. If you \nchoose not to drive a car, you don't have to buy auto insurance. By the \nway, 25 percent of the people who own a car don't buy it or they buy it \nand they cancel it. We know that. That was the latest statistic. So we \nare going to tell everybody in America that you no longer have the \nfreedom to make a choice, that if you have the assets and you choose \nnot to buy health insurance, you are going to get a fine--a \nmisdemeanor--from the Federal Government. We are going to take away \nyour freedom to make a decision you think is in your best interest.\n  I note that I have a limited amount of time. With that, I call on the \nAmerican public to pay very close attention not to what we say and are \ngoing to do in the next few weeks in Washington but look at what we \nhave done in the past. I don't think you can trust us with health care \nthe way we are going. We have not demonstrated we can do that. The \nperson to trust on health care is you. We can fix what is wrong without \nbringing another 20 percent of health care into the Federal Government \nand shackling our children forever.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/28/senate-section/article/S10807-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the motion to proceed to H.R. 3548, which the \nclerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to proceed to H.R. 3548, a bill to amend the \n     Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2008 to provide for the \n     temporary availability of certain additional emergency \n     unemployment compensation, and for other purposes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I have come to talk specifically about \nthe urgency of passing the unemployment benefit extension.\n  I want to take a moment to respond to my friend from Oklahoma, who \nwas essentially bashing the Government's ability to provide any kind of \nstructure or opportunity for health care, saying that the Federal \nGovernment cannot be trusted to provide access to health care for \npeople. I suggest that the 40 million people who receive their health \ncare through Medicare--seniors over age 65 and people with \ndisabilities--would probably disagree with that. I think my 83-year-old \nmother would wrestle me to the ground if I tried to take away her \nMedicare card. She has access to choose her own doctor and procedures.\n  This is a system that involves the public and private sectors, and it \nwas in fact established in 1965 by the U.S. Government to make sure \nseniors and people with disability have health care. Also, those who \nare poor in this country and have lost their jobs and are fearful of \nlosing their health care, families, and low-income seniors who need to \ngo into nursing homes would probably disagree with my friends from \nOklahoma about Medicaid, even though there are many challenges that we \nneed to work on in terms of rates and so on.\n  Medicaid is a safety net for many Americans. That is the difference, \nin some cases, for seniors in nursing homes between life and death.\n  I am proud the Federal Government also stepped up on Medicaid. I also \nthink the Children's Health Insurance Program, which was started in the \nnineties for low-income working families to make sure that if someone \nis working in a job and does not have health insurance, at least their \nchildren can be taken care of with a low-cost policy they pay for. But \nwe established and created a way for families to get health insurance. \nI think those folks would probably disagree with the statement as well.\n  In many regards, the VA--and while there are certainly challenges and \nissues and we all push through to make sure our constituents are \nserved--has been in the forefront of health information technology, \nelectronic medical records, and so on. The VA is a system that works \nfor our veterans as it should. When it is not well funded, as it has \nnot been in the past with the previous administration, we stepped up to \nincrease the funding repeatedly to make sure our veterans have what \nthey need through a Federal Government health care system.\n  Finally, I will just say, there are our military and military \nretirees as well whom, I am proud to say, our country has supported \nthrough providing a health care system.\n  We can talk more about health care at another time. But I do think \nthis ongoing effort to be critical of anything we do collectively as a \ncountry, through a democratic process of government, that somehow that \nis bad, I find that interesting, when we are saying to those around the \nworld they should go to our system. We, together through our system, \nhave made sure there are opportunities for many Americans, most \nAmericans, if you count the employer-based health care system, the tax \ncredits, the incentives for employers, the government policy. In some \nway, our government has been involved in incentivizing health care. The \nquestion now is, Do we complete the job? I am very hopeful we will \ncomplete the job for every American and tackle health care costs that \nare crippling our businesses, our government, and our families.\n  I wish to speak about something else that is of tremendous urgency \nfor families. I was very pleased that last night, finally, after 3 \nweeks of blocking our ability to get to this bill to extend \nunemployment benefits, we have the opportunity to get to a vote. \nEighty-seven Members voted to proceed to the bill. I don't understand, \nwhen 87 Members vote to proceed to the bill, why we could not have done \nthis sooner.\n  Since we started to try to get to this bill, to this point today, \n143,000-plus people have lost their unemployment insurance benefits--\njust in the last 3 weeks, over 143,000 people, who have done nothing \nbut work all their lives, play by the rules, the job goes away, they \nare trying to find another job and, in the meantime, keep a roof over \nthe head for their family, food on the table, turn on that electric, \nturn on that heating system, which is going to cost\n\n[[Page S10808]]\n\neven more to the family budget--just keep things going.\n  We know 7,000 people today will lose their unemployment benefits; \n7,000 people tomorrow will lose their unemployment benefits; 7,000 \npeople the next day. We have been trying to build on what we did in the \nRecovery Act. I am so grateful our President immediately wanted to \nextend unemployment benefits. We did not have to struggle, as we did \nfor 8 years, to try to make that happen. President Obama gets it, and \nit was in the recovery package.\n  Now we come to a position where we need to extend it. The House \npasses it, and we spend 3 weeks procedurally trying to get to this bill \nso we can consider it.\n  There are amendments that will be offered. There are amendments that \nare very good amendments that I support, such as extending the first-\ntime home buyers tax credit, help for our businesses in this economy, \nadjusting tax issues of net operating loss, positive things, bipartisan \nthings. But fundamentally, the question I have is why did it take us so \nlong to get to the substantive discussion on this bill?\n  That leads me to the second matter about which I wish to talk.\n  Since the beginning of this year, we have seen 82--yesterday it was \n81, now it is 82 times, as of this week, that we have seen Republican \nobjections to moving America forward, forcing us to go to a vote, such \nas yesterday, where 87 people said yes. Why did it take a vote? Why did \nit take 3 weeks? If people were sincere about moving this country \nforward, about solving problems, all the talk of bipartisanship and all \nour efforts to create that, we would not get no, no, no; I object, I \nobject, I object. That is all we hear as we try to move forward to \nsolve some of the most critical issues facing the country, facing \nfamilies, facing businesses--the economy, internationally with wars. \nOver and over again, things that should take 2 hours take 2 weeks.\n  It is time to say enough is enough. We have done this too long this \nyear. Now is enough. It is time to get on with the business, the \npeople's business, and to, frankly, call it like it is.\n  I wish to go through a few of the 82--not all of them--a few of the \n82 objections because we started the year with efforts to block the \nPresident from getting his team in place.\n  We know there was an election. Somebody won. They have a right to \nhave their team in place to govern. That is how this works. Yet right \nout of the box, the day after the swearing in, January 22, there was an \nobjection to calling up the Jackson nomination, the Sutley nomination, \nthe Solise nomination, the Rice nomination--objection, objection, \nobjection. We can go on through point by point.\n  I will jump down to April 21, when there was an objection to \nscheduling a vote on Christopher Hill to be the Ambassador to Iraq. We \nare in the middle of a war, years of a war, and there was an objection \nto moving that nomination for most of April, but then he was confirmed \nwith 73 votes.\n  This, obviously, was not about the fact that there was not a majority \nof people--overwhelmingly, over two-thirds of the Senate wanted to have \nthis vote, wanted to confirm the Ambassador to Iraq, but yet there were \nobjections and slow-walking and slow-walking and slow-walking, trying \nto slow down the business of governing and getting things done for this \ncountry.\n  Two days later, there was an objection to moving forward to the \nnomination of Thomas Strickland, the Assistant Secretary for Fish and \nWildlife. Ultimately, he was confirmed with 89 votes. What took so \nlong?\n  Seconds after that objection, there was an objection to Kathleen \nSebelius as Secretary of Health and Human Services, right as we were \nfirst beginning to respond to the H1N1 virus, and we didn't even have a \nSecretary of Health and Human Services. Yet there was an objection.\n  Seconds after that, there was an objection to David Hayes to be \nDeputy Secretary of Interior. They filibustered this nomination. We had \nto go through all these procedural votes. In the end, he was confirmed \nunanimously. So even the person who objected to going to this \nnomination ultimately supported the nomination, which leads one to ask: \nWhat is the motivation of what is going on here?\n  In May, they objected to proceeding to the Family Smoking Prevention \nTobacco Control Act. Ultimately, it passed with 79 votes in June. Twice \nwe had to file procedural motions, cloture motions to get the credit \ncard bill in front of the Senate. Ultimately, it passed with 90 votes.\n  In July, we had to file again. We had to go through the slow process, \nstart the 30-hour clock, another 30-hour clock, waste time on the floor \ntrying to get the Homeland Security bill up, which passed with 84 \nvotes.\n  The Defense authorization bill, another absolutely critical bill that \neveryone agrees must move forward for our troops, for our security, was \nheld up on the floor most of the month of July and ultimately passed \nwith 87 votes.\n  In September, the Interior funding bill, the same thing. It \nultimately passed with 77 votes. Finally, last week, Republicans \nobjected to even going to the conference committee.\n  When we look at this, we have a bill that passes with 87 votes on \nDefense authorization, goes to conference committee, comes back, \nanother objection, have to do a cloture vote, run the clock, and then \nthe bill passes with 68 votes.\n  That leads us back to where we are today. Twice there were objections \nto bringing up the extension of unemployment compensation for millions \nof American families, middle-class families who are caught in the \nmiddle of an economic tsunami. They did not create it.\n  It is our job to create the economic framework to support the jobs \nthat need to be created. We are focused on that, laser focused on that. \nEvery piece we do relates to jobs, whether it is health care, energy \npolicy or financial reform. Whatever it is, it all comes back to jobs. \nBut we take 3 weeks to get in front of us a bill on which ultimately, \nlast night, 87 people voted to proceed.\n  We have a new President of the United States this year. There was an \nelection. There is a new Congress. We know there are differences on \nsubstance, and that is what a democracy is all about, honest \ndifferences. I have differences on specific policy issues. But what we \nsee here is a conscious strategy that has to stop. It has gone on all \ntoo long. We have many challenges as a country that need to be \naddressed. We have families in crisis who need us to act, and this has \nto stop.\n  We can no longer continue to see this number go up from 82 to 85 to \n90. Who knows where this will end, who knows, in terms of objecting to \nmoving forward, objecting to taking up bills.\n  We have one of the most important issues that I know I will ever \naddress or have worked on in my time in the House or Senate coming \nbefore us on health care reform. We have differences. We have people of \ngood will who have differences. We will have a motion whether to even \nproceed to the bill and debate those differences. Yet my assumption is \nthat almost all--hopefully not all--almost all the Republicans in the \nSenate will vote no to even proceeding to discuss it.\n  We are in one of the most important times in our country's history. \nWe don't have time for this. We don't have time for these ongoing \nantics that just burn the time on the clock, stop us from taking votes, \nstopping us from getting the team in place so the administration can do \ntheir work, stopping us from solving problems, extending unemployment \ncompensation, focusing on jobs, focusing on health care costs, tackling \nwhat we need to do for clean energy. We don't have time. The American \npeople don't have time. Our country doesn't have time to waste on items \nthat are blocked that eventually have overwhelming support.\n  We know there are times when we all feel passionately about \nsomething, when there are divisions in the Senate, when we choose to \nstop moving forward. We all have been in that position, and I respect \nthat decision. I certainly hold that as a right of mine, as it is for \neach of us. But what we are seeing over and over are efforts to slow-\nwalk the business of this country, of solving problems, and then when \nwe get to the end, such as yesterday, there are 76 votes or 90 votes or \nit is unanimous. That is what I am objecting to--the strategy of \nstopping the people's business from getting done. I hope as we go \nforward on health care and go\n\n[[Page S10809]]\n\ninto the new year, we will be able to focus on the substance of things, \ndebate that vigorously--as we will--but stop what is the gratuitous \nobjection over and over and over just for the purpose of saying no.\n\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support the unemployment extension \nlegislation that is in front of us. There is a sense of urgency. As I \nindicated before, we have a situation where we have over 148,000 \npeople, just in the last 3 weeks, who have lost unemployment benefits--\n7,000 people, every day we debate this, every day it goes back to the \nHouse, every day before it goes to the President. It is time to get \nthis done.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the \npending business before the Senate, the unemployment insurance \nextension, and I rise today to say that it should come as a surprise to \nno one that we have a jobs crisis in America. To help fix it in the \nshort term, we need to extend unemployment insurance benefits to help \nfamilies who are suffering through the worst job market in many years, \nnot obstruct and stonewall to score political points.\n  I sometimes wonder whether my colleagues understand that people's \nlives are in the balance. It is not a time for political grandstanding, \nnot a time to once again say no--no to everything, no to the people who \nneed help. This is not a time for amendments about ACORN or E-Verify--\namendments that have been offered and voted on on the floor of the \nSenate time and time and time again. It is nice that those people who \noffer them get their paychecks direct deposited every 2 weeks. This is \nnot the time to offer those amendments again after the job crisis this \nadministration inherited.\n  Unemployment in New Jersey is at 9.8 percent, just shy of double-\ndigit unemployment, and the experts tell us it will get worse before it \ngets better. This is not the time to keep saying no, especially when we \nare trying to come out of the policies of the last 8 years that brought \nus to these present economic circumstances, the policies of the last \nadministration that favored the bottom line over the lives of people--\nWall Street over Main Street--and sent millions of jobs overseas, \nleaving us vulnerable to any economic downturn, let alone one as severe \nas the one we were left with.\n  When the economy sheds 263,000 jobs in 1 month alone, it is a crisis. \nWhen 14.9 million Americans are unemployed, and we know that there are \nonly 3 million jobs available, it is not the time to say no. When over \na third of all unemployed--more than 5 million Americans--have been \njobless for 6 months or longer, and 500,000 Americans will exhaust \ntheir unemployment benefits this month--1.5 million by the end of the \nyear--we have to say yes to extending unemployment benefits.\n  We could recite the numbers all day. We could hold up chart after \nchart showing State by State the unemployment figures. But as the \nPresiding Officer knows, from his own comments on the Senate floor, the \nnumbers don't tell us what this is all about. It is about people and \ntheir lives and their hopes, and the look on their faces when the bill \ncomes due and the fear that they could stand to lose everything. \nEverywhere I go, when I am back home, someone comes up to me and I see \nthat look on their face. It is a look of panic. It is a look of \nanguish. They lost their job after the holidays, their benefits are \nabout to run out, they lost their health care, they are behind on their \nmortgage, their husband or wife is working two part-time jobs to try to \nmake up. The story of these troubled times is not in the numbers, it is \nin the faces of those families who are looking to us for help.\n  The numbers are significant, but they are merely a snapshot frozen in \ntime. The truth of joblessness in this country is an ever-changing \nstory of men and women who are one check away from ruin--mothers and \nfathers who have struggled all their lives to make ends meet, who had a \ngood job for years, made a decent wage, then saw 8 years of government \npolicies that favored Wall Street over Main Street. They watched their \ncompanies downsize for greater productivity and send jobs overseas. \nThey watched their friends being laid off. They went to bed at night \npraying that they would not be next, and then they got the news: They \nwere next.\n  But they had hope because of the wisdom of Franklin Roosevelt, who on \nAugust 14, 1935--74 years ago--signed into law the Social Security Act, \nwhich included the first provisions for unemployment insurance. The \nRepublican opposition in his day called him a socialist and they tried \neverything they could to stop the New Deal, notwithstanding an economy \nin depression. For F.D.R., the story was not in the numbers, it was in \nthe faces of the people in grainy black and white photographs, of bread \nlines and old women selling apples on street corners.\n  Today the faces of the unemployed are no different. Their need for \nhelp is the same, and our duty to provide it is the same.\n  This is about them. It is about real people who maybe, just maybe--if \nwe have the will and the wisdom to do what is obviously right sooner \nrather than later--will look across the kitchen table tonight, knowing \nthey are able to hold on just a little longer.\n  I know there are those who have bought into the notion that \ngovernment is the problem for everything; that it can do nothing right \nand should stay out of just about everything; that the free market \nshould be left to its own devices and everyone should fend for \nthemselves without government oversight or involvement. Those are the \nsame views that fought the New Deal. They fought against Social \nSecurity and Medicare and civil rights. They supported Reaganomics. \nThey told us the government was the problem and Wall Street knows best.\n  I think history, especially recent history, has proven them wrong. \nGood, well-run, decent, honest government can be part of the solution. \nThis is one of those times when it is government's responsibility to \nact. Extending unemployment insurance is what we, as responsible \ngovernment leaders, must do when there are those in the community who \nhave no other option. This is not a time to say no. To delay voting on \nthis bill is to turn our backs on millions across this Nation who are \nstill unemployed and facing financial disaster. To look into their \nfaces and say no is not who we are as a people or what we stand for as \na nation. We are a community, united by shared values and common \nconcerns, not a nation of 300 million disconnected individuals. The \nplight of any one of us should be a concern to all of us.\n  The Federal Government stepped in at the right time to help companies \nwe determined were too big to fail--not for the sake of them failing \nbut for the sake of what they would do to our national economy. We said \nthey were too big to fail. I say the American people are too big to \nfail. Now we have to step in and help them. This is America. We do not \nlet the situation get the best of us. We take it as an opportunity, as \nFranklin Roosevelt did, to renew the promise of this Nation, to \nrecommit ourselves to the concept and spirit of community--one nation, \nindivisible.\n  Whether that means 20 more weeks of Federal aid for those who still \ncannot find a job, those who wake up every day with the want ads in one \nhand and their resume in another trying to figure out how they can \nmatch them up and get that job, or whether it is providing incentives \nto home owners to boost the economy, we have always risen to the \nchallenge. We have done it before, and we can do it again. This is our \nchance for each of us in this Chamber to do what is right for every \nAmerican who is looking to us for a little help and a little hope. It \nis not the time to say no again.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S10810]]\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be \nallowed to proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Thank you, Madam President.\n  We are in a time when we are talking about money; we are talking \nabout debt; we are talking about taxes; we are talking about stimulus; \nand we are talking about health care. I wish to put the whole situation \nwith respect to money into some perspective.\n  Having been a businessman, I did my best to try to draw up a balance \nsheet for the United States. This is a very simplified balance sheet. \nIt is in summary numbers only. But by going to the Federal Reserve \nBoard and the Social Security and Medicare trustees and the Census \nBureau, I have come up with the following balance sheet for citizens of \nthe United States.\n  We start out with assets and liabilities. These are personal assets \nand personal liabilities. It is amazing to me that the number of \nhousehold assets on a per-person basis is this high, but it is. If you \ntake all of the personal assets in the United States, lump them \ntogether, and then divide them by the number of people in the United \nStates, you get personal assets of $218,000 per person, and personal \nliabilities or household debt of only $45,000 per person. So the \nbalance sheet looks pretty good.\n  However, as citizens of this country, we have debt beyond our \npersonal debt. So when we add the national debt and each individual's \nshare of it to the balance sheet, that adds an extra $37,982, so that \nthe amount of debt goes up when you add each individual's share of the \nnational debt.\n  The national debt is not the only debt we have. Let's add State and \nlocal government debt on a per-person basis, and it goes up another \n$7,500. But that is not the only debt we have. We have obligations, \neach one of us, with respect to Social Security. There is a Social \nSecurity liability and the present value of that Social Security \nliability is another $17,251 per person.\n  All right. It still looks like a pretty good balance sheet. With the \nassets at $218,000, this is about half. But there are two other \nliabilities we have to put on the balance sheet. The first one is the \npresent value of Medicare hospital insurance. Over the next 75 years, \nthe present value of that unfunded liability is $43,616 per person, \nalmost as much as the total amount of debt that each one of us has as \nan individual. Now the balance sheet is looking a little scarier.\n  But we have one more item we have to put on the balance sheet, and \nthat is the present value of Medicare supplemental medical insurance, \nand that is another $79,095 per person. So when you add it all up, this \nis the balance sheet we are facing today: $218,000 in assets, and \n$231,000 in liabilities. If this were a corporation with this balance \nsheet, we would say the corporation is underwater.\n  As we begin to break this down, we realize that the Medicare \nliability is more than everything else put together. The Medicare \nliability is more than our personal debts, our share of the national \ndebt, our share of State and local debts, and our share of Social \nSecurity. The Medicare liability is more than all of that put together. \nIs it any wonder, then, that the No. 1 issue we should be talking about \nwhen we are talking about health care is how to get the health care \ncosts under control; to use the terms that the budgeteers use, how to \nturn the cost curve downward on health care. We can talk about \nearmarks. We can talk about spending on appropriations bills. We can \ntalk about holding down discretionary spending on other issues. All of \nthose things are worth talking about, but they are dwarfed by the \nchallenge of turning down the cost curve on health care.\n  I have said this before, but it still works: One of the statements \nthat has gotten into American folklore is a statement attributed to \nWillie Sutton. Willie Sutton was a bank robber. Not very many people \nknew much about his robbing banks, but he kept doing it. He would get \narrested, he would get out on parole or he would leave prison and he \nwould rob another bank. Finally someone said to him: Willie, why do you \nkeep robbing banks? He said: Because that is where the money is.\n  If we are going to talk about the balance sheet that every American \nfaces in debt and debt obligations, we have to talk about health care \nbecause that is where the money is: more for health care liabilities \nthan everything else put together.\n  Let's discuss this question of turning the cost curve down. How good \na job have we done as a government in making projections as to the cost \nof health care? On the second chart, let's look at the years and at the \nprojections. In 1965 when Medicare was first proposed, we made a cost \nprojection. We, the government, made a cost projection as to how much \nit would cost us, and that is represented by that red bar there on that \nchart. Then the actual numbers came in, and they are represented by the \ngreen bar on the chart. Let's look at 1965 Medicare hospital insurance. \nThat is a separate program. The cost projection is there in the red \nbar; the actual figures that came in are in the green bar. In 1987, we \nadded Medicaid, and the Congress told the people: Medicaid won't cost \nmuch at all. You see, it is hard to find even on the chart. The actual \ncost was 17 times the projection that was made. In 1988 we added \nMedicare for home care. It was going to cost a little more. Once again, \nthe gap between the red bar and the green bar--it has always cost more. \nWe did a little better with SCHIP, but SCHIP is still a relatively new \nprogram, created in 1997, so the disparity between the projection and \nthe reality is relatively small, but, once again, the reality has been \ngreater than the projection.\n  There is one exception, and that is Medicare Part D, and that is the \nfinal pair there. The red bar shows what was projected that Medicare \nPart D would cost and the green bar shows, almost magically, this one \ncosts less than the projection. Why?\n  I wish to quote from an editorial in the Wall Street Journal where \nthey quote from White House Budget Director Peter Orszag. Peter Orszag \nwas the head of the Congressional Budget Office at the time that cost \nprojection was made. This is what the Journal has to say:\n\n       But as White House budget director Peter Orszag told \n     Congress when he ran the Congressional Budget Office, the \n     ``primary cause'' of these cost savings is that--\n\n  quoting from Orszag\n\n     the pricing is coming in better than anticipated, and that is \n     likely a reflection of the competition that is occurring in \n     the private market.\n\n  I will repeat that: That is a reflection of the competition that is \noccurring in the private market.\n  The Journal goes on to point out something I recall, because I was \nhere during that debate. I was part of that debate. The Journal says:\n\n       Liberal Democrats fought that private-competition model \n     (preferring government drug price controls), just as they are \n     trying to prevent private health plans from competing across \n     state borders now.\n       The lesson here is that spending on nearly all federal \n     benefit programs grows relentlessly once they are \n     established. This history won't stop Democrats bent on \n     ramming their entitlement into law. But every Member who \n     votes for it is guaranteeing larger deficits and higher taxes \n     far into the future. Count on it.\n\n  The history of cost containment with respect to health care is not a \npleasant one. The history of predicting what health care will cost is \nnot a pleasant one. The only example we have where costs have come in \nlower than projected has been in that circumstance where competition in \nthe private sector has been protected. That has been the core of the \nbill Senator Ron Wyden and I have introduced as the Healthy Americans \nAct: private competition absent a government plan. We look at the \nhistory and see that will turn the cost curve down. That will begin to \nsave money.\n  CBO examined our bill. Peter Orszag was the head of CBO when they \nlooked at our bill and said it is revenue neutral--that is a good \nstart--and then likely to save money in the future. They didn't put a \nnumber on it, but the Lewin Group has put a number on it and said that \nthe Healthy Americans Act, cosponsored by Senator Wyden and myself, \nwould save $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years. I don't know whether \nthat number is right or wrong. I do know. It is wrong. I don't know how \nfar wrong it is. But the point is it demonstrates turning the cost \ncurve down rather than turning the cost curve up. And that is what we \nhave to\n\n[[Page S10811]]\n\ndo, as our balance sheet reminds us so dramatically.\n\n  Let me talk briefly about the idea of a government-run plan, a public \noption, or whatever it is we want to call it, as the way to turn the \ncost curve down. Once again, the history of government plans is not \nencouraging as far as turning the cost curve down as we look at \nMedicare and how little it was supposed to cost and how dramatically \nmuch it has cost.\n  Let me quote Robert Samuelson from his column that appeared in the \nWashington Post recently:\n\n       Medicare has low marketing costs because it's a monopoly. \n     But a non-monopoly public plan would have to sell itself and \n     would incur higher marketing costs. Private insurers' profits \n     (included in administrative costs) also explain some of \n     Medicare's cost advance. But profits represent only 3 percent \n     of the insurance industry's revenue. Moreover, accounting \n     comparisons are misleading when they don't include the cost \n     of Medicare's government-supplied investment capital.\n\n  So we are trying to mix apples with oranges when we say, look at the \nlow administrative costs with Medicare and the high administrative \ncosts with private insurance. Medicare can do it cheaper. Every \nprojection about Medicare doing it cheaper has demonstrated not to work \nout.\n  Samuelson says this:\n\n       The promise of the public plan is a mirage. Its political \n     brilliance is to use free-market rhetoric (more ``choice'' \n     and ``competition'') to expand government power. But why \n     would a plan tied to Medicare control health spending, when \n     Medicare hasn't?\n       . . . A favored public plan would probably doom today's \n     private insurance.\n\n  I think that is true. That is one of the reasons I am opposed to that \nkind of thing.\n  Samuelson goes on to make this final comment:\n\n       Many would say: Whoopee! Get rid of the sinister insurers. \n     Bring on a single-payer system. But if that's the agenda, why \n     not debate it directly? It's not insurers that cause high \n     health cost; they're simply the middlemen. It's the \n     fragmented delivery system and open-ended reimbursement. \n     Would strict regulation of doctors, hospitals and patients \n     under a single-payer system provide control? Or would genuine \n     competition among health plans over price and quality work \n     better?\n       That's the debate we need.\n\n  I agree. That is the debate we need. That is the debate that focuses \non, how do you get this cost curve under control? How do you start to \nturn it down? How do you get the kind of score that Senator Wyden and I \nhave gotten from CBO that says our plan is revenue neutral and that \nothers say will save $1.3 trillion over the next 10 years, compared to \nthe cost history of government-run plans that say they are only going \nto cost this much and end up costing that much and driving us to this \nkind of present value liability--twice as much as everything else put \ntogether. That is a staggering thing to contemplate, but that brings us \nback to what I said in the beginning. The core of this debate should be \nfocused on how we turn the cost curve down.\n  I have one more comment to make with respect to that. As I have \nworked with Senator Wyden over the last 3\\1/2\\ years to try to \nunderstand this issue and come up with solutions to it that make \nmarketplace sense rather than political sense, I have come to a great \ntruth that we don't seem to be discussing in this debate at all, and \nthat is this: The greatest cost control factor in health care is \nquality. The best health care is the cheapest. And we have built into \nthe system now incentives that drive us away from the best care. Most \nof the perverse incentives that drive us away from the best care and to \nthe highest costs are in Medicare. They are in the Medicare system that \nhas gone 10 times, 20 times above its original cost, and they are still \nthere, and the care they produce is less than the maximum care people \ncan get when they go to the places that give us the best health care.\n  It is parochial for me to repeat this, but I am happy to do it on \nevery occasion. Dartmouth has done a study as to where the best care is \navailable throughout the United States, and they said it is in three \ncities: Seattle, WA; Rochester, MN; and Salt Lake City, UT. And then \nthey say that if every American got his or her health care in Salt Lake \nCity, UT, it would be the best in the United States and one-third \ncheaper than the national average, and that is because of a variety of \nreasons. They practice the best health care, and they have focused on \noutcomes rather than the kinds of perverse incentives that are built \ninto government-run programs.\n  We have a lot to do and a long time to go before this health care \ndebate is finished, but I hope we recognize that hanging over us, \nregardless of everything else we say with respect to health care, is \nthe fiscal reality that our current value obligations for health care \ndwarf every other debt we have in the United States. Personal household \ndebt, the national debt, State and local debt, and Social Security debt \nall put together do not add up to the amount of health care debt we are \nfacing.\n  The challenge of turning the cost curve on health care down is the \nNo. 1 issue we should be addressing as we are talking about this. The \nirony of it is, if we are successful based on what we know, we can get \nthe cost curve down and produce a better health care outcome and \nresult.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for 10 \nminutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN. Madam President, I will talk about the extension of \nunemployment benefits, which is as important as health care in the next \n2 months to this country, to our economy, and to people's way of life. \nWhat we do in the next day or two on the unemployment extension is \nparamount.\n  Some 400,000 Americans across the Nation, in every State--it doesn't \nmatter if it is John McCain's State or Barack Obama's State or if it is \na big or small State--400,000 Americans exhausted their Federal jobless \nbenefits last month. More than 14,000 Ohioans are among the 200,000 \nAmericans who will lose their benefits this month if we don't act. By \nthe end of the year, more than 64,000 Ohioans will exhaust their \nunemployment benefits if there is no extension coming from the House, \nSenate, and the White House. Despite my Republican colleagues' efforts \nto dismiss the statistics, these are not just numbers; they are people \nin every State in our Nation.\n  Let me tell you about some Ohioans who deserve more consideration \nthan they are getting from my Republican colleagues.\n  Sandra from Van Wert County in western Ohio, on the Indiana border, \nwrote this in a letter:\n\n       There were more than 300 of us who were locked out of our \n     factory in April 2008--only a handful getting new jobs.\n\n  Mr. President, this is a small town where 300 jobs are very hard to \nreplace.\n\n       Several of us went back to school for more education, but \n     unfortunately, only one person in our class has even gotten a \n     job.\n       It is not that we are just sitting around collecting \n     unemployment. We are trying to improve our skills and to be \n     gainfully employed.\n       I had 30 years of employment at the same company and now I \n     am on my own and my unemployment runs out in 2 weeks. There \n     are a lot of people who are running out of unemployment every \n     day.\n       I have used all but $200 of my savings and I know others in \n     the same situation. Please help us.\n\n  I thought a lot about this issue as I read these letters in my office \nand on the floor. Part of the problem is that not very many colleagues \nreally know any unemployed workers. Not very many people here spend \ntime as a single parent trying to make ends meet or spend time with \nsomebody who is laid off because of a plant closing. We don't spend \nenough time with small business owners, with a mom-and-pop operation, \nmaybe running a store or something, and they cannot make it because \npeople have lost jobs in their community. We don't spend our time with \npeople who are really suffering. We don't see them enough.\n  Let me tell you about Dawn from Cuyahoga County in northeastern Ohio, \nthe Cleveland area. She wrote:\n\n       I lost my job two years ago and my mother passed away 6 \n     months afterward. If not for a friend who allows me to sleep \n     on a couch, I would be homeless.\n       I have worked hard ever since I was 15, but now I find \n     myself applying for so many positions over and over.\n       I consider myself lucky when I get the exceedingly rare \n     call for an interview. But if the proposed [unemployment] \n     extension doesn't pass soon, I honestly don't know how I'll \n     survive.\n       Please, Senator, make whoever's blocking this extension see \n     reason. There are a lot of us in Ohio who are really hurting.\n\n\n[[Page S10812]]\n\n\n  I know there are a lot of people in Charlotte, Raleigh, and Durham in \nthe Presiding officer's State and in Galion, Zanesville, and Xenia in \nmy State who are trying to find jobs. They are barely getting along on \ntheir unemployment checks. If the unemployment runs out, they cannot \nget anything. It has to be extended before it runs out. That is why \ntime is of the essence.\n  Every day Republicans delay and obstruct, more Americans and their \nfamilies will slip into poverty. It is not just a human tragedy, it is \nanother blow to the tough economy this country is enduring. Poverty \nreduces consumer spending and increases the need for public assistance. \nThat is two steps back without one step forward.\n  Let's not forget that unemployment insurance is not retroactive. As I \nsaid a minute ago, once unemployment insurance is exhausted, whether \ntoday or last week or last month, they are not eligible for the \nextension. So we have to do this. Every day we wait hurts another \nhundreds and hundreds of families in Ohio and North Carolina and all \nover this country.\n  The Senate bill would extend unemployment insurance for 14 weeks in \nall States, plus an additional 6 weeks in high-unemployment States--\nthose States above 8.5 percent unemployment, such as Ohio. This means \nunemployed workers in Ohio, such as Sandra and Dawn, whose letters I \nshared, would receive a total of 20 weeks' additional unemployment \ncompensation. They are not choosing to just sit home and get \nunemployment. As you can see from some of the letters, people are \ndriving from rural areas, driving county by county, to urban areas, \nknocking on doors over and over to find jobs.\n  The unemployment insurance in the Recovery Act has kept 800,000 \npeople out of poverty. That means fewer Americans on Medicaid, fewer \nAmericans with income assistance, food stamps, and other public \nassistance programs. This isn't welfare; this is an insurance policy. \nEvery paycheck, workers pay something into the insurance fund.\n  It is not just what it does to help workers, but every dollar in \nFederal extended benefits produces $1.64 in economic growth. It is not \nas if they are taking this money, this check of $200 or $300 a week in \nunemployment benefits, and investing in a factory in China. It is not \nas if they are blowing this money. They are using this money to buy \nschool clothes for their kids, to buy food, maybe even to go to a movie \nonce every month or two. Maybe they are putting a little money in the \nchurch plate. Whatever they are doing, they are spending this money, \nnot holding it. That is why it is $1.64 in economic growth with every \ndollar we send into a community. In the first 6 months following \npassage of the Recovery Act, unemployment insurance pumped about $19 \nbillion into the economy. I wonder how many jobs and how much more \neconomic activity would have been lost without unemployment insurance \nputting dollars into workers' pockets, into local communities, boosting \nconsumption, and saving jobs.\n  How much longer are we going to let people like Melody, from Geurnsey \nCounty in east central Ohio, go without the insurance they so \ndesperately need.\n  Melody wrote to me saying:\n\n       We need help in Guernsey County and all around Ohio.\n       I look for work every week, traveling 75 to 100 miles, \n     going to counties in every direction from Noble, Belmont, \n     Muskingum, Harrison, Washington, Coshocton, and Licking.\n\n  She goes to that entire area where she lives looking for a job.\n\n       And after making phone calls, I've been told not to call \n     back because there are no jobs.\n       My unemployment is running out. What am I supposed to do \n     until I find a job?\n\n  Again, that is Melody from Guernsey County.\n  It is unacceptable, irresponsible, and par for the course that the \nRepublicans want to play politics and come up with amendments that \ndon't have anything to do with extending unemployment benefits, but it \nhelps them with messaging for the next election and scores political \npoints with the newspapers back home and scores big political points \nwith talk radio, which cheers them on and says: Keep trying to \nembarrass the Democrats.\n  The fact is, these workers at home are not Democratic workers, they \nare not Republican workers, they are not Independent workers. These are \npeople who have lost their jobs. These are people who need assistance. \nThese are people who want to go back to work. These are people who will \nbenefit not just from the unemployment check they get to keep their \nheads above water but the money they put into the community so there \nwill be job growth in the months ahead, and the people will, in fact, \nget back to work so they will not need their unemployment benefits.\n  We need our Republican colleagues to start putting Americans first, \nahead of their reelection campaigns, ahead of their message campaigns, \nahead of their appeals to talk radio, and start helping to move us \nforward on the extension of unemployment benefits not tomorrow, not \nnext week but this afternoon.\n  I yield the floor.\n  THE PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mr. KAUFMAN pertaining to the introduction of S. 1959 \nare printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, 3 weeks ago we came to the floor of the \nSenate and asked our Republican colleagues to join us in a bipartisan \neffort to extend unemployment compensation benefits for those across \nAmerica who have lost their jobs. This fairly routine and common \npolitical request was met with opposition from the Republican side. It \ncame as a surprise because we know the unemployment we face in this \ncountry is not confined to States represented by Democratic Senators, \nit is nationwide. The recession has cost us so many jobs and, sadly, I \nam afraid that, although there are signs of recovery, it will be some \ntime before many unemployed people actually do get back to work.\n  It is said there are six unemployed people for every available job. \nThe frustration that creates for those who are unemployed is obvious. \nSo the object of our request was to ask our Republican colleagues to \njoin us in extending unemployment insurance benefits for those who are \nabout to see them expire.\n  Unfortunately, the Republican side objected, and they objected \nbecause they said they wanted to offer some amendments. It is not \nunusual to offer an amendment to anything that comes to the Senate \nfloor, but in the case of an emergency such as this, an economic \nemergency where people have, within the last few weeks or months, seen \ntheir livelihood extinguished because they have no job and no benefits \ncoming in, it is a little hard to understand why some Members on the \nRepublican side of the aisle insist on offering amendments that have \nvirtually nothing to do with unemployment.\n  Let me give one example. The Senator from Louisiana wants to offer an \namendment that would, once again, punish an organization known as \nACORN. ACORN is not in Illinois--it has not been for many years--so I \ndon't know on a personal basis, but from what I read, it is an \norganization involved in grassroots organizing. It helps organize \nStates to pass increases in the minimum wage in each State. They have \nalso organized to register voters in many States. They have been \ninvolved in counseling people who are about to lose their homes to \navoid foreclosure.\n  Having said those good things, there were clearly acts of wrongdoing \nby employees of ACORN. In fact, a couple\n\n[[Page S10813]]\n\nwere videotaped. What we saw on those videotapes, a few weeks ago, was \nnothing short of outrageous. The employees involved were fired by \nACORN. I have suggested, if there is any criminal activity associated \nwith it, it should be investigated and prosecuted, no ifs, ands or \nbuts. But, unfortunately, this has become a big cause on rightwing \nradio and TV: go after ACORN. Some Senators are inspired by that to \ncome to the floor on a frequent basis and offer ACORN amendments--one \nafter another after another. We think some four or five different \namendments have been offered, ways of punishing ACORN.\n  The House has already passed an amendment saying ACORN cannot do \nbusiness with the Federal Government. There have been amendments \noffered--I have offered one of them--calling for a complete \ninvestigation of the organization. Other appropriations bills have \nlimited any expenditures involving this organization. So it is not as \nif it has been ignored or glossed over or excuses are being made. There \nis a full investigation being ordered, action taken against it.\n  But for some Senators, particularly one from Louisiana, it is not \nenough. We have to go back and debate ACORN again. We have to debate it \non a bill for unemployment benefits for hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans.\n  Another Senator wants to extend a program called E-Verify. E-Verify, \nconceptually, is sound; that is, you could verify whether a person \napplying for employment is, in fact, a citizen; that you could have a \nnumber or computer contact verifying the name and Social Security \nnumber of the person. It is sound in principle, but it turns out in \noperation it has been a problem. Many times, the numbers have not \nmatched when they should have, people have been disqualified from jobs \nwhen they should not have been, and the system clearly needs to be \nrepaired and improved. It will last for 3 more years, this system, if \nwe do nothing. A Senator from Alabama has come to the floor and said he \nwants to make this a permanent program, despite some of the obstacles \nand problems we currently have with it.\n  So a Senator from Louisiana wants to flog ACORN, this organization, \nagain; a Senator from Alabama wants to extend a law beyond the 3 years \nit is going to be in existence to make it permanent; and they are \nholding up unemployment benefits for people all across America. We are \nnow doing nothing in the Senate except making speeches because these \nSenators insist on their amendments and will not agree to unemployment \nbenefits until they get them.\n  Twenty-one days after we requested an extension of unemployment \nbenefits, the Republican Senators and leadership are continuing to hold \nus up. Two hundred thousand Americans will lose their unemployment \ninsurance this month if the Republicans continue to obstruct a vote to \nextend the benefits. To put it in perspective, around 200,000 people \nlive in Birmingham, AL, and in Montgomery and in Mobile. The \nRepublicans are refusing to help roughly the number of people who live \nin the three biggest cities in that State, all because a Senator wants \nto vote to extend, permanently, the E-Verify Program.\n  Around 200,000 people live in Baton Rouge, LA, and in Shreveport as \nwell. Republicans are refusing to help roughly the number of people who \nlive in those two biggest cities in Louisiana outside New Orleans, all \nbecause the Senator from Louisiana wants one more chance to give one \nmore speech for one more amendment about ACORN. Yes, one more.\n  Meanwhile, here is what I learned from one of my constituents in \nChicago who wrote and said:\n\n       I have been out of work 9 of the last 12 months. I have \n     applied for over 200 jobs and I still am unemployed. I am \n     educated, worked since I was 15 years old and cannot find \n     work. I have applied for everything from hourly to above my \n     skill level including city and state jobs and have not heard \n     from most.\n       Further, Peoples Gas cut off my service this week--for \n     months I have let them know what I was able to pay and have \n     paid it, they still cut off my service. What are we citizens \n     to do. . . .\n       My son and I will be living on the street any day. Where is \n     the help?\n\n  That is from one of my writers from Chicago. Here is a letter from a \nwoman in Genoa, IL.\n\n       . . . I am currently one of many who is unemployed and \n     almost out of benefits. I have 2 young children I am \n     responsible for and have made a full time effort to look for \n     work. I have applied at gas stations, McDonald's, \n     restaurants, everywhere. There are just no jobs. Can you \n     please tell me if the Senate will be voting on the extension \n     [of unemployment benefits] sometime soon? I am expecting my \n     last check next week and then I don't know what I am going to \n     do about keeping a roof over mine and my children's heads.\n       Please help us from becoming homeless. Any kind of response \n     on this issue would be greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\n  How can my colleagues on the Republican side hear stories like that, \nif they are even listening to these unemployed people, and refuse to \nhelp so they can come to the floor and debate their amendments? For \ngoodness' sake, tomorrow is another day. There will be another chance \nto give a speech and debate an amendment. Why wouldn't you let the \nunemployment compensation benefits go forward for people such as those \nwho have written to me? The unemployment rate in my State is 10.5 \npercent, and I think it is my duty to help these people with a safety \nnet that will help them get by while they are just one out of six \napplicants for every available job. While they struggle to keep food on \nthe table and a roof over their heads, we ought to be doing our part in \nthe Senate.\n  Apparently, yesterday when we voted to go to the unemployment \nbenefits, 13 Republican Senators voted no, against moving to the \nextension of unemployment benefits. In case some of those Senators \nmissed it, here are the unemployment rates in the States represented by \nthe Republicans who voted against even debating an extension of \nunemployment insurance: Texas, 8.2 percent; Mississippi, 9.2 percent; \nMissouri, 9.5 percent; Alabama, 10.7 percent; Kentucky, 10.9 percent; \nSouth Carolina, 11.6 percent. I don't understand it. How could you \nrepresent a State with over 10 percent unemployment and vote against \nunemployment benefits for the people there who are searching for jobs? \nThat, to me, does not represent family values. It doesn't represent \nwhat this Senate ought to be about. For goodness' sake, it doesn't \nrepresent the kind of bipartisanship that was always behind voting for \nunemployment benefits.\n  This Republican obstruction, when it comes to something this basic, \nis fundamentally unfair. It is way past time. We should not be playing \ngames and posturing. We ought to stop the politics. We ought to be \nvoting in the next 5 minutes so we can respond to the people who write \nto us in desperation and tell them, in fact, we are moving the bill \nforward so they will have the basics in life to take care of their \nfamilies.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  I also wish to say a word or two about health care because that is \nthe issue that, while we work on others, is coming to the floor soon \nfor a historic debate. Senator Reid, the Democratic majority leader, \nhas sent a bill to the Congressional Budget Office to score it, which \nbasically means to find out will it cost us money. If so, will it add \nto the deficit? Will it reduce the costs of health care? The \nCongressional Budget Office is doing that analysis at this current \ntime.\n  It is clear we desperately need this because we find fewer and fewer \nbusinesses offering health insurance across America, and the cost of \nhealth insurance is going up so fast people cannot afford it. The New \nYork Times reported that insurance brokers and benefits consultants say \nsmall business clients are going to see premiums go up on health \ninsurance an average of about 15 percent for the coming year. That is \ndouble the rate of last year's increase. When Republican Senators come \nto the floor--and they did this morning--and say: Let me tell you, if \nyou pass health care reform, the cost of health insurance will go up, \nwhat they don't say is, if you don't pass health care reform, health \ninsurance costs will go up anyway and possibly higher. What we are \ntrying to do is slow the rate of growth in the cost of health care \nacross America.\n  In one national survey, nearly three-quarters of small businesses \nthat did not offer benefits cited high premiums as the reason. So as \nthe premium costs go up and businesses offer less coverage, individuals \nhave to go out on\n\n[[Page S10814]]\n\ntheir own and it is even more expensive. Small businesses pay up to 18 \npercent more than large firms. What we have tried to do in the health \ncare reform we are working on is to give small businesses a chance. I \njoined with Senator Blanche Lambert Lincoln of Arkansas as well as \nSenators Snowe and Collins of Maine in introducing the SHOP bill, which \nhas become part of the health care reform.\n  It is an effort which we put together with the help of the National \nFederation of Independent Businesses and the National Realtors \nAssociation and the SEIU labor union to try to find a way that small \nbusinesses could afford health insurance, allow them to pool into \nlarger groups, allow them to shop from a market of health insurers so \nthey would have some choice to lower the cost, the overhead costs they \nface, and to lower the premium costs, so small businesses could offer \nhealth insurance.\n  But it is not just small businesses that are stuck. Many Americans \nactually stay in jobs today because they are afraid that if they move \nfrom one job to another, they will lose their health insurance. Even \nbusiness owners, the risk takers among us who have so often led us out \nof the recession, are less willing to take that risk when it comes to \npeople who are sick and need employment.\n  Melissa Wilhelm in Chicago knows what I am talking about. Melissa \nspent years as a research associate, then decided it was time for a \nchange in her professional life. She felt she had outgrown the position \nshe was in. She said: I did not want to put the widget in the hole \nevery day.\n  Melissa had good reason to want the most out of each day. Only a \ncouple of years earlier, at the age of 35, Melissa had been diagnosed \nwith stage IV lymphoma, an aggressive type of cancer that affects the \nlymph nodes. As frightening as her diagnosis was, one thing Melissa did \nnot worry about was how she was going to pay for her cancer treatment. \nShe had a good health insurance policy. In fact, she had two, one \nthrough her employer and another one through her graduate school.\n  In 2006, thank God, Melissa went into remission. It was after her \nrecovery that Melissa decided it was the time for a career change. She \nwanted to start her own education consulting company.\n  Knowing her medical history, she knew her first step was to meet with \na health insurance agent. Melissa said the agent actually laughed in \nher face. Getting affordable health insurance as a self-employed cancer \nsurvivor is apparently a laughable request in the world of insurance. \nMelissa was not alarmed at that point. She qualified for 18 months of \nCOBRA coverage and assumed she would have enough time to shop around. \nBut a couple of months later, she came home from vacation to bad news: \nher COBRA insurance had been terminated. She apparently missed paying \none monthly payment. It had been sent to the wrong place. But for \nCOBRA, since she missed the payment, it was the end of the story, the \nend of her coverage. She was not refunded the $2,000 she had already \npaid in premiums; they just cut her off. Suddenly, she became one of \nthe uninsured, a cancer survivor without insurance.\n  She had one last option: the Illinois Comprehensive Health Insurance \nPlan, our State's high-risk pool, a pool for those individuals unable \nto buy health insurance otherwise. But the coverage would not come \ncheap; it would cost her $780 a month, plus a $2,000 deductible--a \nprice she had no choice but to pay. As she waited for her coverage to \nbe finalized, she put off checkups and CAT scans. It was risky, but, as \nshe said: I did not want to drag myself and my family into bankruptcy. \nThose apparently were the choices: go to the doctor or face \nbankruptcy--not much of a choice in modern-day America.\n  We know health care costs are a major factor in two out of three \nbankruptcies in our country today. How many families can even entertain \nthe idea of paying $25,000 a month for chemotherapy? Not many. And none \nof us should ever be in a position where professional growth is not an \noption because it means giving up health care coverage.\n  Melissa said: People do not have the ability to leave their jobs. \nThey cannot afford to be more productive or more challenged. That is \nnot the American spirit. And Melissa is right.\n  Melissa was living the American dream, pursuing new goals and \nopportunities with the entrepreneurial spirit we need in this country. \nBut she was stopped--stopped cold because of her lack of health \ninsurance.\n  Melissa eventually succeeded and started her business as an \neducational consultant. She is currently helping evaluate Chicago \npublic schools at risk of failure and developing good practices so that \nstudents can do better. With a Ph.D. in child development policy, \nMelissa is certainly up to the task. I think we can use more people \nlike her, determined to improve their lives even though they have to \nbattle cancer and the health insurance companies at the same time. \nHealth care reform will free more people to leave dead-end or \nunfulfilling jobs and to pursue new goals without fear of becoming \nuninsured.\n  Today, many of the unemployed spend countless hours trolling job \nsites, motivated at least in part by the desperate need for health \ncare. What if these people had a safety net, a health care option \noutside of employer-provided health care? Maybe, like Melissa, they \nwould strike out on their own, open the restaurant or the business they \nalways wanted to open. Maybe those businesses would grow, employ more \npeople.\n  It is clear that small businesses suffer in today's health insurance \nmarket more than most. It is extremely difficult for those businesses \nto compete against big firms that are able to spread the cost of \nunexpected illness across a large pool.\n  The bottom line is this: We have a health care reform bill that is \nnow being carefully reviewed, as it should be. It is one we will debate \nat length. The critics will come to the floor, as they did this \nmorning, and will tell us what is wrong with the bill. But the fact of \nlife is, those who are criticizing the bill have no alternative. Their \nalternative is to stay with the current system.\n  The current system of health care in America is too expensive, the \ncost is going up too quickly, fewer and fewer people are insured each \nyear, and more of us are bearing the costs of the insured as they are \ntreated in hospitals and by doctors who pass along that cost to other \npeople.\n  We are the victims of health insurance companies which on a whim can \ndeny coverage, can claim there was a preexisting condition unreported \nor a cap on the amount of money they will pay, or the fact that you are \nsick, they just do not want to be there. That is the reality of what we \nface today.\n  Those on the other side of the aisle who will not participate have \nopted out of the health care debate and really have little room to \ncriticize unless they want to step forward with their own proposal and \ntheir own plan. And the honest answer is, they don't have one. They \ndon't have an answer.\n  I hear from many of my constituents who ask me what we are going to \ndo to get this economy moving again. That is our highest priority. But \nin addition to that we have to liberate families and businesses and \nindividuals from the fear they have of health insurance they can't \nafford, health insurance companies that just say no, or the fact that \nlosing or changing a job can cost them the peace of mind they need to \nprotect their families.\n  We can do a lot more for the American people. I hope we will have the \ncooperation of the Republican side in doing this. It would be great if \nwe had a bipartisan bill. I hope my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle will come around and be part of the solution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, first let me thank my colleague and \nfriend from Illinois for, as usual, his articulate, right-on-the-money \nand right-to-the-point remarks which I agree with.\n  Right now, many middle-class families are facing the prospect of \nlosing the unemployment benefits they are relying on to get them \nthrough this recession. Out-of-work Americans consider these benefits a \nlifeline. But too many Republicans are treating this like a political \nfootball. If Congress does not act to extend these benefits, nearly 2 \nmillion Americans will lose their unemployment insurance by the\n\n[[Page S10815]]\n\nend of the year--2 million. They have families, people who depend on \nthem. And 90,000 of those are in my home State of New York. That is 2 \nmillion people--90,000 in New York--who have been trying to find work \nand are now going to have their safety net pulled out from under them. \nWell, we cannot pull the rug out from under so many Americans. We owe \nit to them to do the right thing and extend unemployment insurance.\n  It is a mystery to me why so many on the other side of the aisle are \nblocking passage of this legislation. Everywhere I go in New York--\ndownstate, upstate, large cities, urban suburbs, rural areas--people \ncome up to me with a pleading look in their eyes: Can you please renew, \nextend unemployment benefits?\n  What in the heck are we waiting for? Why are we putting people \nthrough this agony? So far, Republicans have been opposed to this \nextension as they seek to extract political amendments out of Leader \nReid. It is just another example--the latest one--of a stalling \nstrategy. On one legislative priority after another, their motto has \nbeen the 1980s slogan ``Just say no.'' But if there is one thing this \nrecession and budding recovery has taught us, it is that America can't \nrecover leaving behind our workforce.\n  There is a general view that since much of the first stimulus package \nhas not yet impacted the economy, a second one is not necessary. But \nunemployment benefits are the quickest, most effective form of economic \nstimulus, and they are aimed at the weak point of this economic \nrecovery, which is jobs. The dollars get out the door fast and will be \nspent by those who don't have another source of income at a time when \nwe need to boost consumer demand.\n  So I plead with my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: Stop \nplaying the games, and let's just pass unemployment insurance. I know \nthere are lots of extraneous amendments on all kinds of issues that you \nwish to debate. Leader Reid has been very generous in allowing debate \nafter debate on these amendments, much to the chagrin, frankly, of many \non this side of the aisle. This is one time when we should put the \ngames aside. We should just unite. My guess is that unemployment \ninsurance extension will get a large high vote on both sides of the \naisle. Stop playing politics with this benefit extension. Extending \nunemployment benefits is crucial to ensuring that as our economy picks \nback up we do not leave the recession's victims in the dust.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I rise today to join my distinguished colleague from \nNew York, Senator Schumer, to express my strong support for extending \nunemployment benefits for workers around this country who continue \ntheir struggle to find jobs in this weak economy.\n  The problem is especially acute in my home State of Rhode Island, but \nthis is a national problem, and it is creating significant unhappiness, \nsignificant distress, and significant woe in families all around the \ncountry as they approach the end of their unemployment benefits and \ncannot find a job. And the end is coming up for so many people. We \nreally need to do something about it.\n  Right now, we are on a motion to proceed to the Unemployment \nCompensation Extension Act of 2009. We are not actually on the bill yet \nbecause our colleagues on the other side of the aisle are using every \navailable form of procedural delay. It is not hard to figure out why \nthey are doing it. There are only so many days in the year. There are \nonly so many days the Senate can be in session. And when they force \nthese votes and when they force delays, what they are doing is burning \nthe work time of the Senate. They would like to burn the work time of \nthe Senate because that inhibits the President, that inhibits us, it \ninhibits progress, and that presently is their motivation. They are the \nparty of no. And because they do not have the votes for a lot of this \nstuff, until they can get to it, they are the party of slow. And we \nhave had innumerable--I think the record right now is that we are at 82 \nefforts--to filibuster or force the majority leader to file cloture. We \nhave had votes forced on judges. Some of the judges went through with \nhuge margins by the time the vote actually came, but they wanted to \nburn the time. Indeed, as the Presiding Officer, the distinguished \nSenator from Illinois, may recall, the other day we voted on a judge, \nand the vote was 100 to 0. Yet they had to force a vote. Why? To burn \nthe time of the Senate to prevent progress.\n  This should be one bill where they would stand down from their \nmission to be the party of no and the party of slow. Because since \nOctober 8--when they first put up the procedural obstacles to this \nbill--to now, 7,000 Americans a day have lost their coverage. They have \ncome to the end of their unemployment coverage. It has expired, and \nthey have lost their incomes.\n\n  As the Senator from Illinois, the distinguished Presiding Officer, so \ndistinctly knows, there are millions and millions of families in this \ncountry who live paycheck to paycheck and when they lose their jobs, \nthey live unemployment check to unemployment check while they \ndesperately seek work to feed their families and put a roof over their \nheads.\n  This bill--if we could get to it, and if we could vote on it--would \nprovide a badly needed lifeline to those Americans, and I would hope at \nsome point our Republican colleagues would relent and simply let us \nmake this decision, which is in everyone's best interest. It is \ninhumane, frankly, to put those families--7,000 a day--through the \ntorment of coming to the end of their income and having to think about \nlosing their houses, losing their cars, not paying for their \nprescriptions, not paying for their food, worrying about their \nchildren--all of that. That is an awfully high price to score political \npoints on this floor and to be the party of slow and the party of no. I \nwould hope their point of view will change.\n  I want to, first, applaud the efforts of my senior Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Jack Reed. He has long been a champion of helping the \nunemployed, and he has played a critical role in getting this \nlegislation to the floor for the Senate's consideration. \nNotwithstanding the fact that our Republican colleagues are interfering \nwith allowing us to pass this legislation, Senator Reed's leadership on \nthis issue has been remarkable, has been commendable, and we in Rhode \nIsland are fortunate to have his service.\n  One of the reasons Senator Reed is so concerned about this is because \nour home State--the State of Rhode Island--has the third highest \nunemployment rate in the Nation. We broke 13 percent last month. That \nis the highest level Rhode Island has seen for unemployment since World \nWar II.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, over 74,000 Rhode \nIslanders are currently looking for work. There are 74,000 families \nwith a wage earner out of work in a State with just over 1 million \npeople. At that level, there are very few Rhode Islanders who are not \ntouched in some way by our unemployment crisis.\n  Families are struggling through this recession in every State, but \nthe situation is particularly dire in States such as Rhode Island, \nMichigan, and Nevada where the unemployment level has hit double digits \nand is climbing still. People who have worked their entire lives have \nbeen unable to find work this year. The economies of the worst hit \nStates are getting worse, and the unemployment benefits continue to run \nout.\n  I have heard from hundreds of constituents who fear they will be \nunable to keep their families fed or keep the electricity on or keep up \nwith their prescription drugs when their unemployment benefits expire. \nMy State is in economic crisis, and we need help.\n  One of my constituents, Carole, from Centerdale has degrees in \narchitecture and business, but she has been unable to find work for 18 \nmonths. She has two children. They are 12 and 15. Her unemployment \nbenefits have run out. Without more help, she may lose her home.\n  I send out my good wishes to Carole and my thoughts to her for a \ncomplete recovery. She has recently suffered a heart attack. She is \nrecovering nicely,\n\n[[Page S10816]]\n\nand I wish her well in her health. But we could do a lot for her if we \ncould clear this bill so she did not have to look at her 12-year-old \nand her 15-year-old and, in this market, say: I don't know where our \nincome is coming from now because this government cut off the \nunemployment benefits.\n  Another constituent is Patricia. She is a 51-year-old woman from \nWarwick. She has been unemployed for 17 months. She spends over $300 a \nmonth for her prescriptions, and she can no longer afford to keep up \nthe COBRA payments that will protect her if she gets seriously ill. \nWithout assistance, she may need to go into bankruptcy.\n  I tell just these two stories, although there are thousands more from \nthose 74,000 Rhode Island families, because the statistics are \nsobering--13 percent unemployment, the highest level since World War \nII. That is a deeply distressing statistic. But behind those statistics \nare these personal stories, over and over again, thousands of examples \nof human suffering, human courage, that we must not ignore as we \nquarrel over irrelevant amendments and do not get to the business of \nhelping these people in their hour of need.\n  I am pleased that in addition to the 14 weeks of benefits this \nlegislation would provide to unemployed workers in all States, workers \nin States with the worst job markets would receive an additional 6 \nweeks. That additional time is desperately needed by Rhode Islanders, \nwho, day after day, week after week, pore through the want ads looking \nfor the job postings and hoping that the next interview will be the one \nthat puts them back on their feet again.\n  I am confident the economy of Rhode Island and the economy across the \ncountry will recover. It always does. But right now it looks as though \nit will take time. Economists say the stock market tends to be a \nleading indicator of recovery, while employment numbers are lagging \nindicators of recovery. This means the recent uptick in the stock \nmarket should lead to more jobs being available in the future. But \nuntil then, unemployed Rhode Islanders such as Carole and Patricia, \nunemployed Americans across our country, need their government to help \nprovide the bridge to those better days.\n  I implore my colleagues to join me in supporting swift passage of \nthis urgently needed and--I hope once we cut through the fuss--\nultimately noncontroversial unemployment benefits extension.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I enjoyed the comments of the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island. He is one of the most \nthoughtful and intelligent Members of the Senate. I always enjoy \nlistening to him. But I have a different characterization of what we \nare doing in the Senate.\n  He pointed out that the majority leader believed it was necessary to \ncut off debate 82 times; that was a record. I do not believe I would be \nbragging about that. This is the Senate. What that means is the \nmajority leader has said to the minority: Be quiet. Don't debate. We \ndon't want your amendments--82 times.\n  The House of Representatives is the place where we have the train \nthat runs through according to the majority. That is not the Senate. \nSenator Byrd, the senior Democrat, the senior Senator, has written four \nbig volumes about the history of this body and what is unique about the \nSenate. Our Founders said: We will have one popular body where there is \none man one vote, one woman one vote, and whoever has the majority the \ntrain runs through. So whatever Speaker Pelosi wants, Speaker Pelosi \ngets. That was the view of the Founders more than two centuries ago. \nBut we are going to have a little bit different Senate.\n  Do you know what the idea of the Founders was, the Founders, whom we \nrevere and admire? Unlimited debate. Unlimited amendment. That is the \nSenate. That is the only reason we have it. There is no need for the \nSenate if we do not have that.\n  When Alexis de Tocqueville, the young Frenchman, came to this country \nin the 1830s and wandered around our Nation and wrote that perceptive \nbook, ``Democracy in America,'' which every serious student of the \nAmerican Constitution in our country discovers, he saw one thing he \nworried most about in the new American democracy, and it was, in his \nwords, the tyranny of the majority. He said the Senate was the one \ninstitution which helped work against the tyranny of the majority.\n  So this is the body that protects the minority view. It does slow \nthings down. In the case we are talking about, unemployment \ncompensation, we have already voted to limit debate on unemployment \ncompensation. That is what we are talking about today.\n\n  I see the Republican whip on the Senate floor. As I recall, the vote \nto limit debate on unemployment compensation was overwhelmingly \nbipartisan, was it not?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, could I just interrupt?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Thank you.\n  To answer my colleague quickly, I think the vote was 87 to 13, or in \nthat general range. Almost all Republicans voted to conclude the \nunemployment compensation legislation by getting to the process where \nwe could offer amendments and then have a vote on the final passage.\n  But I would ask my colleague from Tennessee, have Republicans been \nafforded the opportunity to offer five amendments? How about four \namendments, three, two, one? Obviously not. Have Republicans been \nafforded the opportunity to offer any amendments, I would ask my \ncolleague? Then I have a follow-up question.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenator from Arizona and I be allowed to engage in a colloquy on this \nsubject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I believe the answer is no. If I am not mistaken--if I \nam not mistaken--I say to my friend from Arizona, the Democratic side \nhas a nongermane amendment they would like the Senate to bring up, and \nI believe the Republican side has a nongermane amendment we would like \nto bring up. They are saying: Because we are in the majority, we are \ngoing to run over you. That is the tyranny of the majority. That is \nwhat Alexis de Tocqueville warned against, and we are saying: No, you \nare not. We are elected from Arizona and Tennessee to represent our \nconstituents. If you are going to run over us, we might as well go \nhome.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could further inquire of my colleague, \nis it not the Senator's understanding that of all of the issues the \nAmerican people are concerned about today, the No. 1 issue is jobs and \neconomic recovery--how do they get back to work?\n  When our friends from the Democratic side say: We need to hurry up \nand extend unemployment compensation, my guess is the vote on that will \nbe overwhelming. I will support it. I am sure my colleague will support \nit. That is not the question. The question is, Instead of just \ncontinuing to extend unemployment compensation for all of the increased \nnumber of Americans who are out of work, what are we going to do to put \npeople back to work?\n  Then I have one other question to ask my colleague. I may not be \ncorrect that it is the No. 1 issue in public opinion surveys, but I \nrecall it is pretty high on the list.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I think the Senator is exactly right, \nand we on the Republican side--and I believe some Democrats do as \nwell--have some proposals about how to restart housing. We would like \nto deal with that on this issue as well. But the Senator is exactly \ncorrect. The No. 1 issue for most Americans is what to do about jobs. \nUnemployment is about at the rate of 10 percent.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could further inquire, the first thing \nwe want to do is find out how much this unemployment extension is going \nto cost. I think the number is about $2.4 billion. The second thing we \nwant to find out is, how is it going to be paid for? I understand it is \nproposed to be paid for by a continuation of a tax on payroll; that is \nto say, employers and employees will have to pay a certain percentage \nof the employee's wage to the Federal Government in order to provide \nfunds to those who are unemployed.\n  Some of us are concerned if our goal is to put people back to work, \nto allow\n\n[[Page S10817]]\n\ncompanies to hire more people, that the worst thing we would want to do \nis impose another tax on hiring, another tax on employees or, to be \ntotally accurate, to extend the existing tax on workers, on payroll, as \na way of paying for the extension of unemployment benefits. Perhaps a \nbetter way to pay for that would be, for example, to take the $2.4 \nbillion out of unspent and unobligated stimulus funds, which was $780-\nsome billion, half of which is not going to be spent for the next 8 \nyears--or over the period of the next 8 years.\n  One of the amendments we wanted to offer was not just to extend \nunemployment benefits but to pay for it in a way that would not harm \njob creation, as is contemplated under the bill. Am I correct in that?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Senator from Arizona is correct. And as a member \nof the Finance Committee, he has once again come up with a very good \nsuggestion. He understands better than some appear to that if we add \ntaxes to payrolls, it makes it more likely that payrolls will be \nsmaller or there will be fewer jobs. So if we can find a way to pay for \nunemployment compensation that does not add to the debt and does not \nadd to payroll taxes, that is worth taking a little time to do.\n  Mr. KYL. I know my colleague wanted to talk about student loans, so I \nwill close my point here.\n  The whole point, when colleagues and friends of ours on the other \nside of the aisle say: Well, Republicans are just trying to slow this \ndown; the answer is: No, we could have been done with this bill 24 \nhours ago. All that was necessary was a simple agreement between the \nmajority leader and the minority leader that the minority would get a \ncouple of amendments. One of them is an amendment to say, Let's pay for \nthis worthy cause of extending unemployment benefits in a more sensible \nway with respect to job creation; at least in a way that isn't going to \ncost us jobs, to prevent employers from hiring more people. Let's pay \nfor it by taking some of the unobligated stimulus funds that won't be \nspent for another 6 or 7 years and achieve our goal in that way. But \nno, no agreement to do that. The majority says no amendments, take it \nor leave it.\n  If you ask for amendments, then you are slowing the process down and \nsomehow standing in the way of those who are unemployed. The benefits \nhaven't run out yet. We are going to pass this before the benefits run \nout. That is not the question. You can either come down here and make a \npitch to people to make it sound as though you are trying to help them \nand the other side is not or you can try to do things the right way. I \nsubmit that on this, the right way is to pay for it in a way that \ndoesn't cost jobs because our goal here ought to be to put people back \nto work.\n  I would also say that if the majority were serious about getting this \nlegislation completed, they would not in the middle of the process have \nparachuted onto the floor a bill that around here was called the ``doc \nfix''--a most unfortunate term--a bill that was going to add $250 \nbillion to our debt in relationship to the reimbursement of physicians \nwho provide Medicare benefits. The minority didn't do that. Republicans \ndidn't do that.\n  My point is that a week ago we could have had an agreement to \nconclude work on the extension of unemployment benefits that would have \ntaken maybe 24 hours, maybe 48 at the most. We would have had the \nbenefit of voting on a couple of amendments, which I think are very \nwell taken, directly relating to the subject, germane amendments, but \nfor some reason the majority has not seen fit to permit that to happen.\n  So as friends around the country consider what is the reason for this \nbeing slowed down, I hope there would be a better appreciation of the \nreason why this has been delayed. A, we didn't ask for the delay. The \ndelay was occasioned by action by the majority leader by, first, going \nto another bill and, secondly, by filing cloture and, third, by not \nagreeing to allow the minority to have a couple of amendments.\n  Finally, I would say I wish we did have that opportunity because I \nthink when we do support this, it will be a better bill by not only \ntaking care of those who find themselves without a job today but \nhelping to find a way to get them back to work, and that ought to be \nour primary goal.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, if the Senator from Arizona has another \nminute, I thank him for coming to the floor because he has pointed out \nthe value of taking a little time on these important pieces of \nlegislation. He has suggested a way we can not only extend unemployment \ncompensation benefits, which almost all of us want to do, but a way to \npay for it in a way that creates more jobs rather than fewer.\n  There is another example. The Senator from Rhode Island was \ncomplaining about the 82 times that the majority leader has invoked \ncloture, and I was saying that was nothing to brag about. We should be \ncomplaining about that, because that is 82 times he has cut us off. In \ngeneral, he has allowed during this year a fair amount of amendments, a \nfair amount of debate. But take the health care bill for a moment. It \ntakes a little time. Over in the House I hear they may run that through \nin 3 days. That is not going to happen here. When we have time to stop \nand think about it--the same thing happens on this floor that happened \nlast week. We had our first vote on health care and the question was, \nShall we raise the debt \\1/4\\ trillion dollars?, and 13 Democrats \njoined all Republicans and said no.\n  We have another important vote coming up soon that might be called a \nprocedural vote but, in fact, is a vote for or against a bill.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, if I could comment on that, that is another \nvery important point. I think Americans very much want to engage in a \ndebate about health care reform. I think Republicans are anxious to \nengage in that debate here on the Senate floor. But, first you have to \nhave a bill. You can't just have a debate on the floor; you have to \nhave a bill you are debating.\n  We are told there is a bill. It was written in the majority leader's \noffice with some people from the White House and a couple of other \nDemocratic Senators, and then the bill was sent to the Congressional \nBudget Office to be scored, for a cost estimate to be developed. I know \nseveral people have said, Could we see the bill? Could you share that \nbill so the American people can see what we are talking about here? So \nfar, no luck. No bill. If we are talking about getting this debate \ngoing on health care, one would think that we would get the bill \nwritten, we would get it out there, we would all get a chance to read \nit, our constituents would have a chance to understand what is in it \nand, by the way, know how much it costs.\n  I ask my colleague from Tennessee, are Republicans doing anything to \nslow down the bill or making it public or understanding it?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. We are here every day. We want to do what the Senator \nfrom Arizona said. We want to read the bill and we want to know what it \ncosts because when we hear about it--and the Senator from Arizona was a \npart of the Finance Committee that developed one bill; I was a part of \nthe HELP Committee that developed another bill. What we hear is that \ninstead of lowering premiums, which is the idea for 250 million \nAmericans, it will probably raise premiums; that it will raise taxes; \nthat it will cut Medicare by $450 billion.\n  Now we learn from the majority leader this week that there will be a \nnew government-run insurance program. We are going to put the \ngovernment in the insurance business with a ``State opt-out,'' whatever \nthat might mean. I am a former Governor. I am wondering, Does that mean \nwe can opt out of the taxes as well as the benefits? So the Senator \nfrom Arizona is right. We are here. We are ready to go to work. We are \nanxious to read the bill, but it is being written behind closed doors.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague, the minority \nleader yesterday in a press conference talked about this bill that has \nbeen written. I am not actually even sure it has been written. \nObviously, we have never seen it. All the majority leader has chosen to \ntalk about publicly is the so-called public option. So maybe that one \nfeature of it has been written.\n  My point is it isn't Republicans who are slowing anything down. As \nfar as this health care debate is concerned, I think we are very \nanxious to engage in that debate now. As my colleague from Tennessee \npointed out, we are not going to be in debate on a bill which is going \nto raise taxes, raise premiums,\n\n[[Page S10818]]\n\ncut benefits under Medicare, increase the deficit, reduce the quality \nof our health care, and I am not going to vote to begin work on that \nkind of a bill, but I certainly will vote to begin work on a bill which \nmeets the primary objective.\n  There are two primary things we need to try to resolve. One is to \nmake sure we could get insurance to about 18 million Americans who \ncan't afford it and don't have it, and the other is to keep premiums \nfrom going up. As the Senator from Tennessee pointed out, under the \nlegislation that came out of the Finance Committee and out of the House \nof Representatives, insurance premiums go up more than they otherwise \nwould have--according to who? The Congressional Budget Office, the \nnonpartisan entity that we all ask to analyze these things. There are \nmany other studies that came to the same conclusion.\n  So I am not anxious to begin working on a bill that does those \nthings, but so far we haven't seen any bill.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I could ask one more question of the Senator from \nArizona, who is giving a lot of time to this discussion. I thought this \nhealth care debate was supposed to be about reducing costs--the cost to \nthe government and the cost to people buying premiums. Whatever \nhappened to that goal?\n  Mr. KYL. Well, I would say to my colleague, something happened to it \non the way to the Senate, I guess. Because, first, the bill is going to \ncost somewhere between $800 billion and $1 trillion. That is obviously \nmoney that isn't being spent today that will be spent tomorrow. I don't \nknow of any American who believes you can have a $1 trillion new \ngovernment program and not add to the debt, but we are told: Wait for \nthe details; we will show you.\n\n  There is only one way to make sure it doesn't add to the debt: Raise \ntaxes so much that you cover the costs of it. Then that gets to the \nother half of the equation. What about for the American people? Are we \ngoing to be better off? No. It turns out we are going to have our taxes \nincreased by $400 billion, Medicare cut by almost $500 billion--by the \nway, if it is ever cut. There is a question about whether we will ever \nachieve those savings; we never have in the past--in which case the \nbill is then out of balance by $500 billion; $500 billion in debt. So \neither there is going to be a big debt there or seniors are going to \nsee their benefits lost.\n  But I wandered off the point. My colleague was asking, Wasn't the \nexercise here to reduce costs. Yes. And what will the bills do? It will \nincrease costs for the Federal Government so, therefore, the taxpayers. \nIt will increase costs for all Americans in the form of higher taxes, \nsome imposed directly on us. For example, if we don't comply with the \ngovernment forcing us to buy insurance, the Congressional Budget Office \nsays other taxes will be passed directly through to us. For example, \nthere is a tax on the manufacturers of medical devices. If you have an \nangioplasty or some kind of heart problem and they put a little stint \nin there, one of those very high tech items, that is going to get \ntaxed. Why should you be taxed on something that makes you well? I \ncan't understand that. But in any event, the tax is first on the \nmanufacturer and it will be passed on to the consumer, so increased \ntaxes.\n  Finally, my colleague asked about premiums. According to CBO, the \npremiums will go up over what they otherwise would have been. The \nOliver Wyman study that I think is very credible on this said the \naverage would be $3,300 per year per person. In my State of Arizona, it \nwas over $7,000, an increase in insurance premiums over what it \notherwise would be. When Americans see that, they are going to say, \nWhere is the reform? This is a lot worse than it was before.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Senator from Arizona. All of this got \nstarted because the Senator from Rhode Island had complained that the \nDemocratic leader had to cut off debate 32 times, and my response was \nthat was nothing to brag about; that is what the Senate is for. That is \nhow the Founders created it.\n  I appreciate the Senator from Arizona pointing out that in the case \nof unemployment compensation, we all want to extend the benefits. We \nthink we may have a way to do that in a way that creates more jobs \nrather than taxes on jobs. In the case of health care, yes, we want to \ngo slow enough to be able to do two things: Read the bill, know what it \ncosts, because we want to make sure that if we pass a health care bill, \nwe are not the Congress of higher premiums, higher taxes, Medicare \ncuts, and adding to the debt. I think the American people want to make \nsure we do that as well. So I am grateful that we have the Senate. We \nare always a little more grateful for those rules when we are in the \nminority, because they protect our rights to represent the people who \nelect us and to ask us to offer amendments. But the American people \nhave been served very well by a Senate that has different rules and \nprocedures.\n\n\n                             Student Loans\n\n  I wish to say a word about a subject which has nothing to do with \nhealth care and nothing to do with climate change, which is the other \nsubject I have been in hearings on today, but it is a subject that will \naffect millions of families in America, and that is the question of \ngoing to college and student loans.\n  All of us can imagine the anxious moments in our family lives--and \nthere are a number of them, including when a baby is born or when the \ndaughter goes out on her first date; when someone is sick; when a child \ngoes off to college. But one of the most anxious moments comes just \nafter the first of every year when, in millions of homes across \nAmerica, students and their parents wait to see if they have been \nadmitted to college and to which college. The next anxiety comes when \nthey turn to the various options they have to see whether they can \nafford to go to that college.\n  Fortunately, in America we have the best system of higher education. \nWe not only have the best colleges; we have almost all of the best \ncolleges. We have 6,000 autonomous institutions of one kind or \nanother--public, private, religious, secular, profit, for-profit--among \nwhich students may choose. Second, even though prices have been going \nup, we have bent over backward in this country to try to make it \npossible for the largest number of Americans to attend college. \nSeventy-seven percent of Americans who attend college--nearly 20 \nmillion--have a Federal grant or Federal loan to help them do that.\n  So just after January--and I want to paint this picture--in homes \nacross America, we have millions of students, millions of families who \nare waiting for their college admissions and then will turn to the \nquestion of: Can I get some help paying the bills. Specifically, we \nhave 14 million--if next year is anything like last year and the year \nbefore--14 million of those students who will be going to college on 35 \ncampuses who will be borrowing $60 million through the Federal Family \nEducation Loan Program--what we call the traditional student loan \nprogram.\n  We have two types of loan programs. We basically have one through two \nthousand lenders, profit and nonprofit, across the country. For \nexample, we have an organization called Edsouth in Tennessee that is \nnonprofit. It offers a variety of student loan options to Tennessee \nstudents. It has five regional outreach counselors to provide college \nand career planning, financial aid training, college admissions \nassistance, and financial literacy. It makes 443 presentations at \nTennessee schools through college fairs, guidance visits, and \npresentations. It works with 12,000 Tennessee students to improve their \nunderstanding of college admissions and the financial aid process. Last \nyear, Edsouth provided training to over 1,000 school counselors and \ndistributed 1.5 million financial aid brochures.\n\n  The various lending institutions--profit and not-for-profit--are \nusually in these communities and easy for these 14 million students to \nget to. There is another group of students--about a fourth to a third \nin total--who choose to go another route in getting a student loan, \ncalled direct lending. They borrow directly from the government. This \nwas set up as a pilot program when I was the Secretary of Education in \nthe early 1990s. It was set up to see whether the traditional student \nloan program, which is through your local bank or nonprofit, was \nworking right, and what was best for students.\n  Students and colleges have voted over the years with their practices. \nFor\n\n[[Page S10819]]\n\nexample, in Tennessee, most Tennessee campuses and most Tennessee \nstudents choose the traditional student loan program. At the University \nof Tennessee, where I was once president, in Knoxville, there are \n30,000 students, and 11,000 have a Federal loan. They get that through \nthe traditional loan program, not the government direct loan program. \nAt Maryville College, in my hometown, where my parents went, 824 of \n1,100 students have a Federal loan. They get that through the \ntraditional loan program. At Carson-Newman, at Jefferson City, where I \nam going Friday to help inaugurate a new president, with 2,000 total \nstudents, 1,259 have a Federal loan. I can go through each of the \ninstitutions in our State. You can see the number of families that any \nchange in the student loan program affects, and if you add the anxiety \nthat comes with receiving your college admission and worrying about \nwhether you can pay the bill--you can see the problem that causes.\n  The reason I came to the floor is that for those 14 million \nstudents--more or less--who, in January, February, and March, would be \nexpected to turn to the traditional student loan program, we are about \nto have a 14-million car pile-up on the interstate highways of American \neducation because of action taken by the U.S. Department of Education.\n  The Secretary of Education--a man I greatly admire--has sent a letter \nto the various schools--3,500 or so campuses--that now use the \ntraditional loan program, and he said you better get ready for the \ngovernment-run program, and you need to do it because I may not be able \nto continue to offer the traditional loans.\n  That is a big mistake. I want to point out the reasons. First, there \nis not time to switch, even according to a New York Times article.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the Secretary's \nletter to the campuses and the New York Times article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                 October 26, 2009.\n       As this academic year moves forward, it is hard to believe \n     we already need to consider the 2010-2011 year to come. In \n     doing so, I am writing to seek your assistance and offer mine \n     in taking the necessary steps to ensure uninterrupted access \n     to federal student loans by ensuring your institution is \n     Direct Loan-ready for the 2010-2011 academic year.\n       Eighteen months ago, uncertainty in the financial markets \n     seriously threatened the availability of Federal Family \n     Education Loan (FFEL) Program loans for the upcoming 2008-09 \n     academic year. Congress acted quickly to provide the \n     Department of Education with unprecedented temporary \n     authority to directly finance loans made through FFEL Program \n     lenders. The goal was to ensure that every student or parent \n     with a need for a federal loan would be able to get one, \n     whether or not the student's educational institution had \n     taken the steps to provide loans through the Direct Loan \n     Program (where loan access was not affected). This stopgap \n     measure, the Ensuring Continued Access to Student Loans Act \n     (ECASLA), was helpful in assisting FFEL Program lenders in \n     making $61.3 billion in new loans to students and their \n     parents this past year. And the bulk of those funds--some \n     $46.3 billion--was provided by the Department of Education.\n       While many institutions like yours continued to use the \n     FFEL Program loan delivery process last year, more than 500 \n     others responded to the uncertainty by switching to the \n     Direct Loan Program. These colleges' move to direct lending \n     happened in an efficient and effective manner, without any \n     interruption of service to students, and the number of Direct \n     Loans increased by nearly two-thirds compared to the previous \n     year. As you know, the Direct Loan Program provides students \n     with the same types of loans, with essentially the same \n     terms, as those made in the FFEL Program.\n       I do not anticipate any major loan access problems during \n     the remainder of this academic year because Congress's \n     temporary measure remains in effect. However, while there are \n     encouraging signs that the financial markets are rebounding, \n     the most prudent course of action is for you to ensure that \n     your institution is Direct Loan-ready for the 2010-2011 \n     academic year. That way, loan access for your students will \n     be assured. As you may know, President Obama has proposed \n     that Congress make the loan system more reliable by moving to \n     a 100 percent Direct Loan delivery system. In any event, \n     under current law, ECASLA will expire, and the continued \n     participation of FFEL Program lenders will be in question.\n       The Department of Education stands ready to assist with any \n     questions you and your staff may have about becoming Direct \n     Loan-ready. Many institutions have already taken the initial \n     step of contacting us to ensure the appropriate transition \n     steps have been taken at Federal Student Aid to begin the \n     process. If your school has not taken this initial step, we \n     recommend that you do so. Please also reach out to your \n     technology, financial aid, and business offices to make sure \n     they are working together to ensure federal loan access for \n     your students and their parents. If they are unsure of the \n     steps to take, please have them contact our school relations \n     center, or e-mail us with questions.\n       Thank you for your attention to this important matter.\n                                                      Arne Duncan,\n     Secretary of Education.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the New York Times, Oct. 27, 2009]\n\n               Colleges Are Pushed To Convert Loan System\n\n                            (By Tamar Lewin)\n\n       Congress has not given final approval to legislation ending \n     federal subsidies for private student loans for college. But \n     Secretary of Education Arne Duncan sent a letter Monday to \n     thousands of colleges and universities urging them to get \n     ready to use the government's Direct Loan Program in the \n     2010-11 school year.\n       The House of Representatives last month passed the Student \n     Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act, expanding the government's \n     direct lending and ending the current program of government \n     subsidies and loan guarantees for private lenders. Under that \n     law, all colleges would be required to convert to the federal \n     Direct Loan Program by July 1.\n       But the Senate has yet to take action on the legislation, \n     and it is uncertain whether it will do so before the health \n     care debate is resolved.\n       Meanwhile, most of the nation's 5,000 colleges and \n     universities have not taken the necessary steps to convert to \n     direct federal lending. The letter, sent to some 3,000 \n     campuses that have never used direct lending, was an effort \n     to prod them into action.\n       ``Some campuses are thinking they'll wait until Congress \n     acts, but to wait is to endanger loan access for students,'' \n     said Robert Shireman, the deputy under secretary of \n     education.\n       In the past year, Mr. Shireman said, about 500 institutions \n     have switched from the subsidized program, the Federal Family \n     Education Loan program, into direct federal lending.\n       A year and a half ago, when uncertainty in the financial \n     markets threatened the availability of private loans, \n     Congress passed a stopgap law to ensure that families with \n     financial need could get student loans, even if their college \n     was not in the federal direct loan program.\n       But that temporary legislation, which colleges used to make \n     billions of dollars worth of new loans in the past year, will \n     expire in June. And even if Congress does not act to end the \n     subsidized lending program and require direct federal \n     lending, there is no guarantee that any lenders will continue \n     with the private loan program.\n       Private lenders are fighting to stop the switch to direct \n     federal lending. And at their third-quarter earnings \n     conference call last Wednesday, executives of Sallie Mae, a \n     private lender, spoke of the ``transition risks,'' saying \n     many schools' financial aid offices are thinly staffed, have \n     only just finished processing loans for this academic year \n     and would have trouble making the transition to a new lending \n     system in time for next year.\n       Mr. Shireman said that for most colleges and universities, \n     it takes three weeks to four months to make the switch, which \n     requires changing computer programs and retraining financial \n     aid administrators.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The Secretary's assistant says it takes at least 3, 4 \nmonths for colleges to switch their computers around, so instead of \noffering aid through a traditional program, they offer it through the \ngovernment direct loan program. There will be a lot of confusion in \nJanuary, February, March and April. There is not time to switch.\n  Second, the Secretary has gotten ahead of himself. The President has \nproposed a Washington takeover of the student loan program, but this \nWashington takeover requires congressional approval. We have more than \none branch of government in this town. I know the House of \nRepresentatives has passed the President's request, but there's one \nmore--the United States Senate has not approved the President's \nrequest, and I hope it does not. It is a bad idea.\n  So I hope the Secretary will write another letter and say I have \nchanged my mind, given the lateness of the situation in the year--we \nare almost to November--and the fact that it takes up to 4 months for \nany college to make a changeover, and because most students will begin \nto receive their college admissions in January and February, et cetera. \nI hope the Secretary will say I am going to take a little different \napproach and work with Congress, recognizing that the Congress has to \napprove this proposal as well.\n  First, we are going to extend the law that was passed a couple of \nyears ago,\n\n[[Page S10820]]\n\nwhich provides emergency financing to back up all of the traditional \nstudent loans that are made. That has worked out very well. The \ninstitutions participating have paid large fees to the government and \nstudents have gotten their loans. We can extend that another year. It \ndoesn't expire until June.\n  Second, the Secretary might say that I am going to work with Congress \nto make some changes in the existing student loan program to make it \nright. We can talk about ways to do that.\n  Third, I hope he will say I am going to work with Congress to set up \na transition time that is appropriate for any colleges that want to \nmove from the traditional student loan program to the government-run \ndirect loan program.\n  When time comes for us to debate and act on whether there should be a \nWashington takeover of student loans, I am going to say, no, there \nshould not be. I have a little history here. I think the American \npeople have had enough Washington takeovers--banks, insurance \ncompanies, General Motors, et cetera. The President can argue that he \ninherited a lot of that. But this takeover is truly voluntary.\n  Nobody is asking the Secretary of Education to become the banker of \nthe year. I would rather he become the Secretary of the year. I think \nhe could do that. I think he is an outstanding Secretary, one of the \nbest appointees--maybe the best--of the new President. The Presiding \nOfficer is from Illinois, and he knows Arne Duncan very well. I would \nlike to see him reward teachers and setting higher standards, instead \nof making 20 million student loans every year. I want him to be the \neducator of the year, not the banker of the year. Deep in his heart, \nmaybe he wishes that as well.\n  The administration has told us about this latest Washington takeover \nthat is starting next year, and that the nearly 20 million students who \nwant government-run direct loans should all line up at offices \ndesignated by the U.S. Department of Education. This will, the argument \ngoes, save taxpayers $87 billion in subsidies that now go to greedy \nbanks. In anticipation, Members of Congress--we--have already spent the \n$87 billion for more Pell grants, community college improvements, and \nother new programs. That sounds very good. Banks are punished, students \nare helped and, most important, Congressmen look real good.\n  Here is what they have not told you. Your friendly government, for \nall this, will overcharge you, the student--and use the profit to pay \nfor the new programs that make the Congressmen look good. Yes, those of \nyou who borrow student loans--the 20 million--the Education Department \nis going to borrow the money at 2.8 percent from the Treasury and loan \nit to the students at 6.8 percent, and spend the difference on \nadministrative costs and new government programs. That means a student \nwill spend a few more months or years working to pay off the student \nloan in order to help pay for someone else's education and help the \nCongressmen's reelection.\n  There are a few other things the government ought to tell you. The \n$87 billion isn't real. According to a letter in July from the \nnonpartisan CBO to New Hampshire Senator Gregg, the savings are closer \nto $47 billion. If we use the same cost scoring analysis that the CBO \nrequired when we passed the Troubled Assets Relief Program, or TARP, \nthe savings I think are less than that, since the government assumes it \ncan make 19 million loans each year for what it now costs to make 4 \nmillion loans.\n  Finally, the government needs to disclose to these 20 million \nstudents who are thinking about going to college next year that getting \nyour loan will become about as enjoyable as waiting in line for your \ndriver's license. Today there are 2,000 lenders--banks and nonprofit \ninstitutions--competing to offer government-backed students loans at \n4,400 campuses. I mentioned earlier the kinds of services they provide. \nThat is all about to change. There will only be one student loan banker \nunder this proposal, the U.S. Secretary of Education. I wouldn't have \nwanted that job when I was in that position, and I cannot imagine any \nEducation Secretary wanting that job. There will be no competition to \nmake it easier to get your loan.\n  Imagine 20 million students and families trying to call a Federal \ncall center to make their arrangements to go to college. It is true \nthat during the last 20 years subsidies the government paid to lenders \nto make student loans were excessive. Congress took steps to correct \nthat 2 years ago. If there is still $87 billion, or $47 billion, in \nreal savings, then the subsidies are too high and we should lower them \nand give the savings to students, not trick students by overcharging \nthem to pay for more government programs and run up the Federal debt in \nthe process. Seven-eighths of the students who applied for Federal aid \nusing the Free Application for Federal Student Aid had an average loan \nof about $25,000. Assuming a standard 10-year repayment at 6.8 percent, \nwhich is the rate set by Congress, these students would pay roughly \n$9,400 in interest. But we could use the savings to reduce the interest \nrate by as much as 1.5 percent--down to 5.3--and those students would \npay only $7,100 in interest, a savings of $2,200.\n  If this Washington takeover goes through, every one of the 19 \nmillion-plus student loans made in 2010 should carry this warning \nlabel: Beware, your Federal Government is overcharging you so your \nCongressman can take credit for starting a new government program. \nEnjoy the extra hours you work to pay off your student loan.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague from South Dakota on the floor and \nmy colleague from Nebraska, so I will conclude.\n  The Secretary of Education should change his mind, withdraw his \nletter, and work with Congress to extend the temporary law and improve \nthe student loan program and reassure students that they don't have to \nbe anxious about standing in line in January for a loan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wisconsin is recognized.\n\n\n                              Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, in 2002, then-Senator Biden chaired a \nseries of Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearings on U.S. policy \ntoward Iraq. These hearings challenged many prevailing assumptions and \ncalled into question the wisdom of invading Iraq. To the detriment of \nour Armed Forces, our counterterrorism efforts, and the standing of the \nUnited States around the world, our government ignored those prescient \nwarnings.\n  Our country is again contemplating sending tens of thousands of \ntroops into battle, this time as an escalation of the 8-year war in \nAfghanistan. In fact, the escalation has already begun, with an \nadditional squadron to begin deploying in November.\n  Sadly, the impact of our expanding military engagement in Afghanistan \nis becoming increasingly and painfully clear, as October has become the \ndeadliest month for U.S. troops since the war began, and more \nservicemembers have been killed this year than in the first 4 years \ncombined.\n  I commend Senator John Kerry for holding a series of exceptional \nhearings in the Foreign Relations Committee over the past month on U.S. \npolicy in this critical region. Expert witnesses have provided a sober \nanalysis of the situation there.\n  I urge my colleagues, if they have a chance, to read the transcripts \nof these hearings and consider the opinions of this diverse group of \nformer military officials, intelligence officers, diplomats, academics, \nand experts in the region. Of course, a handful of the witnesses \nsupported an escalation of our military involvement in Afghanistan, but \nthe majority of the regional experts--including CIA veterans who have \ndeep experience in the region--questioned whether the stated aims of \nour military strategy are achievable or necessary in order to deny al-\nQaida an uncontested safe haven in Afghanistan. Many expressed concern \nthat our current military-focused approach may be making things worse.\n\n  President Obama has refocused our attention on the Afghanistan-\nPakistan region, and for this I give him great credit. I am also \npleased to see this administration is taking the time to have serious \ndiscussions about our strategy and the many possible alternatives. We \nmust find a way to relentlessly pursue al-Qaida's global network \nwithout destabilizing this critical region, overstretching our military \nor needlessly spending money we do not have. This will require a \nsmaller, more targeted,\n\n[[Page S10821]]\n\nand sustainable military strategy combined with far more robust \nregional diplomatic engagement.\n  I would like to go over what I consider to be some of the myths that \nare being used to support the notion of a significant buildup of troops \nin Afghanistan.\n  One is that preventing a potential al-Qaida safe haven in Afghanistan \nis more important than addressing existing safe havens elsewhere. That \nis not what we heard at the hearings.\n  The committee's hearings have revealed that calls for an open-ended \nor increased military presence in Afghanistan are based upon several \nflawed assumptions or myths. The first common myth is that preventing a \npotential al-Qaida safe haven in Afghanistan is more important than \nother potential safe havens. Again and again, we hear that if we do not \nsend more troops, the Taliban will regain control of Afghanistan and \nagain provide a safe haven in which al-Qaida could reestablish training \nfacilities or launch attacks on the United States. That statement may \nbe true, but it contains a number of assumptions that need to be \nclosely examined. Will more troops make a difference? How likely is it \nthe Taliban will actually regain control of Afghanistan? Even if it \ndoes, what will its relationship be with al-Qaida? But the biggest \nunasked question is: What are the costs of pursuing this strategy and \nis it necessary to address the very real threat posed by al-Qaida?\n  Al-Qaida already has a safe haven in Pakistan and is operating in \nother countries around the globe. Addressing this global threat \nrequires a smart and sustainable use of our resources around the world, \nincluding in Afghanistan, rather than disproportionately directing our \nresources toward only one of many potential safe havens.\n  Several witnesses called into question even the likelihood that the \nTaliban would overrun Kabul. Even if the Taliban were to continue to \nexert control over certain areas, experts challenged the simplistic \nassumption that al-Qaida would then be able to reestablish the kind of \noperational freedom it had in Afghanistan prior to 9/11.\n  Moreover, sending more troops to Afghanistan may not prevent an al-\nQaida safe haven there. As General McChrystal noted in his own \nassessment, even if we send additional troops, they would necessarily \nbe focused on limited areas and would still leave substantial portions \nof the country outside the control of the Afghan Government or U.S. \nforces.\n  Several witnesses questioned whether we can afford to dedicate so \nmany resources to one country when we face a global adversary. Instead, \nas Robert Grenier, the former CIA station chief in Islamabad during the \n2001 invasion in Afghanistan, testified:\n\n       The best that we can hope for is not a permanent \n     elimination of a safe haven [in Afghanistan] . . . but rather \n     the elimination of an uncontested safe haven. [W]e need to be \n     in a place where we can continue to play the game, which \n     means that we need to be able to do that on a sustainable \n     basis. . . .What we are currently doing I believe is not \n     sustainable either by us or by the Afghans.\n\n  We have to have a sustainable, targeted counterterrorism strategy \nthat can contest potential safe havens and, thus, prevent al-Qaida from \nregaining the footing they had in the 1990s. Trying to achieve total \nelimination of such safe havens through a large-scale, open-ended \nmilitary mission is not only infeasible, it is physically and \npolitically unsustainable and could provoke even greater instability in \nthe region. It is time we develop a counterterrorism policy for \nAfghanistan that places it in the context of al-Qaida's many current \nand potential safe havens, including in Yemen, Somalia and North Africa \nand many other places around the world.\n  A second oft-cited myth is, we already tried engaging in such a \nlimited counterterrorism operation in Afghanistan after the 2001 \ninvasion and the situation on the ground only deteriorated.\n  On the contrary, the strategy of the United States in Afghanistan, \nover the past 6 years, has been uncoordinated and neglected and much of \nthe limited resources went to pursuing militants in Afghanistan while \nal-Qaida was rebuilding in Pakistan. This strategy failed not because \nit was targeted at al-Qaida but because it generated resentment among \nthe local population and created a groundswell of opposition. It also \nfailed because it turned a blind eye to the corruption and lack of \nlegitimacy of both the Afghan and Pakistani Governments. The previous \nadministration's extreme reliance on Pervez Musharraf not only failed \nto achieve our immediate counterterrorism goals, but it undermined the \nperception among the Pakistani population that we were working with \nthem against mutual threats. As a result, we lost a crucial opportunity \nto eliminate al-Qaida and the Taliban from, and bring stability to, \nAfghanistan.\n  By contrast, the Obama administration has focused on Pakistan and \nsupported the emergence of a civilian government that shares our \ncounterterrorism goals. We have a strong interest in Pakistan's \ncontinued military operations. We must remain engaged so any tactical \nsuccesses are accompanied by rules of engagement that protect the \ncivilian population and ensure humane treatment of displaced persons, \nwhich are essential to ensuring that these successes actually result in \nstrategic victories.\n  Much more remains to be done, including efforts to strengthen \nresponsive civilian governance and encourage Pakistan to tackle the \ndeeper socioeconomic problems that the Director of National \nIntelligence has testified are driving instability in that country. \nNone of this will be easy, but counterterrorism in Pakistan will not be \nachieved through our escalation in Afghanistan. One thing is certain. \nAt no point in the last 8 years has this kind of comprehensive, focused \nstrategy for Pakistan been attempted.\n  In Afghanistan, I am not suggesting we would necessarily just limit \nourselves to what some have called an over-the-horizon presence. We may \nneed to maintain bases and consider a range of counterterrorism \noptions. But we will never return to the neglect and strategic drift of \nthe pre-9/11 period, nor should we resume the unfocused mission we saw \nfor much of the previous administration.\n  This recognition is why several witnesses testified that a targeted \ncounterterrorism strategy, which has never been tried before, would \nlikely succeed in denying al-Qaida an uncontested safe haven. This \nsustainable strategy, along with a flexible timetable for the \nwithdrawal of troops of the United States from Afghanistan, could \neasily reduce the perception that we are engaging in an open-ended \nmilitary occupation of that country.\n  As to a third myth, there are many who argue that a larger military \npresence is required in order to stabilize Afghanistan. However, many \nof the experts testified that an increase of foreign troops in \nAfghanistan will likely provoke additional militancy.\n  Reports indicate that militancy in both Afghanistan and Pakistan has \nincreased over the years. According to Milt Bearden, the former CIA \nstation chief in Islamabad: ``40,000 troops will beget 40,000 more \nenemy . . . '' We must appreciate that our military presence may well \nbe counterproductive and, in fact, driving the conflict, creating more \nmilitants than it is eliminating.\n  Indeed, it may even be undermining our ability to divide our enemies. \nCIA veterans Robert Grenier and Mark Sageman testified that, in Mr. \nGrenier's words, Afghans ``tend to coalesce against what is perceived \nas an outsider.''\n  It is not surprising, then, that many of the witnesses who appeared \nbefore the Foreign Relations Committee agreed that a political solution \nis essential to stability in Afghanistan. As Mr. Bearden testified, \nthere is no ``military solution--for us or the Afghans.''\n  We can and will relentlessly pursue al-Qaida. We have to find a way \nto do so that does not further destabilize the region. Increasing our \ntroop levels in Afghanistan will only make this more difficult.\n\n  As to a fourth myth, another frequently cited myth is we must \nmaintain a large military presence in Afghanistan in order to prevent \nthe destabilization of Pakistan. In reality, our massive military \nfootprint in Afghanistan has contributed to instability in Pakistan.\n  Several witnesses agreed the majority of Pakistanis would not welcome \nan increased military presence in Afghanistan. Mr. Grenier stated:\n\n\n[[Page S10822]]\n\n\n       I think that a large increase in U.S. presence in \n     Afghanistan would not be welcomed by the majority of \n     Pakistanis. I think that it would make the struggle seem all \n     the more starkly one of the U.S. against Muslims as opposed \n     to the U.S. supporting Afghans in their own struggle.\n\n  As former British diplomat Rory Stewart testified, the ``stabilized \nPakistan'' rationale for a military presence in Afghanistan also \nignores ``the real drivers of the problems in Pakistan. Pakistan will \nnot stand or fall on Afghanistan. It's about the Pakistani government, \nit's about the Pakistani military, it's about the Pakistani economy and \nthe Pakistani society . . . by and large, Afghanistan is far less \nimportant to the future of Pakistan than we're suggesting.''\n  In fact, our presence in Afghanistan could be counterproductive. CIA \nveteran Paul Pillar recently testified in the House that ``an expanded \nU.S.-led counterinsurgency in Afghanistan would be more likely to \ncomplicate rather than to alleviate the task of Pakistani security \nforces insofar as it succeeded in pushing additional militants across \nthe Durand line.'' We need to carefully consider the unintended \nconsequences of sending additional troops to Afghanistan, lest we \nfurther destabilize its nuclear-armed neighbor, Pakistan.\n  The Afghanistan hearings provided a crucial forum to question \nconventional wisdom, justifying our current and proposed military \nstrategy. These expert witnesses have challenged many of the \nassumptions underlying many of the myths I outlined.\n  In his testimony before the House, Pillar warned that:\n\n       An expanded military effort in the cause of \n     counterinsurgency in Afghanistan would be unwarranted. The \n     benefits in terms of ultimately adding to the safety and \n     security of the American people would be marginal and \n     questionable. At best, the difference such an effort would \n     make in the terrorist threat facing Americans would be \n     slight. At worst, the effort would be counterproductive and \n     would not reduce the threat at all. Even at its best, the \n     benefit would be, in my judgment, outweighed by the probable \n     costs of the counterinsurgency.\n\n  There is strong consensus that we must not abandon Afghanistan, and \nthe lack of strategy and focus on this region that occurred over the \npast 6 years must not be repeated. But there has also been significant \nagreement among the witnesses that we continue to greatly overestimate \nthe potential benefits and underestimate the risks associated with \nmaintaining or expanding a large, open-ended military presence.\n  I urge my colleagues, again, to review this excellent testimony from \nthese hearings. We need to reduce our unsustainable military presence \nin Afghanistan in order to pursue al-Qaida without further \ndestabilizing the region and work through diplomatic channels and the \nprovision of assistance to support the emergence of legitimate, \ncompetent governments in both countries that will be effective partners \nin fighting terrorism.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise this afternoon to speak to the \npending issue, which is the extension of unemployment benefits.\n  The pending proposal basically says we would extend benefits for 14 \nweeks for all States. There would be an additional 6 weeks attached for \nthose States that had unemployment that exceeded 8.5 percent.\n  You don't have to look very far around this country to see people are \nstruggling. In fact, just an hour or so ago, I was pulled aside by a \nmember of the media. He said: There are numbers coming out tomorrow \nthat indicate some improvement here and there. What would your reaction \nto that be?\n  I said: You know, until we see improvement with unemployment, we will \nnever convince the American people that things are better.\n  We are hearing 10 percent unemployment. I hope not, but some predict \nwe will actually go over that number around Christmastime or the first \nof the year.\n  People across this country are struggling. Jobs are being cut. People \nare being laid off. As I said, many experts are predicting that \nunemployment could get into the double digits before we see any \nimprovement.\n  I am not here to say the extension of unemployment benefits is the \nwrong course of action. Not at all. I am not here to dispute any of \nthese assertions about how difficult this economy is for people. But \nwhat I am here to do today is to say this: If we are going to consider \na bill of this nature, of this importance to people, I believe it is \nimportant that we, as Senators, have the ability to come to the floor \nto submit an amendment, to make our best case on the amendment, to ask \nfor a vote on that amendment, and then see where it ends up.\n  The original stimulus bill--and again I emphasize, the stimulus \nbill--extended unemployment benefits for 33 weeks. So very clearly the \nmajority of this body, considering the issue of extending unemployment \nat the time the stimulus was passed, said we should use stimulus funds. \nI would argue that the same logic applies today. This extension should \nalso be from stimulus funds, and that is what my amendment would simply \nsay.\n  Here are the reasons why: The stimulus bill, quite simply, did not \nprovide the jobs that were promised. Put forth whatever excuse you want \nto put forth. Argue that maybe you didn't think the economy was as bad \nas it is, although I must admit I find that hard to imagine. But \nwhatever the argument, the stimulus bill did not provide the promised \njobs. The bill in front of us today would do this: It would levy a tax \non our job creators--our businesses--of $2.4 billion to finance it. It \nis an 18-month tax on small businesses, which are the backbone of our \njob creators and certainly the backbone of our economy in the State of \nNebraska.\n  The interesting thing about this extension of unemployment benefits \nis that it would expire in December but the taxes would live on for \nmonth after month after that expiration.\n  So you see, I think it is appropriate to come to the Senate floor to \nmake the case that we should not be taxing the job creators in order to \nsupport those who are out of work and looking for a job. We should be \nencouraging those job creators to do all they can to add another job to \nbring these people back to employment.\n  To make this relevant to the citizens back home in Nebraska, this \nwill have a $17 million impact on our businesses. That is $17 million \nthat will not be spent on creating a single new job. It is $17 million \nthat won't be spent to hire new workers.\n  I have talked to many of these businesses in our State, and they are \nsaying to me: Mike, we are doing all we can to try to keep people \nemployed. I don't want to do layoffs or any more layoffs, they tell me. \nBut what we are saying to businesses is: We know you are struggling, we \nknow you are fighting this brave battle to keep these families with a \njob, but here is another tax extension, and could you also go out and \nhire some new workers? This is simply out of touch--exactly what \nWashington was criticized for during our August townhall meetings.\n  A lot of jobs could be created if we expand this from my small State \nof Nebraska to a nationwide phenomena. Think of the jobs that could be \ncreated with $2.4 billion spent on salaries instead of on taxes.\n  I have this amendment which basically says this: A more sensible \napproach would be to use a very small portion of the unspent stimulus \nmoney to finance this extension. Don't tax these small businesses. The \nstimulus was sold as a shot in the arm. It was going to jump-start the \neconomy. But that goal has proven very elusive. In fact, it has even \nbeen very difficult to get the money flowing. And don't take Mike \nJohanns' word on this. The Congressional Budget Office says that some \nof the stimulus money won't even be spent until 2018, 9 years from now. \nCBO predicts $22 billion will be spent in 2014, about 5 years from now. \nI don't know a single person who could argue that is a shot in the arm.\n  The Chair of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, Christina \nRomer, recently said:\n\n       Most analysts predict that the fiscal stimulus will have \n     its greatest impact on growth in the second and third \n     quarters of 2009.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       By mid 2010, the fiscal stimulus will likely be \n     contributing little to growth.\n\n  This baffles and frustrates the American people.\n  Piling more taxes on people who hire to help those without jobs makes \nno sense when you recognize that originally a portion of the stimulus \nmoney\n\n[[Page S10823]]\n\nwas set aside to extend unemployment. Why not use a small--very small--\nportion of the overall sum to provide an extension?\n  Mr. President, I just want the opportunity to have an amendment that \nwe can vote on, to be able to make the case that my amendment is a \nbetter alternative than what we are doing today. It uses unobligated \nstimulus funds to pay for the extension. It just simply says to the \nOffice of Management and Budget: Go to the unused accounts--and having \nbeen a Cabinet member myself, I will tell you that those funds will be \nfound--and allocate that money to help these people instead of taxing \nthe job creators. My amendment requires only 1 percent--I repeat, 1 \npercent--of the original stimulus to pay for unemployment benefits. Why \nnot use the money parked in these accounts--which literally is years \naway from being allocated--to stimulate this economy?\n  I would respectfully argue that my option gives all Americans a \nbreak. It allows the unemployed workers to have that important safety \nnet while they struggle to find a job; it helps businesses that are \nfighting to stay open and to keep their employees in place, to keep \nthat job in the family, and, my hope, to hire new workers; and it \nallows us to use taxpayer dollars--taxpayers who are tired of seeing \ntheir tax dollars wasted--in a way that I believe they would approve \nof.\n  Given the opportunity to submit this amendment on the floor of the \nSenate, I could ask for its support and we could send a message to the \nAmerican people that we are listening to their concerns. This amendment \nimmediately puts money back into the economy to pay the bills or wages \nand to put food on the table. Unfortunately, it appears increasingly \nlikely that I will not be allowed to offer the amendment.\n  Mr. President, I have not been here a long time. I have been here \nabout the same time as the Presiding Officer. But I have to tell you, \none of the things that impresses me so much about this great body, this \ndeliberative Senate, is that we have the ability, whether we are in the \nmajority or the minority, to offer an idea, to craft an amendment--\noftentimes that we get from a citizen back home--and to come to the \nfloor and offer that amendment, make our best case, and then get a \nvote. It is a remarkable system. But what is happening these days is \nthat precious right is being taken away from us.\n  I think this amendment makes sense. There may be many who will \ndisagree with me. There will be many who will agree with me. All I am \nasking for is that I be given the right to offer the amendment, to make \nthe case, and then to get a vote on this idea.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, let me begin by suggesting that at a \nmoment in American history when we probably have more serious problems \nthan at any time since the Great Depression, I find it rather sad and \ndistressing that time after time the response of our Republican \ncolleagues is no, no, no; filibuster, filibuster, filibuster. In fact, \nwhat we are seeing now is that the filibuster is the norm. Most \nAmericans think it takes a majority to pass something. Not around here. \nOur Republican friends, I think, have broken the alltime world's record \nfor bringing forward filibusters--my understanding is 81 in this \nsession alone.\n  So here you have a crisis in health care, a crisis in the economy, a \ncrisis in global warming, a crisis in foreign policy, a crisis in terms \nof our national debt, and yet our Republican friends say: No, no, no; \nfilibuster, filibuster, filibuster. So it is easy to understand why the \nAmerican people are extremely frustrated with what is going on here.\n  The election in November was all about the American people saying \nvery loudly and clearly: We did it their way for 8 years. We gave the \ntax breaks to the billionaires that these folks wanted. We went into a \nwar we should never have gotten into. We drove up the national debt to \na recordbreaking level. We ignored the crisis in global warming and \nforfeited enormous opportunities to create jobs addressing that. We did \nit their way.\n  Now let me tell you the results of having done it their way.\n  During the Presidency of George W. Bush, over 8 million Americans \nslipped out of the middle class and into poverty. Today, nearly 40 \nmillion Americans are living in poverty.\n  During the 8 years of the Bush administration, 7.8 million Americans \nlost their health insurance. Today, these guys still do not want to \naddress the issue of soaring health care costs and 46 million Americans \nuninsured.\n  Under President Bush, 4\\1/2\\ million manufacturing jobs in this \ncountry were lost in the Midwest and other parts of this country. We \nare seeing desolation in areas where workers used to earn good wages, \nproducing real products. In my own small State of Vermont, we have lost \n10,000 manufacturing jobs over the last 6 or 7 years.\n  During the Bush era, 3.2 million American workers lost their \npensions--pensions they were dependent upon in order to provide some \nsecurity when they retired. Incredibly, during that period, median \nhousehold income declined by over $2,100.\n  My colleagues may have seen an article in USA TODAY recently which \nmentioned that from 2000 to 2008, middle-class men experienced an 11.2-\npercent drop in their incomes. Do you believe that--11.2 percent? That \nis a reduction of $7,700, adjusting for inflation, during the Bush era. \nMiddle-class women in this age group saw a 4.8-percent decline in their \nincomes as well.\n  We did it their way, and the middle class is on the verge of \ncollapse, poverty is increasing, more and more people are losing their \nhealth insurance, and the national debt has exploded. And then, after \nhearing President Bush tell us how robust the economy was, Secretary of \nthe Treasury Paulson saying how strong the economy was, they walked \ninto Congress over a year ago and said: Seems we made a little bit of a \nmistake. The economy is not actually robust. If we don't get $700 \nbillion within the next couple of weeks, the entire world's financial \nsystem will collapse. Sorry about that. We not only have many hundreds \nof supervisors and the Fed, we have the whole Federal bureaucracy \nlooking at what is going on--we kind of missed it. We are sorry about \nthat.\n\n  What ended up happening, as everybody in America knows, the economy \nplunged as a result of Wall Street greed and illegal behavior and \nrecklessness; the conversion of Wall Street to a gambling casino, to \nall the deregulation that these guys fought for for years--both \nparties, by the way, not just Republicans--we ended up with the \ngreatest economic decline since the Great Depression.\n  Let me tell you a little bit about where we are today when we talk \nabout the need to extend unemployment benefits. We hear the official \nunemployment statistic of 9.8 percent. That is bad. But that only tells \nliterally half of the story. If we add to the 9.8 percent who are \nunemployed all those in high unemployment areas who have given up \nlooking for work or who are not part of the official statistic, and we \nadd to that number people who want to work full time but are working \npart time, do you know what we end up with? We end up with 27.2 million \nAmericans who are unemployed or underemployed. This is over 17 percent \nof our population.\n  That is a disaster. That is an absolute disaster causing massive \nsuffering for working families all over this country.\n  I rise today in the midst of that economic disaster in strong support \nof the Emergency Unemployment Compensation Act. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation. I thank Majority Leader Reid \nand Senator Baucus, the chairman of the Finance Committee, for their \nleadership on this legislation. We are in the midst of the worst \neconomic crisis since the Great Depression, and the suffering, from \nCalifornia to Vermont, is enormous.\n  I am sure my colleagues get the same letters I get:\n  I lost my job, I am looking for a new job, there is no job available.\n  I lost my job, I got a new job, but it only pays half of what my old \njob did.\n  I lost my job and I lost my health insurance and maybe I am 1 of the \n1 million people this year who are going to go bankrupt because of \nmedically related illnesses.\n  I am a young person, I graduated high school, I want to get a job. I \ncan't find a job.\n  I graduated college, I can't find a job.\n\n[[Page S10824]]\n\n  That is what we are looking at. We have to address that problem.\n  As bad as the current situation is, what we also understand is that \nlong-term unemployment is soaring. It is a bad thing if somebody loses \ntheir job. That is always bad. If they get a new job in a couple of \nweeks, that is one thing. But what is happening now is we are looking \nat 5.4 million Americans who have been unemployed for over 6 months. \nThat is the highest on record. We have a crisis of long-term \nunemployment. The average length of unemployment is now 27 weeks, the \nlongest since World War II. In the midst of serious unemployment \nnumbers, the fact we are looking at long-term unemployment at record-\nbreaking levels tells us it is absolutely imperative to extend and \nincrease, expand unemployment benefits.\n  There are fewer jobs in America today than there were in the year \n2000, even though the workforce has grown by over 12 million since that \ntime. We now have the fewest manufacturing jobs at any time since April \nof 1941. Can you believe that? We have fewer manufacturing jobs, blue-\ncollar jobs, the jobs that made the middle class, since April of 1941.\n  The American people need our help. That is why it is so important \nthat we pass this legislation and why it is so important that we do \nthis in a bipartisan way. I hope our Republican friends will finally \nstop saying no and say yes to American working families. This bill \nprovides an additional 14 weeks of unemployment benefits to all 50 \nStates. That is important to me. It is important to me because while I \ndo understand there are States which have a lot higher unemployment \nrates than the State of Vermont, the truth is there is long-term \nunemployment in 50 States in America, and I believe we should be \nextending unemployment for all of our workers.\n  If we do not pass this legislation, by the end of this year nearly 2 \nmillion Americans will see their unemployment benefits expire, \nincluding some 2,000 people in the small State of Vermont. In the midst \nof the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, and at a time \nwhen long-term unemployment is extremely high, we cannot turn our backs \non jobless Americans by letting their unemployment insurance expire. \nThat would be driving people into the abyss. We cannot do that. This \nbill will allow workers who have lost their jobs during the severe \nrecession to get the help they deserve while they try to find new jobs \nto support their families.\n  The American people are looking to the Congress for help. These are \ntough times all over this country. We cannot turn our backs on hard-\nworking Americans who are trying as best they can to keep their \nfamilies above water. I hope we pass this legislation and we pass it as \nsoon as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I want to speak to the bill before the \nSenate right now and also to an amendment I would like to have voted on \nas a part of the underlying legislation. But I do want to also react to \nsome of the remarks made by my colleague from Vermont.\n  When it comes to some of the legislation some are trying to jam \nthrough the Congress this year, we believe it is OK to say no to some \nthings. We think it is OK to say no, for example, to 1,500-page bills \nwritten behind closed doors, in secret. We think it is OK to say no to \nhigher health care premiums for our constituents in our home States and \nmost Americans in this country who currently have health insurance. It \nis OK to say no to trillion-dollar spending bills that don't do \nanything to create jobs. We think it is OK to say no to higher taxes \nfor small businesses and working families who are going to get hit by \nmany of the proposals in front of the Congress, including the health \ncare bill which, according to the Congressional Budget Office, more \nthan half the tax burden is going to fall on families making under \n$100,000 a year.\n  We think it is OK to say no to energy taxes that will kill jobs and \nwreck the economy. We think it is OK to say no to a $2 trillion \nexpansion of the Federal Government in Washington to create a new \nhealth care entitlement that will be financed with higher taxes, \nMedicare cuts, and borrowing from future generations. We think it is OK \nto say no to a $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts that are going to \nimpact senior citizens across this country. It is also OK to say no to \nthe extension of what has become a TARP slush fund, what has become a \npolitical slush fund that is now being used for lots of things for \nwhich it was not intended.\n  I do not apologize for saying no to bad policies that are going to \nwreck the economy, cost Americans jobs, and put more and more of our \nfuture generations at risk because we are saddling them with a burden \nof debt that they will be carrying forever into the future. I think it \nis OK for people in this Chamber to stand up to bad policies and to say \nno.\n  I am going to continue to defend the right of my colleagues in the \nSenate, whether I agree with them or not. A lot of my colleagues on the \nother side, they have things they want to do. Some of them I do not \nagree with. That is why we have the Senate. It is to come here and \nresolve our differences and try to reach common ground if that is \npossible. But if there are bad things being proposed, I don't think \nthere is anything wrong with saying no--to higher taxes, higher health \ncare premiums, more borrowing, and more debt we are putting on future \ngenerations. I don't particularly have a problem with that.\n  I do think it is important, however, that we act on legislation that \nwill create jobs, that will provide a better, stronger economic future \nfor people in this country, and that will address the needs of the \npeople who are hurting because of this economic downturn. The \nlegislation we have before us will do just that, and I voted to proceed \nto that legislation last night so we could have this debate, so we \ncould get on this bill, so we could provide an additional 14 weeks of \nassistance to people who need unemployment benefits because of what is \nhappening in our economy and this country.\n  I do not think we will find a lot of disagreement that we need to \ntake those steps that are necessary. I will say the amendment offered \nby the Senator from Nebraska, Mr. Johanns, is a germane, legitimate \namendment that ought to be voted on. All he is saying is, if we are \ngoing to do this, we ought to figure out a way to pay for it that \ndoesn't lead to higher taxes on small businesses.\n\n  I think that is a fair vote to have. It is totally related to the \nunderlying bill. But the underlying bill that would provide and extend \nunemployment insurance benefits to people in this country who are \nsuffering as a result of the economic downturn, we are not objecting to \nthat. Nobody here is. In fact, we could finish that in the next hour or \ntwo if the majority would agree to allow a couple of amendments to be \nvoted on.\n  Having said that, I do have an amendment on which I think it is \nimportant to get a vote, and the reason it is important to get a vote \non it now is because we are not going to get many opportunities. The \nTARP program expires at the end of this year. If Congress doesn't take \nsteps to end it, the Treasury Department can extend it. The reason that \nis important is because the TARP program has gotten far afield from \nanything it was designed to do. It was designed to stabilize the \neconomy last year at a very difficult time. So we voted to extend $700 \nbillion in this authority for the Federal Reserve to go out, to buy \nsome of these troubled assets in various financial firms. They decided \nto take equity positions.\n  I think it is a very different use of the funds than what many of us \nintended when we voted for it, but that having been said, it was done \nto stabilize the financial system in the country. That was a year ago. \nI think it is fair to say it is not an emergency anymore. In fact, many \nof the TARP funds that have been extended are now being extended to \nother types of industries. We have seen the auto industry, to the tune \nof about $80 billion, come in and get TARP assistance. We have seen \ninsurance companies get TARP assistance. We have even seen TARP \nassistance made available to help modified home mortgages in this \ncountry to the tune of $50 billion, on which the Congressional Budget \nOffice says we will never see any return.\n  The TARP has become--I hate to call it a political slush fund. I hate \nto refer to it that way, but at a minimum it has become a revolving \nfund that can\n\n[[Page S10825]]\n\nnow be used by the Treasury for all kinds of purposes. In fact, I think \nfrom statements that have been made by the Treasury Secretary, the \nindications are they expect to reuse a lot of those funds even after \nthey are paid back by some of the institutions that have gotten \nassistance.\n  So we have the $700 billion TARP authority out there. With payments \nthat have been paid back, there is now over $300 billion that is \nunused. This is about $213 billion that was never used. And with \npayments that have now come back from some of the institutions that \nreceived assistance, there is a little over $300 billion of unobligated \nfunds in the TARP account. Why is that significant? It is significant \nbecause if we do not use those funds for some other purpose than for \nwhich they were intended, those funds will be to retire the Federal \ndebt. To me, that is probably as good a use of funds as we could \npossibly find right now.\n  We had a deficit last year of $1.4 trillion. We are looking at \ntrillion-dollar deficits as far as the eye can see. If the predictions \nof the Congressional Budget Office are accurate, in the next 5 years we \nwill double the Federal debt. In the next 10 years we will triple the \nFederal debt to the point where every American, every household in this \ncountry is going to owe $188,000 of debt.\n  So as a young couple gets married and starts out in their life \ntogether, they are going to get a wedding gift from the Federal \nGovernment, a big fat IOU for $188,000. The best thing we can do in \naddition to extending unemployment benefits to people who have lost \ntheir jobs and whose coverage is running out is to try to get this debt \nunder control so we are not passing on this enormous liability to \nfuture generations.\n  I would argue if we allow this situation to go unabated, if we \ncontinue to borrow money at the rate we are borrowing it today, and we \ncontinue racking up debt at the rate we are today, it is going to \ncreate all kinds of economic consequences down the road in the form of, \nperhaps, higher interest rates; we could see inflation pick up down the \nroad. Nobody sees that in the near term, but in the long term, when we \nstart having to print money to monetize our debt, and we are paying \nback our debt with cheaper dollars, the people who are buying our debt \nare going to start saying: Wait a minute. I want a better return on my \ninvestment.\n  So the interest rates start to pick up, and that could have some very \ndisastrous consequences for our economy when it comes to homeowners and \nsmall business owners and people who are trying to get student loans. \nThere are all kinds of consequences from this incredible binge of \nborrowing that we are on as a country.\n  I think the best we can do if we have got unobligated funds in the \nTARP authority right now is use those funds to pay down that Federal \ndebt. That is what my amendment does. I am coauthoring it with the \nSenator from Utah, Mr. Bennett. But we believe we ought to end the TARP \nauthority this year when it is set to expire. If Congress is not heard \non this, then the Treasury has the authority to extend it.\n  I wish to at least have Congress heard. Congress, after all, created \nthe TARP fund. It seems to me that if it is going to be extended, \nCongress ought to have a vote on that. As I said, that extension or \nthat expiration date is looming. It is December, the end of December of \nthis year. So if Congress is going to be heard, that is going to have \nto happen in the very near future.\n  So I wish to see a vote by the Senate on whether we believe that TARP \nought to be extended, ought to continue to be used for all of these \nother ancillary purposes I mentioned that are unrelated to the \nunderlying purpose for TARP when it was created a year ago, and whether \nwe are going to say we think it is a priority that we start paying down \nthis gargantuan Federal debt that is growing by the day, and the \ninterest payments are growing with it.\n  I wish to see, on this opportunity, this legislation that is moving \nthrough here, a vote on whether we can extend TARP. My amendment is one \npage. In fact, it is only four lines long. It is very simple. It is \nhere for everyone to take a look at. It will not take very long to \nfigure out what it does. I cannot imagine why the majority would not \nwant to have a vote on whether we are going to allow a $700 billion \nauthority of the Federal Government to continue to use these funds, why \nCongress would not want to be heard when, in fact, it was the Congress \nthat created this program in the first place.\n  My amendment is very simple. All it says is when TARP expires at the \nend of the year, it ends. That does not mean that the Treasury does not \nhave the authority to wind down some of the assets in some of the \nplaces where it has already invested those TARP dollars. Not at all. \nAll it simply says is the moneys that are not expended out of that \naccount will be used to pay down the Federal debt and no additional \nmoneys will be extended to other programs or other uses.\n  Some people might say: Well, what if we have another emergency? If we \nhave another emergency, Congress can act again. That is what we do. We \nare the legislative branch of the government. We have the power of the \npurse. There is not any reason to think that if for some reason it \nbecame clear that a TARP-like authority was necessary down the road \nthat the Congress would not take the necessary steps to address that \nemergency.\n  But in the meantime, we have a $700 billion out there which, as \npeople are making payments back in, are now going back out. We have got \nabout $300 billion right now of head room in that fund. It seems to me \nwe ought to take that $300 billion and apply it to paying down the \nFederal debt, so that future generations of Americans are not having \ntheir future mortgaged because we have not been able to live within our \nmeans.\n  It is a one-page amendment, four lines long. The bill that I am told \nis being written on health care, which is 1,500 pages, the last version \nof it that I heard or saw--we have not seen the current version of it. \nBut that 1,500-page bill is being written behind closed doors.\n  This, on the other hand, is one page, four lines long--a very simple, \nstraightforward amendment. It would not take us probably but a half an \nhour to debate it and vote on it. If the majority does not want to have \na vote on this amendment, I am not sure why, because it would seem to \nme that the Senate would want to weigh in on one of the most important \nissues of the day, and that is whether we are going to take some of \nthese unexpended funds and use them, apply them to paying down the \nFederal debt.\n  With regard to the debate before us on unemployment insurance, it \nneeds to be extended. There is no debate about that. In fact, I think \nthere will be a big bipartisan vote when it happens.\n  But why wouldn't we, in the interest of having a vote, a fair debate \nand a vote on amendments, allow amendments such as this which, as I \nsaid, because of the expiration date being December 31, it is unlikely, \nin my view, that Congress is going to get an opportunity, if we do not \nvote on this now, to vote on whether a $700 billion expenditure of \ntaxpayer dollars is going to be extended. And, if in fact, it has \nserved its purpose--and it has not--then why would we not use that \nunexpended authority, that unobligated balance to pay down the Federal \ndebt which, I would argue, I think most Americans would agree is one of \nthe most difficult and protracted problems that is going to face the \ncountry going forward.\n  I guess I would simply say that this, in my view, is related to the \ndebate we are having. Because the debate we are having is about the \neconomy. It is about people who have been displaced and who have lost \njobs and extending assistance to them, which they need and which we are \nall supportive of doing.\n  But if you are talking about things we can do to bring greater \nstability to the American economy, to provide a better and a brighter \nand more secure future for future generations, and to try and get this \neconomy back on track, I think it would be a great message to send to \nthe American people that the TARP, which was created for a specific \npurpose for a specific time, has accomplished that purpose. We do not \nbelieve it ought to become a slush fund for other activities. The \nunexpended balances in that fund ought to be used to pay down the \nFederal debt\n\n[[Page S10826]]\n\nand to provide a better and a brighter future for the taxpayers of \ntomorrow, unencumbered by a huge mountain of debt that is going to be \npassed down to them if we are not able to get our fiscal house in \norder.\n  I hope the majority will come around to the view that let's have a \nvote, let's have a 30-minute or hour debate on a couple of these \namendments. Let's pass this bill and be done with it. But it seems to \nme, at least, for some reason--I am not sure what that is--the majority \ndoes not want to have a vote on what I think is a very consequential \nissue of our time, and a very consequential issue for the future of \nthis country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Stabenow.) The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I wish to talk about another one of \nthose consequential issues of our day that we have been talking about a \nlot lately. That is health care reform. I wish to start by asking a \nquestion of my colleagues and anyone who is within the sound of my \nvoice, and that would be: Before we create a new government-run health \ncare plan, why don't we fix the ones we already have? Why don't we do \nmore to fight fraud, waste, and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid?\n  Of course, Medicare is a government-run plan for seniors. It is part \nof a commitment we made that people who have achieved a certain age \nwill have health care available to them, and that is a commitment we \nneed to keep. Medicaid, conversely, is for low-income individuals. It \nis a State-Federal Government share program. But like a new government \nplan could be dressed up in many different ways, kind of like a child \non Halloween, like some calling a government plan a public option, or \nsome talking about opt-outs, opt-ins, and triggers, once the mask comes \noff, what we are left with is plain and simply another government-run \nhealth care plan.\n  When I was on the floor on Monday and talking about our current \ngovernment plans, Medicare and Medicaid, I pointed out the very serious \nfiscal problems that both of these programs have and ones that we \nshould attend to before we go creating another government-run plan with \nperhaps its own set of fiscal problems.\n  For example, Medicare, which is health care for our seniors, has $38 \ntrillion in unfunded liabilities and will go bankrupt in 2017 unless \nCongress acts sooner.\n  Medicaid, we know, has its own share of problems. It actually reduces \naccess to health care. It promises access on the one hand but denies \nthat access because of unrealistically low reimbursement rates to \nhealth care providers. So many health care providers in my State, in \nTexas and elsewhere, simply will not accept a Medicaid patient. What \ngood is Medicaid, what good is Medicare, if you cannot find a physician \nwho is willing to see you? It is not much good at all.\n  I agree with our colleague, Senator Landrieu of Louisiana, who has \nasked why don't we fix the two public options we have now instead of \ncreating a new one. This afternoon I wish to talk about how we need to \nfix another problem with our government plans; that is, how we should \ndo more to fight waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I noted earlier this week that both Medicare and Medicaid combined \nhave, by some estimates, as much as $90 billion lost in taxpayer \ndollars each year, stolen from the intended beneficiaries of those two \nimportant government plans.\n  ``60 Minutes'' ran a story on this on Sunday which included the story \nof a former Federal judge who discovered that someone had billed the \ngovernment for two artificial limbs on his behalf, even though he still \nhas the ones God gave him when he was born. Someone is using his name \nand in this instance his billing number in order to defraud \nthe American taxpayer. We ought to be doing more to stop it.\n\n  This morning in the Judiciary Committee, we discussed health care \nfraud. We listened to some witnesses from the Justice Department. \nBasically what I concluded from that hearing is there are more bad guys \nthan there are good guys, and we are stuck with a lack of resources to \ndeal with this. We need to change the way we approach it to prevent \nfraud and waste on the front end rather than on trying to chase it down \non the back end.\n  According to the Department of Health and Human Services, $32.7 \nbillion--$32.7 billion--of Medicaid funds were consumed last year by \nwaste, fraud, and abuse. That is about 10 percent of Medicaid's total \ncosts, which were $333 billion.\n  Medicare has similar problems. Medicare fraud may consume up to 15 to \n20 percent of the $454 billion in the Medicare budget. According to \nHarvard Professor Malcolm Sparrow, that means the amount lost to fraud \nwould be between $70 to $90 billion each year.\n  Some of the examples of waste, fraud, and abuse should be \nembarrassing. For example, between 2000 and 2007, more than $90 million \nof claims were ordered by dead doctors. According to a report of the \nSenate Permanent Committee on Investigations last year, some of these \ndead doctors have been very productive. They have been ordering \nMedicare benefits for up to 10 years.\n  This past August in Houston the FBI discovered that a doctor and his \nwife had defrauded health care providers of more than $31 million, one \ndoctor and his spouse, $31 million. They claimed to have administered a \nnumber of injections and other treatments that never, in fact, occurred \nbut they still charged the taxpayer for them and were paid because of \nMedicare fraud.\n  Defrauding the Federal Government and the Federal taxpayers through \ntheir health care programs is so lucrative that Mafia figures and other \ncriminals are getting into the act. According to the Associated Press \nthis month, members of a Russian-Armenian crime ring in Los Angeles \nwere indicted for bilking Medicare of more than $20 million. A week \nafter the FBI issued search warrants related to Medicare fraud in \nMiami, the body of a potential witness was found in the back seat of a \ncar, riddled with bullets.\n  Violent criminals are moving into defrauding the government and the \nAmerican taxpayer because the risks and rewards look better to them \nthan, for example, the drug trade. According to this same AP story, a \nMedicare scammer could easily net $25,000 a day, while risking a \nrelatively modest 10 years in prison if convicted on a single count. A \ncocaine dealer, by comparison, could take weeks to make that amount, \nwhile risking life in prison. So it is a matter of incentives, risks, \nand rewards. Apparently, the risk of committing Medicare and Medicaid \nfraud is so low and so lucrative that it has continued to grow and grow \nand grow.\n\n  We know vulnerability in government programs also facilitates drug \nabuse. According to a General Accounting Office study of five States \nreleased last month, the General Accounting Office found that about \n65,000 Medicaid beneficiaries in these States each visited 6 or more \nproviders for the same type of controlled substance. Each of these \n65,000 Medicaid beneficiaries visited 6 or more providers for the same \ntype of controlled substance. These controlled substances included \nValium, Ritalin, and various amphetamine derivatives. Together, these \n65,000 Medicaid beneficiaries charged taxpayers $63 million to feed \ntheir habits--in just 2 years.\n  Sometimes providers aid and abet these drug addicts. The GAO reported \nthat a Florida physician was sentenced to life in prison after writing \nmultiple prescriptions for controlled substances to patients who he \nknew were drug abusers. Tragically, five people died as a result of the \ndrugs this doctor prescribed.\n  We know there is a better way to deal with the fraud in the two \npublic options or government-run plans that currently exist. We do not \nhave to accept the 3- to 10-percent loss in taxpayer dollars because of \nfraud, waste, and abuse. That is 3 to 10 percent of the taxpayer \ndollars.\n  Let's just compare that for a second to another industry that deals \nwith huge amounts of money and millions of transactions: the credit \ncard industry. According to the Center for Health Transformation, the \ncredit card industry processes more than $2 trillion in payments ever \nyear from 700 million credit card transactions, used at millions of \nvendors. Yet fraud in that industry is a fraction of what exists with\n\n[[Page S10827]]\n\nFederal Government programs. It is at least 100 times higher.\n  Then--more close to home--private health insurance companies do a \nmuch better job of fighting fraud, waste, and abuse than do government \nbureaucrats. I know everyone likes to bash the insurance industry, but \nin this area they sure beat any government plan I have seen. Fraudulent \nclaims in the private sector are much lower. They are roughly 1.5 \npercent of all the claims submitted, according to a new book called \n``Stop Paying the Crooks,'' edited by Jim Frogue. This is because the \nprivate sector operates with a different paradigm, a different \nstrategy. They use a ``detect and prevent'' strategy, as opposed to the \nFederal Government, which will pay first and then we will chase the \ncrooks later on. Because, as I said earlier, there are more bad guys \nthan good guys and our efforts to combat fraud are underresourced, this \n``pay first and chase the crooks down'' is not working at all. We need \nto change that paradigm to one that more closely follows the private \nsector strategy of ``detect and prevent'' rather than ``pay and \nchase.''\n  So why isn't the Federal Government doing a better job of fighting \nfraud? We heard testimony this morning, as I said, from representatives \nof the Department of Justice and the Department of Health and Human \nServices. I congratulated them, first of all, for their service to our \ncountry. They have had some modest successes with stepped-up \ninvestigations and prosecutions for health care fraud. I say ``modest'' \nbecause the volume of the problem, the enormity of the problem, dwarfs \nany of their successful efforts. Still, the administration--I will give \nthem credit--is trying to get their hands around the problem.\n  Regarding Medicaid, for example, the inspector general of HHS \nreleased a report in August. He said the data collected by the Medicaid \nStatistical Information System was not timely or accurate enough to \nhelp fight fraud, waste, and abuse. Data from the Medicaid Program \ntakes a year and a half to be publicly available, by which time the \ncrooks will have already gotten the money and escaped, perhaps long \nretired in the Caribbean.\n  This morning, the administration told us they were going to conduct a \nnational fraud summit. I can tell you, sometimes having a meeting is a \nsubstitute for doing something about the problem. So having a summit is \nfine in and of itself, but I do not have a whole lot of confidence that \nanother meeting or summit is going to solve this problem. Instead, we \nneed to give the Federal Government--and our law enforcement personnel, \nin particular--and those custodians of the Federal tax dollars better \ntools to be able to solve the problem.\n  I have offered a number of pieces of legislation designed to help \nfight health care fraud in Medicare and Medicaid. For example, earlier \nthis year, I introduced something I call the STOP Act, which is called \nthe Seniors and Taxpayers Obligation Protection Act. This legislation \nwould give Federal agencies greater tools and authority to detect \nwaste, fraud, and abuse before they happen. The STOP Act has bipartisan \nsponsors, and I believe its provisions should be a part of what we do \nto reform our health care system.\n  I had also offered an amendment to the bill in the Finance Committee \nthat would have made sure we fixed the fraud already existing in \nMedicaid before we expanded the program. Specifically, my amendment \nwould have said that Medicaid had to reduce its improper payment rate \nto 3.9 percent. That may sound like a lot, and it is still too high, \nbut it is actually the average of improper payment rates across the \nFederal Government. So my suggestion in my amendment was, just be \naverage. Yet my amendment was voted down largely along partisan lines.\n  Fraud is not the only problem we see in government health care \nprograms, but it is one reason I am skeptical of the so-called public \noption or government insurance companies or government takeovers of the \nrest of the health care sector that they do not currently control. It \nis a serious problem we ought to address rather than just creating a \nnew plan with a similar set of problems and see 3 to 10 percent of the \namount of money we spend on this new program lost to crooks and other \ncriminals.\n  Madam President, 61 percent of the American people, in one poll, said \nthey believe the issues of fraud and waste in Medicare and Medicaid \nshould be addressed before--before--we create a new government-run \nprogram. I believe we should listen to the American people. I believe \nwe should fix the current government-run programs before we create \nanother one.\n  So, Madam President, I leave with a few more questions that I think \nmust be addressed, will be addressed over the weeks and months ahead.\n  First of all, we know Senator Reid, along with help from Democratic \nleadership, has merged the Finance Committee bill with another Senate \ncommittee bill behind closed doors and sent it to the Congressional \nBudget Office to be scored or a cost estimate provided. I would like to \nask, why can't we see the bill? Why can't we see the bill? Why can't \nthe American people see the bill so they can read it for themselves \nonline and they can tell us how they will either be positively or \nnegatively affected by the provisions in another thousand-page bill?\n  Secondly, I would like to ask--and I guess we will find out sooner or \nlater, but we do not know now--how much will it cost? Will this be \nanother trillion-dollar-plus bill?\n  Third, I would like to know how much this bill will raise premiums on \npeople who already have health insurance coverage--as virtually every \nopinion we have heard surveying the Finance Committee bill, the HELP \nCommittee bill, and the House committee bills has said that Federal \ncontrols on health insurance plans will actually raise premiums. So we \nneed to know how much the Reid bill--that is going to come to the \nfloor, that has been written behind closed doors, that we need to see \nposted on the Internet--we need to know how much it is going to cost. \nWe need to know how much it is going to raise insurance premiums for \npeople who already have health care coverage.\n  The next question is, How much is it going to raise taxes on the \nmiddle class? I know some people around here think you can impose taxes \non insurance plans, you can impose fees on medical device providers, \nyou can do all of this, and it will be absorbed by those entities, by \nthose companies, when expert after expert tells us what we know, what \nour common sense tells us; that is, those costs will be passed down to \nthe consumer and they will be passed down to the taxpayer to pay for \nthem, middle-class taxpayers. How much will this bill raise taxes on \nthe middle class?\n  Then I think the American people would like to know--and this was in \nthe Finance Committee bill; we will find out, I assume, at some point \nwhether the Reid bill does the same thing--there was roughly $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in cuts to Medicare. Yes, that is right. It is the same \nMedicare plan that is scheduled to go bankrupt by 2017. Yet the \nproposal is, let's take another half-trillion-dollar chunk out of this \nfiscally unsustainable program, with $38 trillion in unfunded \nliabilities. We are going to take that, we are going to cannibalize \nfrom that plan to create yet another government plan or a public \noption, as some like to say around here.\n  Well, I think these are all important questions, and I wish I had the \nanswers to them. I know constituents call my office. They write me. \nThey e-mail me. They tell me in person: We are pretty worried about \nwhat we see coming out of Washington these days--with the spending and \nthe debt, the responsibilities we should be meeting today, ourselves, \nbut which we are kicking down the road and going to ask our children \nand grandchildren to pay for.\n  This particular subject is one that will affect all 300 million \nAmericans. I know they will be paying close attention, as they should, \nto the debate as we go forward.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I wish to talk for a moment about health \ncare\n\n[[Page S10828]]\n\nsince, hopefully, one of these days we will be able to begin a debate \non a piece of national health care legislation. I wish to make it clear \nthat Republicans support sensible health care reform, but we believe \nthe bill the majority will bring to the floor could create a whole new \nset of health care problems. We don't have the specifics yet, but I \nthink we can be sure that certain things are true.\n  First, the bill is a Washington takeover of health care that will \nraise taxes, cut Medicare by nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion or more, and \nincrease premiums as new taxes on the insurance industry and medical \ndevice manufacturers are passed on to consumers. This much we know. \nBefore any bill is considered and as we debate the legislation, we \nthink it is important to remember Americans have some rights in this \nprocess.\n  They have the right, for example, to have access to all the specifics \nof the bill and to have time to weigh it and to give us their \nreactions, their concerns. Let's not forget we function as a result of \ntheir consent, the consent of the governed.\n  Americans also have the right to know what the legislation is going \nto cost them and their families, including what it will cost their \nchildren and grandchildren 10 or 20 or 30 years from now. They have a \nright to know what it will cost the Treasury and how much debt will \nhave accrued. By the way, if Medicare is a model for the new \nWashington-run health care program, how can anyone believe it is going \nto be deficit neutral? In fact, I asked people at a townhall meeting: \nHow many people here believe you can have a $1 trillion health care \nbill and not add to the national debt? Not a single hand, of course, \nwas raised.\n  We also have the right to know about the unintended consequences of \nthe bill. A lot of my constituents are concerned because of a Lewin \nGroup prediction that 119 million people will end up on the Washington-\nrun insurance plan. That is of great concern to them, among other \nthings. They also are concerned this will interfere with their sacred \ndoctor-patient relationship. They have a right to have their concerns \ntaken seriously.\n  I think one of the guarantees we need to give to our constituents is \nthat the President can keep his pledge not to raise taxes on the \nAmerican people, as he pledged not to increase taxes by one single dime \non middle-income Americans. Yet as we read the legislation that has \ncome out of the various committees, taxes are raised on Americans.\n  Republicans will insist on these protections, these guarantees for \nour constituents: protections from increased premiums, from Medicare \ncuts and from increased taxes and, perhaps most importantly, protection \nfrom rationing of health care, the delay and denial of care that comes \nfrom things such as Medicare cuts of $\\1/2\\ trillion.\n  We support legislation that features cost-saving measures Americans \ncan support, things such as medical liability reform. But what we want \nto ensure is that our constituents do not have to suffer high taxes, \nhigh premiums, a bill that cuts Medicare and ends up rationing their \nhealth care. Americans deserve better.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I wish to speak about jobs and \nunemployment. I know we are in this period postcloture on the effort to \nextend unemployment benefits. Frankly, I have great difficulty \nunderstanding why we should have to be going through this kind of \nprocedural obstacle in order to extend unemployment benefits to the \nmany Americans who need those benefits. So I hope we can get through \nthat. I hope we can go ahead and pass the extension of unemployment \nbenefits. Frankly, that does not begin to address the overall \nemployment and job needs of the country. I think we all recognize that. \nI wish to talk a little bit about that today.\n  Frankly, we need additional policies to create jobs. Even as Congress \nand the President focus on other critical challenges facing the \ncountry, including health care reform and climate change and energy, at \nthe same time those issues are being discussed, we need to also \nprioritize job creation.\n  While there has been considerable debate about whether the Recovery \nAct is working, whether it has raised the gross domestic product, \nwhether it is creating jobs, most economists tell us the Recovery Act \nhas boosted the gross domestic product by 2 to 4 percentage points \nduring the past 6 months. With two-thirds of the funds not yet spent, \nthe Recovery Act certainly has the potential to create or save 4 \nmillion jobs, as the administration has expected it would and as all of \nus hope it does.\n  I have divided my remarks into three parts. First, I wish to describe \nthe scale of the job-creation problem the country faces. Because of the \nanemic job creation we have seen in this country over the last 9 years, \nthe economy is short by about 12 million jobs from what we actually \nneed in order to have reasonable employment. Second, there is \nconsiderable evidence--and this is the second subject I will address--\nthere is considerable evidence that this recession is much worse than \nit was expected to be. Critics of the Recovery Act are missing this \nfundamental point. The Recovery Act is working, but the recession is \nmore severe than the Recovery Act was designed to address. Accordingly, \nwe need to do more.\n  Finally, I will propose four ideas to create jobs I think Congress \nshould hold hearings on and fully debate. These are, by no means, the \nonly good ideas, but given the size of the problem we face, Congress \nshould consider all ideas that have a potential to create jobs.\n  I have two charts that illustrate the scale of the job-creation \nproblem. Let me start by putting up this first chart. The black line on \nthis chart shows the monthly change in the number of jobs since January \nof 2001. The red number, which is right here, this red area represents \n100,000 jobs. That is an important number to understand. It is the \nbreak-even number. Because our population is constantly growing, we \nneed to create about 100,000 new jobs every month just to maintain our \nunemployment and our employment level. That is 100,000 jobs per month \njust to keep unemployment from going up. Every time the black line--\nthis black line you see here--every time that black line is in the red \narea, which is most of the time in the last 9 years, we are not \ncreating enough jobs to break even and the jobs deficit is getting \nlarger and more Americans are out of work.\n  As my colleagues can see, for most of the past 9 years, the number of \nnew jobs has been far short of where it needs to be. From 2001 to 2004, \nthe jobs deficit grew by 5.8 million jobs. Even when job creation was \nabove the break-even level--and that is this period where this black \nline is above the reddish area on the chart--even in that period, it \nwas never high enough to dig us out of the hole we had created in the \nprevious years.\n  The second chart I wish to show is labeled ``The Jobs Deficit.'' It \nshows the total jobs deficit that has accumulated over the past 9 \nyears. It illustrates the cumulative effect of 9 years of slow job \ncreation and job losses. The country had 132.5 million jobs in December \nof 2000. If job creation had kept pace with population growth, today we \nwould have 143 million jobs, but it has not. Today, we are 12 million \njobs short of that number. The chart shows how that has happened. Today \nwe have only 131 million jobs. We actually have fewer jobs today than \nwe had before President Bush took office.\n  The takeaway from these charts is this: The job situation for \nAmericans is dismal. Congress needs to act quickly so new job-creation \npolicies will overlap with and will complement the remaining Recovery \nAct funds that will be invested this next year. There is no danger of \ndoing too much to create jobs, as I see it. We should learn from \nJapan's lost decade. Japan was plagued by weak economic growth and \nlackluster job creation all through the 1990s. Its lost decade, as that \nperiod is referred to, was caused by the bursting of an asset price \nbubble similar to what triggered the financial crisis we experienced \nlast year. The primary lesson from Japan's lost decade is, intermittent \nstimulus policies are ineffective. We need to take sustained and \noverwhelming action to reenergize our economy.\n  Let me speak for a moment about the current recession and data about \nthe current recession. In January of this year, the prospects for the \neconomy were truly grim. The country had lost jobs in every month in \n2008--over 3 million jobs in total. Over 1.6 million jobs were lost in \njust October, November,\n\n[[Page S10829]]\n\nand December of 2008. The financial system had suffered a massive self-\ninflicted wound, causing the biggest crisis since the Great Depression. \nThe prognosis was far from clear. American families in every State were \nworried about their jobs, their homes, their children's futures, and \neconomists were making dire predictions about what would happen in \n2009.\n  So that was what was happening when we began January of this year. \nYet, in January, while the Recovery Act was being designed, these \npredictions still substantially underestimated how bad the recession \nwould turn out to be. The 54 economists regularly surveyed by the Wall \nStreet Journal said, on average, gross domestic product would shrink by \n3.3 percent in the first quarter of 2009. There were only 4 of those 54 \neconomists who predicted the gross domestic product would decline by as \nmuch as 5 percent. Yet now we know the economy actually contracted by \n6.4 percent in that first quarter, twice as much as the economists had \nprojected. Over the entire year, that is a difference of $420 billion \nor more than half the size of the Recovery Act.\n  The effect on jobs and on unemployment was also underestimated. This \nsame group of 54 economists thought job losses would average 154,000 \nper month in 2009. There were only 3 of those economists who thought it \nwould be more than 300,000 per month. So far this year, the country is \nlosing, in fact, an average of 458,000 jobs every month--3 times more \nthan economists predicted.\n  In January, these same 54 economists thought the unemployment rate \nwould be 8.2 percent in the first half of 2009. Mark Zandi, at Moody's \neconomy.com, estimated unemployment would be less than 7.5 percent in \nthe first quarter of 2009 and 8.5 percent in the second quarter if the \nRecovery Act was not enacted. The administration said, if the Recovery \nAct was not enacted, unemployment would be less than 8 percent in the \nfirst half of this year and would peak at 9 percent in 2010. Those were \nthe estimates if the Recovery Act was not enacted. Yet we now know the \nunemployment rate was already 8.1 percent in February. It grew to 8.5 \npercent in March and 9.5 percent in the second quarter. Even with the \nRecovery Act, the unemployment rate is worse than anyone predicted it \nwould be without the Recovery Act.\n  In January, the administration said that enacting the Recovery Act \nwould keep the unemployment rate below 8 percent. Critics are trying to \nscore political points based on that estimate. But as I have said, the \nunemployment rate was already 8.1 percent in February, when there had \nhardly been enough time for the ink to dry on the Recovery Act, let \nalone for the stimulus funds to be obligated and spent.\n  In short, with perfect hindsight, it is obvious this recession is \nmuch worse than economists had predicted it would be. More jobs have \nbeen lost than economists predicted. I say this not to disparage those \nprofessionals, only to point out we need to do more to create jobs \nbecause the situation is worse than almost anyone thought it would be.\n  The Recovery Act is working, but the problem is bigger than the \nRecovery Act was designed to solve. We must all recognize this. \nCongress and the administration need to work together to enact \nadditional policies to create jobs. We need a combination of policies \nboth to encourage hiring and to increase the demand for goods and \nservices.\n  I want to talk briefly about four ideas that have been proposed that \nCongress needs to look at, and look at them hopefully sooner rather \nthan later.\n  First is a job creation tax credit. Last week, the Economic Policy \nInstitute released a new and noteworthy version of this idea, developed \nby John Bishop of Cornell and Timothy Bartik of the Upjohn Institute. \nThe EPI proposes to give businesses a tax credit worth 10 to 15 percent \nof the cost of creating new jobs. Such a credit would help businesses \nchoose to take the risk of expanding and hiring more workers. The \nauthors estimate their job creation tax credit would create 2.8 million \nnew jobs in 2010 that would not otherwise be created. In addition, 2.3 \nmillion jobs would be created in 2011 under their proposal, as they \npredicted, for a total of 5.1 million new jobs over a 2-year period. \nTheir proposal is to put this job creation tax credit into place for 2 \nyears. According to EPI, the cost to taxpayers for each job would be \nbetween $4,600 and $15,000. That is expensive, but it is well worth \nconsidering if their analysis is correct.\n  Critics say the job creation tax credit will not work, that only more \ndemand for a business's products and services will cause the business \nto hire more employees. While there is some truth to this, it is also \nthe case that entrepreneurs frequently start new businesses or expand \nexisting businesses before having a steady stream of new orders. This \nis the fundamental idea behind innovation. In other words, businesses \noften create new jobs before there is a confirmed increase in demand. \nMoreover, a similar but more difficult-to-use tax credit was enacted in \n1977 and is thought to have created 700,000 jobs by the end of 1978.\n  Critics also say that businesses will use tricks to game the system \nand fraudulently claim the tax credit. This is certainly possible. If \nCongress pursues this idea, we need to take care to design the credit \nto eliminate that problem. Already the authors of the proposal \nrecommend that the credit be based on the increase in a business's \nSocial Security wage base, so that a business could not fire and rehire \nemployees in order to claim the credit.\n  Some of these criticisms may be valid, but there is enough promise in \nthis idea that we need to take the time to fully explore and consider \nit.\n  The second idea I want to mention is the possibility of enacting an \ninvestment tax credit for manufacturing. Such a credit would subsidize \nthe cost of building new factory space or purchasing new machinery. \nThis credit could be tied to research and development that has been \ndone in the United States in order to ensure Americans get the maximum \nbenefit from that R or the credit could be more broadly designed and \nmade available for all manufacturing investments. Manufacturing jobs \nare critical to the long-term health of our economy, and we need \nadditional policies to create those jobs.\n  Third, we in Congress need to consider providing additional aid to \nStates. This could be accomplished through the expansion of the Federal \nrole or the Federal share of Medicaid, as we have done in the past. It \ncould be done through additional education funds or other direct \ngrants. The Recovery Act included $144 billion in aid to States and \nlocalities, but now we know the total budget shortfall of States is \nprojected to be nearly $360 billion over the next 2 years. Thirty-nine \nStates will face budget shortfalls in 2011. Without additional help, \nStates will have to cut services and raise taxes, making the recession \nworse and slowing job creation even more. As Nobel laureate Paul \nKrugman has written, there is a real danger that the States will become \n``50 little Herbert Hoovers'' by cutting back on spending, laying off \nworkers, and raising taxes all at the worst possible moment. Enacting \nadditional aid to States could have immediate benefits by curtailing \nplans to cut State programs. Direct aid to States would complement the \nnew tax credits I have mentioned. It would be a fast, effective way to \nstabilize and increase demand for goods and services.\n  Finally, Congress should explore the idea of providing emergency \nbridge loans to families to help families stay in their homes. The \ngovernment did provide bridge loans to Wall Street. American homeowners \nshould get the same assistance. The amount of the loan would be equal \nto up to 2 years of mortgage payments and could be repaid over 10 or 15 \nyears. These bridge loans would also complement the job creation tax \ncredit and the manufacturing investment tax credit by preventing a \nfall-off in the demand for consumer goods and services. Senator Jack \nReed and Congressman Barney Frank have proposed similar ideas to \nprovide bridge loans to homeowners. All of these ideas should be fully \ndiscussed and considered.\n  Over the longer term, Congress and the administration need to \nconsider proposals that address the structural flaws in our economy, \nincluding reforming financial regulation, fixing our unemployment \ncompensation system, so that it assists more workers in our economy, \nand creating additional countercyclical economic policies that\n\n[[Page S10830]]\n\nwould automatically be triggered during a recession. I hope to discuss \nsome of these issues in the coming weeks.\n  The four proposals I have outlined today are ideas that could create \njobs in the short and medium term. Congress should hold hearings on \nthese and other job creation proposals. We should act quickly to \naddress this issue. If the trend this year continues, another 15,000 \njobs will be lost each day we wait. If we do nothing, unemployment is \nprojected to climb past 10 percent next year, more families will lose \ntheir homes, our economy will grow weaker, making it more difficult for \nthe United States to compete in the global market. Even as Congress \ncontinues working on other strategic challenges such as health care, \nenergy, and climate change--and I support taking action in those \nareas--we must give renewed priority to job creation in order to \nstrengthen the long-term competitiveness of the United States and the \nprosperity of the American people.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nI be able to have a facsimile of the successful rocket test brought \nonto the floor for demonstration purposes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe Senator from Nevada be able to follow in the order. He was kind \nenough to let me go ahead so I might be able to then sit in the chair \nand preside at the appointed hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                         Successful Rocket Test\n\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, this is a facsimile of the \nrocket that was a successful test today, called the Ares I rocket. The \ntest flight was the Ares IX--X for ``experimental.'' It wanted to show \nall of the flight control systems. It was an exceptionally successful \ntest. It was only intended to go into suborbit.\n  The stages that were live were the first four of the five stages of \nthe solid rocket booster, which presently are identical to the solid \nrocket boosters--the two big candlestick-type things on either side of \nthe space shuttle orbiter and the big external tank, what makes up the \nstack that we refer to as the space shuttle.\n  In the design of the new rocket that was extraordinarily successful \ntoday, they have added a fifth segment. Instead of that being loaded \nwith solid propellant--which, by the way, has the consistency of a \npencil eraser--a dummy fifth stage was constructed, with the same \nweight and flight characteristics, along with the second stage of the \nrocket--again, designed and configured and weighed to be exactly what \nwould be the second stage of the rocket. And then, with the upper part \nhere, the capsule looks a lot like the old Apollo capsule, but instead \nholding six or seven astronauts instead of the three in the Apollo--the \ncrew being known as Orion. And then we have the escape rocket, these \nrockets here, so that if you had a malfunction and explosion at any \ntime in the first couple of minutes of flight, you could eject the \ncapsule with the humans on board, and it would parachute back. We don't \nhave that capability, for example, in the space shuttle today because, \nfor the first 2 minutes of flight, you are basically married to those \nsolid rocket boosters. If anything goes wrong, there is no escape \npossibility on the space shuttle. The new rocket is designed so that it \nhas that increased safety factor.\n\n  What I wanted to point out to the Senate is that, with this success \ntoday--and there is some question about whether it is this rocket--the \nPresident will decide, along with his NASA administrator, Marine GEN \nCharlie Bolden, whether they want to complete this rocket in its \npresent architecture, as the way for us to get into space after the \nspace shuttle has shut down or if they want some other kind of \nconfiguration.\n  But the fact is we had a very successful test today. What I want to \nsay to the Senate is that it is another example of the ability of this \ncountry and its people, in science and technology, in its engineering \nprowess, in its can-do spirit, in its ability to build on experiences \nthat we have had in the past, in order that we can create machines we \ncan marry up with humans and explore the unknown.\n  Most every child in America in school knows of the Hubble space \ntelescope. That was put up by an astronaut crew. Remember, its lens had \nbeen erroneously ground, and it was blind once it was put up. We had to \nsend a second astronaut crew up in a space shuttle, retrieve it, put \nnew glasses on it, and they have had three servicing missions on the \nHubble space telescope over the course of the last decade and a half. \nOf course, Hubble has peered out into the unknown, back to the origins \nof the universe, to the light that was emitted shortly after the big \nbang. And with the new upgrades to the Hubble space telescope, we are \neven going to be able to look back further in time in the universe. \nThis is the prowess, the genius of America. This is what we do not want \nto give up.\n  I congratulate the team at NASA for the tremendous success they had \ntoday. Whether it is this rocket for the future or some other \nderivative, America has exhibited her can-do and successful spirit \nagain this morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada is recognized.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Policy Czars\n\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Madam President, I rise today to talk about the growing \nnumber of so-called policy czars in the current administration and the \nimpact it is having on the Senate's oversight function over the \nexecutive branch.\n  I will begin by saying that I am not here to question the President's \nconstitutional or statutory authority to name advisers. I think we all \ncan agree that the President is entitled to surround himself with \nexperts to help coordinate policy and to provide advice. However, as \nmany of my colleagues are aware, there are some 18 new policy advisers, \nor czars, in the White House whose job descriptions may be a bit \nblurred.\n  While some media reports cite more than 18, I think we can reasonably \nsay that there are at least 18 new positions that have not been \nestablished by statute, are not confirmed by the Senate, and have not \nexisted before.\n  Early in his administration, President Obama sent a memorandum to the \nheads of the executive departments and agencies stating that ``a \ndemocracy requires accountability, and accountability requires \ntransparency.''\n  Despite this charge, the President has taken it upon himself to \nnominate a number of advisers who appear to wield a great amount of \npower and who are seemingly without public accountability.\n  I am not the only one who is concerned with this lack of \naccountability. We have seen members of the President's own party \nexpress concerns over this unusually high number of policy advisers in \nthe White House.\n  In February of this year, Senator Robert Byrd, the constitutional \nconscience of the Senate, wrote to the White House and said:\n\n       The rapid and easy accumulation of power by the White House \n     staff can threaten the constitutional system of checks and \n     balances.\n\n  Like the senior Member of the Senate, I too am concerned that the \nObama administration is creating what can be perceived as a shadow \nCabinet by creating policy positions that do not follow the same advice \nand consent of the Senate as other relevant policy positions in the \nWhite House.\n  In September, Senator Feingold, the chairman of the Constitution \nSubcommittee of the Senate Judiciary Committee, sent a letter to the \nWhite House requesting information on the roles and responsibilities of \nthe czars in question. His letter was specifically focused to ensure \nthat these advisers are not in violation of the appointments clause of \nthe Constitution.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution says the President ``shall \nnominate, and by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, shall \nappoint Ambassadors, other public Ministers and Consuls, Judges of the \nsupreme Court, and all other Officers of the United States, whose \nAppointments are not herein otherwise provided for, and which shall be \nestablished by law. . . .''\n\n[[Page S10831]]\n\n  Unfortunately, because we know so little about the roles and \nresponsibilities about the czars in question, it is simply not possible \nto determine whether the czars are actually officers and, therefore, \nconstitutional.\n  In response to Senator Feingold's letter to the administration last \nmonth, the White House claimed that the one and only role of the 18 \npositions in question is to advise the President. Yet when we look at \nthe press releases and Executive orders announcing these policy \nadvisers, they seem to have far more authority than strictly advising \nthe President.\n  Take, for example, Executive Order No. 13507 on April 8, 2009, \nannouncing the establishment of the White House Office of Health \nReform. The order states the office, run by a director, will ``develop \nand implement strategic initiatives'' and ``work with Congress.''\n  Is it not the role of the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \nimplement strategic initiatives? In the White House press release \nannouncing key members of his energy and environmental team, President \nObama announced that Carol Browner, the new Assistant for Energy and \nClimate Change, would be ``indispensable in implementing an ambitious \nand complex energy policy.''\n  Again, the administration is leaning on its newly created czar \npositions to implement policy. This question of policy implementation \nwas brought up during a hearing last week in the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee which I attended. Senator Collins, who \nalso wrote the White House with others in September questioning the \nincreasing number of czars in the administration asked the panel of \nconstitutional law experts about the issue of implementing policy.\n  Dr. James Pfiffner, a university professor at George Mason's School \nof Public Policy, testified that ``with respect to the implementation \nof health policy, I think that's very troubling.''\n  Lee Casey, a former attorney-adviser in the Office of Legal Counsel \nat the U.S. Department of Justice, testified that ``by law,'' these \nczars ``cannot implement.'' Casey did suggest, however, that Congress \ncould ask what the administration means by ``implement.''\n  I believe that is the true question here. What exactly are these \nczars doing? Are they simply advising the President, or are they \nactually implementing policy?\n  A few of my colleagues have come to the Senate floor to offer \namendments prohibiting funds to these czars if they are directing \nactions to the Cabinet officials who have been confirmed by the Senate. \nOther amendments would ensure that the czars will respond to reasonable \nrequests to testify before Congress, therefore, allowing our proper \noversight in this body. Unfortunately, these amendments were defeated \non procedural grounds.\n  I even offered an amendment during the Finance Committee's health \nreform markup that will require the czar handling health care issues be \nsubject to Senate confirmation. My amendment was defeated on a party-\nline vote.\n  What is the answer? How can Congress and the American public feel \nconfident the people who are appointed by the executive branch are \nappropriately carrying out the duties they are supposed to?\n  More importantly, how can we be sure the balance of power does not \nget out of balance? I think we all have the right to know exactly what \nthese policy czars are doing, to whom they are reporting, and who is \nresponsible and accountable if something goes wrong.\n  If the President can answer these questions for us, I think we will \nall feel better about this process.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Madam President, I wish to talk briefly about the health care reform \nbill that is going to be coming before this body in just a couple of \nshort weeks.\n  There are certain facts that we know. We have not seen the bill \nbecause it has just been written and given to the Congressional Budget \nOffice for the official scoring to be done. What we do know about the \nbill, though, is that there is over a $400 billion cut in Medicare. We \nknow that. We know that people who currently have health care, their \npremiums will go up. That is according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice. We know for many Americans--and mostly this will fall on people \nmaking less than $250,000 a year--their taxes will go up. We know also \nthere will be government bureaucrats making decisions on health care. \nWe also know people who currently have policies they like, especially \nthose who have Medicare Advantage, millions will lose their current \npolicy because over $120 billion is being taken out of the Medicare \nAdvantage Program.\n  We need to ask ourselves a couple of very fundamental questions. Does \nanyone really believe we can have a trillion-dollar health care bill \nand not add one dime to our deficit, as the President promised? Does \nanybody seriously believe that? How does adding a government-run plan, \nthis so-called public option, which mirrors the Medicare Program, \nactually fix the health care problem when Medicare itself is going \nbankrupt?\n  Everyone agrees Medicare is going bankrupt. Yet we want to add a new \ngovernment entitlement program into our health care system? That is \ngoing to fix the problem?\n  Do the American people really trust Washington, politicians, and \nbureaucrats to run their health care system? I believe we need to \ndesign a patient-centered health care system instead of a government \nsystem or an insurance company system. Let's design a health care \nsystem which makes health care more affordable and more accessible by \nencouraging people to make healthier choices, such as quitting smoking, \neating better, and exercising more. That will improve people's quality \nof life, but it will also lower the cost of health care for all \nAmericans.\n  Let's enact real medical liability reform to stop the practice of \ndefensive medicine which, once again, will lower the cost of health \ncare in the United States. It will save the government over $50 \nbillion, and it will save the private sector a similar amount, and \nthese are both conservative estimates.\n  Lastly, instead of taking $400 billion out of Medicare to fund a new \nentitlement program, let's work on getting the fraud out of Medicare \nand let's use that savings to preserve that system that has been so \nincredibly important for seniors for the last several decades.\n  I believe we need to start over. We do need to take a bipartisan \napproach to health care reform. We need to actually forget about \nwhether we are Republicans or Democrats and let's just be Americans. \nLet's sit down together ahead of time, not based on ideology but based \non what systems can work in America for the American people to achieve \nbetter quality, lower costs in our health care system today that puts \nthe patient at the center of our health care system instead of a \ngovernment bureaucrat or an insurance company.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Nelson of Florida). The Senator from \nArizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, the Senator from Pennsylvania, Mr. Casey, be \nrecognized.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I thank him for his courtesy in allowing me \nto precede his remarks this evening.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  A little more than a year ago, President Obama said:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge. Under my plan, no family making \n     less than $250,000 a year will see any form of tax increase. \n     Not your income tax, not your payroll tax, not your capital \n     gains taxes, not any of your taxes.\n\n  We have not seen the bill yet--the bill written in the majority \nleader's office--but it is probably fair to assume that the Finance \nCommittee bill will cover most of the tax provisions.\n  So how does the President's commitment fare under the Finance \nCommittee bill? It turns out that the bill will raise your taxes. In \nfact, it will raise them in several ways.\n  First, the Finance Committee bill would levy a host of new taxes on \nmillions of Americans--and I am not just talking about the wealthy--in \nfact, primarily on middle-income Americans who I think will tell you \nthey already have enough taxes to worry about.\n  Let me discuss the specific elements of this bill. The first one is \non taxing flexible savings accounts. Under current law, employees can \nmake contributions to flexible spending accounts. Many middle-income \nfamilies enjoy the benefits of these accounts which allow them to set \naside tax-free\n\n[[Page S10832]]\n\nincome for their medical expenses. In fact, the Employers Council on \nFlexible Compensation estimates that the median income for those 35 \nmillion Americans who have an FSA is $55,000. The bill would limit \ntheir contributions to $2,500. So the less they can contribute, the \nmore their taxable income rises. The total cost for taxpayers? It is \n$15 billion over 10 years.\n  The Finance bill would also tax many Americans through their \ninsurance plan by imposing a 40-percent excise tax on certain high-cost \nplans. So while another part of the bill taxes you if you don't buy \ninsurance, this provision will tax you if you buy too much. So tax No. \n2, if you don't buy insurance; tax No. 3, if you buy more than \nWashington thinks you should.\n  Tax No. 4, Americans who suffer catastrophic illnesses and the \nchronically ill would face a harmful change in the IRS Code, the Tax \nCode. Currently, catastrophic medical expenses are deductible if they \nexceed 7.5 percent of income. The bill would raise that threshold to 10 \npercent. Mr. President, 87 percent of Americans who would be hit by \nthis tax earn less than $100,000 a year. Seniors, who already face \nhardships through Medicare cuts, would be exempt from this tax for only \n4 years.\n  In addition to raising these four taxes, the bill taxes insurance \nwhich would be passed on to everyone who buys health insurance. \nSpecifically, the bill would impose an annual $6.7 billion so-called \nfee on the insurance industry. The entire amount collected by this tax: \n$67 billion over 10 years would be passed on to patients in the form of \nhigher premiums, according to the Congressional Budget Office. That is \ntax No. 5.\n  The bill would also impose a new tax on medical devices, $40 billion \nover 10 years. The entire cost of this tax, too, would be passed on to \npatients in the form of higher premiums, according to the CBO.\n  The medical device tax will be assessed against thousands of products \nsuch as contact lenses, stethoscopes, hospital beds, artificial heart \nvalves, and advanced diagnostic equipment, thereby increasing costs for \nconsumers, physician practices, hospitals, and the sickest patients who \nrequire the most care.\n  There is serious, bipartisan concern over this provision. But the \nlast time we looked, it is still in the bill.\n  So here are six ways Americans earning less than $250,000 will be \ntaxed, contrary to the President's promise. Some are direct taxes, such \nas the IRS tax if you don't buy the exact insurance policy Washington \nsays you must. Others are indirect but a tax nonetheless because the \nfirst target, be it the device manufacturer or the insurance company, \nwill, according to the CBO, pass it on directly to you.\n  The bottom line, Mr. President, is that the tax provisions in the \nbill will, in fact, violate a fundamental promise President Obama has \nmade about health care--not to raise taxes on middle-income Americans. \nThe American people have a right to expect some guarantees from \nWashington. Keeping the President's promise on tax increases is one of \nthem. But that is not the direction in which this bill is moving. This \nbill would increase taxes on working families, seniors, and the \nchronically ill by more than one-half trillion dollars over 10 years. \nRepublicans have better ideas, starting with protection from taxes and \npremium increases. The whole point of health care reform is to make \nthings better for American families. These taxes only make things \nworse.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the unemployment \ninsurance issue and the bill that is before the Senate.\n  Sometimes in a bad economy and when we have so many families, so many \ncommunities that are hurting, maybe the best way to convey information, \nother than a personal story, is in the few words of a headline. \nUnfortunately, in Pennsylvania today--and I am sure this is true in \nmany communities throughout the country--the headlines in just the last \n24 or 48 hours have told the whole story or at least most of the story.\n  This is a headline you may not be able to see clearly, so I will read \nit. This is from the Times Tribune, my hometown newspaper. This was \nfrom yesterday: ``Jobless rate hits 9.5 percent.'' The subhead says: \n``Regional unemployment reaches highest level since December '93; \nhighest in 15 years in northeastern Pennsylvania.'' Then we go to \nsouthwestern Pennsylvania--Pittsburgh and that region, some 5 hours by \ncar from where I live--and this is what the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette \nsaid on the same day, October 27: ``Region's jobless rate hits 23-year \nhigh in southwestern Pennsylvania.'' That is a part of our State that \nhas been hit hard over a couple of decades now by the loss of \nmanufacturing jobs and steel jobs. We know that tragic story. So a \ncorner of the State that was doing much better than the national \naverage is having its numbers go up. Northeastern Pennsylvania is at a \n15-year high and southwestern Pennsylvania is at a 23-year high in \nunemployment.\n  But this last one might tell the story even more graphically for \nthose who have a sense of the Pennsylvania economy. This is from the \nHarrisburg Patriot-News. This is from our capital city, Harrisburg, but \nit is in a region of the State that is more south central Pennsylvania, \nwhich has had a lower unemployment rate historically and more recently. \n``Jobless rate in region hits 26-year high.'' The subhead reads as \nfollows: The midstate is faring better than the State as a whole and \nthe Nation, but we are still hurting. Professional and retail jobs \ndisappeared while health care and education held steady. But other than \nthose two sectors, all the other sectors are hurting--Dauphin County, \n8.4 percent--right where the capital is; Cumberland County, 7.2 \npercent; Lebanon County 7.4; Perry County, 8.8.\n  For some parts of our country, one might say: Well, 7.2 or 7.4 sounds \na lot better than a lot of communities. But you have to put it in the \ncontext of this region of Pennsylvania, where the unemployment rate is \nusually at 4 or 5 percent. So we are way above that now, and it is in \nplaces where we don't expect it.\n  Unfortunately, in Pennsylvania, as I am sure is true in many States--\nin the State of Florida, the Presiding Officer's home State, I am sure \nhe sees this--this isn't limited to big urban areas. Philadelphia has a \nlot of unemployment, but there are small rural counties in northwestern \nPennsylvania and now we see even in south central Pennsylvania that are \nhurting. And in some places, it is not just 7.2 or 7.4 but 11 and 12 \nand 13 percent in a very small area in terms of population.\n  So these job figures and these headlines tell the whole story. And we \nknow now, just as we knew weeks ago, that the Senate has stalled too \nlong on providing an extension of unemployment insurance. Think of it \nthis way: Each day, 7,000 Americans lose their unemployment benefits. \nOver 23,000 Pennsylvanians have lost unemployment insurance just \nthrough the month of September, and that number is expected to go to \nover 60,000 by the end of the year. Pennsylvania ranks fifth highest in \nthe Nation with respect to the number of persons who will lose \nunemployment benefits by the end of the year if the Senate and the \nCongress overall do not act.\n  As I mentioned before, our statewide unemployment rate is about 8.8 \npercent. Someone living in another State might say: Well, that is not \nnearly as high as this State or another State. But 8.8 percent in \nPennsylvania means roughly half a million people are unemployed. And \nthere are some people here in the Senate who say: Well, we shouldn't \nact on this now. We don't have time for it. We don't think it is \nimportant to act. Well, I would like to have them say that to the half \nmillion people in Pennsylvania who are out of work or the tens of \nthousands right now who are losing their unemployment insurance month \nafter month, week after week.\n  The legislation that is before the Senate would provide needed relief \nby extending benefits to all States by 14 weeks. At the expiration of \nthose 14 weeks, if a State has an unemployment rate of higher than 8.5 \npercent, it would receive an additional 6 weeks of unemployment \ninsurance benefits. So it contemplates an extension for everyone by 14 \nweeks and then additional help if a State is above the 8.5-percent \nlevel.\n  I have to commend the work of our majority leader, Senator Reid, who \nhas made this a central focus, as it should be, in the midst of a \nrecession.\n\n[[Page S10833]]\n\n  One of the biggest challenges we face in the midst of a recovery--\neven the beginnings of a recovery--is that you don't see the \nunemployment rate get much better. You don't see the jobless number \ncome down. The unemployment figure is often the last number to come \ndown during a recession. But for an economist or a Senator or anyone \nelse to say: Well, the unemployment rate is a lagging indicator, that \nis not much comfort to someone who is out of work, and it is not a very \ngood reflection on the urgency of the problem. So we have to be \nconcerned with the unemployment rate even in what we hope is the \nbeginning of a recovery.\n  Even though our economy has shown promising signs of a recovery, \nwhich I just spoke of, the rate of unemployment is far too high. In \norder to boost our economy, passage of this unemployment extension \nwould benefit so many communities.\n  Another way to look at this is not just from the vantage point of the \nmost important thing here, which is helping those who are unemployed, \nthough that is reason alone to get this passed, but also what we will \nget for the rest of our economy, the kind of positive impact it has. It \ncertainly has a positive impact for someone out of work--that is \nobvious--for his or her family and their community. But there is \nanother way to measure it as well. Moody's chief economist, Mark Zandi, \nwho is not a partisan either way, is a skilled and capable economist \nwho says that every dollar spent in unemployment benefits generates \n$1.63 in new demand. So if you spend $1, you get $1.63 back. There is a \nreturn on investment for the overall economy when we target resources \nfor unemployment insurance.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, quoted widely in our health care \ndebate, has also stated that unemployment benefits are one of the most \ncost-effective forms of economic stimulus. I mentioned some of the \nrates throughout Pennsylvania, throughout both urban and rural areas. \nAll of these communities--whether a small town, a rural area, suburban \nor urban area--would benefit by keeping our citizens at work and not \nfacing the threat of joblessness. I think it also helps our overall \neconomy.\n  We have tried to move the unemployment extension through the Senate \ntwo times by the so-called unanimous consent process. A lot of things \nmove through the Senate by agreement on both sides. So you would think \nthat would be the case in the midst of a recession, in the midst of \nthese unemployment numbers, in the midst of week after week of bad news \non jobs. And we know the unemployment rate doesn't choose between a \nRepublican area and a Democratic area. The unemployment rate does not \nhave a Republican or Democratic flavor to it. Everyone is out of work \nno matter who they are or of what party. But what has happened? We \ntried to move the unemployment extension through the Senate by \nunanimous consent, and the Republican side of the Senate blocked it \nboth times. We could have had this done weeks ago but for one reason: \nthe Senate Republicans blocking the unemployment extension going \nforward.\n  It is tragically and I think painfully ironic that we are having to \nface this difficulty with our Republican colleagues because I keep \nhearing the following argument in the context of another topic. We are \nhaving an argument as to what our President should do with regard to \nour policy in Afghanistan and Pakistan. We hear people on the other \nside of the aisle, and pundits around Washington, saying the President \nhas to decide on Afghanistan right now. They were saying that 3 or 4 or \n5 weeks ago. They didn't want to give him more than a few days to \ndecide on what our policy should be. I have a strong disagreement with \nthat. I think when you are committing men and women on a field of \nbattle, you ought to have a policy that you have thought about and \nwhere all the options are analyzed and reviewed thoroughly, completely, \nand with the kind of scrutiny we should apply to that question. Some \nRepublican Members of the Senate wanted to move very quickly and wanted \nto have the President decide in a matter of days--not weeks but days. \nThey wanted him to make up his mind on Afghanistan in days. Yet when we \nwent to them with the sense of urgency about unemployment insurance and \nan extension of that, where you can literally document the impact of a \ndelay on real people's lives and real jobs and real communities across \nour country, many of them in Republican communities, what do we hear \nfrom the other side? No, we don't think we want to do that right now.\n\n  So they want what I think is a kind of dangerous and, I would argue, \nirresponsible speed on a decision about war, the grave question of war, \nbut they want to delay and block and be an impediment to an extension \nof unemployment insurance, which is an urgent problem. We can document \nexactly the number of people who are running out of their unemployment \ninsurance. We can document the exact number of people who are out of \nwork in a State or in a community.\n  So I think they have it backward. I think when it comes to a question \nsuch as the President is facing regarding Afghanistan, he should take a \ncouple of weeks to analyze it, and thank goodness he has. But on \nunemployment insurance, I think it is a much simpler question: We are \neither going to extend it now and help people who are out of work or \nnot. And I think it is long overdue for the Republicans in the Senate \nto release their hold or their blockade of this.\n  So we tried on October 8, and now it is late October. Over 140,000 \nAmericans have lost their coverage in the past 20 days--140,000 \nAmericans--because we have people on the Republican side of the aisle \nblocking what we have tried to do. Thousands of Americans have \nwithdrawn their last dollars from their savings accounts over the past \n20 days. Thousands of Americans have been wondering for the past 20 \ndays how they are going to provide a meal for their families or keep a \nroof over their head, pay the mortgage, pay the bill for their \nelectricity, or make an investment in their children's future.\n  Every day for the last several weeks, Jackie, from Monaca, PA, out in \nsouthwestern Pennsylvania, which, as I said, is suffering a 23-year \nhigh in unemployment, has called our office. She is wondering whether \nwe are going to pass a bill. Her benefits expired at the end of \nSeptember. So this isn't theoretical to Jackie and to her family and to \nmany people like her. She used the last of her savings to pay her rent \nat the beginning of the month and now is struggling to get by on \nnothing--nothing right now. She waits every day to see if we will \nprovide her with just a lifeline--not some handout, not some promise, \nbut a lifeline to get from here to there, to get her over the bridge, \nso to speak, from where she is now to where she hopes to be in a couple \nof weeks or months. She looks for work and she tries to keep up with \nher bills, but her story is similar to that of thousands of others who \nhave been directly impacted by the Senate Republican blockade. It is \nvitally important we pass this legislation right now.\n\n  Finally, I will conclude with a comment about health care in the \ncontext of the unemployment rate and our economy. In addition to the \nobvious problem with unemployment insurance benefits that we should \npass and get done, a lot of people are losing their health care at the \nsame time. The recovery bill, the bill we passed and the President \nsigned back in March, the Recovery and Reinvestment Act, provided a \nsubsidy of 65 percent, where an individual pays 35 percent of the \ncoverage for so-called COBRA coverage for those who were involuntarily \nterminated from their job. This subsidy only lasted for 9 months and is \nexpected to expire at the end of the year.\n  Following passage of an unemployment insurance extension, we should \nalso, in addition, push for an extension of the COBRA health care \nsubsidy. If we pass an unemployment insurance extension and do not \nprovide an extension of COBRA health care subsidy, Americans who are \nout of work will have to decide between using their unemployment check \nto pay for a drastic increase in their monthly premium or no health \ninsurance, no health coverage at all. I urge the Senate to swiftly pass \nnot only the unemployment extension but, when we get to it in the next \ncouple days or weeks, an immediate extension of COBRA and health care.\n  We have to do both to protect people from the ravages of this economy \nwhich, as I said before, knows no party, which is not a partisan issue. \nIt is an issue that affects all of America, urban\n\n[[Page S10834]]\n\nand rural, big city and small town. We have to continue to push hard. I \nurge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle, the Senate \nRepublicans, to allow this to go forward because, if they do not, I \nthink their own constituents are going to be as harmed as many of my \nconstituents are, in both parties.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I think it is important, as we \napproach this monumental debate on health care reform and health \ninsurance reform, to understand what it is we are trying to achieve at \nthe end of the day. I don't think there are very many people in America \nwho would say the present system of health insurance and health care \ndelivery is sufficient, given the fact there is uncertainty as to \nwhether someone will be able to continue in their health insurance and \nwhether, even if that health insurance is available, it is going to be \naffordable today. Availability and affordability are two of the goals. \nAs we go through this amendatory process once the bill comes to the \nfloor, we have to remember that is the goal.\n  If you listen to our good friend, the Senator from Arizona, he ticks \noff a whole bunch of things he says are additional taxes, fees, and so \nforth on the people. Let's examine that.\n  First of all, if you do nothing, we have a system that is not serving \nour people. I am going to round the percentages, but this is \napproximately the case: About half the American people get their health \ninsurance through their employer in a group policy. Indeed, what we are \nfinding out, as those policies are being renewed, is employers are \ncoming back to their employees and are saying: We have this humongous \nincrease in premium we are going to have to pay to continue to give you \nthe same benefits in group health insurance policies. One of the \nexecutives of one major telecommunications company told me they were \nforced, by the insurance company, to endure a 47-percent increase in \npremiums and, he said, we negotiated that down from a 53-percent \nincrease.\n  Let's not lose sight, as we get into the nits and gnats, of what we \nare trying to achieve. About half of us are insured through group \npolicies through our employers. Then there is another 16 percent of us \nor so for whom our health care is taken care of by Medicare. There is \nanother 10 percent of us whose health care is taken care of by \nMedicaid--because we are either poor enough or we are disabled enough \nto qualify under the Federal law that has a joint Federal-State \nfinancial responsibility. Generally, that split is about 55 percent of \nMedicaid paid by the Federal Government and 45 percent paid by the \nState government.\n  How much of the entire populous of the country have we already talked \nabout? About half employer-based health insurance, about another 15 or \nso percent Medicare, another 10 percent--we are up to about three-\nquarters of the American people.\n  What is the remaining 25 percent? About 5 percent of us, we don't \nhave an employer or our employer doesn't offer it, but we desperately \nneed health insurance. Where do we get it? We go to an insurance \ncompany and we get an individual policy. Of course, since it is only \nour life, there is not a big pool of people to spread that health risk \nover. Guess what happens to our premiums if we have an individual \npolicy. The premiums go through the roof. Oh, by the way, don't even \ntry to get an insurance policy on your health if you have a preexisting \ncondition.\n  What does that leave in the American population with regard to health \ncare through health insurance? About 20 percent don't have any health \ninsurance. They are uninsured. A major part of this health reform bill \nthat will come to this floor in a few weeks is to try to bring them \ninto the system, the uninsured, and get them insured. Why? First of \nall, it certainly makes sense, from a quality of life standpoint, that \nwe have someone able to get preventive care from a doctor before it \nturns into an emergency. But that is not now the case. They don't have \nhealth insurance, they can't afford it or they choose not to get it--\nbut they get health care. Where do they get it? They go to the most \nexpensive place, which is the emergency room, at the most expensive \ntime, and that is when the sniffles have turned into pneumonia. Of \ncourse, the care is exceptionally more costly.\n  By the way, who pays for that? All the rest of us back here pay for \nthat. Do you know how we pay for it? With our increased premiums on the \npolicies we are paying for, either individually or through our group \nemployer-sponsored health insurance. Do you know what that cost is? It \nis, on the average in America, about $1,000 more per year for a family \ninsurance policy that we are paying to take care of those people who \nare uninsured but still get health care.\n  When you come out here for the nits and the gnats, saying: It is \nwrong here, we are going to have a fee here and a tax there, let's not \nlose sight of the goal of what we are trying to do, which is bring \neverybody into the system, let the principle of insurance operate for \nyou, where you spread the health risk over millions of lives so you \nbring down the health costs, get a system of health insurance for those \nwho are uninsured and those who cannot afford insurance and especially \nthose who are getting stuck in the wallet through individual policies--\nget them into a health insurance exchange, where there is competition \nand where there is no barrier if you have a previous existing \ncondition; so you have a guarantee you can get health insurance, and it \nis going to be at a competitive price.\n  We have had a rhubarb in this country over something known as a \npublic option. Most people do not realize that 90 percent of the \nAmerican people will not be affected by a public option. But the 10 \npercent who will be getting their health insurance in the previously \nuninsured or unaffordable group, who is now going to get it in this \nhealth insurance exchange, where insurance companies are going to come \nin and compete for that business--that public insurance company, if it \nis in existence by the time the final bill passes, will compete in that \nhealth insurance exchange against those insurance companies on an even-\nsteven competitive basis.\n  Let's remember the goal. We are trying to bring in folks who cannot \nget insurance, the folks who do not have insurance but still get health \ncare that all the rest of us pay for. It lowers our bills over here by \nnot having to pay for them. When we bring them into the system, into \nthis new health insurance exchange, those who do not have health \ninsurance--some of them cannot afford it, but they are not poor enough \nto qualify for Medicaid in their State--the bill that will come to the \nfloor will provide a series of subsidies according to the person's \nincome, based on their percentage of the poverty level, that will \nassist them to get that health insurance in the private insurance \nsector.\n  I come back to the beginning, the reason I asked the Senator from \nPennsylvania if he would sit in the chair so I could come back to my \ndesk and make a response in response to Senator Kyl.\n  Is everyone satisfied with what we have? Clearly no. Is health \ninsurance available to everybody? The answer is no. Is it affordable \nfor everybody? The answer is no. Can it be streamlined by us changing \nthe health delivery system, which we want to do? That clearly is the \ncase.\n  We can do it with electronic records and accountable care \norganizations. We can do it by following the patient, instead of the \npatient going to this specialist and this specialist and this \nspecialist, and none of the specialists are talking to each other and \nthey are duplicating all of the tests. We can put primacy on a primary \ncare physician who will follow that patient. We can do it with those \nkinds of delivery reforms. This is the desirable goal. This is why we \nhave to have health insurance and health care reform.\n  My final point is this: The previous Senator who spoke, the Senator \nfrom Nevada, said we are going to take a lot of money out of Medicare. \nIn the bill that is coming to this floor, the money that is coming out \nof Medicare is the money that is going to be contributed\n\n[[Page S10835]]\n\nto the reform of the system coming from the Medicare providers, not the \nMedicare beneficiaries, in other words, not the senior citizens.\n  The Senator says: But there is $120 billion that is coming out of \nMedicare Advantage. Well, what was Medicare Advantage? Medicare \nAdvantage is a fancy term for a Medicare HMO. You know what a Medicare \nHMO is? It is an insurance company. When it was originally set up 10 or \n15 years ago, a Medicare HMO was going to save money to the Federal \nGovernment, Medicare, by paying only 95 percent of what Medicare fee \nfor service did.\n  But then the people in the rural areas did not get it, so it did not \nwork. Along comes this famous prescription drug bill 6 years ago, and \nadded to it is this fancy new thing called Medicare Advantage that \ncreates an advantage for the insurance companies by giving them an \nadditional 14 percent of reimbursement over the standard Medicare fee \nfor service.\n  Guess who gets to keep most of that. The insurance company gets to \ndecide what they are going to do with most of it. It is true that in \nthe 75 percent that the insurance company keeps per Medicare senior \ncitizen in Medicare Advantage, that money often is given as a break to \nthe senior citizen in things such as copays and the premium payments \nfor Medicare Part B and Medicare Part D.\n  That is why this Senator in the Finance Committee offered an \namendment that would say: Okay, we are going to get Medicare back to \nbeing standardized where we are not going to give a cushy 14-percent \nextra to the insurance companies called Medicare Advantage. Instead, we \nare going to start getting that on a more competitive basis over time \nto bring those payments down. But it would not be fair to take it away \nfrom the seniors who already have it, so this Senator offered an \namendment to grandfather in the seniors who have it now.\n  So do we need health reform? You bet we do. And the Senator from Utah \nis over here. I commend him. Because he and I are cosponsors on another \nhealth reform bill that is even more visionary than what the two of us \nthink is going to come to the floor. But it is a recognition that we \nhave to reform the present system.\n  I want to take this opportunity to try to set the record straight on \nsome of the statements that have been made here. I look forward to \ncontinuing this debate on all sides of the issues as the bill comes to \nthe floor.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        Tribute to Iris Morales\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I rise once again to recognize the service of one of \nAmerica's great Federal employees. Right now the Congress, the \nPresident, and the American public are engaged in historic discussions \nabout the future of our health insurance system. This is one of the \nmost important issues facing the country.\n  The dedicated public servant I will speak about today works for a \ngovernment-run health insurance program already serving 44 million \nAmericans. Medicare was established in 1965. Its mission is to provide \ncoverage for all Americans over the age of 65. At the time of its \ncreation, Medicare faced criticism from those who were apprehensive of \na government-run health insurance program. Today, however, Medicare is \npraised as a great success. Indeed, its fiercest defenders sit on both \nsides in this Chamber.\n  Medicare continues to protect nearly one out of every seven Americans \nagainst what would be otherwise prohibitive medical costs. The reason \nfor its success is not only that it provides a much needed service to \nAmerica's seniors; one of its greatest strengths is that the men and \nwomen who administer Medicare benefits are among the most outstanding \nFederal employees. They work for an agency called the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services or CMS. The CMS employee I will talk \nabout today has worked as a Medicare benefits administrator for 11 \nyears. Iris Morales joined the CMS Chicago Regional Office after having \nfirst served several years in the Navy. She has been on the front line \nas a benefits administrator helping to set at ease those who contact \nthe CMS with inquiries about their coverage.\n  Iris has called her job incredibly rewarding, and she is one of so \nmany Medicare administrators who spend their days solving problems for \nAmerica's seniors. On one day she might work to make sure a cancer \npatient has access to lifesaving chemotherapy. On the next Iris might \nreassure beneficiaries that their copayments are low enough for them to \nafford critical treatments.\n  Iris is set to retire next year, and when she does, she will join the \nranks of Medicare beneficiaries herself. I know that Iris, as a \nbeneficiary, will receive from those helping her in the years to come \nthe same kind of attention to detail, diligence, and professionalism \nshe has demonstrated through her years at CMS.\n  Iris Morales and all of the hard-working employees of CMS are proof \nof the constructive and important role our government already plays in \nensuring Americans' access to affordable health care. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me in recognizing this unsung hero and all of the \nemployees at CMS. I honor their contributions, and I thank them for the \ngreat job they do every day. I know that America's seniors are grateful \nfor their patience, their caring, and their service to the Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto proceed as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                                  TARP\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, it has been a little over a year since a \ngroup of us met in the Foreign Relations Committee room headed by the \ndistinguished Senator from Connecticut, Mr. Dodd, to talk about the \nfinancial crisis we were facing and how we would deal with that. We \ncame out of that meeting, held a press conference where we sounded \nperhaps more optimistic than we should have at the time about having a \nsolution to that problem. And out of that has come now a name that is \nwell known throughout the country called TARP. We did not call it that \nat the time.\n  But we talked it through in a completely bipartisan and substantive \nway and voted for the rescue package that came out of that discussion. \nI voted for that package. I voted for the original disbursement of \nTARP. I stand by that vote a year later. It was the right vote, the \nright situation, the right time, and the right thing to do.\n  But I will share now some of the thoughts that went into my \nparticipation in that particular meeting and some of the things that \ncame out of it. In anticipation of the meeting, I called some people \nwhose judgment I trust and discussed this. I was told Treasury cannot \nphysically push $700 billion out the door. You cannot sign that many \ncontracts. That is far too much money.\n  The suggestion I made was: Why don't we give them $50 billion, \nbecause I was told that is the most they could spend in any one month. \nWhy don't we give them $50 billion for 5 months or $250 billion and see \nhow it works before we buy into the $700 billion number that Secretary \nPaulson was talking about.\n  No, Secretary Paulson let us know he had to have $700 billion as the \nheadline. He could not calm down the markets, the international \nmarkets, unless he had a number that big. We talked it over in that \nroom and came up with this solution, which I think was a good one. We \nwould give them a $700 billion headline, because we authorized $700 \nbillion, but we actually only gave him $350 billion and said he would \nhave to come back to the Congress for the second 350.\n  Also in that group--and it was not by any means my suggestion or \nanyone else's suggestion--it was overwhelmingly the consensus: We have \nto put some controls in here. We have a congressional oversight \ncommittee that we created. We have to create an inspector general. I \nremember one of the members of the group saying: I do not trust any \nTreasury Secretary, no matter how bright he is, with $700 billion and \nabsolutely no reporting or transparency or control situation.\n\n[[Page S10836]]\n\n  One of the things that was discussed and that I thought was put in \nthe bill was that when the money starts to come back--because, \nunderstand, TARP was not a bailout program in the sense that we gave \nmoney to people never to recover anything. It was a program where we \nwere acquiring things, either acquiring collateral or acquiring stock. \nWhen the money starts to come back, it will be used to pay down the \nnational debt. If we are going to expend $700 billion to stabilize the \nsystem, when the $700 billion comes back, it goes to reduce the debt \nthat was created when it went out. That was my understanding of the \nagreement we made.\n  Well, I voted for the TARP and I voted for the first $350 billion. \nAfter we came to the second tranche, the second $350 billion, listening \nto the inspector general and listening to what the congressional \noversight committee had to say, and looking at how well the first $350 \nbillion had worked in stabilizing the situation and getting us past the \npanic we were facing, I voted against the second $350 billion because I \nwas afraid it would turn into somewhat of a bailout fund that could be \nused for things other than acquiring assets that could be liquidated \nand bring money back to the Treasury. That is indeed what has happened, \nbecause much of the money went for things very different than that \nwhich we were talking about in that room that morning.\n  The amendment I will offer to the bill, when we get on the bill, will \nbe to sunset TARP at the end of this year. This is where we are. \nTreasury is sitting on about $370 billion in the TARP fund right now. \nThe recession certainly is not over and the challenge in our economy is \nstill there with tremendous force. But the crisis we were facing when \nwe had that meeting is over, and Treasury, to deal with that kind of a \ncrisis, no longer needs that money.\n  The fear I have is that Treasury is starting to recycle the money and \nit is not going to pay down the national debt. It has become something \nof a slush fund to say: All right, if we have a circumstance here where \nwe wish to spend some money, we cannot get it from the Congress, let's \ntake it out of the TARP. If there is a situation over here where we \nthink it might be helpful, and we cannot get the Congress to support \nus, let's take it out of the TARP. The temptation, sitting on $370 \nbillion, to spend that money, is overwhelming.\n\n  When Secretary Geithner came before the Banking Committee or the \nJoint Economic Committee--I am sorry, I cannot, with my memory right \nnow, put the exact committee to it--the question arose about repaying \nthe national debt rather than recycling the money. He said the lawyers \nfrom the Treasury Department had looked at the act of Congress, and \nthey made it clear we in the Congress had made it clear the money could \nbe recycled, it could be relent, it could go out again. That came as a \ngreat surprise to me because I thought the conversation we had in that \nroom, as the bill was being written, made it clear the money had to go \nto pay down the national debt. But I am not in a position to sue the \nTreasury and argue with their lawyers, and even if we did over the \nactual meaning of what was in the bill, it would take so many years to \nadjudicate there is no point in it.\n  But it comes as a great surprise, as I say, to me that as the money \ncomes back in--and money is coming back in from TARP--it does not go to \npay down the national debt, and that it is being treated as a revolving \nfund, almost a revolving credit card, if you will, that the Treasury \ncan use for the purposes it deems well.\n  So I will offer an amendment that will sunset TARP at the end of this \nyear. I will point out, the inspector general and the congressional \noversight committee we set up on that occasion still have a number of \nquestions about TARP and the way it is being used, and there is great \nconcern that the transparency we had hoped for is not there.\n  I had come to the decision to offer this amendment for myself and \nSenator Thune--and we will do so, if we are allowed to, when we get on \nthe bill--long before the Wall Street Journal offered an editorial. But \non October 27, the Wall Street Journal had an editorial entitled \n``Rolling up the TARP,'' which I ask unanimous consent be printed in \nthe Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BENNETT. The lead paragraph I wish to quote. It says:\n\n       The Troubled Asset Relief Program will expire on December \n     31, unless Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner exercises his \n     authority to extend it to next October.\n\n  They obviously did not know about my amendment or I am sure they \nwould have endorsed it.\n\n       We hope he doesn't. Historians will debate TARP's role in \n     ending the financial panic of 2008, but today there is little \n     evidence that the government needs or can prudently manage \n     what has evolved into a $700 billion all-purpose political \n     bailout fund.\n       We supported TARP to deal with toxic bank assets and \n     resolve failing banks as a resolution agency of the kind that \n     worked with savings and loans in the 1980s. Some taxpayer \n     money was needed beyond what the FDIC's shrinking insurance \n     fund had available. But TARP quickly became a Treasury tool \n     to save failing institutions without imposing discipline \n     (Citigroup) and even to force public capital onto banks that \n     didn't need it. This stigmatized all banks as taxpayer \n     supplicants and is now evolving into an excuse for the \n     Federal Reserve to micromanage compensation.\n\n  I think we take the decision for Secretary Geithner and we sunset \nTARP on December 31, and that will be the amendment I will offer when \nwe get on the bill.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Oct. 27, 2009]\n\n                          Rolling Up the TARP\n\n       The $700 billion for banks has become an all-purpose \n     bailout fund.\n       The Troubled Asset Relief Program will expire on December \n     31, unless Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner exercises his \n     authority to extend it to next October. We hope he doesn't. \n     Historians will debate TARP's role in ending the financial \n     panic of 2008, but today there is little evidence that the \n     government needs or can prudently manage what has evolved \n     into a $700 billion all-purpose political bailout fund.\n       We supported TARP to deal with toxic bank assets and \n     resolve failing banks as a resolution agency of the kind that \n     worked with savings and loans in the 1980s. Some taxpayer \n     money was needed beyond what the FDIC's shrinking insurance \n     fund had available. But TARP quickly became a Treasury tool \n     to save failing institutions without imposing discipline \n     (Citigroup) and even to force public capital onto banks that \n     didn't need it. This stigmatized all banks as taxpayer \n     supplicants and is now evolving into an excuse for the \n     Federal Reserve to micromanage compensation.\n       TARP was then redirected well beyond the financial system \n     into $80 billion in ``investments'' for auto companies. These \n     may never be repaid but served as a lever to abuse creditors \n     and favor auto unions. TARP also bought preferred stock in \n     struggling insurers Lincoln and Hartford, though insurance \n     companies are not subject to bank runs and pose no ``systemic \n     risk.'' They erode slowly as customers stop renewing \n     policies.\n       TARP also became another fund for Congress to pay off the \n     already heavily subsidized housing industry by financing home \n     mortgage modifications. Not one cent of the $50 billion in \n     TARP funds earmarked to modify home mortgages will be \n     returned to the Treasury, says the Congressional Budget \n     Office.\n       As of the end of September, Mr. Geithner was sitting on \n     $317 billion of uncommitted TARP funds, thanks in part to \n     bank repayments. But this sum isn't the limit of his check-\n     writing ability. Treasury considers TARP a ``revolving \n     fund.'' If taxpayers are ever paid back by AIG, GM, Chrysler, \n     Citigroup and the rest, Treasury believes it has the \n     authority to spend that returned money on new adventures in \n     housing or other parts of the economy.\n       A TARP renewal by Mr. Geithner could thus put at risk the \n     entire $700 billion. Rep. Jeb Hensarling (R., Texas) and \n     former SEC Commissioner Paul Atkins sit on TARP's \n     Congressional Oversight Panel. They warn that the entire \n     taxpayer pot could be converted into subsidies. They are \n     especially concerned about expanding the foreclosure \n     prevention programs that have been failing by every measure.\n       TARP inspector general Neil Barofsky agrees that the \n     mortgage modifications ``will yield no direct return'' and \n     notes charitably that ``full recovery is far from certain'' \n     on the money sent to AIG and Detroit. Mr. Barofsky also notes \n     that since Washington runs huge deficits, and interest rates \n     are almost sure to rise in coming years, TARP will be \n     increasingly expensive as the government pays more to borrow.\n       Even with the banks, TARP has been a double-edged sword. \n     While its capital injections saved some banks, its lack of \n     transparency created uncertainty that arguably prolonged the \n     panic. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke and former \n     Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson recently admitted to Mr. \n     Barofsky what everyone figured at the time of the first \n     capital injections. Although\n\n[[Page S10837]]\n\n     they claimed in October 2008 they were providing capital only \n     to healthy banks, Mr. Bernanke now says some of the firms \n     were under stress. Mr. Paulson now admits that he thought one \n     in particular was in danger of failing. By forcing all nine \n     to take the money, they prevented the weaklings from being \n     stigmatized.\n       Says Mr. Barofsky, ``In addition to the basic transparency \n     concern that this inconsistency raises, by stating expressly \n     that the `healthy' institutions would be able to increase \n     overall lending, Treasury created unrealistic expectations \n     about the institutions' conditions and their ability to \n     increase lending.''\n       The government also endangered one of the banks that they \n     considered healthy at the time. In December, Mr. Paulson \n     pressured Bank of America to complete its purchase of Merrill \n     Lynch. His position is that a failed deal would have hurt \n     both firms, but this is highly speculative. Mr. Barofsky \n     reports that, according to Fed documents, the government \n     viewed BofA as well-capitalized, but officials believed that \n     its tangible common equity would fall to dangerously low \n     levels if it had to absorb the sinking Merrill.\n       In other words, by insisting that BofA buy Merrill, Messrs. \n     Paulson and Bernanke were spreading systemic risk by stuffing \n     a failing institution into a relatively sound one. And they \n     were stuffing an investment bank into one of the nation's \n     largest institutions whose deposits were guaranteed by \n     taxpayers. BofA would later need billions of dollars more in \n     TARP cash to survive that forced merger, and when that news \n     became public it helped to extend the overall financial \n     panic.\n       Treasury and the Fed would prefer to keep TARP as insurance \n     in case the recovery falters and the banking system hits the \n     skids again. But the more transparent way to address this \n     risk is by buttressing the FDIC fund that insures bank \n     deposits and resolves failing banks. The political class has \n     twisted TARP into a fund to finance its pet programs and \n     constituents, and the faster it fades away, the better for \n     taxpayers and the financial system.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Cantwell). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before I get to the substance of my \nremarks, let me comment briefly, if I can, on the comments of my \ncolleague and friend from Utah, Senator Bennett. He has been an \ninvaluable Member when it comes to these issues of economics in our \ncountry. His background and experience has brought a wealth of talent \nto this institution at some very critical moments.\n  I want my colleagues to know, as the new chairman of the Banking \nCommittee after the election of 2006, I happened to have been in the \nposition of being asked to manage a situation that began, as many will \nrecall, back in September of last year. September 18 is a date which \nwill be forever emblazoned in my mind and memory. It was on that \nevening that a small group of us were asked to gather in the office of \nthe Speaker of the House, where Chairman Bernanke of the Federal \nReserve Bank and Secretary Paulson, the Secretary of the Treasury, \nannounced to us that we had a matter of days to act as a Congress or we \nwould face a meltdown of our financial system in this country and \nelsewhere.\n  In some ways, it was the economic equivalent to 9/11. It took all the \noxygen out of the room, I can tell you. I was sitting next to Dick \nShelby, my friend from Alabama. As I say, there were about 10 or 12 of \nus in that room that evening who received that message.\n  Within 2 weeks, from September 18 to the end of the month, we ended \nup voting here on the floor that night--we all sat in our chairs, as we \ndo on rare occasions when there is a moment of significant import. \nEvery single Member cast a ballot from their seat.\n  I knew that evening, by the way, as I listened to the call of the \nroll, that there were several of our colleagues here who were 40 days \naway from the election, and that probably they were going to lose their \nseats if they supported the proposal. And they did. But they did what I \nthought was the courageous and right thing to do. And 74 people voted \nthat night in favor of it; 25 against. Our colleague from Massachusetts \nwas not here that evening, Ted Kennedy. There were 99 Senators.\n  As long as I live, I will never forget that vote that evening because \nI think it is what the Founders sort of had in mind. We recall--those \nof us who were here, I am sure my friend from Florida remembers, it \nmade the townhall meetings pale by comparison--the reaction over those \n2 weeks across the Nation. There will be historians who debate the \nwisdom of the specifics of the bill.\n  But I recall with great clarity the morning my friend from Utah just \ndescribed, with about five of us in the room, and that was S-116, one \nfloor down from where we stand this evening. We met to try and fashion \ntogether something on a bipartisan basis that we could present to our \ncolleagues and the administration and others that would incorporate the \nprotections we thought we could pull together in a space of days to \nrespond to this, and with the necessary resources.\n  Bob Bennett was the author, as I recall, who insisted we break up \nthis proposal into two parts so we would have a chance to evaluate the \nsuccess of it. I think it was a remarkable and very valuable suggestion \nthat contributed significantly to the outcome of that vote. It also \noffered those an opportunity at a later date to determine whether to \nproceed with it.\n  There were differences of opinion about that, and, again, historians \nwill debate this. But the people of this country ought to know that a \nguy named Bob Bennett from the State of Utah, along with several \nothers, played a role which I think helped save our country at a \ncritical moment. We have a lot of disagreements around here. I am a \nDemocrat from New England. He is a Republican from Utah, although, as \nhe well knows, my wife's family is from Utah, so I have some Utah \nconnections. But it was one of those moments where I think Americans \nwould like to think we can act around here when a crisis occurs.\n  While we differ and disagree on a lot of issues, as he knows, despite \nour friendship--as long as I live, in the years I have served here, \nthat morning, that occasion, and the events that followed in the short \ndays afterwards, I think, helped keep this country on a stable footing \nand we avoided the kind of depression and collapse that could have \noccurred.\n  I did not intend to speak about this, but since he addressed the \nissue--I have kept a lot of notes about those 2 weeks. I have copious \nnotes, almost 500 pages of them, that describe the events of those 2 \nweeks in great detail because I was involved in every meeting and every \ndrafting session. So I can tell you down to every dotted ``i'' and \ncrossed ``t'' what happened during those 2 weeks. It was a moment of \ngreat import, and I thank my friend from Utah for his contribution to \nall of that.\n  Madam President, I want to address the issue of the Unemployment \nCompensation Extension Act. I am sorry we are still here debating this. \nThis legislation was introduced nearly 3 weeks ago, and twice the \nadoption of this bill has been stopped, despite overwhelming support. \nYesterday 87 of us voted to get us one step closer to extending \nunemployment benefits. We all would prefer to be talking about how we \ncan get people back to work than extending benefits. It would be far \nbetter for the Nation if we could talk about what we are doing to \ncreate jobs.\n  But in the interim, while we have not created as many jobs as we \nwould like, providing benefits is crucial. Let me take a moment to add \nthat we would not be here at all without the work of our colleague from \nNew Hampshire, Senator Jeanne Shaheen, who has championed this issue \nover the last month or so as a new Member. We are neighbors in New \nEngland, but she speaks for the country when she talks about the \nimportance of this issue and what a difference it has made in the lives \nof families, as they struggle to keep their homes and provide the \nnecessary resources for their children and others.\n  As part of this effort--and I know there is some debate--I wanted to \nalso recognize my colleague and friend from Georgia, Johnny Isakson. \nThe two of us have been working, as many of my colleagues know, on a \nproposal to extend and expand the first-time home buyer tax credit. \nSenator Isakson has been the leader on this issue. I commend him for \nit, and I want to thank him and his staff for their work to get this \nextension before the credit runs out on November 30.\n  Already we have seen the impact of this credit on jump-starting the \nhousing sector. Sales of existing homes rose\n\n[[Page S10838]]\n\n9.4 percent in September--the highest level in 2 years. Extending this \ncredit, in our view, temporarily through the slowest housing sales \nmonths would help maintain the recovery.\n  The great fear everyone has is that without swift action these good \nsignals we have been getting--and while certainly not a recovery yet, \nthey are an indication we may be heading now in the right direction--\nwill stall during these critical cold months, and the winter months are \ndifficult months for the housing sector. I think inaction would be a \ngreat mistake.\n  This legislation he and I have authored would extend the current \ncredit through the spring, increase the income limitations, and provide \na slightly smaller credit to the so-called move-up market--not just \nfirst-time home buyers, but the move-up market--helping to make more \nthan 70 percent of current home buyers eligible for this credit.\n  I want to stress, as my colleague from Georgia has on numerous \noccasions, including during a hearing I held only a few days ago of the \nSenate Banking Committee--where he testified eloquently, I might add, \nthat this tax credit needs to be temporary. Democrats and Republicans \non the committees, I think, were deeply impressed with how \nknowledgeable Johnny Isakson is about real estate issues. He spent more \nthan three decades in the business and knows it well, and he impressed, \nI think, all of us with his knowledge of this industry and what a \ncritical component it is of our economy.\n  That aspect he advocated for, as I mentioned before, is that the \neffectiveness of this credit depends on it being temporary, which it \nis. That will encourage, we believe, prospective home buyers to buy \nthat home now--those who are thinking about it. Extending it \ncontinuously would not.\n  I want to indicate to my colleagues that this credit should remain \ntemporary and not become a tax extender that we extend year after year \nafter year after year, as we do in certain other areas of our economy.\n  But neither the unemployed nor prospective home buyers will be helped \nby stalling on the speedy passage of this legislation.\n  Every night for 3 weeks now--going back to the unemployment \ncompensation issue--we have gone home and not had to worry about how we \nare going to make those mortgage payments or feed our families. We are \nSenators, and so we have these jobs that provide us with more than a \ndecent income, and we never have to feel that gnawing worry about \nwhether there is going to be enough money to allow us to keep our homes \nor to see to it that our families are going to have the basic \nnecessities they need.\n  Every night--every night--7,000 more Americans in our Nation have \nexhausted their unemployment benefits. So for 3 weeks--7,000 people a \nday have had their jobless benefits run out. They do not have jobs. \nThey do not have benefits to help them. These are hard-working people \nwho contribute to our economy and contribute to our country, their \nfamilies, and their neighborhoods. They have been good providers. And \nbecause of a collapsing economy--which they did not create--they find \nthemselves in the dire circumstances where they are unable to meet \nthose obligations at home.\n  Over the years I have been in this body, we have come together during \ncritical moments like this--never quite as serious as this one--and \nhave extended those benefits to people because we know how important it \nis to them. We have been able to come together to get it done. Yet now, \nfor nearly 3 weeks, we have been stalled in our effort to provide \nneeded relief.\n  I mentioned early we provided relief for the banks, $700 billion in \nrelief, in less time than it is taking us to provide relief to jobless \nworkers. That is what Bob Bennett and I were doing. We had a crisis in \nthe country. So we worked on the legislation for 2 weeks. From \nSeptember 18 to October 1, that is how long it took for us to come \ntogether and vote 74 to 25 to provide $700 billion to stabilize the \nfinancial institutions in this country. I think we did the right thing. \nHistory will debate it. Here we have been nearly 3 weeks and we can't \neven come up with unemployment compensation for the 7,000 people every \nday who are losing these benefits.\n\n  You explain that to the American public. This collapse occurred in \nour economy not because they did anything wrong, but because they lost \ntheir job. Here we are still 3 weeks later dithering about whether we \ncan get some special amendment we would like added that has nothing to \ndo with this issue--ACORN payments or other proposals. I don't question \nthe sincerity of people, but why would they allow that to obstruct an \nextension of jobless benefits that hundreds of thousands of Americans \nso desperately need?\n  In total, since playing politics with this issue, 140,000 Americans \nhave exhausted their benefits. That is my math. We know this is \nimportant. Last night we had 87 votes to move to the motion to proceed, \nbut here we are running out 30 more hours while another 7,000 people \nare losing those benefits.\n  So I don't have to tell my colleagues how vital this lifeline is for \nfamilies back home in their states. They all know it. People can't find \nwork. They need a little help to put food on the table and make ends \nmeet until they can find that job again. Unfortunately, this recession \nis hitting families in all of our States.\n  According to the National Employment Law Project, nearly 14,500 \npeople in my home State of Connecticut and 400,000 people nationwide \nhave already exhausted all of their unemployment benefits. By the end \nof the year, that will rise to 20,000 people in my State, 1.4 million \npeople across the country.\n  One of my constituents wrote in desperation the following:\n\n       I have been without benefits for two months now. I have a \n     family of 5. Every day is a struggle. My husband and I have \n     been looking for work every day. There are no jobs! Something \n     has to change. I ran out of my benefits. Please have someone \n     help not only me, but everyone that is without work.\n\n  It is not just these people who will suffer when these benefits run \nout; it will be their children. It will be the local businesses whose \ncustomers can't afford to buy their products anymore. It will be the \nlocal governments who lose tax revenues that pay the salaries of our \npolicemen and firefighters.\n  We have a good bill that I worked on with Senator Baucus, Senator \nReid, and, as I said, Senator Shaheen of New Hampshire, who has been \nour champion on this issue. Our new freshman Senator from New Hampshire \nhas led the way, and again, her leadership has been invaluable.\n  Madam President, 140,000 people over 3 weeks whose benefits have run \nout while Republicans have stood in the way of this important \nlegislation, I think, deserve better. We managed to give the banks $700 \nbillion in 2 weeks; we ought to be able to take care of people who are \nlosing their benefits by passing a bill that they need so desperately.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Thank you, Madam President. I wish to thank Senator \nDodd from Connecticut for his kind words and for all of the work he has \ndone to try and move an unemployment extension for people, and for his \neloquence in talking about the need to help those people who are \ncurrently running out of their benefits. As is the Senator from \nConnecticut, I am here one more time to voice my support for the \nUnemployment Compensation Extension Act.\n  I am pleased, as the Senator from Connecticut is, that yesterday the \nSenate voted by an overwhelming majority to move this legislation \nforward. But like the Senator from Connecticut, I remain very \ndisappointed that even with 87 votes to move forward, we are still here \ntoday. Another day has gone by, a day when 7,000 more workers have lost \ntheir benefits, and the opponents of this extension are still playing \npolitics to hold up the help that so many people around the country \nneed.\n  During the delay of the past 3 weeks, more than 100,000 Americans \nhave exhausted their unemployment benefits. Without this extension, \nnearly 2 million jobless workers will lose their benefits by the end of \nthe year. The American people should be outraged by this continued \ndelay.\n  I would like to read an e-mail I got this morning from Jane McDermott \nfrom Stoddard, NH. Jane has been unemployed for over a year, and she \nwill\n\n[[Page S10839]]\n\nexhaust her remaining benefits in the next 2 weeks. She writes:\n\n       Right now, receiving unemployment means I can eat and I can \n     pay for my medication. Those of us who are still unemployed \n     still have bills and property taxes to pay. With the rug \n     being pulled out from under us, it means being on the edge of \n     homelessness.\n\n  She writes to me:\n\n       I urge you to make this fight a priority. Here in New \n     Hampshire there are many, including myself, who depend on \n     having heat, lights, and even enough gas in our cars to \n     search for employment each and every day, especially over the \n     holidays.\n\n  She signs her e-mail: Sincerely, Jane McDermott from Stoddard.\n  Jane McDermott is out looking for work every day, but with more than \nsix people out of work for every job opening, she hasn't been able to \nfind that new job. She is like millions of hard-working Americans from \nevery community and every State and every part of our country. This is \njust one out of dozens of calls and e-mails my office gets every single \nday.\n  So I urge my colleagues to stop playing politics and to pass this \nextension. It is the right thing to do for our unemployed workers, and \nit is the right thing to do to stimulate our economy. Let's not let one \nmore day go by without extending unemployment benefits for the tens of \nthousands who need them all across this country.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I note the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to \nspeak as in morning business for 1 hour. I also ask unanimous consent \nto engage in a colloquy with other Senators who may join me.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, first, let me speak on the \nissue that Senator Jeanne Shaheen spoke about before me just briefly. I \nwish to compliment her for being such a champion for extending \nunemployment compensation. We are talking about people who, in many \ncases, through no fault of their own, lost employment. They may well be \nthe only provider for their family. They don't have the wherewithal to \nsupport their family.\n  We have in this recession, this deep recession we are in the middle \nof, several times for people like that, extended unemployment benefits. \nSenator Shaheen and Senator Dodd and others who have spoken have \ndescribed the personal circumstances people are in. We can't believe we \ncan't move this legislation along to extend unemployment compensation \nbenefits. These people need help in the recession and most likely they \nare the dollars that will be spent in the economy.\n  I wish to describe the procedure that has occurred. We had 87 \nSenators vote on a motion to proceed. The first thing we did to get on \nto a piece of legislation such as this unemployment benefits \ncompensation legislation was we filed a motion to proceed because we \ndidn't have the consent of the Republican leadership. We were then \nrequired to let that motion for cloture ripen over a 2-day period. So \nas many have watched, there hasn't been necessarily a lot of debate. It \nhas ripened. We had the vote after 2 days--87 votes. Then, after 87 \nsaid we should move forward on the motion to proceed, there was a 30-\nhour postcloture period.\n  Well, what has happened with that is we also haven't had that much \ndebate occurring on the Senate floor, but the time continues to run. So \nthese delay tactics--they are called filibuster tactics, but in a way \nit isn't a filibuster. There is nobody here filibustering most of the \ntime. So it is a delay tactic to do something the Nation needs.\n  So I compliment all of the Senators who are standing up for this \nlegislation. I know Senator Whitehouse is also one who believes we \nshould pass unemployment compensation legislation very quickly.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Madam President, we are here again this evening as a group of \nSenators--Senator Whitehouse has joined me--to strongly support the \ninclusion of a public option in health care reform legislation. I \nencourage other Senators who support the public option to come down and \njoin us.\n  We were heartened earlier this week when majority leader Harry Reid \nannounced that he would include a public option in the bill he is \nmerging from the Senate Finance and HELP Committees. Senator Reid \nshowed real leadership in developing a compromise that includes the \npublic option, something that a wide majority of Americans support and \nwant included in this reform.\n  This is another step in the direction of meaningful reform, but we \nare by no means finished with this debate. We expect defenders of the \nstatus quo, as well as those who continue to put insurance company \nprofits over people, to step up their attacks and step up their \nmisinformation campaign. The bottom line is that a public option is the \nbest proposal on the table to help keep the insurance companies honest. \nIt will insert much needed competition into the insurance market, and \nit will give Americans another affordable, quality choice for their \nhealth insurance needs.\n  So with all of that said tonight, I want to continue by highlighting \na story out of New Mexico. It is a letter I received from a woman from \nPlacitas, NM. She is a small business owner who wrote to tell me about \na rate increase notice she got from her health insurer. She was told to \nexpect a 9- or 10-percent increase next year. For two people, that will \nmean $2,300 a month in premiums she will have to pay. Here is what she \nwrote:\n\n       We can't afford it. I am now faced with the likelihood of \n     having to drop insurance which for two cancer survivors is \n     not the right answer.\n\n  I know I speak for many of my colleagues here tonight when I say our \noffices get dozens and dozens of e-mails and letters like this each and \nevery week. Americans are struggling, and they are looking to us for \nrelief from an impossible situation they cannot fight or win.\n  There was a story in the newspaper over the weekend that I think \nillustrates how urgent this situation has become. It illustrates why a \npublic option must be a part of this reform. In the newspaper it was \nreported that many small businesses are facing the steepest rises in \ninsurance premiums they have seen in years. That is saying a lot \nconsidering that insurance premiums have already more than doubled over \nthe past 9 years.\n  In this news story, insurance brokers and benefits consultants said \ntheir small business clients are seeing premiums go up an average of \nabout 15 percent for next year and in some places as high as 23 \npercent. That is double the rate of last year's increases which were \nalready unacceptably high. Do you know why these small businesses are \nseeing such big increases? This report said it is because insurers are \ntrying to raise their premiums ahead of anything we do legislatively \nthat might reduce their profits.\n  Health insurance companies are only looking out for themselves and \ntheir own profits. It is up to us to look out for hard-working \nAmericans. It is up to us to look out for America's entrepreneurs, \nthose small business men and women whose companies employ some 40 \npercent of American workers.\n  With that, I will open the floor to my colleagues. Let's talk about \nwhat a public option would mean for small businesses and how difficult \nit is for American entrepreneurs to keep their heads above water as \nhealth insurance companies continue to raise their rates, deny them \ncoverage, or drop them completely when they place a claim to be \nreimbursed.\n  I see Senator Whitehouse here. He has been a champion throughout this \nprocess in terms of the public option. I will yield to him. I also see \nSenator Durbin here, our majority whip, who I hope will join us, who \nhas also been an incredible champion when he stands up in leadership \ntime and throughout the day on the public option.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, I thank the Senator from New Mexico \nfor organizing this time.\n  What do we mean by a public option? To begin with, I will explain a \nlittle\n\n[[Page S10840]]\n\nwhat our public option is and why it is so important. Then I have some \nstories from people in Rhode Island who have contacted me and who are \nexactly the reason we need to do this.\n  The first thing you will hear is our friends on the other side saying \nthat the public option is a government takeover of the health care \nsystem, that it is going to squeeze out private providers and it will \nbe subsidized by taxpayers and all these things. I know something about \nthe public option that came out of the HELP Committee because, along \nwith Sherrod Brown and Kay Hagan, I wrote it. So I know a little bit \nabout what it does. Those things are just not true.\n  The design of the public option is that it exists State by State. In \neach State, it has to stay solvent. It can't lose money. The government \nputs up the money any insurance company needs to start with, the \ninitial capital. After that, the public option in each State, from its \nrevenues, the premiums it charges, has to make money and stay solvent. \nIf not, it fails like any other company. Secretary Sebelius of HHS is \nmandated to make sure each State's operation runs on a solvent basis. \nSo there is no taxpayer bailout. It is head-to-head competition on a \nlevel playing field, and the insurance companies, frankly, should not \nbe frightened of it. They are, but the reason they are has a lot to do \nwith their bad practices and very little to do with anything about the \ndesign of the public option.\n  One of the reasons we need it, to give a little background on this, \nyou have to remember where our national health expenditures are going. \nLook at this chart. This is how much we spend on health care.\n  I was born in 1955, when we were spending $12.5 billion a year on \nhealth care in this country. We probably spend that much a day now. In \n1979, just after I graduated from college, by then we had gone from \nroughly $12 billion a year to $220 billion a year. In 1987, which was \nabout when my daughter was born, we were over $500 billion or $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion a year. In 1992, we were at $849 billion a year. In 2009, we \nare at $2.5 trillion a year. You can see the shape of the curve on the \nchart. It is not going out and leveling off. It is getting steeper and \nsteeper. Costs are going through the roof, and the private insurance \nindustry is driving that.\n  There are big savings that can be achieved. The President of the \nUnited States, President Obama, and his Council of Economic Advisers \nissued a report in July of this year that said:\n\n       Efficiency improvements in the U.S. health care system \n     potentially could free up resources equal to 5 percent of the \n     U.S. GDP.\n\n  They continued:\n\n       It should be possible to cut total health expenditures by \n     about 30 percent without worsening outcomes . . . which would \n     again suggest that savings on the order of 5 percent of GDP \n     could be feasible.\n\n  If you do the math, based on GDP, 5 percent is more than $700 billion \na year--that is $700 billion with a ``b''--in excess costs in our \nhealth care system. So we have a big target this public option can \nshoot for.\n  People say: Well, if there is no subsidy involved, how is it that the \npublic option is going to be able to compete against these private \ninsurers and save costs? Well, three ways:\n  No. 1, no profits necessary; they will be not-for-profit. In Rhode \nIsland, about a year ago, United Health Care, a big private insurance \ncompany which has a 16-percent market share in Rhode Island--and we are \na small State; we are not like Illinois or even New Mexico; we are only \na million people. So this is a company in a State of a million people \nwith only a 16-percent market share, and they asked to remove $37 \nmillion in profits from that 1 year out of the State to go back and pay \nfor salaries of CEOs and shareholders and all that. Think how much $37 \nmillion could have been delivered in health care to 16 percent of the \ninsured population of Rhode Island, a State of only a million people, \nif it didn't have to go out in profit. So that is one thing. Profits \ndon't have to be sucked out of the system.\n  Second is administrative costs. One of the reasons this cost keeps \ngoing up is because the administrative costs of the insurance companies \ngo up. In 2000, while these costs were going up, they were raising \ntheir administrative costs by more than 100 percent. What did they do \nwith those administrative costs? They make it more difficult for you to \nget care and harder for your doctor to get permission to give you the \ntreatment you need.\n  You hear the other side talking about government bureaucrats standing \nbetween you and health care. They don't stand between you and your \nhealth care; insurance company bureaucrats stand between you and your \nhealth care. And they are getting better at it all the time. The \narmamentarium they are creating to make it difficult for providers to \nget paid and get authority to go forward is getting more complex and \nexpensive every year.\n  In addition to the fact that those costs have doubled, gone up more \nthan 100 percent, what do the doctors and hospitals have to do? They \nhave to fight back or else they will get rolled.\n  So you have this whole other cost. I went to the Cranston Community \nHealth Center, a wonderful community health center in Cranston, RI. \nThey told me that 50 percent of their personnel are not dedicated to \nproviding health care but are dedicated to fighting with the insurance \ncompanies to get paid and to get prior authorization. On top of that, \n50 percent of their personnel--they pay almost $300,000 a year to fancy \nconsultants whom they have to hire to fight back against the insurance \nindustry.\n  So one thing they can stop doing is taking the profits out. Another \nthing they can do is to wind down all that administrative cost, stop \ntorturing the doctors and hospitals, let them wind down their \nadministrative costs, and bring down the arms race over claims payments \nand approval we are living with right now. That is something a public \noption can do in addition to not taking out profits.\n  The third thing is to reform the health care system. We have all \nheard the testimony and seen the steps we put into our legislation to \nimprove the quality of health care. When you improve the quality of \nhealth care, it saves money. It is interesting the way that works. When \nyou improve the infection rate in intensive care units, people get out \nsooner and they don't get those postoperative infections, and it costs \nabout $60,000 for infections, on average. It saves money. Everybody is \nout sooner and the costs are less. In Michigan, in 15 months, they \nsaved $150 million and 1,500 lives just by cleaning up and preventing \ninfections in hospital intensive care units.\n\n  So you can save money and save lives if you are focused on improving \nquality instead of torturing the doctors and the providers and denying \ncare and trying to throw people out when they get sick. It is a \ndifferent way of going about the business. But it is something a public \noption can do.\n  The same logic applies to the prevention of illness. We don't do \nanywhere near enough to prevent illness in this country. A public \noption is willing to invest in prevention. We will invest in health \ninformation technology and in promoting better public health records \nfor everybody. We will make sure people understand the value of the \ntreatments they get, how much they cost, and whether they work. People \nwill make better decisions about their care.\n  Finally, through the public option we will be able to stop paying \ndoctors and hospitals for doing more and more tests and procedures and \npay them for results. That will help change the direction of American \nmedicine. That is how you get to the $700 billion a year the \nPresident's Council on Economic Advisers said could be saved in our \nhealth care system.\n  People talk about the Lewin Group, which is a knowledgeable group \nabout health insurance and health care costs. Here is what they say:\n\n       Current levels of spending could be reduced by limiting \n     excess consumption, managing disease, promoting competition \n     and improving transactions.\n\n  Here are the sources of potential excess costs. Right now, they are \nat $2.4 billion, the total cost. You can save $151 billion in excess \ncosts from incentives to overuse services; $519 billion in excess costs \nfrom poor care management and lifestyle factors; $135 billion from \nexcess costs due to competition and regulatory factors; $203 billion \nfrom excess costs due to transactional inefficiency. That is a fancy \nway of talking about administrative warfare between insurers and \ndoctors.\n  There are big savings to be had out there, and this legislation \nbuilds in\n\n[[Page S10841]]\n\nthose tools--quality, prevention, transparency, information technology, \nand payment reform. The key to making them all work their best is a \npublic option that will pick them up and do the job for the American \npeople.\n  The question fundamentally for this legislation is, Do you trust the \nprivate insurance industry? Do you trust the people who, if you have a \npreexisting condition, won't let you in the door or will deny coverage \nfor that? Do you trust the people who, the first time you show up after \nhaving been a loyal customer for years, the first thing they do is go \nback to look at the form to see if you filled it out wrong so they can \nthrow you off because suddenly you became ill and expensive? Do you \ntrust the people who, when you get sick and your doctor recommends \ntreatment, butt in and say: No, no, no, we don't want you to get that \ntreatment; we want something different than what your doctor \nrecommends. They will say it is because of quality, but what you will \nnotice is that every single time the insurance company steps in to \nprevent your care from coming from your doctor, what they recommend is \nsomething that is cheaper for them. They have never once said: Wait a \nminute, what the doctor recommended is not right, you need a more \nexpensive regime of care because we want to treat you right. No, they \nsay: Sorry, that is too expensive; we are cutting you off. Do you trust \nthat industry to lead America out of this cost problem and into this \nnew future? I don't. That is why we need the public option. And I think \nthere are other reasons.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes, I am happy to.\n  Mr. DURBIN. One of the aspects of the bill now being considered by \nthe Congressional Budget Office is the opt-out provision. We have heard \nfrom the Republican side of the aisle for as long as this debate has \ngone on about their resistance and opposition to the idea of so-called \ngovernment-run health care.\n  I have yet to hear the first Republican Senator come to the floor and \nsuggest we eliminate Medicare, which is a government-run health care \nprogram which some 40 million Americans use every day to protect \nthemselves when they need health insurance; nor have they suggested \neliminating Medicaid, which involves health insurance for the poorest \nin America. Some 40 million to 50 million Americans are covered by \nMedicaid. They have not suggested eliminating veterans health care, \nanother government health care program which helps millions of those \nwho served our country; nor have they suggested eliminating the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program, a creation of the Federal \nGovernment, so that literally millions of children across America have \nthis kind of protection and the parents have peace of mind.\n  By my estimation, more than a third of the people in America have \nprotection from government health insurance. Although our friends on \nthe Republican side are critical of government health insurance, they \ndo not want to eliminate any part of it, but they are arguing that \nbasically Americans do not like it.\n  The polls say otherwise. When you ask the American people, throughout \nthis debate, they say: We are generally confused, but we do know one \nthing; that is, if we have a chance to get Medicare for everybody, two \nout of three would like to see that. That is a government health \nprogram that two out of three Americans would like.\n  Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, prepared a bill \nwith a public option with an opt-out provision. I ask the Senator from \nRhode Island what the opt-out provision will mean for those political \nleaders or people or legislatures or Governors in the States who might \ncome to the same conclusion as our Republicans here, that they are \nopposed to any form of a public option that might involve the \ngovernment.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The opt-out plan, as I understand it, would allow \nStates to decide they don't want a public option in their State, so \nthey don't have to have one. Each of us comes here representing a \nState. My colleague is the very distinguished majority whip, but he is \nalso the Senator from Illinois. Our distinguished friend, Mr. Udall, is \nthe Senator from New Mexico.\n  The health care our constituents get is delivered to them almost \nentirely in our States. So one would think it would be satisfying to \nthe people on the other side who object to a public option that they \ncould go home and they could say: You know what. This public option is \na terrible idea. You know what I have done. I have worked out an opt-\nout and have protected you from it. It is only these crazies in places \nsuch as Rhode Island who want to take advantage of the public option. \nBut I have saved you, and it is their funeral.\n  The way we designed it, as I mentioned earlier, is State to State it \nhas to be solvent. There is no cross-subsidization, that one State has \nto carry the water for another State. They would not have to pay for \nRhode Island's costs if they got out of control, whether they have a \npublic option or they do not. So they are protected.\n  One would think that would be an adequate argument for them. The fact \nthat it is not an adequate argument suggests to me there is a little \nbit more at stake; that the real party in interest is not the \nconstituents of their own States, it is the private insurance industry.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, to put clarity and a final \npoint on this, if this is enacted into law and a Governor or some \nleaders in any given State decide that the public option in their \nState, giving the people who live in that State an additional choice \nwhen it comes to the health insurance they want to buy, if they decide \nthat is too extreme, too socialistic, too French--whatever they happen \nto decide--they could initiate an effort to eliminate the public option \nunder this law so it would not apply to anyone living in their State. \nWhether these are the folks inspired by the tea party folks or others, \nthey have their chance. They have the last word as to whether there \nwill be a public option in their State.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Absolutely, it is wide open, as the distinguished \nmajority whip has pointed out. The choice would entirely be theirs.\n  I suspect what we would see is, many people who are railing against \nthe public option right here would find that their States, when they \nactually had the choice, would take it. Ninety-four percent of U.S. \ninsurance markets are deemed highly concentrated by the U.S. Department \nof Justice. That is like the alarm going off in those markets, saying \nthat if you find anticompetitive behavior, because that market is \nhighly concentrated, you focus on it. You have to act.\n  Ninety-four percent of our major urban areas are in that situation. \nSo to add another choice for those consumers I think is something that \nwhen practical people look at it in real life and see what its effects \nwill be in real people's homes and in their jobs and in their finances \nand in their world, it will be a lot harder to keep it going, but it \nwill be their choice.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If I can make one last point in a question. I know the \nSenator from Rhode Island is a former prosecutor, as is the Senator \nfrom New Mexico. When we come to the competitive nature of insurance \ncompanies--I know the Senator from Rhode Island was with me at a \nhearing recently in the Senate Judiciary Committee on the McCarran-\nFerguson law, which in the 1940s exempted insurance companies--in this \ncase, health insurance companies and medical malpractice insurance \ncompanies--from antitrust regulations, so that literally the executives \nof insurance companies--in this case health insurance companies--could \nall meet in a room and decide what the premiums would be in any given \nplace in America, across the Nation. They could meet together and come \nto a common agreement as to which States would be dominated by which \ncompanies and, as I understand the McCarran-Ferguson law, the Federal \nGovernment would have no power to stop them.\n  We can stop virtually any other group of companies trying to do the \nsame anticompetitive things, but there is no power to stop the health \ninsurance companies because of McCarran-Ferguson under our Federal \nantitrust laws.\n  I say to the Senator from Rhode Island, does this not also suggest \nthat when the health insurance companies threaten they are going to \nraise premiums, we ought to take them seriously? They have the power to \ndo it,\n\n[[Page S10842]]\n\nand they certainly have a long, rich history of doing that. So when \nthey say: If you pass health care reform, we are going to raise \npremiums, count on it; they are going to do it.\n  If we do not create the competition of a not-for-profit public option \nhealth insurance company, they literally will not face competition.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Yes, exactly correct. Unless they are involved in \nboycott or coercion, they can fix prices, carve up territories, do \ninnumerable anticompetitive things that any other industry in America \nwould have to answer for in a court of law. They get a pass on it \nbecause of the McCarran-Ferguson Act. But it shows, as the Senator from \nIllinois is pointing out, how vitally important competition is because \nthat public option, I doubt it is going to sit down with private \ninsurance industry and fix prices or carve up territories. It will have \na public purpose and a public function, and it will be serving the \npeople rather than the shareholders of the insurance company.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I say to Senator \nWhitehouse, let me join in here with him and Senator Durbin because the \nthing he pointed out--and that is the crux of this argument, right here \non this chart--that when we talk about a public option--and the Senator \nhas hit it over and over again and Senator Durbin mentioned it--it is \ncompetitiveness. That is what we want to see, competitiveness. We are \nnot talking about a government takeover. We are not talking about \nsingle payer. We are not talking about all these things our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle say about this reform. We are talking about \nmaking the system more competitive.\n  People may not realize that in many of our States, when you talk \nabout insurance company monopolies, there are States where more than 75 \npercent are covered by just two insurers. So we have the State of \nMontana with two insurers, more than 75 percent of the market. Look at \nMinnesota, Iowa, all these darker States, Maine. These States have very \nlittle competition going on.\n\n  What the Senator talked about is, No. 1, the Federal Government \ncannot move in. I don't know if Senator Durbin heard this. But at the \nbeginning, there was a big national news article that said the \ninsurance companies are getting ready to raise the rates because they \nknow reform is coming, and there is not a single thing the Federal \nGovernment can do about it. We have a great antitrust unit over in the \nJustice Department, but they cannot do anything about it because we \nhave these laws in place.\n  This is, once again, what we are going to see. This is the pattern in \nthe past: Skyrocketing insurance premiums, sky-high insurance company \nprofits. In the last 7 years, a 428-percent increase, and all that is \ngoing on while these 47 million Americans are without insurance, \npremiums doubled in 9 years, and these huge CEO salaries.\n  I think the public option is the key to bringing competitiveness to \nthis market. I am glad the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator \nfrom Illinois are working in committee to see that our antitrust units \nmay be able to get involved in these kinds of situations in the future.\n  (Mr. BENNET assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If the distinguished Senator will yield, the way this \nworks out in individual people's lives--it is important for us as \npolicymakers to understand what the Senator from New Mexico pointed \nout; that is, a 428-percent increase in insurance company profits in \njust 7 years, while they are turning people down and pushing them off \ncoverage, even 47 million Americans uninsured, denying their claims, \nwhile the profits are going up like that. That is a very important \nstory.\n  But then you get down to the actual people who get tangled up in this \nand what it does to their lives. Nicole from Providence, RI, wrote to \nme. In 2008, her doctor prescribed a number of tests she needed to take \nbecause she was experiencing stomach problems. Similar to many \nAmericans who have gotten into these nightmares, they come in thinking \nthey are all set, they have good health insurance.\n  Nicole thought she had good health insurance. She never imagined she \nwould have any problem covering her medical costs. But the insurance \ncompany, once it started getting the bills, went scurrying around \nthrough its files and started to look for a way to get out of having to \npay. Sure enough, they decided that her condition was ``preexisting.'' \nThe magic word so they don't have to pay. Sure enough, they denied \nthousands of dollars of Nicole's claims.\n  So now there is Nicole. She thought she had insurance. She thought \neverything was fine. She had this stomach illness. She had to take \nthese tests. She sends in the bills to the insurance company and they \nsay: No, sorry, that is preexisting. So she is scrambling to pay off \nthousands and thousands in debt. That starts you off into the whole set \nof other problems, those administrative costs I was talking about. \nThose administrative costs are spent fighting patients, fighting their \nclients.\n  Here is Nicole constantly on the phone trying to get the correct \ndocumentation from her doctor to the insurance company, trying to get \nit to match up, and it never does and the bills keep coming. It is not \nonly that she did not get the health care she needed and the company \nwould not pay for it, it is when she tries to sort it out, she gets \ninto this bureaucratic nightmare with that bureaucracy that grew 109 \npercent just in this decade arming up to fight people such as Nicole.\n  Here is what she concluded. This is a regular person from Providence, \nRI, snarled in the health insurance system. She says:\n\n       I have a full-time job with a good salary. I own a home. I \n     have health insurance. I am a middle-class American doing \n     everything I think I should. And yet I am now saddled with \n     thousands of dollars in medical bills that I cannot afford to \n     pay.\n\n  The stories go on and on of people in this system. Coreen from \nCranston, RI, wrote me. She has health insurance through her employer, \nbut the insurance company jacked up its premiums so high this year that \nher husband's employer was forced to switch to a high-deductible plan. \nShe has a deductible of $2,000. So now Coreen and her husband take \nturns who is going to see the doctor, depending on which one of them \nthey think is the most ill. The healthier one doesn't go and lets the \none they think is sicker go. Do they know? Of course not, they are not \nexperts, they are not doctors, but they have to make this decision \nbecause they have had this limitation put on their policy.\n  She wrote to me:\n\n       We have no other option but to be held hostage by our \n     insurer. In our current system, people come second and \n     profits come first.\n\n  For all the big picture stuff we are talking about, it is important \nto remember that all these big pictures come down to homes and families \nand people and workers all across this country, all of whom find that \nthis health care system is a nightmare for them under the private \nhealth insurance regime.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator will yield, I would like to note that I \nreceived a similar letter from a man in Illinois who had a $5,000 \ndeductible because he had a history of illness. So in order to buy \nhealth insurance he could afford, he had to be willing to first put out \n$5,000 in cash out before they would cover the first dollar. He was \ntold by his doctor, because of an examination, that he would need a \ncolonoscopy, which is rather common and certainly a thoughtful thing to \ndo when there is an indication. But he found it would cost him $3,000 \nout-of-pocket for a colonoscopy, and he would have to pay that because \nthe insurance plan didn't cover it. He didn't have the $3,000.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. May I inquire back if the insurance company, to the \nSenator's knowledge, actually checked to see if by taking the $3,000 \ncolonoscopy they might find out something about his health so that in \nthe long run everybody would save money because they did the test at \nthe right time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Well, I don't know the answer to that, but I would \nsuspect that they did not because the concern for that insurance \ncompany is the bottom line for that quarter. They are not concerned, as \nthey should be, about the long-term health of this man. If there is an \nindication that leads to a colonoscopy, it makes common sense that you \nwould do it because things\n\n[[Page S10843]]\n\ndiscovered early can often be treated successfully, and things that you \ndon't treat can turn into very expensive and deadly diseases.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The public option, therefore, might be much more \nadept and likely at making that investment in the constituent's health \nbecause it is worth spending $3,000 for a colonoscopy if it will help \nprevent a catastrophic illness later on.\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is the key word, ``prevent.'' We have to move toward \na new mindset that health insurance companies don't think about--\nwellness and prevention. If we put a little money into those, we can \nkeep people healthier and keep costs down.\n  I am sure the Senator from Rhode Island and the Senator from New \nMexico will recall the visit we had from the CEO of a major grocery \nstore chain--Safeway/Dominix--and how they decided for their management \nto try to do preventive care. I recall the CEO telling us that because \nof preventive care, they have been able to keep their health insurance, \nwhich is a self-insured plan, even for 3 straight years without \nincreases.\n  So prevention and wellness not only keep people healthier but reduce \ncost. But if you were trying to drive the bottom line and just said no \nto people who need a colonoscopy or need a mammogram or prostate cancer \ntreatment, diabetes maintenance--if you are saying no to all of those \nthings and those people--the ultimate cost in human life and in dollars \ngoes through the roof.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. If the Senator will yield, the Senator from \nIllinois has hit on an example that comes home to me because I had a \ngentleman write to me from a small community in New Mexico--Pena \nBlanca--about his wife. He said his wife had reached the age of 50, and \nshe wanted to do what she could in preventive care, which is what we \nwant to encourage, as the Senator is talking about, to get out in front \nof illnesses and try to do that preventive care. So she wanted a \ncolonoscopy, and she went to the insurance company that said: Well, it \nis going to cost you $3,000. They didn't have $3,000, so she had to \nforgo the colonoscopy. That was when she was 50 years of age.\n  At 54 years of age, she was diagnosed with colon cancer. So he writes \nto me saying that his wife is dying and he is in this situation now \nwhere he realizes if they had had that kind of preventive care, he \nwould have his wife with him and would have her with him a lot longer.\n  It demonstrates what the Senator has just said, that if we reorient \nour health care system to prevention, to wellness, if we use the public \noption--we use the nonprofit method--we will then be moving in the \ndirection of getting way out in front of these illnesses rather than \nhaving tragedies such as this gentleman from the small town of Pena \nBlanca, NM, describes. It is a crying shame to see that kind of thing \nhappen to a family.\n  As Senator Whitehouse has said, we talk about all these things--\nskyrocketing premiums and profits and everything--but it comes down to \nfamilies and individuals with serious health care problems. In many \ncases, those problems are not being dealt with in our health care \nsystem.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The story the Senator just told, reminds me of one. I \ndo regular community dinners around Rhode Island. I go to a community, \nand we put out nothing fancy--pasta and meatballs, a salad and punch, \nand we invite people to come in and just have a general discussion \nabout the issues that concern them.\n  At one of my recent community dinners, a lady spoke about some \ndifficult run-ins with the health care system. The worst part of it was \nabout her sister, who had the same situation as the Senator's \nconstituent. She did not have health coverage and she missed an \nappointment with the doctor. She didn't want to put out the money, so \nshe went without. By the time she actually did go to the doctor, the \ncondition had worsened.\n  The doctor told the woman at my dinner: Your sister's condition, if \nshe had come in earlier, we could have cured her. But as advanced as it \nis now, I don't think there is much we can do about it. They tried what \nthey could, and it was very expensive, obviously, but ultimately they \ncould not save her.\n  So when we don't get this right, and when people forgo health care \nbecause they can't afford it, and because our system is set up to not \npay for things that are essential preventive care, people lose their \nlives. It is a matter of statistics and it is a matter of cost and it \nis a matter of tragedy, but ultimately it is also a matter, for many \npeople, of life and death.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator would yield once again, I would like to \nmake note for the record that we are on the Senate floor this evening, \nand we have time to speak on this important issue because the \nRepublicans are blocking our efforts to pass a bill that sends \nunemployment compensation to literally hundreds of thousands of \nAmericans who have been out of work for a long time and need these \nchecks to keep their families together. They have now resisted us for \n21 days to extend unemployment benefits to these people across America. \nI am sure in each of our States, as I found in Illinois, many of these \nunemployed people have also lost their health insurance as a result of \nlosing their jobs.\n  I would like to ask either or both of the Senators to comment on what \nthis health care reform proposal that we are talking about would do for \na person who has either lost a job or is in a low-income category; \nsomeone who is scraping by with a low-wage job, hoping for something \nbetter, or maybe that is the best they can come up with.\n  Would either of the Senators like to respond as to what this \nlegislation, our health care reform bill, is proposing?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Well, Mr. President, to talk a little about \nthat situation, I think it is important to understand, first of all, \nthat we have so many people out there who are uninsured--absolutely \nuninsured. As Senator Durbin has described, many times they lose their \njob and they lose their insurance, and that is what this reform is all \nabout. We are not going to have that connection any longer. We are \ngoing to say to Americans: You are going to have your health care \ncoverage, and if you go from job to job, you are going to be able to \ncontinue your health care coverage. If you are unemployed, you are \ngoing to be able to continue your health care coverage.\n  That is a big new step for us, to take people who didn't have \ninsurance, who were subject to the vagaries of existence out there, and \npoint the way to where they are going to get insurance. They are going \nto get help for their families, and I would just say that we are at the \nright place at the right time. Things have aligned.\n  We have President Obama, we have a Democratic Senate, we have a \nDemocratic House, and we need to get this done in this time period. We \nknow we are going to be opposed. Our friends on the other side are \ngoing to do the same thing the Senator mentioned on unemployment \nbenefits. They are going to stand up and use every trick in the book. \nThey are going to use all these filibuster rules, and they are going to \nmake us file everything. But we will stay here long nights, we \nwill stay through to the end so that we can help the individuals like \nthose we have been talking about to get insurance regardless of what \ntheir personal circumstances are, regardless of things such as \npreexisting conditions and serious illnesses and getting dropped by \ninsurance companies.\n\n  Senator Whitehouse.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I would add another element in responding to Senator \nDurbin's question. They may very well be eligible for Medicaid or \nMedicare, in which case they would go on to those programs. But, if \nnot, they would very likely be eligible under this health care reform \nfor a significant subsidy to help them pay for health insurance.\n  What is interesting about the way that works is that they do not have \nto go into a government program to get the subsidy. We are trying to \nmake health insurance more available to more middle-class families. So \nwhat they do is go to the health insurance exchange, which is like a \nmarket for health insurance or, if they work for a big company or the \nState or county or Federal Government, there is a period where they go \nand sign up for the health insurance they want.\n  Your H.R. person says: OK, now is the time to choose your policy for \nthe coming year. They give you your choices and you select from your \nchoices. You have a labor agreement or a contract agreement or a \nstatutory provision that lets you know how much\n\n[[Page S10844]]\n\nyour employer is going to contribute, but you get to choose, just like \nthe Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan we are in--that all Federal \nemployees are in.\n  That is the model, so that somebody who can't afford the insurance \nthey want will get their stipend from the government and then they will \ngo to the exchange and be able to choose. That is why it is called the \npublic option. If there is a public option in that State, they will be \nable to choose the public option. If they do not like the public \noption, they can choose Aetna or Blue Cross or Wellpoint or Cigna or \nwhoever is doing business in that State and buy through the exchange.\n  So for people in the circumstance the Senator talks about, who are in \neconomic straits, this will be an easier way to buy health insurance. \nIt will be a way they can afford health insurance, and it is a way that \nleaves the choice up to them. That is where the public option comes in \nbecause when they have that choice, I think for a lot of Americans \nlooking at the way costs are going and looking at the way they get \ntreated by the health insurance companies, they are going to say: The \nchoice between all those for-profit health insurers, that is no choice \nat all. That is, which enemy do you have to sign up for? I use the word \n``enemy'' because I have had people tell me the terrible thing about \ngetting ill in this country is that they have to, on the one hand, \nfight the disease and, on the other hand, fight the insurance company. \nAnd they do see them, when they get involved in that, as the enemy.\n  When they have a choice between a whole bunch of insurance companies \nand they all share the purpose of trying to throw them off coverage if \nthey are sick, trying to deny them coverage when they get sick, trying \nto deny the claims their doctor puts in, trying to interfere with what \ntheir doctor wants them to do to get better, if those are all their \nchoices, that is not much of a choice.\n  That is where the public option can provide a real choice to people \nwhen they come in. They will have the dignity of being able to make \nthat choice for themselves and their family through this program in our \nreform.\n  I see we are joined by the distinguished Senator from Colorado, Mr. \nBennet.\n  (Mr. UDALL of New Mexico assumed the chair.)\n  Mr. BENNET. I have been listening to the debate, and I wanted to join \nin and respond to Senator Durbin's question about people leaving their \ninsurance carrier and going on Medicare and Medicaid today, if they are \neligible; and if they are not eligible, they are just out of luck. I \nthink it is important, as we think about what this reform will bring, \nto remind people about what is happening with the status quo as it \nexists right now.\n  We are having all this debate about whether a public option is a good \nidea, whether the other insurance reforms are a good idea, accusations \nthat this is just a government takeover of health care. What people are \nignoring is what is happening right before our eyes.\n  In my State, median family income has actually declined by over $800 \nover the last 10 years. That is before this recession we are in right \nnow. In the country it has gone down $300. In my State, the cost of \nhealth premiums over that same period of time went up 97 percent--it \ndoubled. We are saying to working families, you are going to earn less \nbut the cost of health insurance is going to go up by twice. Not only \nthat, but the cost of higher education is going to go up 50 percent. \nWorking families are getting squeezed.\n  What is happening is--because they are having double-digit cost \nincreases every year, because small businesses are spending 18 percent \nmore than large businesses to cover their employees--we are seeing \nalready fewer and fewer people getting insurance from their employer. \nThe number of people who are insured by employers in my State is \ndropping like a stone. The number of small businesses that are able to \noffer insurance anymore to their employees is dropping like a stone, \nwhich is heartbreaking to a lot of people because a lot of these \nbusinesses are family businesses where they pride themselves on having \noffered insurance for many years.\n  Where do these people end up in this debate we are having right now \nabout a public option versus not? If they are poor enough, they end up \non Medicaid, a government program. If they are not, they end up going \nto the emergency room where they get uncompensated care that we all pay \nfor as taxpayers.\n  In the case of my city, in Denver, we have an excellent public \nhospital. They did a study 3 years ago that showed that in 1 year they \nspent $180 million treating people who were uncompensated, who were \nemployed by small businesses. These are people working for a living \nevery day but who do not have insurance. Who pays that bill? We, the \ntaxpayers.\n  What I would say to people on the other side, or even on our side who \nare saying this is a bad idea, to give people more choice, more option, \nis that the system we have right now is landing people in public \ngovernment options or landing them in the emergency room where the \ntaxpayers are having to cover them with uncompensated care. We are just \ndoing it in the least intentional way possible. We are doing it in the \nleast thoughtful way possible and in many respects doing it in the most \nexpensive way possible. People are not getting the kind of preventive \ncare they ought to be getting, the screenings they ought to be getting \non the front end so they don't show up in the hospital emergency room \nwhen they are dreadfully sick.\n  When I hear the objections to this and I realize how painful the \nstatus quo is right now for working families and small businesses--in \nthe State of Colorado, but I also know in other States as well--I \nwonder sometimes what people are fighting against. What we are fighting \nfor is a much more intentional approach to coverage, a much more \nintentional approach to quality, a much more intentional and rational \napproach to how we finance all of this.\n  It has been a pleasure to hear you tonight. I wanted to come and be \npart of the discussion.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Of course, anybody in the situation Senator Bennet \ndescribed, if they don't like the idea of a public option under this \nlegislation they are completely free to not sign up for it. Nobody in \nAmerica will be forced into the public option. We don't even connect \nthe subsidy, the stipend that makes health care affordable for American \nfamilies, to the public option. We give it at the exchange in this \nlegislation.\n  If you want to spend your government stipend to help make health care \nmore affordable on Blue Cross, on Aetna, on Cigna, on whoever does \nbusiness in your home State, you are welcome to do that. The public \noption is an absolute free choice. There is not a single person in this \nroom, not a single person in the United States who, if the public \noption passes and they choose not to participate, has any adverse \nconsequence at all.\n  The one thing they may have happen to them if the public option is \nsuccessful is--if it is not sucking profits out of the system, if it is \nnot building that huge administrative superstructure to fight with the \ndoctors and hospitals so that they have to build a matching one to \nfight back from, if they are actually investing in, as you say, \nprevention and quality improvement and electronic health records and \npaying doctors in a sensible way so they don't have to run up \nprocedures to get paid--if they do all that successfully, they will \ndrive down the cost. Because it is competitive, those private insurance \ncompanies will have to follow. What you may get if you do not like the \npublic option is you will get your stipend just like anybody else, if \nyou are in the right income category. You will say I don't like the \npublic option. I have no business with anything to do with the \ngovernment health care, I don't want any part of it, I am going to the \nprivate sector--and you can buy that. You may in that circumstance \nactually see your private sector insurance rates come down because of \nnothing you did but because of the public option being out there and \nbeing competitive.\n  If the public option is uncompetitive and its rates go up, that is \nnot going to hurt you. You are still in that private insurance company \nanyway. It is a ``heads I win, tails you lose'' situation for you; you \nare the winner on both sides.\n  Mr. BENNET. If the Senator will yield, there is one other important \ncomponent to this that people in my State have been talking to me about \na\n\n[[Page S10845]]\n\nlot over the last 6 weeks or so. It has become clear that as part of \nthis reform, because this is the way insurance needs to work if you are \ngoing to cover everything, as part of this reform there is a \nrequirement that everybody have insurance.\n  People are saying to me: Michael, I want you to make sure you give me \nas many options as possible. If you are going to make a requirement as \npart of this, I want to maximize my choice. I want to be able to look \nat everything, whatever you call it--whether it is private insurance or \npublic option, nonprofit plans--I want to be able, they say, to make \nthe best decision that is in the interest of my family or make the best \ndecisions in the interests of my business.\n  I don't know why we would want to say on the one hand we are going to \nrequire you to have insurance and on the other hand say we are going to \nconstrain the range of choices that you can make on behalf of your \nfamily. We should not be making those choices here in Washington. Those \nare choices our families should be making for themselves.\n  Mr. DURBIN. If the Senator from Rhode Island will yield, on his chart \non national health expenditures, I have heard my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle, the Republican side, come to the floor many \ntimes and decry this whole effort because it was going to cost $1 \ntrillion. We are not sure if that will be the exact number, but take it \nas an example. We are talking about $1 trillion over the next 10 years. \nIf you accumulate the cost of health care in America over the next 10 \nyears, starting this year at $2.5 trillion, and assuming it goes up to \nat least $3 trillion, maybe $3.5 trillion, it seems to me we are \ndealing, over that period of time, with an accumulated cost of health \ncare in America over 10 years of $30 to $35 trillion, I think, is \nprobably a fair estimate.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I agree.\n  Mr. DURBIN. One trillion dollars as a percent of that comes out to \nless than 3 percent of the overall cost of the system and the savings \nwe are trying to build into this approach, by trying to find ways to \nreduce costs, to reduce the fraud and waste that is part of health care \ntoday, to give people options so that they have more competition, \nbringing down the cost of premiums--I would say to my friends on the \nother side of the aisle arguing that $1 trillion is a huge sum, \ncertainly when you deal with $1 trillion it is, but in comparison to \nthe overall cost of health care over the next 10 years it is less than \n3 percent of what we anticipate. And it is largely made up of savings \nwithin the current system. I think that is the point they miss when \nthey use that figure on the floor so frequently.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I think the Senator has made a very good point. I add \nto it by going back to the figures from the President's Council of \nEconomic Advisers that suggest we could save $700 billion every year \nout of this health care system if we could wring the excess costs out \nof it--the unnecessary MRIs because you don't have an electronic health \nrecord and you have to go out and replicate it because you don't have \nthe file with you; the totally unnecessary staff fighting with each \nother over who should get paid and who should not get paid; the $60,000 \nit requires, on average, when you get a hospital-acquired infection in \nthe intensive care unit. If you could prevent it, you save. Those are \nthe kinds of numbers that add up to these numbers. If you could save \n$700 billion a year--I am not saying you could do it, but it is a big \ntarget out there--investing $1 trillion over 10 years to get a piece of \nthat back only makes sense. It is plain business sense.\n  If you were in the manufacturing sector and if you had an assembly \nline and that assembly line was creating costs like this, so the price \nof your product had to go up and up and you were having all those \ncasualties, people were getting their hands caught in the machine and \nmangled and it was lighting up on fire because it was running out of \noil, and you were having all these problems with the system, somebody \nwould come in and say: You know what, you ought to spend a little money \nupfront to get a good system put in to fix up your assembly line \nbecause you will save costs in the long run. That is all we are \nexpecting to do right now, is get those. There are so many disasters in \nthe health care system right now, and to get that cleaned up and put a \nlittle money down for that, that is only good common business sense, \nparticularly when there is a big target such as that $700 billion a \nyear savings and, as you said, the cost of the next 10 years will be \nwell north of $30 trillion if we do not do anything about this.\n  (Mr. BENNET assumed the Chair.)\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, the example on the savings is \nright there, in the examples before us. We just talked about Medicaid. \nMedicaid has a 3-percent administrative cost. We are talking about a \nprogram, when I go into my townhall meetings and visit with people, \npeople say they like Medicaid, they like what they have. Here is a \nprogram that is running with 3 percent administrative costs.\n  When we talk about the insurance companies, because of what the \nSenator mentioned, how they fight the claims and you have to get all \nthese people in the doctor's office trying to prove claims, and then \nback and forth--doctor's offices many times told me 50 percent of the \npeople in the office are there doing this administrative work because \nof what the insurance companies have created.\n  When you ask the big question to insurance companies, how much is \nyour administrative cost on the health insurance industry--30 percent. \nI think there is enormous room for improvement when we are talking \nabout the hundreds of billions of dollars that are out there, from 3 \npercent in Medicare to 30 percent or more in the health insurance \nindustry.\n  There is no doubt that the savings can be squeezed out of this \nsystem. That is what the public option does. That is what we have been \ntonight talking about, night after night. I am so thankful that Senator \nWhitehouse, in the HELP Committee, his service in the HELP Committee, \nvolunteered to write the public option for that health bill. That \ncontributed so much to this debate. It gave us the outside parameters \nfor what we are debating right now, and our leader, Senator Reid, has \nnow stepped forward and said he wants a public option with this opt-out \nprovision.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If I may step in----\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Please.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. It was a team effort. I want to make sure that \nSenator Brown of Ohio, our friend Sherrod Brown gets recognized. He had \na very important role in it. As the Senator knows, he is very committed \non this issue and fights very hard to protect the interests of \nconsumers. Senator Kay Hagan, our friend from North Carolina, also was \nextremely helpful. Because she has a more conservative perspective than \nwe do, there was a wide range of views that were brought together. I \nthink that is reflected in the fact that when the so-called Blue Dogs, \nthe conservative Democrats over in the House, wanted to work out a \npublic option, the public option they signed off on was the Senate HELP \npublic option.\n  I think it has good appeal for conservative Democrats as well as \nprogressive Democrats, that it reaches across the whole aisle. I hope \nby the time the dust settles, reasonable Senators of the other party \nwill also join us in this because it only makes sense. If, as the \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers says, it is ``possible to cut \ntotal health expenditures by about 30 percent without worsening \noutcomes,'' if there is 30 percent of waste and fighting you are \ntalking about, and it adds up to $700 billion as the President's \nCouncil of Economic Advisers said, and if you add up the numbers from \nthe Lewin Group, this here--they actually anticipate bigger savings, \nthey anticipate $1 trillion a year in potential savings if--you could \nget all the excess costs out--it is $1 trillion a year--it is a \nphenomenal target to shoot for.\n  That is why making the public option competitive is such a good idea.\n  With this cost we cannot keep doing the same old thing and \nsubsidizing. We have to change the direction of the health care system \nand the public option will do that.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. We are near the end of our hour right here. \nI wish to read one more letter and then Senator Whitehouse may have \nsome concluding remarks. But I think this letter drives home what we \nhave been talking about all night. I received a\n\n[[Page S10846]]\n\nletter from a man in Carlsbad, NM. This man's wife was denied insurance \nbenefits after she fell at the school where she is a teacher. And here \nis what he said:\n\n       Her orthopedic surgeon told us that her fall aggravated her \n     degenerative condition in her knees and spine. He felt he \n     could no longer treat her without surgery and recommended \n     that she have both knees replaced. She had one knee replaced \n     . . . , but before she could have the other knee replaced or \n     her back treated, she was summoned to Albuquerque where she \n     had to appear before a panel of three doctors.\n       The lead doctor on this panel rules that she needed no \n     further treatment of any kind. One of the doctors wrote a \n     dissenting opinion, but her coverage was cut off. The \n     dissenting doctor later apologized to my wife, stating that \n     he hated serving on those panels because the lead doctor \n     always ruled in favor of the insurance company and against \n     the patient.\n       The health insurance industry cannot be trusted. Without \n     the public option the American people will not have the \n     choice they deserve. The public option would bring needed \n     competition to the industry. I strongly urge you to support \n     the public option.\n\n  That is my constituent writing me. He has really hit it on the head. \nI think the gentleman from Carlsbad said it best when he said: The \npublic option would bring needed competition to the industry.\n  You saw this chart earlier here about the lack of competition and how \nwe have these insurance companies with a monopoly. Right now health \ninsurance companies are basically monopolies or duopolies, at best. In \nNew Mexico, we have two companies that hold 65 percent of the market. \nThis kind of control means there is no incentive for competition. There \nis no incentive to drive down those costs. A public option would insert \nthat competition back into the market and it would keep those insurance \ncompanies honest.\n  I thank Senator Whitehouse, Senator Durbin, Senator Bennet from \nColorado, for being down here. We have been doing this for weeks now \nand we are going to continue this. I do not know if you have any \nconcluding remarks. But I think this has been a very productive \nsession. I hope we will continue until we get health care reform done \nand with a public option as part of it.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Only to thank the Senator for organizing this time so \nwe could engage in this colloquy on a matter that is so important to \nAmericans on a matter where so much of what has been said has been so \nmisleading and unhelpful.\n  The chance we have to talk about the actual public option as it is in \nreal life, not some overheated imaginary public option that has been \ncooked up by the other side for the purpose of knocking it down, I \nthink is very helpful to help the American people understand the \ndirection we are trying to go. The Senator's role in getting this done \nis very much appreciated.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Afghanistan\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I have just returned from Afghanistan. \nI was there over the weekend. I wanted to take a moment and share a few \nimpressions. I traveled with Senator Burr, who is a colleague of mine \non the Intelligence Committee, and with Senator LeMieux of Florida. We \nvisited Kabul, Jalalabad, and a military location further out in the \nfield.\n  It was my third trip to Afghanistan. That makes me no expert. But I \ndo hope my observations might be of some interest or use to my \ncolleagues. Before I begin, our colleagues should know the perception \nin Kabul of how extremely valuable the efforts of our colleague Senator \nKerry have been. It was clear the resolution that we saw to the \nelection dilemma could not have happened without Senator Kerry.\n  The more our officials in Afghanistan knew about that situation, the \nstronger their views were about Senator Kerry's irreplaceable role. \nEven President Karzai commented on it in our meeting with him. So a \nwell earned ``well done'' to our colleague and friend.\n  While the situation in Afghanistan is obviously complex and \ndifficult, the best news for us is that the Taliban remains very \nunpopular. The Taliban's strength comes from the fact, not \nunreasonably, that many Afghans are terrified of them.\n  If the Taliban are willing to ride into town and cut off the ears of \nthe village elder's son in front of the whole village, it requires \nconsiderable courage and confidence on their part in us and the Afghan \nGovernment for that village to stand up to those Taliban.\n  The Afghan people do not lack courage. Indeed, their courage and \nresistance in standing up to the Soviet invasion are among the reasons \nthe Cold War is over, and why America is largely out of the shadow of \nthat nuclear threat. When we think of our role in Afghanistan, it is \nworth considering our obligations in the light of what their struggle \nagainst the Soviet Union has meant for our country, our safety and our \nliberty. So courage is not something that Afghans lack.\n  But there is a compelling need for the Afghan people to feel \nconfidence in their government and confidence in us. The best avenue to \nincreasing Afghani confidence in their government will be reducing \ngovernment corruption. It is a pernicious cancer throughout much of the \nAfghan Government.\n\n  Once this election is settled--and I will assume that President \nKarzai will emerge victorious--President Karzai can then turn his \nattention to his new administration. And then I think it is vital--and \nit is unanimously seen to be vital by the officials I spoke to--that \nvigorous efforts against corruption be a leading part of President \nKarzai's commitment to the Afghan people.\n  Confidence in us is equally important, but confidence in us must be \nmeasured against its counterweight, which is dependence on us. \nPresident Karzai, his ministers, and his challenger, Dr. Abdullah, are \nextremely grateful for the sacrifice that America has made for the \nbenefit of their people, and they do not hesitate to say so. But at the \nsame time, it is a realistic human impulse to be pleased if someone \nelse will do something for you that you would otherwise have had to do \nyourself.\n  So, on the one hand, assuring the Afghan people of our reliable and \nenduring commitment to their struggle, while, on the other hand, \nensuring that the Afghan Government meets its responsibilities, rather \nthan just relying on us to fight their war, is the difficult balance we \nmust achieve.\n  The more President Karzai--after this election is settled--can assume \nthe mantle of a wartime President and accept responsibility that he is \nthe military leader of this struggle, as well as the newly elected \nleader of Afghanistan, the better it will be. But it also seems to me \nthat a strategic agreement with the Afghan Government, a strategic \nagreement that more clearly lays out the responsibilities and the \ncommitments on either side, would be a good vehicle to set that \nbalance.\n  The confidence of the Afghan people in our steadfastness is necessary \nto their willingness to fight this enemy, and the Afghan Government \nstepping up clearly to its responsibilities is necessary to our \nwillingness to fight this enemy. Together, where those goals intersect, \nwe can win. Divided, we cannot.\n  Sorting this out will not be easy. For too many years, we have been \n``muddling through'' in Afghanistan. President Obama's appointee, \nGeneral McChrystal, has now called for a new strategy. I think the \nPresident is wise and patient to think this through carefully as he \nleads us out of the muddle and develops a winning strategy.\n  No one I spoke to in Afghanistan thought the need for new troops was \nimmediate. The 21,000 additional troops President Obama sent are still \nbeing absorbed. Winter is coming with its seasonal lull in the \nviolence. Questions about Pakistan's role supporting the Taliban in \nAfghanistan are unresolved, questions whose answers will make our \nchallenge in Afghanistan either far more easy or far more difficult. \nThis is not simple and should not suddenly be rushed now, after years \nof muddling.\n  In evaluating the decision that President Obama faces, it is worth \nconsidering the actual report that General McChrystal provided. We have \nheard a lot about it, and most of it has had to do with the immediate \ndeployment of troops.\n\n[[Page S10847]]\n\n  The report, if you look at it, has a slightly different cast. In his \nreport, General McChrystal identified ``two fundamental changes''--that \nis his quote--``two fundamental changes'' that are required.\n  One is this--and I quote--\n\n       ISAF must focus on getting the basics right.\n\n  ISAF is International Security Assistance Force. It is the \ninternational force that America leads in Afghanistan. Here is one: \n``ISAF must focus on getting the basics right.''\n  Two:\n\n       ISAF must also adopt a new strategy.\n\n  Those are his one and two points--``getting the basics right'' and \n``adopt a new strategy.''\n  To continue quoting General McChrystal's report:\n\n       The key take away from this assessment is the major need \n     for a systematic change to our strategy and the way we think \n     and operate.\n\n  Let me quote that again:\n\n       The key--\n\n  This is the McChrystal report quoted verbatim--\n\n       The key take away from this assessment is the major need \n     for a systematic change to our strategy and the way we think \n     and operate.\n\n  That is the task on which the President has embarked, and after years \nof muddling, I think he is entitled to a reasonable time to get it \nright.\n  I would like to highlight three of the areas that General McChrystal \nemphasized in his report.\n  I will quote again. One:\n\n       Tour lengths should be long enough to build continuity and \n     ownership of success.\n\n  Afghan society is deeply complex, personal, and it is governed by \ncodes of conduct and honor. Our decisionmakers on the ground need to \nknow the social terrain to be effective. That message has been loud and \nclear from my trips to that country. But the conclusion from the \ngeneral is that ``Tour lengths should be long enough to build \ncontinuity and ownership of success.'' This will be hard on our troops \nand their families, and it will also be hard on the back-office \nbureaucracies that have to accommodate this. But that is what he said. \nThere it is.\n  This is another quote. Two:\n\n       ISAF must operate differently. Preoccupied with force \n     protection, ISAF has operated in a manner that distances \n     itself, both physically and psychologically, from the people \n     they seek to protect.\n\n  An example of this is that the reconstruction of a bridge or a school \nis good and important and valuable, but if the convoy of MRAPs ran \neverybody off the road in all the villages that they went through on \nthe way to that school or bridge, the signal that we are there to help \nis lost.\n  This is a hard point that General McChrystal has made: reducing the \ncocoon of force protection around our civilian and military personnel \ncreates greater exposure to casualties. General McChrystal has faced \nthis point squarely.\n  Third, and somewhat amazingly--I will quote again--\n\n       Major insurgent groups outperform GIROA and ISAF at \n     information operations.\n\n  Again, ISAF is the International Security Assistance Force. GIROA is \nthe acronym for the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. \nSo I plug that into the quote and it says: Major insurgent groups \noutperform the Government of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan and \nthe International Security Assistance Force at information operations.\n  I will tell you, for a country that invented Madison Avenue \nadvertising and public relations, this is a bitter pill. And this was \nconfirmed during our trip. Although we saw a few areas that gave us \nhope, overall, officials acknowledged that information operations \nappear to be operating with far less sophistication and energy than \ntactical military operations.\n  I have the impression that for too long this function has been seen \nreally as information supply rather than information combat. Everybody \nin this Chamber has gotten here--or at least almost everybody has \ngotten here--after having won an election in which they had to engage \nin prolonged information combat against the other side to get their \nmessage across. Our information operations do need to be improved in \nAfghanistan, and it is commendable that General McChrystal has \nrecognized it.\n  Let me be clear. This is not propaganda. This is not making up a lot \nof spin. This is getting the facts out faster and better. As General \nMcChrystal noted in his report--and I quote again--``this is `a deeds-\nbased' information environment,'' but we do have the deeds. We have \nvillages peaceful. We have markets opened. We have Taliban fighters \nturning in their guns to seek reconciliation.\n  We have, on the negative side, horrific Taliban atrocities that \noffend Afghan culture as well as our own--so that we can tell a winning \nand truthful story to the Afghan people, but, as General McChrystal has \nacknowledged, we have to get better at this.\n  I will conclude with an expression of gratitude and a final \nobservation. We should be extraordinarily grateful to our Americans \nserving in Afghanistan, not just for their courage and sacrifice, which \nare remarkable in themselves, but also for their skill to fight an \nenemy of lunatics, criminals, and fanatics for whom no brutality is too \noffensive, while, at the same time, protecting the civilian population \nwithin which the enemy operates--all while protecting the values we \nAmericans hold dear. That is no small trick.\n  The men and women who have developed this to an unprecedented level \nof competence--even mastery--deserve our commendation: the Rangers, on \nlong and arduous patrols through harsh terrain; the special operations \nteams, working by night to disable enemy leaders; the interrogators, \nworking far from home to develop intelligence about this enemy, well \nwithin the bounds of decency and the norms of military conduct, and \nvery successfully; the analysts, at work 24/7, processing that \nintelligence to maintain nearly immediate situational awareness for our \nforces; the pilots, delivering goods and personnel wherever and \nwhenever required; and the vast support structure that keeps those \naircraft operational in one of the harshest environments on Earth; the \nmarines, clearing and rebuilding villages in Helmand Province, not just \nrebuilding villages but rebuilding trust and security for those \nfamilies; our silent services, whose only reward is their success and \nthe respect of their peers; the reconstruction teams, working to bridge \nbarriers of culture and language, and our own bureaucratic barriers, to \nrebuild the infrastructure of civilized life: schools for girls, roads \nto market--that is all just a slice of the courage, devotion, and skill \nthat Americans are bringing to this challenge.\n  My final observation is this: Wherever I have been on three visits \nnow, American soldiers of all ranks have a tangible respect and \naffection for their Afghan counterparts. The Afghan soldier could be \ncenturies behind us technologically, but he comes from a martial \ntradition lasting thousands of years, producing men who are brave, \nresourceful, hardy, principled, and willing to fight.\n  I remember a bearded special forces officer telling me about the \ncommandoes he was training, that when he went out on patrol with them, \nhe had no hesitation. They called each other brothers. And he said \nthere was not a man in his group who would not lay down his life to \nprotect him. For all the difficulties we will face--and this is not \neasy--I think this aspect provides a platform for some optimism about \ngrowing an effective Afghan national military and police to assume its \nnecessary role protecting Afghanistan's security and sovereignty and \nspeeding our return home.\n\n  I thank the Presiding Officer.

Mr. President, I rise today on the floor of the Senate \nto discuss events involving the troubled country of Burma.\n  Earlier this year, I encouraged Secretary of State Clinton to make \nBurma a priority and to see how the United States could better achieve \nits policy objectives toward the regime. Several weeks ago, the \nadministration unveiled its review of existing Burma policy. The result \nis that the administration has undertaken a diplomatic effort with the \nState Peace and Development Council, SPDC, in pursuit of the \nfundamental U.S. goals of peace, democracy and reconciliation in Burma.\n  Let me say that I wish the administration well with its diplomatic \nefforts. I am hopeful this policy will meet with some success. In \naddition, I believe that this interaction should not be limited to \ntalks merely with the SPDC but should also include discussions with the \nNational League for Democracy, NLD, and representatives from Burma's \nethnic minorities. That said, I am not sanguine about the prospects for \nengagement with the regime. The military junta has shown no inclination \nwhatsoever to compromise on any issue that might jeopardize the \nregime's hold on power. According to news reports, in July of this \nyear, just weeks before the unveiling of the new Burma policy, the \nState Department at the highest levels offered to drop the U.S. \ninvestment ban against Burma if the regime released Aung San Suu Kyi. \nThis was a major test of how the regime would respond to diplomatic \nengagement, providing a golden opportunity for the SPDC to demonstrate \nthat it had indeed changed its spots. Instead of accepting this offer \nand freeing Suu Kyi, the regime promptly sentenced her to an additional \n18 months of imprisonment. That does not augur well for diplomatic \nengagement.\n  As part of its new strategy, the administration indicated that, while \nit will place a high priority on diplomatic engagement, it will \nmaintain the economic sanctions in place against the regime. It seems \nto me that, as matters now stand, there are three significant tests of \nwhether or not the junta's relationship with the United States has \nimproved to the degree that we should even consider moving away from a \npolicy of sanctions: No. 1, the release of all political prisoners, \nincluding Suu Kyi; No. 2, the free and fair conduct of the 2010 \nelections; and No. 3, Burma's compliance with its international \nobligations to end any prohibited military or proliferation related \ncooperation with North Korea. Short of tangible and concrete progress \nin these areas, the removal of sanctions seems to make little sense. It \nis after all the most significant leverage our government has over the \nSPDC. Sanctions make clear that the military junta has not achieved \nlegitimacy in the eyes of the West.\n  It is that search for international legitimacy that has apparently \ndriven the SPDC to hold elections next year. But the 2010 elections are \nfraught with problems. As a preliminary matter, for these elections to \nbe meaningful, the new ``constitution'' should be amended to provide \nfor truly open electoral competition and democratic governance. As it \nstands now under the junta's charter, if Suu Kyi's party the NLD won \n100 percent of the contestable parliamentary seats in next year's \nelection it would still not control the key government ministries: \nDefence and Home Affairs. No matter what they will remain firmly under \nmilitary control. Moreover, the NLD cannot amend the constitution to \nimprove the charter because the military is guaranteed a quarter of the \nparliament's seats. That means the junta can block any constitutional \nchange. Finally, Suu Kyi may not even hold a position in the \ngovernment; she is excluded from office by the charter. I would say to \nmy Senate colleagues, this is hardly a prescription for democratic \ngovernance.\n  But putting the flaws in the constitution to one side, there would \nneed to be a profound change in the political environment in Burma for \nnext year's elections to be meaningful. For example, candidates would \nneed to be permitted to freely speak, assemble, and organize. So far as \nI can tell, none of that has occurred. There would also need to be \ninternational election monitors allowed in the country well in advance \nof election day. This was not permitted during the 2008 ``referendum.'' \nSimply holding an election is not enough; the elections must pass \nmuster.\n  With respect to next year's balloting, the NLD, the clear winner of \nthe 1990 elections which the regime abrogated, faces a Hobson's choice. \nIt can either participate in the elections which are almost certain to \nbe unfair and thereby legitimize the flawed constitution or boycott the \nelections and be treated as a member of an unlawful organization. \nParticipation means casting aside its 1990 victory; nonparticipation \nmeans becoming outlaws. I am likely to support the NLD in whatever \ndecision the party makes in this regard though I am not blind to the \nprofound dilemma it faces.\n  I would just close by paying special tribute to Aung San Suu Kyi. Her \ngrace and courage are an inspiration not only to the people of Burma \nbut to us all. Her imprisonment is a reminder of the paramount \nimportance of the need for freedom and justice in her homeland. I want \nher to know that I stand with her in her efforts to bring freedom and \nreconciliation to the people of Burma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/28/senate-section/article/S10848-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10848-S10849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. PAIGE BAKER\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Dr. Paige \nBaker, superintendent of Badlands National Park. Dr. Baker is retiring \nfrom the National Park Service at the end of this year, and his \nleadership at the park will be greatly missed. I have enjoyed working \nwith Dr. Baker in his capacity as superintendent and want to take this \nopportunity to recognize his dedication to public service.\n  Dr. Baker grew up on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in western \nNorth Dakota. Education has been a strong theme throughout his life, \nand his commitment to educating others is evident in his work at the \nBadlands. He attended college at the University of Mary in Bismarck and \nwent on to earn both his master's and doctorate in education \nadministration at Pennsylvania State University. Prior to joining the \nNational Park Service, he worked at several universities and for the \nBureau of Indian Affairs. In 2004, he became superintendent of the Casa \nGrande Ruins National Monument in Arizona. In late 2005, Dr. Baker came \nto southwestern South Dakota to serve as superintendent of the Badlands \nNational Park. The Baker family has been kind to the National Park \nService and South Dakota; his brother Gerard Baker serves as \nsuperintendent of Mount Rushmore National Memorial.\n  At the Badlands, Dr. Baker has overseen the management of a unique \nand treasured landscape visited by more than a million people each \nyear. Badlands National Park encompasses 244,000 acres of some of the \nmost spectacular scenery in the world. The Badlands formations contain \nrich geology and paleontological resources, and the mixed-grass prairie \nwithin the park offers visitors from around the world the chance to \nview bison, bighorn sheep, and other wildlife. Dr. Baker's charismatic \nand respected leadership has no doubt had a positive impact on the \nexperience of each visitor to the park.\n  The Badlands also have strong historical and spiritual significance \nto the Lakota people. Dr. Baker has expanded visitors' understanding of \nthe Badlands through interpretation programs that recognize the \ncultural significance of the area. Among his most significant \ncontributions, Dr. Baker has helped to improve relationships with \ntribes and bridge cultural divides. He has brought Native and non-\nNative students to the Badlands to learn from one another and find \ncommon ground. He has also fostered greater communication with tribes, \nparticularly with regard to the South Unit of the Badlands that is \ncurrently comanaged with the Oglala Sioux Tribe. Dr. Baker has brought \na level of understanding and respect to these multi-faceted issues that \ndeserves recognition.\n  In closing, I thank Dr. Baker for his service at Badlands National \nPark and wish him all the best in his retirement. Dr. Baker's work at \nthe Badlands will leave a lasting legacy, and I congratulate him on his \naccomplishments.\n\n[[Page S10849]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/28/senate-section/article/S10849-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       RECOGNIZING IBEC CREATIVE\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, our Nation has long recognized that \nsmall businesses are the true innovators in our economy. Indeed, \naccording to the U.S. Small Business Administration, our Nation's 27 \nmillion small firms generate a majority of the innovation coming from \nAmerican businesses and produce 13 times more patents per employee than \ntheir larger counterparts. But to continue this trend, we need a new, \nyounger generation of entrepreneurs to rise to the forefront and open \ntheir own small businesses. That is why I am proud to rise today to \nrecognize the entrepreneurial spirit and ingenuity of a young woman \nfrom my home State of Maine whose graphic and Web design company is \nproviding clients with, in her words, `` fresh ideas that grow \nresults.''\n  iBec Creative was founded in 2006 by entrepreneur Becky Stockbridge. \nAs a senior at the University of Southern Maine, Ms. Stockbridge wrote \na business plan to start a Web and graphic design business for medical \nprofessionals. She realized that this critical segment of our economy \nwas in desperate need of innovative and creative ways to promote their \nexpertise, including through brochures, logos, and informational Web \nsites. With a $4,200 grant from the Libra Future Fund, a Maine-based \nnonprofit organization that supports young entrepreneurs, as well as \nfree office space awarded by the Maine Center for Enterprise \nDevelopment, she embarked upon her fledgling entrepreneurial career. To \novercome a slow start, Ms. Stockbridge soon began designing Web sites \nand graphic designs for small businesses in other fields and by seizing \nupon these additional opportunities, she greatly broadened her client \nbase.\n  In her continued efforts to present clients with cutting-edge \ntechnology, Ms. Stockbridge's innovative assortment of development, \ndesign, and monitoring services have turned iBec Creative into a well-\nrespected five-person small company with an expected $350,000 in \nrevenue for 2009. iBec currently specializes in providing a wide range \nof marketing and consulting services to its clients, such as Web design \nand search engine optimization, SEO, consulting, branding, internet \nmarketing, traditional marketing, and project management. Additionally, \niBec Creative utilizes emerging media to promote its clients various \nbrands.\n  Ms. Stockbridge's creativity, vigor, and entrepreneurial commitment \nwere recently recognized by BusinessWeek as she was named a 2009 \nfinalist in the America's Best Young Entrepreneurs competition. She is \nthe only person nominated from my home State of Maine and the first \nfinalist from Maine since the contest began 5 years ago. Ms. \nStockbridge is competing against 24 other young entrepreneurs from \naround the Nation in this unique online challenge, and I look forward \nto hearing about her successful outcome at the end of the competition.\n  iBec Creative is a remarkable small business whose story demonstrates \nhow community involvement and encouragement can help entrepreneurs of \nall ages realize their aspirations and dreams. I commend Becky \nStockbridge for her innovation and determination and wish Ms. \nStockbridge and everyone at iBec Creative the best of luck with their \nburgeoning business.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/28/senate-section/article/S10849-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/28/senate-section/article/S10849-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/28/senate-section/article/S10849-4", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 9:33 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 2489.

A bill to improve health care fraud enforcement; to the \nCommittee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, it is no longer a secret that fraud \nrepresents one of the fastest growing and most costly forms of crime in \nAmerica today. In no small part, our current economic crisis can be \nattributed to unchecked mortgage fraud. Mortgage fraud itself was \nspurred by rampant accounting fraud, which enabled crooked executives \nto fatten their larders on a bubble of fake equity. And on the back-\nend, securities fraud, in the form of market manipulation and insider \ntrading, hastened the eventual market crash and maximized its impact on \nMain Street and average American investors. In response, this body \npassed the Fraud Enforcement Recovery Act, FERA, which directed \ncritical resources and tools to anti-financial fraud efforts.\n  FERA was passed in response to an unprecedented financial crisis. \nAmericans should expect Congress to do more than simply react to crises \nafter their most destructive impacts have already been felt. We owe it \nto our constituents to be proactive and to seek out and solve problems \non the horizon so that disaster can be averted.\n  In the midst of the debate concerning comprehensive health care \nreform, we must be proactive in combating health care fraud and abuse. \nEach year, criminals drain between $72 and $220 billion from private \nand public health care plans through fraud. We pay these costs as \ntaxpayers and through higher health insurance premiums. As we take\n\n[[Page S10853]]\n\nsteps to increase the number of Americans who are covered by health \ninsurance, and to improve the health care system for everyone, we must \nalso ensure that law enforcement has the tools that it needs to deter, \ndetect, and punish health care fraud.\n  The Finance and HELP committees have worked long and hard to find \nways to fight fraud and bend the cost curve down. They have done a \ngreat job. There's more work to be done, however, which is why today I, \nalong with Senators Leahy, Specter, Kohl, Schumer, and Klobuchar, \nintroduce the Health Care Fraud Enforcement Act of 2009.\n  This bill makes straightforward but critical improvements to the \nFederal sentencing guidelines, to health care fraud statutes, and to \nforfeiture, money laundering, and obstruction statutes. The bill would \nalso make available more Federal resources to activities specifically \ndesigned to target health care fraud. Taken together, these measures \nsend a strong and unmistakable signal to those who would engage in \nhealth care fraud that they will be caught, and they will be punished.\n  The bill makes important changes to the Federal sentencing guidelines \nto ensure that health care fraud offenses will be punished commensurate \nwith the cost that these offenders inflict upon our health care system. \nHealth care represents \\1/6\\ of our national economy, and so unchecked \nhealth care fraud has the potential to inflict devastating harm to our \nnational prosperity.\n  Despite the enormous losses in many health care fraud cases, analysis \nfrom the United States Sentencing Commission suggests that health care \nfraud offenders often receive shorter sentences than other white collar \noffenders in cases with similar loss amounts. And according to \nstatements from cooperating health care fraud defendants, many \ncriminals are drawn to health care fraud because of this low risk-to-\nreward ratio. For this reason, the bill directs the Sentencing \nCommission to increase the offense score of health care fraud offenses \nby two to four levels, depending on the dollar amount involved in the \ncrime.\n  The bill also clarifies that courts should refuse to entertain \narguments by defendants that they can avoid stiff punishment because \nonly a portion of their fraudulent claims were likely to be paid.\n  In addition, the bill updates the definition of ``health care fraud \noffense'' in the Federal criminal code to include violations of the \nanti-kickback statute, the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and certain \nprovisions of ERISA. These changes will allow the full panoply of law \nenforcement tools to be used against all health care fraud.\n  The bill also strengthens whistleblower actions based on medical care \nkickbacks, which tempt by health care providers to churn unnecessary \nmedical care at great risk to patients and great cost to the taxpayer. \nBy making all payments that stem from an illegal kickback subject to \nthe False Claims Act, this bill leverages the private sector to help \ndetect and recover money paid pursuant to these illegal practices.\n  The Department of Justice has had success both prosecuting illegal \nkickbacks and pursuing False Claims Act matters based on underlying \nviolations of the Anti-Kickback Statute. Nevertheless, defendants in \nsuch FCA cases continue to mount legal challenges that sometimes defeat \nlegitimate enforcement efforts.\n  For example, a court recently held that, even though a device company \nmay have paid a kickback to a doctor to use a particular medical \ndevice, the bill to the government for the procedure to implant the \ndevice was not false or fraudulent because the claim was submitted by \nthe innocent hospital, and not by the guilty doctor. In other words, a \nclaim that results from a kickback and that is fraudulent when \nsubmitted by a wrongdoer is laundered into a ``clean'' claim when an \ninnocent third party finally submits the claim to the government for \npayment. This has the effect of insulating both the payor and the \nrecipient of the kickback from False Claims Act liability. This \nobstacle to a successful action particularly limits the ability of the \nDepartment of Justice to recover from pharmaceutical and device \nmanufacturers, because in such instances the claims arising from the \nillegal kickbacks typically are not submitted by the doctors who \nreceived the kickbacks, but by pharmacies and hospitals that had no \nknowledge of the underlying unlawful conduct.\n  This bill remedies the problem by amending the anti-kickback statute \nto ensure that all claims resulting from illegal kickbacks are ``false \nor fraudulent,'' even when the claims are not submitted directly by the \nwrongdoers themselves. I want to emphasize that in such circumstances, \nneither anti-kickback nor False Claims Act liability will lie against \nthe innocent third party that submitted the claim.\n  The bill also addresses confusion in the case law over the \nappropriate meaning of ``willful'' conduct in health care fraud. Both \nthe anti-kickback statute and the health care fraud statute include the \nterm ``willfully.'' In both contexts, the Ninth Circuit Court of \nAppeals has read the term to require proof that the defendant not only \nintended to engage in unlawful conduct, but also knew of the particular \nlaw in question and intended to violate that particular law.\n  This heightened mental state requirement may be appropriate for \ncriminal violations of hyper-technical regulations, but it is \ninappropriate for these crimes, which punish simple fraud. The Finance \nCommittee health care reform bill, America's Healthy Future Act, \naddresses this problem for the anti-kickback statute, but not for the \ngeneral health care fraud offense. Accordingly, the Health Care Fraud \nEnforcement Act tracks the Finance bill and clarifies that ``willful \nconduct'' in this context does not require proof that the defendant had \nactual knowledge of the law in question or specific intent to violate \nthat law. As a result, health care fraudsters will not receive special \nprotection that they don't deserve.\n  Next, the bill provides the Department of Justice with critical \nsubpoena authority for investigations conducted pursuant to the Civil \nRights for Institutionalized Persons Act, also known as CRIPA.\n  Pursuant to that important statute, the Civil Rights Division of the \nDepartment of Justice investigates conditions in publicly operated \ninstitutions, such as nursing homes, mental health institutions, \nfacilities for persons with disabilities, residential schools for \nchildren with disabilities, as well as jails and prisons, where there \nhas been an allegation of pattern or practice of violating residents' \nFederal civil rights. Under CRIPA, only injunctive relief is available; \nthe statute does not provide for the award of damages.\n  CRIPA investigations commonly concern allegations of inadequate \nmedical and mental health care, unsafe living conditions, and the \nfailure to protect residents from harm. The majority of CRIPA \ninvestigations are conducted with the voluntary cooperation of state \nand local jurisdictions. When unlawful conditions are identified, CRIPA \ninvestigations are typically resolved through a negotiated settlement \nagreement that addresses the reforms necessary to correct policies, \nprocedures and practices to address the identified deficiencies.\n  Some jurisdictions, however, have refused to cooperate with the \nDivision. CRIPA does not authorize the Department of Justice to issue \nsubpoenas for documents, records, or even for access into the \ninstitution that is the target of the investigation. As a result, \ninvestigations have been hamstrung and the effectiveness of CRIPA to \nremedy systemic abuse of institutionalized persons has been \nunnecessarily limited.\n  For example, in a CRIPA investigation of a county nursing home in New \nJersey, the local jurisdiction would not cooperate. The Division's \ninvestigation revealed inadequate medical and mental health care, \nunlawful restraint, and inadequate nutrition and hydration. In one \nparticularly serious incident, which occurred weeks after a meeting \nwith the county officials to request their cooperation with the \ninvestigation, a resident was fed so quickly by staff that she \naspirated and died. Emergency room physicians extracted a volume of \nmashed potatoes from the resident's lungs that filled a Ziploc bag. \nAnother nursing home resident slowly starved to death because staff \nimproperly positioned that resident's feeding tube. The Division was \ncompelled to file suit, resulting in a negotiated settlement more than \n4 years after the investigation began. To be sure, these\n\n[[Page S10854]]\n\nabuses are a civil rights issue that demand attention even in the \nabsence of fraud prevention. But substandard care also represents fraud \nand waste, because taxpayers have paid for the provision of \nsatisfactory medical services at facilities that fall under CRIPA \njurisdiction.\n  The absence of subpoena authority enables non-cooperating \njurisdictions to obstruct and delay the Division in its mission to \nensure that the Federal rights of persons in the custody of state and \nlocal officials are respected. The resultant litigation when \njurisdictions exploit the absence of subpoena power is extraordinarily \ncostly, yet the substantive outcome, appropriate injunctive relief, is \nthe same.\n  The bill addresses the problem by authorizing the Department of \nJustice to issue subpoenas for access to any institution that is the \nsubject of an investigation related to a violation of CRIPA, and for \nany documents, records, materials, files, reports, memoranda, policies, \nprocedures, investigations, video or audio recordings, and quality \nassurance reports of such institution.\n  In a final substantive change, the bill corrects an apparent drafting \nerror by providing that obstruction of criminal investigations \ninvolving administrative subpoenas under HIPAA, the Health Insurance \nPortability and Accountability Act of 1996, should be treated in the \nsame manner as obstruction of criminal investigations involving grand \njury subpoenas.\n  Finally, the Health Care Fraud Enforcement Act provides the resources \nneeded for law enforcement to uncover and go after these frauds. Health \ncare fraud cannot be fought effectively without more investigators and \nprosecutors. This bill authorizes the appropriation of $20,000,000 each \nyear from 2011 through 2016 for investigations, prosecutions, and civil \nor other proceedings relating to fraud and abuse in connection with any \nhealth care benefit program. The bill authorizes the United States \nAttorneys' Offices to be appropriated an additional $10,000,000 each \nyear for this purpose, the Criminal Division of the Department of \nJustice, $5,000,000 each year, and the Civil Division of the Department \nof Justice, $5,000,000 each year.\n  As we move toward meaningful health care reform, we must ensure that \ncriminals who engage in health care fraud, and those who contemplate \ndoing so, understand that they face swift prosecution and substantial \npunishment. Congress should move quickly to pass this legislation so \nthat American taxpayers can be confident that their government has the \ntools and resources necessary to protect its investment in the health \nand welfare of our Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Health Care Fraud Enforcement Act \nof 2009.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Kaufman, as \nwell as Senators Specter, Kohl, Schumer, and Klobuchar, to introduce \nthe Health Care Fraud Enforcement Act of 2009. This legislation builds \non the impressive steps the administration has already taken to step up \nhealth care fraud prevention and enforcement, and on the real progress \nrepresented by the anti-fraud provisions of the Finance and Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pension Committee bills already before Congress. I \nwas glad to contribute to those efforts.\n  I feel strongly, though, that more needs to be done. This bill will \nprovide prosecutors with needed tools for the effective investigation, \nprosecution, and punishment of health care fraud. By making modest but \nimportant changes to the law, it ensures that those who drain our \nhealth care system of billions of dollars each year, driving up costs \nand risking patients' lives, will go to jail, and that their fraudulent \ngains will be returned to American taxpayers and health care \nbeneficiaries.\n  For more than 3 decades, I have fought in Congress to combat fraud \nand protect taxpayer dollars. This spring, I introduced with Senator \nGrassley and Senator Kaufman the Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, \nthe most significant anti-fraud legislation in more than a decade. When \nthat legislation was enacted, it provided law enforcement with new \ntools to detect and prosecute financial and mortgage fraud. Now, as \nhealth care reform moves through the Senate, I want to make sure we do \nall we can to tackle the fraud that has contributed greatly to the \nskyrocketing cost of health care.\n  The scale of health care fraud in America today is staggering. \nAccording to conservative estimates, about three percent of the funds \nspent on health care are lost to fraud--more than $60 billion a year. \nIn the Medicare program alone, the Government Accountability Office \nestimates that more than $10 billon was lost to fraud just last year. \nWhile Medicare and Medicaid fraud is significant, it is important to \nremember that health care fraud does not occur solely in the public \nsector. Private health insurers also see billions of dollars lost to \nfraud. That fraud is often harder for the Government to track. Private \ncompanies have less incentive to report it, and in some cases, are \nresponsible for the fraudulent practices themselves. Reining in private \nsector fraud must be a part of any comprehensive health care reform.\n  The Health Care Fraud Enforcement Act of 2009 makes a number of \nstraightforward, important improvements to existing statutes to \nstrengthen prosecutors' ability to combat health care fraud. The bill \nwould increase the Federal sentencing guidelines for health care fraud \noffenses. Despite the enormous losses in many health care fraud cases, \noffenders often receive shorter sentences than other white collar \ncriminals. This lower risk is one reason criminals are drawn to health \ncare fraud. By increasing the Federal sentencing guidelines for health \ncare fraud offenses, we send a clear message that those who steal from \nthe Nation's health care system will face swift prosecution and \nsubstantial punishment.\n  The bill also provides for a number of statutory changes to \nstrengthen fraud enforcement. For example, it would expand the \ndefinition of a ``Federal health care fraud offense'' to include \nviolations of the anti-kickback statute and several other key health \ncare-related criminal statutes, which will allow for more vigorous \nenforcement of those offenses, including making their proceeds subject \nto criminal forfeiture. It would also amend the anti-kickback statute \nto ensure that all claims resulting from illegal kickbacks are \nconsidered false claims for the purpose of civil action under the False \nClaims Act, even when the claims are not submitted directly by the \nwrongdoers themselves. All too often, health care providers secure \nbusiness by paying illegal kickbacks, which needlessly increase health \ncare risks and costs. This change will help ensure that the government \nis able to recoup from wrongdoers the losses caused by false health \ncare fraud claims. The bill clarifies the intent requirement of another \nkey health care fraud statute in order to facilitate effective, fair, \nand vigorous enforcement.\n  The bill also provides the Department of Justice with limited \nsubpoena authority for civil rights investigations conducted pursuant \nto the Civil Rights for Institutionalized Persons Act. This provision \nallows the Government to more effectively investigate conditions in \npublicly operated institutions, such as nursing homes, mental health \ninstitutions, and residential schools for children with disabilities, \nwhere there have been allegations of civil rights violations.\n  Lastly, the bill provides needed resources for criminal and civil \nenforcement of health care fraud laws. It authorizes the appropriation \nof $20,000,000 a year to the Department of Justice from 2011 through \n2016 for investigations, prosecutions, and civil or other proceedings \nrelating to fraud and abuse in connection with any health care benefit \nprogram. Studies indicate a return on investment of anywhere from $6 to \n$15 in Government recovery of fraud proceeds for every $1 spent on \nhealth care fraud enforcement, so this is a prudent and needed \ninvestment.\n  We all agree that reducing the cost of health care for American \ncitizens is a critical goal of health care reform. We in Congress must \ndo our part by ensuring that, when we pass a health care reform bill, \nit includes all the tools and resources needed to crack down on the \nscourge of health care fraud. This bill is an important part of that \neffort.\n\n[[Page S10855]]\n\n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1963. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to provide \nassistance to caregivers of veterans, to improve the provision of \nhealth care to veterans, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I am introducing landmark legislation \nthat will provide critical assistance to veterans and their family \ncaregivers. The Caregiver and Veterans Omnibus Health Services Act of \n2009, contains provisions from S. 252, the Veterans Health Care \nAuthorization Act of 2009, and S. 801, the Caregiver and Veterans \nHealth Services Act of 2009. The Committee reported both S. 252 and S. \n801, and but they are being held by a single Senator. Today, I \nreintroduce these vital improvements to veterans' health care as S. \n1963.\n  The bipartisan provisions contained in S. 1963 provide needed \nassistance and support to family members and others who are serving as \ncaregivers for the most seriously injured veterans of the conflicts in \nIraq and Afghanistan. This assistance includes health care, counseling, \nsupport and a living stipend. They also expand services for women \nveterans, those with traumatic brain injury, and veterans that live in \nrural areas. Because the Nation's veterans and their caregivers cannot \nwait any longer for this help, I am introducing S. 1963, and asking \nthat it be immediately placed on the Calendar.\n  S. 1963 has one simple theme: that every veteran deserves access to \nhigh quality health care, whether that care is provided by VA, or by a \nfamily caregiver. The Congress has previously recognized the \ncontributions of caregivers. S. 1963 also contains many other important \nveterans' health improvements, including expanding services for women \nveterans; telemedicine technologies; transportation grants; and \nscholarship and loan repayment programs; and eliminating copayments for \ncatastrophically disabled veterans. States which have an especially \nhigh number of veterans living in rural areas, such as Montana, Nevada, \nWyoming, Florida, Arizona, Arkansas, Virginia, Idaho, Oklahoma, and New \nMexico, would benefit greatly from the provisions in the bill which are \ndesigned to improve health care for rural veterans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA:\n  S. 1964. A bill to require disclosure of financial relationships \nbetween brokers and dealers and mutual fund companies, and of certain \ncommissions paid by mutual fund companies; to the Committee on Banking, \nHousing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today, I am introducing the Mutual Fund \nTransparency Act of 2009. Mutual funds are vital investment vehicles \nfor middle-income Americans that provide diversification and \nprofessional money management. Many working families rely on their \nmutual fund investments to pay for their children's education, prepare \nfor retirement, and attain other financial goals.\n  I first introduced a version of this legislation in 2003. That fall, \nappalling abuses of investor trust were exposed. Ordinary investors \nwere being harmed by the greed of brokers, mutual fund employees, and \ninstitutional and large investors. The transgressions made it clear \nthat the boards of mutual fund companies were not providing sufficient \noversight and failed to adequately protect the interests of their \nshareholders.\n  After the introduction of my bill, Securities and Exchange \nCommission, SEC, Chairman William Donaldson proposed several rules that \nmirrored the provisions in my bill, including a requirement that funds \nrelying on certain exemptive rules have an independent chairman and \nthat 75 percent of board directors be independent. However, legal \nactions taken against the SEC by the Chamber of Commerce and subsequent \ninaction under his successor, Chairman Christopher Cox, have prevented \nthe adoption of these rules. The SEC needs additional statutory \nauthority to finish these reforms and ensure that investors can rely on \nindependent mutual fund boards to protect their interests.\n  My bill will ensure the independence of mutual fund boards, increase \nthe transparency of fees and expenses of mutual funds, and impose a \nfiduciary duty on all investment advisors.\n  I have included in this legislation a number of provisions intended \nto ensure the independence of mutual fund boards. Poor board governance \nwas a contributing factor to the mutual fund scandals in 2003. \nIndependent directors must have a dominant presence on the board to \nensure that investors' interests are the top priority. Once again, my \nlegislation requires mutual fund boards to have an independent chairman \nand that 75 percent of their members be independent. The legislation \nstrengthens the definition of an independent director. These changes \nwill ensure that the interest of investors will be the paramount \npriority of the board.\n  My legislation will ensure that investors are provided with relevant \nand meaningful disclosures from which they can make better informed \ndecisions. Mr. President, my bill will increase the transparency of the \ncomplex financial relationship between brokers and mutual fund \ncompanies in ways that are both meaningful and easy to understand for \ninvestors. Shelf-space payments and revenue-sharing agreements between \nmutual fund companies and brokers present conflicts of interest that \nmust be disclosed to investors. Without such disclosures, investors \ncannot make informed financial decisions. Investors may believe that \nbrokers are recommending funds based on the expectation of solid \nreturns or low volatility, when the broker's recommendation may be \ninfluenced by hidden broker commissions. I have included a point-of-\nsale disclosure requirement in my legislation. In my bill, investors \nwould have to be provided with the amount of differential payments and \naverage fees for comparable transactions. My legislation also requires \nthat confirmation notices be provided for mutual fund transactions, \nwhich will indicate how their broker was compensated.\n  Investors are not provided with a complete and accurate idea of the \nexpenses involved with owning a particular fund. Consumers often \ncompare the expense ratios of funds when making investment decisions. \nHowever, expense ratios fail to take into account the cost of \ncommissions in the purchase and sale of securities. To further increase \nthe transparency of the actual costs of the fund, brokerage commissions \nmust be counted as an expense in filings with the SEC and included in \nthe calculation of the expense ratio. Currently, brokerage commissions \nare disclosed to the SEC, but not to individual investors. Brokerage \ncommissions are only disclosed to investors upon request. My bill \nstrengthens brokerage commission disclosure provisions and ensures that \ncommissions will be included in a document that investors have access \nto and can utilize. The inclusion of brokerage commissions in the \nexpense ratio creates an incentive to reduce the use of soft dollars. \nSoft dollars can be used to lower expenses since most purchases using \nsoft dollars do not count as expenses and are not calculated into the \nexpense ratio. This change will make it easier for investors to know \nthe true cost of the fund and compare the expense ratios of funds \nmeaningfully.\n  When I reintroduced a version of this bill in 2005, I added a \nprovision pertaining to the fiduciary duty of brokers. Although I have \nmodified that provision for the current bill, my intent to apply a \nfiduciary duty to brokers remains the same. This is an essential \nprovision because it ensures that all financial professionals have the \nsame responsibility to act in the best interests of their clients \nwhether they are an investment advisor or a broker.\n  We must improve the financial literacy of mutual fund investors so \nthat they can make more sound investment decisions. I have included a \nrequirement that the SEC study financial literacy among mutual fund \ninvestors. The SEC would be required to develop a strategy to increase \nthe financial literacy of investors that results in positive change in \ninvestor behavior. In addition, the bill requires the Comptroller \nGeneral of the United States to conduct a study on mutual fund \nadvertising and make recommendations to improve investor protections \nand ensure that investors can make informed financial decisions when \npurchasing shares.\n  We must enact this vital legislation to help protect the investments \nthat our working families make in mutual\n\n[[Page S10856]]\n\nfunds. These reforms are long overdue. I will build upon the \nadministration's regulatory modernization proposal on fiduciary duty \nfor brokers and pre-sale disclosure of mutual fund expenses.\n  I look forward to working with my friend, SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro, \nto bring about structural reform in the mutual fund industry and \nincrease disclosures in order to provide useful and relevant \ninformation to mutual fund investors.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1964\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: We are writing to express our strong \n     support for your efforts to ensure that professionals who \n     advise America's investors are held to the highest standard \n     of care--the fiduciary standard. Section 6(b) of the Mutual \n     Fund Transparency Act of 2009 (``MFTA'') would clearly \n     establish that brokers are subject to a fiduciary duty with \n     respect to investment advice provided to retail investors. \n     This provision eliminates a regulatory gap that has long \n     exposed investors to unscrupulous and harmful sales practices \n     by brokers.\n       Under current law, brokers are subject to a general \n     suitability standard when providing investment advice to \n     their retail clients. Under a suitability standard, a broker \n     is not required to ensure that his recommendations are what \n     is best for his clients, but only what is generally suitable. \n     The suitability standard allows brokers to recommend \n     investments, for example, based on the amount of compensation \n     the broker receives rather than what is in the best interest \n     of the client. The suitability standard does not even require \n     brokers to disclose their compensation so that their clients \n     can evaluate conflict of interest payments for themselves.\n       In contrast, investment advisers are subject to a strict \n     fiduciary duty under the Advisers Act. As such, they are \n     required to make recommendations only if they are in the \n     client's best interest and to disclose all material \n     conflicts. By applying the fiduciary standard under the \n     Advisers Act to brokers, Section 6(b) of the MFTA ensures \n     that the protection of a fiduciary standard for retail \n     advisory clients will not depend on an arbitrary regulatory \n     distinction between brokers and investment advisers, but will \n     be applied rationally to provide all Americans who receive \n     investment advice with the regulatory protection that they \n     expect and deserve.\n       We wish to express our enthusiastic support for your \n     proposal to establish a fiduciary duty for brokers and are \n     available to provide whatever assistance you may need in this \n     respect.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Mercer Bullard,\n       Founder and President, Fund Democracy, Inc.\n     Barbara Roper,\n       Director of Investor Protection, Consumer Federation of \n     America.\n     Denise Voigt Crawford,\n       Texas Securities Commissioner and President, North American \n     Securities Administrators Association, Inc.\n     Ellen Turf,\n       CEO, National Association of Personal Financial Advisors.\n     Kevin R.

Daniel K. Akaka,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Akaka: We are writing to express our \n     enthusiastic support for the Mutual Fund Transparency Act of \n     2009 because your bill will benefit fund shareholders in \n     three significant respects. First, it will strengthen the \n     independence of mutual fund boards to help ensure that the \n     gross abuses of trust committed by fund managers in \n     connection with the recent mutual fund scandal will not be \n     repeated. Second, the bill will require that fund \n     shareholders be provided with full and understandable \n     disclosure of brokers' fees and conflicts of interest, and \n     that when brokers provide individualized investment advice \n     they will be held to the same fiduciary standards to which \n     all other investment advisers are held. Third, the bill will \n     promote competition through increased price transparency, and \n     thereby improve services and reduce costs for the almost 100 \n     million Americans who have entrusted their financial security \n     to mutual funds.\n\n\n                            Fund Governance\n\n       The mutual fund scandal that erupted in September 2003 and \n     continues to be litigated to this day revealed ``a serious \n     breakdown in management controls in more than just a few \n     mutual fund complexes.'' As noted by the Securities and \n     Exchange Commission:\n\n     The breakdown in fund management and compliance controls \n     evidenced by our enforcement cases raises troubling questions \n     about the ability of many fund boards, as presently \n     constituted, to effectively oversee the any management of \n     funds. The failure of a board to play its proper role can \n     result, in addition to serious compliance breakdowns, in \n     excessive fees and brokerage commissions, less than \n     forthright disclosure, mispricing of\n\n[[Page S10858]]\n\n     securities, and inferior investment performance.''\n       The Act directly addresses the governance weaknesses \n     revealed by the scandal by strengthening the independence of \n     fund directors. It plugs loopholes that have allowed former \n     executives of fund managers and other fund service providers, \n     among others, to qualify as ``independent'' directors when \n     their independence is clearly compromised by their former \n     positions. The Act also ensures that the board's agenda will \n     be set by an independent chairman, and not by the CEO of the \n     fund's manager, as is common practice today, and that \n     independent directors will control board matters and the \n     evaluation of independent nominees. The Act's requirement \n     that independent directors seek shareholder approval at least \n     every five years will enhance the accountability of \n     independent directors to the shareholders whose interests \n     they are supposed to serve.\n       The Act's requirement that funds have an independent \n     chairman and a 75 percent independent board of directors is \n     critical in light of the SEC's failure to take final action \n     on rules imposing similar requirements. Even if these rules \n     were adopted, they would not prevent fund managers from \n     terminating independent chairmen or reducing independent \n     representation on the board to the statutory minimum of 40 \n     percent. The SEC's rules would apply only when the funds \n     choose to rely on certain exemptive rules. If there were a \n     conflict between the fund's independent directors and the \n     fund manager, the fund manager could simply stop relying on \n     the rules and seek to install its own executives in a \n     majority of board positions. More importantly, independent \n     directors know that the protection given them by the SEC is \n     limited, and they therefore will be less likely to stand up \n     for shareholders than they would be if--as you have \n     proposed--the SEC's proposals were codified.\n\n\n    Fiduciary Duties and Full Disclosure for all Investment Advisers\n\n       Recent regulatory investigations and enforcement actions \n     have uncovered persistent and widespread sales abuses by \n     brokers. Regulators have found that brokers have \n     systematically overcharged investors for commissions, \n     routinely made improper recommendations of B shares, accepted \n     undisclosed directed brokerage payments in return for \n     distribution services, and received revenue sharing payments \n     that create incentives to favor funds that pay the highest \n     compensation rather than funds that are the best investment \n     option for their clients.\n       Five years ago, the Commission promised that it would \n     address the problems that have so long plagued brokers' sales \n     practices, but the Commission's efforts have fallen far short \n     of the mark. Its proposals failed to require full disclosure \n     of brokers' compensation, much less the disclosure of \n     information that would enable investors to fully evaluate \n     their brokers' conflicts of interests. The new disclosure \n     requirements that you have proposed will ensure that brokers \n     will be subject to a fiduciary duty and their conflicts of \n     interest will be fully transparent to investors. Investors \n     will be able to view the amount the broker is being paid for \n     the fund being recommended compared with the (often lesser) \n     amount the broker would receive for selling a different fund, \n     which cannot help but direct investors' attention to the \n     conflict of interest created by differential compensation \n     structures. We especially applaud your proposal to ensure \n     that all broker compensation, including revenue sharing \n     payments, is disclosed in the point-of-sale document, which \n     ensures that disclosure rules will not create an incentive \n     for brokers to favor revenue sharing as a means of avoiding \n     disclosure.\n       Remarkably, in the wake of a longstanding pattern of \n     brokers' sales abuses, the Commission has effectively \n     repealed Congress's narrow exemption from advisory regulation \n     for brokers who provide only ``solely incidental'' advice. \n     The Commission's strained interpretation of ``solely \n     incidental'' advice to include any advice provided ``in \n     connection with and reasonably related to a broker's \n     brokerage services'' has effectively stripped advisory \n     clients of the protections of an entire statutory regime \n     solely on the ground that the investment advice happens to be \n     provided by a broker. The Commission's position flatly \n     contradicts the text and purpose of the Investment Advisers \n     Act, which, as the Supreme Court has stated: ``reflects a \n     congressional recognition `of the delicate fiduciary nature \n     of an investment advisory relationship,' as well as a \n     congressional intent to eliminate, or at least to expose, all \n     conflicts of interest which might incline an investment \n     adviser--consciously or unconsciously--to render advice which \n     was not disinterested.''\n\n       Your proposal restores crucial components of Congress's \n     carefully constructed regulatory scheme for the distinct and \n     complementary regulation of brokerage and advisory services. \n     It properly recognizes that a ``fiduciary, which Congress \n     recognized the investment adviser to be,'' is also what \n     consumers expect an investment adviser to be, as is generally \n     the case when professional services are provided on a \n     personalized basis. The Act also recognizes the importance of \n     ``expos[ing] all conflicts of interest which might incline an \n     investment adviser--consciously or unconsciously--to render \n     advice which was not disinterested,'' by requiring full \n     disclosure of such conflicts of interests and other material \n     information at the time that the prospective client is \n     deciding whether to enter into the relationship.\n\n\n                  Fee Disclosure and Price Competition\n\n       Your fee disclosure provisions will do double duty, by \n     addressing conflicts of interest and brokers' sales abuses \n     while also promoting competition, thereby improving services \n     and driving down expenses. Requiring brokers to disclose the \n     amount of differential payments and average fees for \n     comparable transactions will provide the kind of price \n     transparency that is a necessary predicate for price \n     competition and the efficient operation of free markets. In \n     addition, the requirement that funds disclose the amount of \n     commissions they pay will ensure that the fund expense ratio \n     includes all of the costs of the fund's operations and will \n     enable investors to make more informed investment decisions. \n     The best regulator of fees is the market, but the market \n     cannot operate efficiently when brokers and funds are \n     permitted to hide the actual cost of the services they \n     provide.\n\n\n               Financial Literacy and Fund Advertisements\n\n       Finally, we strongly agree that there is a need for further \n     study of financial literacy, including especially information \n     that fund investors need to make informed investment \n     decisions and methods to increase the transparency of fees \n     and potential conflicts of interest. Your proposed study of \n     mutual fund advertisements is also timely, as the regulation \n     of fund ads continues to permit misleading touting of \n     outsized short-term performance and other abuses.\n       Mutual funds are Americans' most important lifeline to \n     retirement security. The regulation of mutual funds, however, \n     has not kept pace with their enormous growth. We applaud your \n     continuing efforts to enhance investor protection, promote \n     vigorous market competition and create wealth for America's \n     mutual fund investors through effective disclosure and truly \n     independent board oversight.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Mercer Bullard,\n       Founder and President, Fund Democracy, Inc.\n     Barbara Roper,\n       Director of Investor Protection, Consumer Federation of \n     America.\n     Ken McEldowney,\n       Executive Director, Consumer Action.\n     Irene E.

A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to provide \nfinancial assistance to the State of Louisiana for a pilot program to \ndevelop measures to eradicate or control feral swine and to assess and \nrestore wetlands damaged by feral swine; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce a bill that \nwill be an important component in our efforts to rebuild Louisiana's \nvast wetlands. Today, the coastline of my home state is the site of one \nof the Nation's most pronounced ecological disasters: the massive \nerosion of Louisiana's coastal wetlands. Few are aware that the marsh \nand wetlands along Louisiana's coast comprise some 40 percent of the \nNation's total salt marshes. Louisiana's coastline is a national \ntreasure. Yet, this national treasure is disappearing at an alarming \nrate due to a number of natural and man-made factors, including the \ndestruction of wetlands caused by non-native feral pig populations that \nare literally eating away the coast. The loss of our wetlands threatens \nnot only our teeming wildlife, but also land, lives, energy \ninfrastructure, and navigation.\n  That is why I rise today, to introduce the Feral Swine Eradication \nand Control Pilot Program Act of 2009, address the challenges these \nspecies pose to our efforts to reverse coastal wetland deterioration.\n  Every 30 minutes, a portion of Louisiana's coast the size of a \nfootball field is converted from healthy marsh into open water. Since \n1930, 1.2 million acres have been lost--an area roughly the size of \nDelaware. Scientists predict that Louisiana will lose another 700 \nsquare miles of coastal wetlands by 2050--an area the size of the \ngreater\n\n[[Page S10859]]\n\nWashington, D.C. and Baltimore metro areas.\n  Louisiana's coastal land loss problems are caused by a number of \nnatural and man-made factors. The primary factor has been the leveeing \nof the Mississippi River for purposes of flood control and navigation. \nHistorically, the river would flood seasonally, taking silt from the \nMidwest and depositing it across the Mississippi Delta. Levees provided \nthe needed flood protection, yet prevented vital land-building \nsediments and nutrients from replenishing and elevating deteriorating \nmarshes. Additional activity added to the problem, including dredging \nthousands of miles of access canals for petroleum extraction and \nnavigation. Those canals accelerated saltwater intrusion, further \nweakening the marsh.\n  Another human activity that resulted in significant wetland loss was \nthe introduction of two invasive species to the marshland habitat: the \nnutria and the feral pig. These non-native species are consuming our \nwetlands at an alarming rate. Nutria were initially introduced by those \nwho wanted to raise them for their furs. Their population exploded in \nthe wild and their appetite for marsh grass is boundless. Scientists \nestimate that nutria are currently affecting an estimated 100,000 acres \nof coastal wetlands.\n\n  The feral hog is another exotic species which has expanded its range \nthroughout most of Louisiana. Feral swine cause extensive damage to \nnatural wildlife habitat. In Louisiana, the wild omnivores compete with \nnative wildlife for food resources; prey on young domestic animals and \nwildlife; and carry diseases that can affect pets, livestock, wildlife \nand people. Scientists now believe that the feral hogs are not only \nwreaking enormous damage to the marsh, but are also negatively \nimpacting native freshwater mussels and insects by contributing E. coli \nto water systems.\n  According to the Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries, the \nwild pig is the most prolific large mammal in North America and given \nadequate nutrition, its populations in an area can double in just 4 \nmonths.\n  As I mentioned earlier, Louisiana's landscape has already been \nravaged by the nutria rodent. In 2002, the first program was created to \ncombat the increasing nutria populations. This program, the Coast-wide \nNutria Control Program, CNCP, incentivized trappers to catch nutria in \nreturn for monetary compensation. This program has proven successful at \ndecreasing nutria populations and significantly reducing their impact \nto coastal wetlands.\n  However, more effort was needed to further reduce the nutria damage \nto wetlands, both in Louisiana and in other marshy environments, \nincluding Maryland's Chesapeake Bay. The Nutria Eradication and Control \nAct was enacted in 2003 to provide a critical supplement of funding to \nstrengthen the Coast-wide Nutria Control Program. In July, I joined my \nfriend and colleague Senator Cardin in introducing the reauthorization \nof the Nutria Eradication and Control Act. These two measures have been \ninstrumental in reducing the nutria damage to Louisiana's wetlands.\n  Now, it is my hope that we can achieve similar success with the \nproblem of feral hogs. Feral swine are listed by the World Conservation \nUnion, IUCN, as one of the top 100 invasive species worldwide. If \naction is not taken to control the feral swine population, our \nbiologists fear these animals will undo much of the progress Louisiana \nhas made in controlling the nutria population. It is my hope that with \nthe help of my colleagues, we can pass this bill to help eradicate \nthese pests from our vanishing coastline once and for all.\n  The bill I am introducing today authorizes the Secretary of the \nInterior to allocate funding to create a pilot program modeled off of \nthe Nutria Eradication and Control Act. This program will assess the \nnature and extent of damage to the wetlands in Louisiana and develop \nmethods to eradicate or control the feral swine population, and restore \nthe coastal areas damaged by this invasive species.\n  It is a small program, but rewards it could reap are potentially \nvast. Consider this, Louisiana's wetlands are not only the home to our \nfamed wildlife, they are also the most effective protection we have \nagainst future storm damage.\n  Coastal wetlands are the last barrier between the sea and the land. \nWetlands reduce high winds and absorb the deadly storm surges that \noften accompany hurricanes. Scientists estimate that every 3 to 4 miles \nof wetlands can absorb enough water to reduce the height of a storm \nsurge by 1 foot. That protects the millions of hardworking men and \nwomen who live along Louisiana's coast.\n  But I would also like to remind my colleagues of the vital strategic \nimportance these wetlands serve to the Nation's energy security: \nLouisiana is one of the economy's largest producers of energy. Without \nwetlands as a buffer, storms could devastate the Nation's critical \nenergy infrastructure.\n  It is for all of these reasons that this legislation is crucial. I \nask that my colleagues support its prompt passage.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Ms. Klobuchar, Mr. Tester, Mr. \n        Harkin, and Mr. Kerry):\n  S. 1986. A bill to amend the Help America Vote Act of 2002 to require \nStates to provide for same day registration; to the Committee on Rules \nand Administration.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will reintroduce, along with \nSenators Klobuchar, Tester, Harkin and Kerry, the Same Day Registration \nAct of 2009, a bill that would significantly increase voter \nparticipation by allowing all eligible citizens to register to vote in \nfederal elections on Election Day or the same day that they vote.\n  In many ways, the machinery of our democracy needs significant \nrepair. We live in an age of low turnout and high cynicism. The \nAmerican people have lost faith in our election system, in part because \nthey are not confident that their votes will be counted or that the \nballot box is accessible to each and every voter regardless of ability, \nrace, or means.\n  What we see instead are long lines at polling places; faulty voting \nmachines; under-trained, under-paid, over-worked poll workers; partisan \nelection administrators; suspect vote tallies; caging lists; \nintimidation at the polling place; misleading flyers; illegal voter-\nfile purges; and now, the Supreme Court approving discriminatory voter \nID laws. If people cannot trust their elections, why should they trust \ntheir elected officials?\n  Three years ago, Professor Dan Tokaji, a leading election law expert, \ncalled for a ``moneyball approach to election reform.'' Named after \nMichael Lewis' book about the Oakland A's data-driven hiring system, \nTokaji's approach is quintessentially progressive, as that term was \nunderstood at the turn of the century. ``I mean to suggest a research-\ndriven inquiry,'' Tokaji wrote, ``in place of the anecdotal approach \nthat has too often dominated election reform conversations. While \nanecdotes and intuition have their place, they're no substitute for \nhard data and rigorous analysis.''\n  This bill embodies the moneyball approach to election reform. In \nstark contrast to many so-called election reform proposals, this bill \naddresses a real problem--low voter turnout; it targets a major cause \nof the problem--archaic registration laws; and it offers a proven \nsolution--same day registration SDR sometimes known as Election Day \nregistration, EDR.\n  The bill is very simple: it amends the Help America Vote Act to \nrequire every state to allow eligible citizens to register and vote in \na Federal election on the day of the election, or on any day where \nvoting is permitted, like during early voting. Voters may register \nusing any form that satisfies the requirements of the National Voter \nRegistration Act, including the Federal mail in voter registration form \nand any state's standard registration form. North Dakota, which does \nnot have voter registration, is exempted from the bill's requirements.\n  The bill itself is simple, but it addresses a significant problem: \nthe low voter turnout that has plagued this country for the last 40 \nyears. We live in a participatory democracy, where our government \nderives its power from the consent of the governed, a consent embodied \nin the people's exercise of their fundamental right to vote. It is self \nevident that a participatory democracy depends on participation.\n  This may be a government of the people, Mr. President, but the people \nare\n\n[[Page S10860]]\n\nnot voting. Since 1968, American political participation has hovered \naround 50 percent for Presidential elections and 40 percent for \ncongressional elections. Even in 2008, a record-breaking year, national \nturnout was only 61.7 percent of the voting age population. The U.S. \nmay be the only established democracy in the world where the fact that \nnearly 40 percent of the electorate stayed home is considered cause for \ncelebration.\n  In fact, our predecessors in the Senate would be surprised to find us \ncelebrating such low turnout: a 1974 report by the Senate Committee on \nthe Post Office and Civil Service bemoaned the ``shocking'' drop in \nturnout in the 1972 election. And what was the number that so troubled \nthe Committee? Fifty-five percent.\n  The report went on: ``[i]t is the Committee's conviction that our \ndisquieting record of voter participation is in large part due to the \nhodgepodge of registration barriers put in the way of the voter. Such \nobstacles have little, if anything, to recommend them. At best, current \nregistration laws in the various states are outmoded and simply \ninappropriate for a highly mobile population. At worst, registration \nlaws can be construed as a deliberate effort to disenfranchise voters \nwho desperately need entry into the decision-making processes of our \ncountry.''\n  What a shame, that the Committee's findings are still valid. Our \narchaic registration laws have been reformed, but they are still \narchaic. We have passed a number of important bills designed to combat \nlow turnout, but turnout is still low. America is even more mobile than \nit was in 1974, and yet our registration laws are still out of touch \nwith the reality that more than 40 million Americans move every year. \nWorst of all, our registration laws still fall especially hard on the \nyoung, the old, and the poor.\n  We have long known that complicated voter registration requirements \nconstitute one of the major barriers to voting. In fact, many states \nadopted voter registration in order to prevent certain segments of the \npopulation from voting. Alexander Keyssar, the preeminent scholar on \nthe history right to vote in this country, writes that although \n``[r]egistration laws emerged in the nineteenth century as a means of \nkeeping track of voters and preventing fraud; they also served--and \nwere intended to serve--as a means of keeping African-American, \nworking-class, immigrant, and poor voters from the polls.''\n  It is time for a fundamental change. A large body of research tells \nus that unnecessarily burdensome voter registration requirements are \nthe single largest factor in preventing people from voting. Simply put, \nvoter registration restrictions should not keep eligible Americans from \nexercising their right to vote. The solution to this problem is same \nday registration.\n  Decades of empirical research confirm same day registration's \npositive impact on turnout. As one academic paper states, ``the \nevidence on whether EDR augments the electorate is remarkably clear and \nconsistent. Studies finding positive and significant turnout impacts \nare too numerous to list.'' Mr. President, studies indicate that same \nday registration alone increases turnout by roughly 5 to 10 percentage \npoints.\n  In general, States with same day registration boast voter turnout \nthat is 10-12 percentage points higher than States that require voters \nto register before Election Day. Turnout in Minnesota and Wisconsin, \nwhich implemented same day registration over 35 years ago has been \nespecially high: in 2004, for example, when national turnout was just \n55 percent, 78 percent of eligible Minnesotans and 75 percent of \neligible Wisconsinites went to the polls. The last time national voter \nturnout was above 70 percent, it was 1896, there were only 45 States, \nand the gold standard was the dominant campaign issue.\n  Critics might worry about the possibility of fraud, but same day \nregistration actually makes the registration process more secure. \nVoters registering when they vote do so in the presence of an elections \nofficial who verifies the voter's residency and identity on the spot. \nMark Ritchie, Minnesota's Secretary of State, points out that same day \nregistration ``is much more secure because you have the person right in \nfront of you--not a postcard in the mail. That is a no-brainer. We have \n33 years of experience with this.''\n  In contrast to most election reforms, the cost of same day \nregistration is negligible. A recent survey of 26 local elections \nofficials in six same day registration States found that ``officials \nagreed that incidental expense of administering EDR is minimal.'' In \nfact, same day registration may actually result in a net savings \nbecause it significantly reduces the use of provisional ballots. \nProvisional ballots, which are required by the Help America Vote Act, \nare expensive to administer. The Congressional Budget Office estimates \nthat provisional ballots cost State and local governments about $25 \nmillion a year.\n  In some States the number of provisional ballots cast is surprisingly \nlarge. For example, in 2004, more than 4 percent of California's \nregistered voters cast provisional ballots--that is 644,642 provisional \nballots. In Ohio, 157,714 provisional ballots were cast, about 2 \npercent of all registered voters.\n  In contrast, in 2004 only 0.03 percent of voters in SDR states cast a \nprovisional ballot. In Wisconsin, only 374 provisional ballots were \ncast. In Maine, only 95 provisional ballots were cast. In fact, only \n952 provisional ballots were cast in all the SDR states combined in \n2004. To be sure, this bill is no cure-all: it does not address long \nlines, deceptive flyers, and faulty voting machines. Other bills, good \nbills, address those issues.\n  The bottom line is this: the Same Day Registration Act would \nsubstantially increase civic participation, improve the integrity of \nthe electoral process, reduce election administration costs, and \nreaffirm that voting is a fundamental right. It has been proven \neffective by more than 30 years of successful implementation in \nMinnesota and Wisconsin and decades of empirical research. Same day \nregistration is good for voters, good for taxpayers, and good for \ndemocracy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1986\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 327\n\n       Whereas the President has designated October 2009 as \n     ``National Domestic Violence Awareness Month'';\n       Whereas domestic violence affects people of all ages as \n     well as racial, ethnic, gender, economic, and religious \n     backgrounds;\n       Whereas females are disproportionately victims of domestic \n     violence, and 1 in 4 women will experience domestic violence \n     at some point in her life;\n       Whereas on average, more than 3 women are murdered by their \n     husbands or boyfriends in the United States every day;\n       Whereas in 2005, 1,181 women were murdered by an intimate \n     partner constituting 78 percent of all intimate partner \n     homicides that year;\n       Whereas women ages 16 to 24 experience the highest rates, \n     per capita, of intimate partner violence;\n       Whereas 1 out of 3 Native American women will be raped and \n     6 out of 10 will be physically assaulted in their lifetimes;\n       Whereas the cost of intimate partner violence exceeds \n     $5,800,000,000 each year, $4,100,000 of which is for direct \n     medical and mental health care services;\n       Whereas \\1/4\\ to \\1/2\\ of domestic violence victims report \n     that they have lost a job due, at least in part, to domestic \n     violence;\n       Whereas the annual cost of lost productivity due to \n     domestic violence is estimated at $727,800,000 with over \n     7,900,000 paid workdays lost per year;\n       Whereas some landlords deny housing to victims of domestic \n     violence who have protection orders or evict victims of \n     domestic violence for seeking help after a domestic violence \n     incident, such as by calling 911, or who have other \n     indications that they are domestic violence victims;\n       Whereas 92 percent of homeless women experience severe \n     physical or sexual abuse at some point in their lifetimes;\n       Whereas approximately 40 to 60 percent of men who abuse \n     women also abuse children;\n       Whereas approximately 15,500,000 children are exposed to \n     domestic violence every year;\n       Whereas children exposed to domestic violence are more \n     likely to attempt suicide, abuse drugs and alcohol, run away \n     from home, and engage in teenage prostitution;\n       Whereas one large study found that men exposed to physical \n     abuse, sexual abuse, and adult domestic violence as children \n     were almost 4 times more likely than other men to have \n     perpetrated domestic violence as adults;\n       Whereas nearly 1,500,000 high school students nationwide \n     experienced physical abuse from a dating partner in a single \n     year;\n       Whereas 13 percent of teenage girls who have been in a \n     relationship report being hit or hurt by their partners and 1 \n     in 4 teenage girls has been in a relationship in which she \n     was pressured by her partner into performing sexual acts;\n       Whereas adolescent girls who reported dating violence were \n     60 percent more likely to report one or more suicide attempts \n     in the past year;\n       Whereas there is a need for middle schools, secondary \n     schools, and post-secondary schools to educate students about \n     the issues of domestic violence, sexual assault, dating \n     violence, and stalking;\n       Whereas 88 percent of men in a national poll reported that \n     they think that our society should do more to respect women \n     and girls;\n       Whereas a recently released multi-State study shows \n     conclusively that the Nation's domestic violence shelters are \n     addressing\n\n[[Page S10866]]\n\n     victims' urgent and long-term needs and are helping victims \n     protect themselves and their children;\n       Whereas a 2008 National Census Survey reported that 60,799 \n     adults and children were served by domestic violence shelters \n     and programs around the Nation in a single day;\n       Whereas those same understaffed programs were unable to \n     meet 8,927 requests for help that day;\n       Whereas there is a need to increase funding for programs \n     aimed at intervening and preventing domestic violence in the \n     United States;
