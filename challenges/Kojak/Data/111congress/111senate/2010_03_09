Mr. President, the debate over health care has been \ngoing on for a long time now. It is easy to lose sight of where we \nstarted, so I would just like to remind people today of what this \ndebate was supposed to be about.\n  It was supposed to be about cost. This debate was supposed to be \nabout bringing the cost of health care down, about keeping health care \ncosts from bankrupting families and government. So if you are looking \nfor a reason as to why Americans overwhelmingly oppose this bill and \nwhy Democrats are having such a hard time rounding up votes within \ntheir own party for this bill, it is because no one believes this bill \nwill lower the cost of health care. It is that simple.\n  When you hear people talk about the cost of health care, they usually \nare referring to three things: the overall health care expenses \nAmericans will have to shoulder if this bill passes, overall spending \nby the Federal Government on health care if this bill passes, and the \namount of money people will have to spend on health insurance premiums \nif this bill passes. On all three counts, the bill the White House and \nits allies in Congress want us to vote for would drive costs up \nactually. The administration's own scorekeeper at the Centers for \nMedicare & Medicaid Services says overall health spending will go up by \nmore than $200 billion under this bill--overall health care spending up \n$200 billion under this bill, according to the administration. The \nindependent Congressional Budget Office says Federal spending on health \ncare will increase by about $200 billion over the next 10 years. CBO \nalso says health insurance premiums for millions of Americans across \nthe country will go up 10 to 13 percent as a result of all the new \ngovernment mandates contained in this bill--and continue to rise at the \ncurrent unsustainable rate for nearly everyone else, despite more than \n$2 trillion in new government spending.\n  Another thing Americans are rightly concerned about is the debt. It \nis completely out of control. Some say this\n\n[[Page S1274]]\n\nbill lowers the debt, but let me remind my colleagues that the \nextenders bill we will be voting on today--the bill we will be voting \non today--will add more to the debt than even the White House claims \nits health spending bill will save. Let me say that again. The bill we \nare going to pass today, the extenders bill, will add more to the \ndebt--will add more to the debt--than even the White House claims its \nhealth spending bill will save.\n  So if cost is what you are concerned about, then you cannot vote for \nthis bill. It is that simple. Americans have it figured out, and that \nis why they are asking themselves why anyone in Congress would even \nthink about voting for this bill. This should not even be a tough call.\n  Let's start over and work together on a step-by-step solutions \nprocess that focuses on cost, that actually lowers costs, not the other \nway around. Let's put together a bill Americans will support.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1274-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1274]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I just heard the Republican leader talk \nabout the issue of health care in America and the goal which we heard \nso much about of getting the cost of care under control.\n  I have practiced medicine for 25 years in Casper, WY. I was in \nWyoming yesterday visiting with physicians, visiting with nurses, \nvisiting with those who are patients, as well as those who are \nproviders, and talking with them about what is happening in this \ncountry and in this body with the discussion about health care in \nAmerica and the legislation. No matter whom I talk with in Wyoming, \nwhen they look at this massive, 2,000-page bill and they think about it \nand then they ask questions about it, they say: How in the world is \nthis actually going to get the cost of care down? How is this going to \nhelp them save money? Because as they read it and as they look at the \nrules and the regulations and the new mandates for more bureaucracies--\nthey say it is going to be more government employees at a time when \nthere is 10 percent unemployment in the country--they say: It is going \nto likely cause my own cost of health care to go up, my own insurance \ncoverage to go up. They have great concerns that the quality of their \nown care will go down--go down. Americans, and certainly the people in \nWyoming, are very worried that if this bill becomes law, the cost of \ntheir care is going to go up and the quality and availability of their \ncare is going to go down. That is not what they want.\n  The President was speaking in Philadelphia yesterday. The front page \nof one of the papers this morning says: ``[The President] Turns Up the \nVolume in Bid for His Health Measure.'' And he said, as a challenge to \nDemocrats, ``If not us, who?''\n  Mr. President, it should be all of us. This should not be something \nthat is being rammed through the House and the Senate and force-fed to \nthe American people at a time when 75 percent of them want nothing to \ndo with this bill. Three out of four Americans say: Stop, we don't want \nthis, because they are worried about the cost of their own care and the \navailability and the quality of the care they are receiving.\n  So when the President gives his speeches, as he did yesterday, I \nwould say: Involve all of us. Involve all of us in the discussion, \nwhich is what we should have been doing for over a year.\n  I look at what he said in his speech, and he talked about an \ninsurance broker who apparently told some others there was so little \ncompetition--this is the President now talking, saying there is so \nlittle competition in insurance, that allows people to drive up the \ncost. The solution to that is the Republican solution that says: \nIncrease the competition, increase the competition. That is what we \nneed. Patients, people, citizens of this country want to be able to \nshop around, buy insurance across State lines, look for what is best \nfor them and best for their families. If we did that, if we did that \ntoday, there would be 12 million more Americans with insurance by \nmerely being allowed to have more competition, to be able to shop \nacross State lines and to look around for something that is best for \nthem and for their families--not the limited choices they may have in \nthe State in which they happen to live.\n  So I look at this from the standpoint of practicing medicine for 25 \nyears, visiting with patients, visiting with providers, talking with \nnurses, talking with doctors, saying there are things we can do to get \ndown the cost of care. Unfortunately, they are not included in this \n2,000-page bill that is now sitting over in the House, with all of \nthese different approaches to force this through in a way that \nundermines what the American people want, what the American people are \nasking for--the opinions of the American people--by a group of people \nin this body who say: We know better than the American people.\n  This body does not know better than the American people. The House \ndoes not know better than the American people. It is time to listen to \nthe American people, which is why I go home every weekend to visit with \nthose folks in my State, in my home State of Wyoming, to visit with \nthem about their needs, their concerns. And they have great concerns \nabout this bill.\n  It is not just people in my home communities. Warren Buffett, the \ngreat investor, says Washington should scrap this health care bill and \nstart over. He said they should focus, as our Republican leader said a \nfew minutes ago, on the costs. He said we should say we are going to \nfocus on the costs and not dream up 2,000 pages of other things. Warren \nBuffett says get rid of the nonsense, and this bill is loaded with \nnonsense. This bill is loaded with nonsense--nonsense that is going to \ndrive up the cost of care and decrease the quality of care in this \ncountry.\n  So we have now been going through this for a year. The President is \nout trying to make an appeal to the Nation to say: Yes, buy this \npackage I am trying to sell. The American people are too smart for \nthat. They realize this package cuts $500 billion from Medicare \npatients who depend on Medicare for their health care--$500 billion in \nMedicare cuts. Part of it is to hospitals and part of it is to a \nprogram called Medicare Advantage. There are 10 million Americans on \nMedicare Advantage. The reason they signed up for this, they choose \nthis, is because there is an advantage for them as seniors to \nparticipate in this program because this is a program that actually \nworks with preventive care, with coordinating care, things that regular \nMedicare does not do. They are going to cut over $100 billion from our \nnursing homes and money from home health, which is a lifeline for \npeople at home. They are going to cut money from hospice for people in \ntheir final days of life. That is part of this big bill the President \nis supporting and that he is asking the House to vote for. It is a bill \nthat raises taxes by another $500 billion. It is a bill the House is \ngoing to be asked to pass that includes every one of the sweetheart \ndeals because their first act in the House is going to have to be to \npass the bill the Senate passed on Christmas Eve and that includes all \nthe sweetheart deals, whether it is to Nebraska or Louisiana or \nFlorida. Thirteen different Senators had sweetheart deals put into that \nbill the Democrats are going to be asked to vote for because the \nRepublicans see through this whole thing.\n\n  So the opposition to this is bipartisan. It is bipartisan opposition. \nThose who support it is one party only.\n  We are looking now at a mandate where every American is going to be \nforced--forced--to buy a product, to buy insurance--forced under this--\nor they will either have to pay special taxes, have their wages \ngarnished or pay a fine or a penalty under this plan\n\n[[Page S1275]]\n\nthat the American people, three out of four, have absolutely rejected.\n  I see my colleague from Arizona has taken to the floor, and I would \nask him if he is hearing similar things when he goes home to Arizona to \nvisit with the people and what concerns he is hearing because there are \ncertainly many seniors in the fine State of Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague asking. There are \n330,000 seniors in the State of Arizona who rely on Medicare Advantage. \nIt is exactly as Dr. Barrasso said: Medicare Advantage is a program \nthat helps people with preventive care, with coordinated care, and with \nsome of the things that aren't available under regular care, including \nvision care, audio care, and the like. These benefits would be \ndrastically cut under the proposal in this legislation, so they are \nnaturally very much opposed to it. I think Arizona represents the \nsecond largest State in terms of the number of seniors participating in \nMedicare Advantage.\n  The other part of this that concerns them is the fact that if it is \nsuch a good idea to eliminate this program--or to drastically curtail \nit, to be perfectly accurate--then why is it that in one State the \nSenator was able to get his senior citizens who have Medicare Advantage \nprograms exempted from the bill? If it is such a wonderful idea, why \nshouldn't it apply to everybody? But the seniors in Florida would be \ngrandfathered in their Medicare Advantage plans because, of course, \nthey don't like these cuts any more than seniors in Arizona or Wyoming \nor any other State.\n  So this brings up the question: How can these provisions that are \nobjected to by the American people be fixed in the process that has now \nbeen settled upon, this so-called reconciliation process?\n  If I could address that for a moment. The author of this so-called \nreconciliation process is our esteemed colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom West Virginia, Robert Byrd. Here is what he had to say about using \nthe process he created, this reconciliation process, for the purposes \nof consideration of health care legislation. I quote him from the \nWashington Post, March 22, 2009:\n\n       I am certain that putting health care reform and climate \n     change legislation on a freight train through Congress is an \n     outrage that must be resisted.\n       Using the reconciliation process to enact major legislation \n     prevents an open debate about the critical issues in full \n     view of the public. Health reform and climate change are \n     issues that in one way or another touch every American \n     family. The resolution carries serious economic and emotional \n     consequences.\n       The misuse of the arcane process of reconciliation--a \n     process intended for deficit reduction--to enact substantive \n     policy changes is an undemocratic disservice to our people \n     and to the Senate's institutional role.\n\n  That is what Senator Byrd had to say. Yet that is the process that \nhas been selected by the Democratic leaders to force this legislation \nthrough the Congress.\n  The final point I wish to make with respect to this is I think, to \nsome extent, it may be a cruel hoax on some of our Democratic \ncolleagues in the House of Representatives who are counting on the \nSenate to back up the reconciliation bill that might be passed in the \nHouse of Representatives. What they are assuming is, when they attempt \nto fix the Senate bill they don't like very much by amending it through \nthis reconciliation process and then sending that bill over to the \nSenate, the Senate is simply going to pass the bill. Voila: The bad \nSenate bill has been fixed, the President can sign the reconciliation \nbill, and we will now have national health care reform.\n  Well, not so fast. As a matter of fact, the author of this \nreconciliation process also created what is known around here as the \nByrd rule, which means that if you go outside the narrow lanes of the \nreconciliation process and try to include things in the bill that don't \nbelong in the reconciliation process, then it is, of course, subject to \na point of order, as it should be, and it would take 60 Senators to \noverride that point of order.\n  Well, there are a lot of things that are going to be attempted to be \nfixed in the reconciliation bill that are subject to a point of order--\nthe Byrd rule. Those points of order will be upheld because I am going \nto predict to my colleagues that 41 Republican Senators are not going \nto allow that misuse of the reconciliation process--going outside what \nis clearly a reconciliation process--which means the bill that is \npassed in the House of Representatives, if it is, would not be passed \nby the Senate. Key provisions of it would have been stricken on points \nof order. Then, our friends in the House of Representatives would be \nfaced with the prospect that they had already passed this bad Senate \nbill they don't like very much--and that I don't like very much--but \nthe President can sign that into law. Yet the process by which they \nwould attempt to fix it has failed because of the points of order that \ncan be raised and that will be raised and that will be sustained, as \nshould be the case, under the application of the so-called Byrd rule.\n  So when my colleague from Wyoming talks about his constituents in \nWyoming objecting not only to the substance of the bill but also the \nprocess by which it has been handled, I can answer the question: Yes, I \nmet with a whole group of people from different States this weekend--\nfrom Pennsylvania, California, New Jersey, New York--I visited with \nfolks from literally all over the country, and they had the same \nobjections, both as to the substance of the legislation, but they were \nalso very curious about this reconciliation process because they had \nheard it could be used to ram the bill through by a process that it was \nnever intended for, and they wanted to talk about that. When we \nexplained the fact that the legislation adopted by the House--if it \nis--would not necessarily be adopted in the Senate but would be subject \nto these points of order--and, by the way, amendments, an unlimited \nnumber of amendments--then at least they understood why House Democrats \nwho will insist on amending the Senate bill should not rely on the \nSenate to do their bidding. That isn't going to happen.\n  Let me say one other thing before I turn it back over to my colleague \nfrom Wyoming. It has been such a learning experience for us and an \ninspiration to have a couple real physicians in the Senate. Our only \ntwo physicians here are Dr. Barrasso, an orthopedic surgeon from \nWyoming, and Dr. Tom Coburn, a physician from the State of Oklahoma, to \ntalk about the real world of treating patients and how there are ways \nthat care can be given in a less expensive way but retaining both the \nessential quality of care and that intangible but incredibly \nimportant--almost sacred--relationship between the doctor and the \npatient.\n  I see Dr. Coburn has joined us on the floor. It is key for the rest \nof us to understand how this process works when physicians sit down \nwith patients and determine the best course of action to preventive \ncare, that can both be the least expensive and yet still deliver the \nquality care that their patients deserve.\n  I think we ought to pay more attention to the advice they have \nprovided to us, and I commend both Senator Barrasso as well as Dr. \nCoburn for the advice they have given to us, and I hope we will \ncontinue to listen to that advice as this debate unfolds.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I would say to my colleague from \nArizona--and there is actually a Mayo Clinic in Arizona, as there is in \nFlorida and as there is in Rochester, MN, which is the home of the Mayo \nClinic--one would think, since the President early on talked so much \nabout the Mayo Clinic being a model for health care in the country, the \nMayo Clinic might agree with what the President had to say. But if you \ngo to the Mayo Clinic's blogs, they say:\n\n       The proposed legislation misses the opportunity--\n\n  We have an opportunity now--\n\n     to help create high-quality, more affordable health care for \n     patients. In fact, it will do the opposite.\n\n  So here you are. The proposed legislation misses the opportunity to \nhelp create higher quality, more affordable health care for patients. \nIn fact, it will do the opposite.\n  Mr. KYL. If my colleague would yield for a quick comment on that \npoint.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Absolutely.\n  Mr. KYL. The Mayo Clinic in Arizona, unfortunately, has had to \nannounce that in several of its key facilities there, it will no longer \naccept new Medicare patients. Why is that so? Because the government \nprogram of Medicare, which our seniors rely on, is getting to the point \nwhere it does not\n\n[[Page S1276]]\n\npay physicians what they require just to stay in business, just to have \ntheir office practice continue.\n  The Medicaid Program, which is the other government program, is \nalready so low in its reimbursements to physicians that--the numbers \ndiffer, but 50 to 60 percent of physicians are no longer taking \nMedicaid patients. As a result, these government programs end up \ngetting very close to rationing care because there aren't enough \nphysicians and facilities to take care of the people who are enrolled \nin the programs. Imposing yet another entitlement for even more people \nto have this care with fees regulated by the Federal Government and \nreimbursements at levels too low for physicians to take advantage of \nwill simply continue to drive physicians away from the treatment of the \npatients they have treated over the years and want to continue to \ntreat.\n\n  It would be our hope we could bring the incentive for physicians to \ncontinue to treat these patients, rather than the disincentives the \nMayo Clinic is pointing to in backing out of the treatment of folks in \nArizona.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, if the Senator will yield, one of the \nimportant points he made a moment ago is a doctor sitting down and \nlistening to their patient. Mayo has it right. If you are not going to \npay us enough to sit down, we refuse to practice medicine the way \nMedicare is directing us to practice: Listen a little bit and then \ncover it with tests.\n  The reason costs are out of control is because Medicare wouldn't pay \nfor a physician to sit down and truly listen and come to a centered \npoint on what the patient's problem is and the way to get around it. \nConsequently, what we have seen in the Medicare Program is doctors have \nto see so many patients that they don't get to listen to them and they \nconsequently cover that lack of listening by ordering more tests.\n  What do we know about tests? We know we order $\\1/4\\ trillion worth \nof tests every year that aren't needed. There are two reasons we are \nordering them. No. 1, the reimbursement to sit down to listen to the \npatient is so low the doctors can't afford to take the time to cover \nthe test; and No. 2 is the threat of tort litigation. So now we are \nordering tests not for patients, but we are ordering them for doctors. \nIf we want to change health care, we have to drive costs down. I am \nproud Mayo recognizes we are not going to sacrifice our quality, so, \ntherefore, we are saying: No, we are not going to take any more \nMedicare patients because we can't do it in a way that lends a quality \noutcome at an appropriate cost.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I remember sitting back in the cloakroom and \nlistening to Dr. Coburn when he was talking about how he treats \npatients who come into his office. A child, he said, comes in who has \nhad a fall on the playground and the parents, understandably, are very \nconcerned. Dr. Coburn said to me: If I just sit down and talk to that \nyoung man, that child, talk to his parents for a while, I can usually \nfigure out what kind of treatment is going to be necessary without \nnecessarily ordering a bunch of tests. But under the medical \nmalpractice situation we have to work under today, I am almost required \nto order those tests or, if something should go wrong, be accused of \nmalpractice. I wonder if my colleague could relay that story.\n  Mr. COBURN. Every summer, we have thousands of kids hit the ER, \nwhether they ran into a pole or they had a baseball bing them in the \nhead. The standard of care now is to put that child through a CT scan. \nThese are children the vast majority of whom have no neurologic signs \nwhatsoever. But now we are not only spending that $1,200 per child, we \nare exposing those children to radiation they don't need.\n  So there are two untoward events for what has happened as we see the \nhijacking of medicine by the trial bar. No. 1 is we spend a whole lot \nmore money unnecessarily, but No. 2 is we are actually now starting to \nhurt people by exposing them to radiation they don't need.\n  That is another cost. We know we can bring down costs if we change \nthe tort system in this country to one that is sensible and reasonable \nand still allows, when doctors make mistakes, for them to be \ncompensated for their economic damages and the harm that was caused to \nthem. No one is saying we should eliminate that. What we are saying is, \nit should be appropriate and in a venue that represents the real risks \nwithout disturbing the practice of medicine because we cannot afford \nit, and the children who are getting these tests, their bodies cannot \nafford it. It is just common sense that we would go that way.\n  I wonder if the Senator will yield for a moment before we lose our \ntime that I might discuss the amendment I am going to have up in a \nmoment.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I just inquire how much time remains on \nthe Republican side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 3 minutes 15 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to take that time, \nif I may.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1276-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1276-S1277]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           TAX EXTENDERS ACT\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we are going to have an amendment on the \nfloor in just a moment that simply requires the Senate to post every \ntime they create a new program and every time they spend money outside \nof pay-go so that we truly are transparent with the American people \nabout what we are doing.\n  With great fanfare, we passed pay-go. We made it a statute. The last \nthree bills in a row, we have allocated up to $120 billion outside of \npay-go. With all the claims, with all the fanfare, we said we are going \nto now start paying for everything we do, and the first three bills to \ncome before the Senate, what do we do? We simply say: Rules off; \ndoesn't count; we are going to spend our grandkids' money.\n  For the life of me, I do not understand the controversy around this \namendment. It is about us being transparent with the American people. \nNo more games. No more saying we are doing one thing and doing another. \nAll this amendment says is, when we violate our own rules and we spend \nmoney we do not have and we do not pay for programs by eliminating \nprograms that are not effective, that are not a priority, that we are \ngoing to list it on our Web site. Nothing could be simpler.\n  We have offered the Secretary of the Senate our staff to do that \nwork. It takes about 5 minutes a day to post that information and \nprobably 5 minutes every third or fourth day. We will happily pay for \nthat or we will offer one of our staff to put that information on the \ncomputer.\n  We are going to have a side-by-side amendment that does nothing. We \nunderstand that. That gives people a way to not vote for our amendment.\n  If we want to solve the problems in America and we want to solve our \nfinancial problems, the first thing we have to do is have real \ninformation about what this body is doing. This amendment will do that.\n  I yield back the remainder of our time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nmy amendment No. 3431 be in order when we return to H.R. 4213, with up \nto 10 minutes to speak regarding that amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I object on behalf of the managers who are \nnot present at this time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I still ask for up to 10 \nminutes to speak on behalf of this amendment, even though the action \nhas been heard and registered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator may speak.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. The amendment I rise today to speak on is \nstraightforward. It would provide an offset for all known emergency \nprovisions included in the bill, H.R. 4213. The amendment would direct \nthe Office of Management and Budget to rescind $35 billion in \nunobligated American Recovery and Reinvestment Act funds on a prorated \nbasis. The amendment would exclude military construction and veterans \naffairs stimulus funding from the rescission.\n  This rescission would offset all remaining nonemergency items in the\n\n[[Page S1277]]\n\nAmerican Workers, State, and Business Relief Act, which is H.R. 4213.\n  As a result of my amendment, all provisions in the bill would be paid \nfor minus the emergency extension of unemployment insurance and COBRA.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle just made the best case \nI have heard for this amendment. They raised concerns about the \nunderpayments for Medicare and Medicaid patients and patient care. In \nthis underlying bill, doctors would have their fees increased for \npayment purposes so the concerns that were raised by my colleague from \nArizona would be, in part, answered by the increased payments the Mayo \nClinic was not receiving and, therefore, made the decision to reduce \ntheir care to Medicare patients.\n  It seems to me it would be appropriate to support this bill. I \nsuspect they will not, but it would seem appropriate to support this \nbill then and also support having it paid for under pay-go rules \napplying to the unused stimulus funds that would be available through \nthis act.\n  If we are going to see that Medicare patients are treated and are not \nexcluded from treatment, it is going to be because the providers are \nadequately compensated. That is one of the provisions of this bill. \nWhat we are seeking to do is to make sure that is paid for, among other \nthings.\n  The Governors of the States have come to us and said they cannot \nafford to make their part of the Medicaid match that they are required \nto make under the Medicaid Program that is approved in virtually every \nState. As a result of that, a good portion of this bill is seeking \nmoney to pay the States, compensate them for that unfunded mandate that \nthe States are currently facing.\n  In other words, they come in and say: You forced us to do this. We \ndon't have the money to do it. We are asking that you make it good. You \npay for it.\n  The challenge is, if Medicaid is decreased or payments to providers \nare decreased, then the concerns they raised about the Medicaid Program \nunderfunding providers will be a self-fulfilling prophecy. It seems to \nme there is an opportunity for the other side to take a very positive \nlook at this particular bill.\n  I can look at it positively if we pay for it. My concerns are that we \npay for the nonemergency provisions within this bill, that we pay for \nthe FMAP fix, that we pay for the other parts of this bill minus the \nemergency extension of unemployment insurance and COBRA. That would \nmake us consistent with the pay-go rules we forced upon ourselves--I \nthink appropriately so. But it is important that we follow the rules we \nset for ourselves. This is one of the ways we do it--by paying for \nthese nonemergency items in the underlying bill.\n  That is my argument. That is why I have offered this legislation. I \nthink it is unfortunate the other side has chosen to object to it, but \nthey have and that is it. The amendment will fail unless the other side \nfinds that it makes sense to simply begin to pay for things. I thought \nthe other side was interested in seeing that these requirements are \npaid for, particularly when they make such a strong case for the \npayment to physicians for Medicare and Medicaid patients. That does not \nseem to be the case.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I know you and I and others in this \nChamber are focused like a laser beam on getting this economy turned \naround. Although we see some promising signs--for example, in my State \nof California it turns out that last month 32,000 new jobs were \ncreated--we still are not moving quickly enough on the jobs front. That \nis why I am particularly pleased that Leader Reid is focused on jobs, \njobs, jobs, and we are going to finish, hopefully, the bill that is \nbefore us which is very critical to jobs.\n  Then we are going to move on to the FAA reauthorization--the Federal \nAviation Administration reauthorization--which is going to create \n160,000 new jobs as we modernize our Nation's airports. After that, we \nare going to stop for a brief moment and take up the HIRE Act that we \npassed over here, and it has been passed in the House with a couple of \npay-go changes. That will extend the highway trust fund until the end \nof this year and will save 1 million jobs.\n  Mr. President, we can't play politics with the highway trust fund. \nThe Nation needs us to build our highways, our bridges, and our roads. \nSo we are doing the right thing.\n  There is one piece of unfinished business that is directly related to \nour economy. There is no question that health care is directly related \nto our economy, and we need to fix a health care system that is broken.\n  Now, I have listened to my Republican friends on this for a very long \ntime, and they have a message for the American people. I would like to \ndistill that message.\n  That message is, when it comes to health care reform, when it comes \nto fixing the health care system, be afraid. Be very afraid.\n  Mr. President, that is not the American way. When there is a \nchallenge in front of us, we act. We don't cower in the corner in fear. \nI think it is important to note that if one were to be afraid, it \nshould not be of fixing the system--which, in our mind, means if you \nlike your health insurance, you can keep it, and we are going to make \nsure that it is affordable and that more people can obtain it. If there \nis one thing to be fearful of, it is doing nothing. It is the status \nquo.\n  Let me explain why. Every day in America 14,000 people lose their \nhealth insurance. That could be any one of us, for any of a number of \nreasons. We might lose our job, or our spouse might lose their job, and \nthat means we can't have health insurance anymore.\n  An insurance company can rescind your policy. They can walk away and \nsay: Oh, by the way, 10 years ago when you signed up, you didn't \nmention that you had one blood test that was a little awry and, \ntherefore, we are walking away from you.\n  You may have a cap on your policy and reach that cap, because you \ndidn't read the fine print and so you are out; it is over. Any one of \nus could be one of the 14,000 people who loses their health insurance.\n  Now, that would not happen in the Senate. Oh no. Every one of my \ncolleagues is protected because we have a system that, yes, is a public \noption, where the rules are made by the Federal Employees Health \nBenefits Program and people can't mistreat us. But for some reason, my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle don't seem to believe it is \nfair to give that kind of protection to ordinary families, so they are \nscaring people to death.\n  So let me say again: If there is anything to be afraid of, it is \ndoing nothing because you could be one of the 14,000 people--in my \nState about 1,400--who every day lose their insurance. Or, Mr. \nPresident, you could be one of the people who goes bankrupt because of \na health care crisis. Sixty-two percent of bankruptcies in America \ntoday are directly linked to a health care crisis and most of those \npeople have insurance. I repeat: Most of those people have insurance.\n  I read a little story--I don't know if it is true--that Sarah Palin, \nthe former Republican Vice Presidential nominee, said when she was \nyoung her family went to Canada to get their health care. I don't know \nif it is true, but I find it interesting if it is true. But here is the \npoint: Doing nothing is not an option.\n  Let me tell you what is happening. In California, a company--Anthem \nInsurance--has increased rates in the individual market by--hold on to \nyour hat--29 percent. Imagine, 29 percent in one clip. This leads me to \na study that was done by a nonpartisan group. That study showed what \nhappens if we do nothing--which is, in fact, my Republican friends' \nidea because they say start over. Well, we started this under Teddy \nRoosevelt. It is time we acted. But this nonpartisan group said if we \ndo nothing, the average cost of insurance would be 45 percent of a \nfamily's income by 2016. Imagine that. Yet my colleagues on the other \nside say: Well, if you go with the President's bill and the Democrats' \nbill, insurance rates will go up.\n  The fact is, rates would not go up as much if you have the same \npolicy. If you have a better policy, they may go up a little over time, \nbut they are never going to be--never, never, never--45 percent of your \nincome. There are two reasons for that: No. 1, we are going to watch \ninsurance companies like a hawk, and that is the right thing to do. \nThey are not selling us something that is a luxury. They are selling us \na product that is a matter of life or death, and we ought to look over \ntheir shoulder a little more to make sure they are fair. So that is one \nreason.\n  The other reason is, we are going to help people--the middle class--\nfamilies making up to $88,000 a year. We are going to make sure you get \ntax credits to help you pay for your premiums. That is a big deal. That \nis a good thing.\n\n[[Page S1284]]\n\n  So, remember, when the Republicans say: Be very afraid, don't be very \nafraid of reform, be very afraid of doing nothing. That is a reason to \nbe very afraid.\n  Then my Republican friends will say: They didn't take any of our \nideas. Well, it turns out when the bill was being written in the \nSenate, well over 100 amendments--I think it was 160 amendments--of the \nRepublicans were incorporated into the work of the HELP Committee. Oh, \nthat is not good enough for them. We took 160 of their ideas, why can't \nthey take an equal amount of our ideas? Why can't we work together, \ncome to the table across party lines? It doesn't work that way.\n  Then the President had them up for, I thought, a very instructive \nmeeting, and the President took three or four more very big ideas of \nthe Republicans--dealing with HSAs, dealing with medical malpractice, \ndealing with selling insurance across State lines, and a couple of \nother things. Yet they still say: It is not enough.\n  Then they say: Be very afraid, people. Be very afraid because the \nSenate might do this with a majority vote. Well, I would suggest that \nall of us are here because we won a majority vote. I don't hear any of \nmy colleagues suggesting we need 60 percent of the vote to win. We are \nhere.\n  I support minority rights very strongly, but there is a point where \nsomething turns and it becomes obstruction. I can't look into the faces \nof any of my constituents who are having all of these problems and tell \nthem: I am sorry, I couldn't do anything even though we had a majority \nin the Senate.\n  So they are scaring people about using a procedure they have used \nover the years. Out of 22 times, they have used the reconciliation \nprocedure requiring a majority vote 16 times. I need to say that again. \nMy Republican friends, who abhor the use of a majority rule, used it 16 \ntimes out of the 22 times it was used, and mostly it was used for \nhealth care.\n  Then they say: Oh, no; when we used it, it was for much smaller \nthings. Well, no, I checked it out. The whole Reagan revolution was \ndone by reconciliation--all the Bush tax cuts, health care and all. So \nthe very slippery slope of their argument, whatever the argument of the \nday is, at the end of the day it is about scaring people. It is all \nabout scaring people.\n  So I am going to close with this. I am going to talk about the 8 or \n10 things that happened within 6 months to a year that this bill was \nsigned into law--real things. For all new policies, you can keep your \nchild on your policy until he or she is 27 years of age--27 years of \nage. I know a lot of people whose kids have been thrown off \ntheir policy. They may have had asthma, for example, and the insurance \ncompany says they have a preexisting condition and so they can get no \ninsurance. We fix that in this bill.\n\n  If you have a preexisting condition and you are an adult, and you \ncan't get insurance, you can join a high-risk pool and get insurance \nvery soon--within 90 days. If you run a small business that is \nstruggling to find affordable health insurance, or you are self-\nemployed--and I have spoken to so many people in that situation in \nCalifornia--there will be many billions of dollars for small business \nand self-employed people in tax credits to help them get insurance.\n  The President has also proposed increasing funding for community \nhealth centers by $11 billion so they can provide affordable, high-\nquality care to even more families in need.\n  There will be no preexisting conditions for children. If you have a \nchild who has a preexisting condition, they still can get insured. I \nthink about the story Harry Reid told about the couple who had full \ninsurance, and the woman gave birth to a baby and the baby had a cleft \npalate. The couple was distraught, but the doctor said: Don't worry. We \ncan fix that baby right up and no one is going to know there was a \nproblem.\n  So they wrote to their insurance company. You know what their \ninsurance company said, even though they gave full coverage to that \npregnant woman. They said: Your baby has a preexisting condition. You \nare out of luck.\n  Mr. President, that is morally reprehensible. So if you want to be \nscared about something--and I don't believe in being scared about \nanything--be scared about the status quo. Be scared about what your \ninsurers could do to you in today's world.\n  What else will happen with this bill? Well, prevention is pretty much \nfree. As soon as this bill is signed into law, you get to go to your \ndoctor and get preventive treatment pretty much for free.\n  If you are a senior and you are on a prescription drug plan, we are \ngoing to close that gap--that payment gap where you get to a certain \nlevel and then your insurance company stops paying until you reach yet \nanother level. This creates the situation where at the time you need \nyour medicine the most, it is not there for you. We are going to close \nthat doughnut hole. By the way, that impacts 794,000 Californians. The \nPresident wants to give about $250 to help our seniors who fall into \nthat doughnut hole right away.\n  Also, there will be insurance reform. The minute this bill is signed \ninto law, an insurance company must use 80 percent of their income on \nyou--on the people who have insurance--not on them, not putting it in \ntheir pockets, not on these outrageous bonuses and paying their people \nmillions of dollars. So 80 to 85 percent will have to go into the \nbusiness of helping their people by expanding coverage or lowering \npremiums.\n  There are a couple more things that will kick in--no more caps on new \nplans. I remember my husband and I once had a plan that had a cap. We \ndidn't even know it, but somebody warned us and we realized it was a \nbad plan and there was a cap. I forget the amount, but it wasn't that \nhigh.\n  Also, you will be protected from your insurance company walking away \nfrom you. No more rescissions in all new plans. There are other \nbenefits to retirees. In 2014, we will have these exchanges, and you \nwill be able to shop for the best insurance in an exchange online. It \nwill be very clear.\n  So we are moving in the right direction, Mr. President. At the end of \nthe day, by the way, this bill saves money. Not only is it deficit \nneutral, it helps the deficit. Why? Because we take the fraud, waste, \nand abuse out of the system.\n  My message to the people of this great country is, don't listen to \nthe fear mongering. Learn the facts. Understand how life will be better \nif we move forward with this reform--but not in 3 years, right away. I \nthink if we do that, and we realize we are going to do it in a way that \nactually reduces the deficit, there should be strong support for this \nbill.\n  I hope we will be able to get to that day as we focus on getting this \ncountry on track: jobs, jobs, jobs. We also fix this problem of \nunaffordable health care, tenuous health care. It has to become \nsomething we can count on.\n  I yield the floor and suggest absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico).

The first amendment is a simple attempt to improve the \navailability of budgetary information on what Congress does. This \namendment would require the Secretary of the Senate to create a new Web \nsite that clearly provides information from the Congressional Budget \nOffice on the legislative actions of the Senate. This is a side-by-side \namendment to the Coburn amendment on the same subject.\n  I believe Senator Coburn has the same purpose in mind, but we have \ndrafted this side-by-side amendment to avoid new burdens on the \nCongressional Budget Office. The Rules Committee and Budget Committee \nworked together with us on the drafting of this amendment to assure \nthat it would work.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The question is on agreeing to the Coburn \namendment No. 3358. There is 4 minutes, evenly divided, before the \nvote. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, we just voice voted an amendment that will \nnot do anything. What this amendment says is, where we violate our own \nrules in terms of pay-go, we will actually publish both the number of \ntimes and the amount of dollars we do that. It is about transparency of \nthe Senate, being honest with the American people.\n  With great fanfare, the Senator from Montana came down and we put \ninto law a pay-go law. Since that time, including this bill, we will \nhave passed $120 billion of debt to our kids by saying we waive pay-go.\n  That is OK. That is the right of the body to do that. But it is not \nOK not to let the American people know that and let them keep track of \nus.\n  This amendment is very simple. Anytime we create a new program, \nanytime we pass and violate the pay-go rules by overriding the pay-go \npoint of order, then we should list that with the American people so \nthey can see what we are doing. It is quite simple, quite \nstraightforward. It doesn't require any time. You will spend forever \ngoing to the Congressional Budget Office to find this. This makes it \nvery simple, very straightforward.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I think we can vote on this. I yield the \nremainder of my time, but before I do, I think it is a step toward \ntransparency, and I urge all my colleagues to vote for it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I ask unanimous consent to use 1 minute and for Senator \nKerry to have the second minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I am offering the youth summer jobs \namendment to build on the extremely successful summer jobs program that \nmade it possible for over 313,000 young people to have a job. I have \npersonally heard amazing stories from these young men and women who got \na job. It changed their lives and gave them the experience they needed.\n  This amendment will provide $1.3 billion to create up to 500,000 \ntemporary jobs this coming summer. It will invest in critical \nemployment and learning programs that will help not only these young \npeople but the businesses that hire them. The underlying bill is going \nto help millions of families across the country who need a job. This \namendment will make sure young people get a start in their professional \nlives, firmly planted on their feet and moving toward success.\n\n[[Page S1286]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I thank Senator Murray for her work on this \namendment.\n  Today, almost 15 million Americans are unemployed, 9 million can only \nfind part-time work, and 25 percent of our Nation's teenagers and 42 \npercent of African-American teenagers are unemployed. Both the TANF \nEmergency Fund and the summer jobs program provide desperately needed \njobs to our Nation's families who are the most vulnerable to our \neconomic downturn. According to the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, extending the TANF Emergency Fund will save more than \n100,000 jobs. And providing up to $1.3 billion in funding for the \nsummer jobs program will create 500,000 summer jobs.\n  I promise my colleagues, provide these summer jobs, and it will save \nfar more than that money in the criminal justice system and in other \nsocial services. This is money well invested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, why do we keep doing this? Why do we keep \npassing debt on to our children? Why do we keep running program after \nprogram out here that is shrouded in sweetness and light but not paid \nfor?\n  We just passed a pay-go point of order 4 weeks ago to great fanfare, \ngreat breast-beating about how fiscally responsible we were going to \nbe. Yet time after time since we passed that pay-go point of order, \namendments have been brought to the floor which violate it. This is \nanother one. This amendment costs $2 billion which is not paid for.\n  Summer jobs may be good. I am sure they are. But why do we want to \nput the debt for those summer jobs onto the children of the people who \nare having the summer jobs?\n  If this is a priority--and it is--let's pay for it. Let's take the \nmoney out of some other account. But let's not add to the debt, and \nlet's not once again violate the pay-go rules which this Senate has so \nloudly proclaimed is the manner in which we will discipline ourselves \nfiscally. It is a $2 billion item. If we can't stand by pay-go for $2 \nbillion, we are making a farce out of it.\n  As a result of this violation of pay-go, I raise a point of order \nagainst the amendment pursuant to section 201(a) of S. Res. 21, the \nconcurrent resolution on the budget for fiscal year 2008.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. How much time does the Senator from Washington have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has consumed her time.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, let me be clear: Working with the Finance \nCommittee, this amendment is paid for over 10 years.\n  I ask that the budget point of order be waived.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, is this a pay-go point of order violation?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I move that the budget point of order be waived and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there was an article in last Thursday's \nChicago Tribune, my hometown newspaper, that caught my attention. It is \nshocking news for many of my fellow Illinoisans. I would like to share \nit with my colleagues today.\n  According to State records, Illinoisans who lose their jobs and have \nto buy their own health insurance will see their premiums increase by \nas much as 60 percent this year. As the Tribune notes, this is \naffecting more people than ever before because of the economic crisis.\n  There are currently more than one-half million consumers in Illinois \nwho have individual health plans. Their base rates, which stand at 8.5 \npercent at the moment, will jump to more than 60 percent. Those are \njust the base rates. Elderly folks will likely see additional increases \non top of that. So will those who have a history of illness. So will \npeople who live in certain areas or who have only had a policy for a \nshort period of time.\n  Insurance companies will pile on additional increases for all these \nfolks, on top of a 60-percent increase that will affect every \nIllinoisan with an individual health plan.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that these are mostly folks who have lost \ntheir employment, so they do not have a steady stream of income to \nabsorb these increases, and they do not have a choice but to pay \nwhatever the insurance companies demand or go without the coverage they \nneed.\n  This is bad news by itself, but it gets worse because they are not \nthe only ones who will see their premiums go up. Small businesses are \nfinding it harder than ever to afford coverage for their employees \nbecause they are being hit with big rate hikes even though business is \nnot as good as it was a few years ago.\n  Companies, such as Illinois Blue Cross, have even acknowledged they \nwill be increasing their rates by an average of 10 percent across the \nboard and much more for some of their customers.\n  We have seen this kind of thing before. Just recently in California, \na health insurance company raised its rates by 39 percent, a move that \nsparked national outrage and investigations by State and Federal \nregulators.\n  When we hear about this kind of behavior, there is an obvious \nquestion for us to ask, the same question that many folks in Illinois \nwill be asking when they get their insurance bills over the next few \nmonths. That question is why. Why are insurance companies raising rates \nby as much as 60 percent? Why does it keep getting harder and harder to \npay for health coverage when benefits are being slashed at the same \ntime? It does not make any sense.\n  But when Illinoisans pick up their phones and they call their \ninsurance providers and they ask them why, they probably will not be \nable to get an answer. Most insurance companies do not release that \ninformation and do not\n\n[[Page S1287]]\n\nfeel they have an obligation to explain the outrageous rate hikes. \nOrdinary Americans do not have a way of finding out.\n  That is exactly why we need to pass comprehensive health care reform \nwithout delay to restore competition to the insurance industry so folks \ncan shop around and try to get a fair deal, to help us hold insurance \ncompanies accountable so we can keep them honest, and to provide cost \nsavings so hard-working Americans and small businesses can breathe a \nlittle easier in these difficult times.\n  The Senate health reform bill would have accomplished all these \nthings and more. If we had combined our bill with the House version at \nthe end of last year and sent it to President Obama, we would have had \na law on the books by now. We would almost certainly not be seeing \nthese dramatic premium increases. Instead, people's premiums would be \ngoing down significantly, and 3l million more Americans would have \nhealth care coverage.\n  This Chicago Tribune article would have read very differently if we \nhad finished this health care bill a few months ago, as we easily \nshould have done. But because of our inaction in Washington, because of \ndelays and the obstructionism, these companies continue to have free \nrein.\n  As we struggle to find common ground between the House and the \nSenate, we must never forget the American people are locked in a much \nmore serious struggle.\n  We have experienced the worst economic crisis since the Great \nDepression. The unemployment rate exceeds 10 percent in Illinois, and \nit stands just under 10 percent nationwide. Millions have watched \nhelplessly as their hard-earned economic security vanished overnight. \nIndividuals and families are finding it harder than ever to make ends \nmeet. One of the greatest challenges they face is paying for health \ninsurance.\n  Under the current system, too many people are forced to choose \nbetween keeping food on the table and buying health coverage. It is a \nterrible choice. Premiums are so high it is almost impossible to afford \nquality coverage. As the Chicago Tribune reported, they are about to \nget even higher, but without insurance we are all just one accident or \ncatastrophic illness away from bankruptcy or even death.\n  It is time to turn our attention away from the partisan fight that \nconsumes Washington every day and focus on the fight that is taking \nplace in America's heartland.\n  My colleagues and I must never forget why we entered public service \nin the first place. Why are we here? What is our purpose? We must \nalways remember our actions and our failures to take action have real \nconsequences for ordinary people from coast to coast.\n  This legislation was stalled and delayed for the better part of a \nyear. As a result of this obstructionism, we are about to see premiums \ngo up by 60 percent instead of going down.\n  If my Republican friends had come to the table and acted in the \nspirit of compromise and listened to the will of the American people, \nwe would have passed health care reform and a dozen other things by \nnow. But instead, it is the same old politics. It is easy to find \nexcuses. It is very difficult to govern.\n  Once again, I invite my colleagues across the aisle to join us in \nthese efforts, come to the negotiating table. You heard President Obama \nspeak yesterday very vividly and forthrightly about what we need to do \nto bring health care reform to the American people. We have a fresh \nsense of momentum, a new opportunity to deliver on this promise of \nreform.\n  Let's keep having this conversation. Let's confront these challenges \ntogether as the American people have asked us to do. Let's move forward \nas one Congress, as one Nation. It is time for Republicans and \nDemocrats to say enough is enough to big insurance: No more outrageous \nrate hikes; no more coverage denials; no more abuse.\n  It is time for Republicans and Democrats to reaffirm our commitment \nto the hard-working people we represent in Illinois and across the \ncountry. It is time to pass comprehensive health reform so every \nAmerican can get a great deal on health insurance and foreclose the \npossibility of losing their life or their assets.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of a proposal \nthat has been offered on this bill that we are currently dealing with \nthat will hold the bailed-out Wall Street companies and their \nexecutives more accountable to American taxpayers.\n  Over the last 2 years, the top TARP recipients have paid out tens of \nbillions of dollars in employee bonuses, while at the same time \ntaxpayers have been footing the bill for bailing out these large \nfinancial institutions.\n  Enough is enough. All we have to do is look across this great land of \nours to see so many people in businesses--small businesses in small \ncommunities across America--who are in difficult times. This \namendment--the Taxpayer Fairness Act--included in the Senate jobs bill \nwould put in place a one-time windfall tax on bonuses paid in 2010 to \ncompany executives who received the taxpayer bailout.\n  Specifically, the amendment provides a 50-percent tax on bonuses \nabove $400,000 paid to financial institution executives who received at \nleast $5 billion in taxpayer support. That is just common sense to all \nof us here who realize how important it is to be respectful of the \ntaxpayers and make sure that as we have made available these resources \nto these Wall Street industries, to at least have the acknowledgment \nand respect from them of what the rest of America is going through.\n  I have fought for years to hold Wall Street more accountable. During \nthe TARP debate in the fall of 2008, I pushed for stricter limits on \nexecutive compensation, which went unheeded in the Bush Treasury \nDepartment's implementation of the program. Later that year, I also \ncosponsored legislation that would have capped executives' salaries at \nbailed-out banks. In March of 2009, I sent a letter to the AIG chairman \ncalling on his executives to forfeit their $165 million in bonuses or \nface unprecedented congressional action to strip them of their so-\ncalled ``performance-based'' rewards.\n  During the debate on the Recovery Act, in early 2009, the Senate \npassed my amendment to place an excise tax on bonuses from financial \ninstitutions that had received taxpayer dollars under TARP. Wall Street \nneeds to understand that in these extraordinary times they must change \ntheir ways of doing business. They must play by the same rules that \nArkansas families and businesses and other small towns and States \nacross the Nation have to play by.\n  When a small business owner in our home State of Arkansas has a bad \nyear, they have two options: They either buckle down and trim the fat \nor they go out of business. They do not come to the steps of the \nCapitol and ask for a government check, and they surely do not give \nthemselves a lavish pay raise.\n  Arkansans are rightly irritated, just as I am. Let's not forget the \nactions of some of these firms are what sent our economy into dire \nstraits in the very beginning. For almost 2 years now, Americans have \npaid the price for Wall Street's mistakes. They have lost jobs, they \nhave seen their property values diminish, and they have seen their \nretirement savings depleted. So it flies in the face of common sense \nand general prudence for those accountable to reward themselves when \nthe rest of the country is shouldering the burden they created.\n  This amendment must be enacted to send the message to Wall Street \nthat we will not stand for such behavior. The time is right now, and we \nmust send the message to all of America that we are not going to stand \nfor this type of fiscal irresponsibility. I encourage my colleagues to \nstand with Main Street, not Wall Street, and support this important \namendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3336\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, shortly we will vote on the motion to \ninvoke cloture on this urgent legislation to create jobs and extend \nvital safety net and tax provisions. We have had a good debate. The \nSenate considered this bill on 7 separate days over the course of 2 \nworkweeks. We have considered more than 30 amendments. We conducted a \ndozen rollcall votes. It is now time to bring this debate to a close.\n  This is not just some technical bill; this measure helps real people. \nFailure to enact this bill would cause real hardship. Failure to enact \nthis bill would cost jobs.\n  Within weeks, this bill would help half a million workers who lose \ntheir jobs nationwide, including nearly 1,600 in my State of Montana, \nto remain eligible for help paying for their health insurance under the \nCOBRA health insurance program. Unless we act, within weeks the average \ndoctor in America will stand to lose more than $16,600 in payments from \nMedicare. The average doctor in Montana would lose $13,000. This bill \nwould help nearly 40 million Medicare beneficiaries and nearly 9 \nmillion TRICARE beneficiaries nationwide to continue to have access to \ntheir doctors. That includes nearly 144,000 Montanans with Medicare and \nnearly 33,000 Montanans with TRICARE. Within weeks, this bill would \nhelp 400,000 Americans to be eligible for expanded unemployment \ninsurance benefits. Thus, this important legislation would prevent \nmillions of Americans from falling through the safety net. It would \nextend vital programs we have only temporarily extended. It would put \ncash into the hands of Americans who would spend it quickly, boosting \nthe economy. It would extend critical programs and tax incentives that \ncreate jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to help Americans hurt by this great \ndepression. I urge my colleagues to vote to preserve and create jobs. I \nurge my colleagues to vote to invoke cloture on the substitute \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe tax extenders bill. I do so with a heavy heart because there are \ngood things in this bill that would be good for my State of Florida. It \nwould be good to extend unemployment benefits. It would be good to \nextend COBRA, it would be good to extend and help with Medicaid \nfunding, and it is important to make sure we have enough money going to \ndoctors in Medicare so that they can provide services. But I can no \nlonger stand by, even on a bill such as this, and vote for it when it \nis going to add $100 billion to our deficit.\n  If the majority party in this Chamber did the right thing and paid \nfor this bill, if we cut wasteful spending, if we cut duplicate \nprograms in other areas and paid for this bill, 80 or 90 Senators would \nvote for it. But at some point, even though these programs may be good \nfor your State, a Senator has an obligation to stand up and say: No \nmore, no more spending our kids' future, no more putting debt on the \nnext generation, no more bankrupting the promise of this country.\n  No more. We cannot afford it. We have a $12.4 trillion debt. We are \nsupposed to have pay-as-you-go rules here. One month ago, we passed a \npay-as-you-go law. The President signed it. And all of the language was \nlaudatory: We are not going to spend our children's money anymore. We \nare going to be fiscally responsible. And then here comes this bill, \n$100 billion in spending, and we declare it an emergency so that we do \nnot have to follow the rules. It occurred to me this weekend as I \nplayed with my 6- and 4-year-old sons that this is not pay-go, it is \nPlay Doh--you can make whatever you want of it. But it is not real \nenforcement.\n  We in this chamber should pay for the spending so that we do not \nincrease the debt on our children. So we should vote against cloture on \nthis bill, not because the leadership has not allowed us to have \namendments--they have, and I appreciate that. But we should vote \nagainst it because this bill should only pass if we can pay for it.\n  No matter how good the program is, it is not good if we saddle our \nchildren with $100 billion more in debt. The public debt in this \ncountry is going to double in 5 years and triple in 10. It is has now \ncome out that the estimate of the national debt in 2020 will add \nanother $10 trillion. The day of reckoning is at hand, and we just \ncannot stand by, even though there are good things in this bill, things \nthat would help my State. On this occasion, I have to put country \nfirst.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Massachusetts. Mr. President, we have a vote coming on \ncloture on a matter that has been moving through the Senate, the tax \nextenders bill. I wish to make clear that I will be voting for cloture. \nThat does not mean I will support the actual legislation when it comes \nto a vote. That being said, I have serious concerns about the overall \ncost of the bill, but my vote for cloture signals my belief that we \nneed to keep the process moving and allow the measure to be considered \nby the full Senate. I promised my constituents I would try to change \nthe tone of politics as usual in Washington. There has been a week of \ndebate. Allowing this bill to receive an up-or-down vote would be a \nstep in the right direction.\n  However, I am opposed to the bill at this point because it adds more \nthan $100 billion to our national debt and provides no way to actually \npay for it. Our national debt is at a record high, and we cannot \ncontinue to burden future generations with a mountain of debt and bills \nthey cannot pay.\n  I believe in process. I believe we should have an opportunity, after \nfull and fair debate, to move bills forward so the House and others can \nget a crack at it and hopefully send back a product with which we can \nall live.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to thank the leader for his \ncourtesy and for his help on this legislation. In particular, I wish to \nthank Chairman Baucus and his staff and Senator Grassley and his staff, \nas well as my staff, Ed Egee in particular, who did a great job of \naddressing the pension problems in this country.\n  This amendment gives corporations two alternatives to accept, adopt, \nand smooth their obligation on pensions. It will raise $3.5 billion \nagainst the debt. It will save the pensions of many Americans.\n  I wish to acknowledge the leadership of Senator Baucus from Montana, \nSenator Grassley, and their staffs for helping us accomplish it.\n  Also, let me thank my friend and colleague, Senator Cardin from \nMaryland, for his good work and cooperation on this issue. Senator \nCardin has long been a leader on retirement issues. I recall in the \nHouse supporting a landmark retirement bill that bore his name: the \nPortman-Cardin Pension Reform Act of 2001.\n  Almost 4 years ago, I was proud to support the Pension Protection Act \nof 2006. That piece of legislation adopted a stringent new funding \nregime for single employer defined benefit pension plans. It raised the \nfull funding target to 100 percent, based the sponsor's contribution \nrequirements on the funded status of the plan, encouraged pre-funding \nof pension funds through the recognition of credit balances, and \nincluded much-needed smoothing of both assets and liabilities.\n  All of these were positive changes. Unfortunately, just as the \nPension Protection Act's stringent funding requirements began to be \nimplemented, the assets of most pension funds were depleted by the \neconomic recession.\n  The gravity of the situation was reflected in a recent Mercer study \nof over 800 companies. Mercer found that required cash contributions to \npension plans will be more than 400 percent higher in 2010 than in \n2009.\n  Over the last year, dozens of employers who sponsor defined benefit \nplans have come to me and to many Members of this body asking for \nrelief from the stringent funding rules of the Pension Protection Act. \nThey hope to avoid severe cost-cutting measures. A May 2009 survey \nindicated that the overwhelming majority of DB plan sponsors--68 \npercent--will have to cut other expenses, including jobs, in order to \nmake required pension contributions.\n  Even if the market were to come soaring back tomorrow, this relief \nwould still be appropriate. A February 2010 study by Towers Watson \nfound that even if equities rise by 20 percent\n\n[[Page S1292]]\n\nin 2010 and projected interest rates increase by a full percentage \npoint, total 2011 funding obligations would still be approximately \ntriple the level of 2009 funding obligations.\n  Given the scope of the situation, there is broad agreement that the \nSenate must act. As such, Senators Baucus and Grassley included \ntargeted funding relief in this tax package.\n  Our amendment makes small but important changes to the underlying \nlanguage, mostly affecting the application of the ``cash flow rule.'' \nGenerally speaking, the cash flow rule forces employers to make \nadditional contributions to their plan above the amount they would \nnormally owe.\n  Fe do not oppose the inclusion of the cash flow rule in the relief \npackage. We agree that that is an appropriate stick in exchange for the \ncarrot of relief.\n  However, the stick can last up to 7 years while the relief is only \navailable for 2 years. Accordingly, we are urging this Senate to limit \nthese restrictive conditions on the funding relief that we are offering \nto employers in this amendment.\n  Sponsors would continue to receive 2 years of relief from the onerous \nfunding obligations imposed by the Pension Protection Act. However, our \namendment applies the cash flow rule for 3 years for the 2 plus 7 \noption and 5 years for the 15 year option--as opposed to 4 and 7 years, \nrespectively.\n  Our goal here is to achieve a balance. We want to ensure the \nviability of the pension security system by ensuring that the plans are \nfully funded. At the same time, we want to make the relief usable to \nemployers so they will be incentivized to continue their defined \nbenefit pension programs.\n  I continue to support efforts to protect taxpayers by strongly \nopposing any attempts to break down the wall between the Pension \nBenefit Guaranty Corporation and general Treasury funds.\n  I thank Senators Grassley and Baucus for accepting our amendment and \nthank the staff for their work on the amendment. Cathy Koch and Tom \nReeder with Senator Baucus; Chris Condeluci with Senator Grassley; \nDebra Forbes with Senator Harkin; Greg Dean with Senator Enzi; Femeia \nAdamson with Senator Cardin; and Ed Egee with my staff.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, there was debate this morning and a lot of \ntalk outside the Chamber regarding the TANF summer jobs program. The \nobjection of a number of Senators raised was that it was paid for over \n10 years rather than 5 years. In an effort to compromise this, Senators \nMurray and Kerry agreed that we would drop anything relating to TANF in \nthis amendment and over 5 years pay for summer jobs in the amount of \n$743 million. As everyone will remember, it was originally $1.5 \nbillion. So this would be lowered to $743 million. It is paid for over \n5 years. TANF is not included in any of this, much to the consternation \nof a lot of us.\n  I ask unanimous consent that amendment be allowed and that we have \nanother vote on it, if necessary.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. GREGG. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. I failed to mention this does not violate pay-go.\n  Mr. GREGG.

Some know it as the DC \nschool voucher program. We are offering our amendment to this \nlegislation because without prompt action by Congress, the OSP, I am \nafraid, will end. The current administrator has advised Secretary \nDuncan that it will no longer\n\n[[Page S1293]]\n\nadminister the program absent a reauthorization, and no other entity \nhas expressed the willingness to take over, given the constraints \nimposed by Congress under the prevailing set of circumstances. Despite \nthe President's stated intent in his budget to continue the program, if \nonly for those students currently participating, even that will become \nimpossible.\n  This amendment, as I will explain in a moment, will reauthorize this \nprogram for 5 years at essentially its current levels. As I will \nexplain in a moment, it is working, and it is immensely popular with \nfamilies of children and failing schools in the District of Columbia. \nIt is supported by the chancellor of the school system, Michelle Rhee, \nand by Mayor Fenty. It is warmly endorsed by the families of the \nstudents who have benefited from this program as it literally changed \ntheir lives. Yet it has run into opposition in Congress, I fear from \npeople who are committed to defending a status quo that is not working.\n  Chancellor Michelle Rhee is working so hard to reform the school \nsystem of our Nation's Capital, the public school system. Why would she \nbe supporting this Opportunity Scholarship Program that will allow some \nchildren--low-income children--in the District of Columbia to get this \nscholarship and go to a private or faith-based school? She said, in \nterms that were very compelling, as she testified before committees of \nCongress, the following: That if a parent of a student in a school that \nliterally had been determined to be failing turned to her and said, can \nmy child get a good education in the school the public school system \nsends her to, she can't now say yes to parents of students who are in \nthese designated failing schools.\n\n  And she said, I think with great strength and conviction and \nhonesty--and she is the head of the public school system here--that \nuntil she can tell these parents that their children will get a good \neducation in the public schools of the District of Columbia, she cannot \nin good conscience oppose this plan that will basically enable these \nchildren a lifeline while she is fixing the DC public schools--a \nlifeline to a better education, a better career, a better life.\n  Her own estimate is that it will take her 5 years more to get the DC \npublic schools to where she wants them and every parent of a child here \nin the District wants them to be. That is the length of the \nreauthorization of this program that our amendment would provide.\n  I understand there will be a point of order raised against our \namendment, as well as objections to proceeding to a vote on our \namendment, and that, therefore, I will be obliged to withdraw my \namendment. It was not possible on this bill to receive the consent \nnecessary to bring up this amendment for a vote, although I am pleased \nto understand that no objections would likely be raised on the minority \nside to at least bringing up a vote for an amendment.\n  I do want to serve notice that I will continue to push for a vote on \nthis matter, because I think it is so critically important. I know \nthere are several bills coming before the Senate, including the \nreauthorization of the FAA, which will come soon and that will be \nsubject to amendment and, therefore, I will be afforded an \nopportunity--myself and my cosponsors--to amend those bills and to \noffer this opportunity scholarship amendment to those bills.\n  I don't know at this moment that we have the 60 votes to pass this \namendment, but what I am committed to doing is making sure we have \ndebate on the amendment and a vote on the amendment so the Senate can \nbe heard and, in that sense, is challenged to take a position on this \namendment and this program which, I repeat, has been a lifeline for \nkids trying to get a decent education and build a better life.\n  In my view, this amendment did belong on the American Workers, State, \nand Business Relief Act--the underlying bill before the Senate--\nbecause, obviously, the opportunity to seek and receive a better \neducation enables our children to be better, more productive workers, \nto help our businesses and, of course, to grow our national economy. \nAchievement gaps in our schools have a profound effect on the quality \nof our workforce and on the future of our economy. Most importantly, \nthe quality of our schools has a profound effect on the quality of the \nlives of the children who go to better schools and get a better \neducation.\n  Like so many millions and millions of others in our country today, \nincluding, I am sure, a lot of other Members of the Senate, my life was \ntransformed by the public schools of my hometown of Stamford, CT, which \ngave me an education that enabled me to be the first person in my \nfamily to go to college, and then I was able to go to law school after \nthat.\n  There are within the District of Columbia so many gifted and talented \nstudents who are in schools that are developing their gifts or growing \ntheir talents by giving them a good education. The OSP takes a limited \nnumber of those--and they are low income--and gives them a chance for a \nbetter education and a better life.\n  I regret that I am not going to be able to debate this issue and to \nget a vote on this amendment on this bill, but we are going to wait for \nthe next opportunity to do so. I do want to make, however, some brief \nremarks on the substance here.\n  I have followed the status of the OSP for several years in my \ncapacity as chairman of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee. It is one of those strange twists of Senate committee \njurisdiction that the governmental affairs part of the jurisdiction of \nour committee--the traditional historic jurisdiction before homeland \nsecurity was added--included, according to the wisdom of a previous \ngeneration of Senators, jurisdiction over the District of Columbia. So \nI can tell you we need only listen to the students in the program and \ntheir parents--as our committee has had the privilege to hear--to know \nthis program has served as a life changer--not just a game changer but \na life changer--for many of these children in this program.\n  We also have a federally mandated study that documents the success of \nthis program. Despite a lot of misleading statements by those who \noppose the program, the science behind this study--an independent study \nrequired by a previous act of Congress authorizing this proposal--\nproves that the program is working. It is one thing to hear the \nstudents and their parents talk about how their lives have been changed \nwith the opportunity to go to a school that has made them feel they can \nbe a success and educated them better, but Dr. Patrick Wolf, the lead \ninvestigator for the study that was authorized by a previous act of \nCongress, concluded:\n\n       The DC voucher program has proven to be the most effective \n     education policy evaluated by the Federal Government's \n     official educational research arm so far.\n\n  That is an awful lot to be able to say.\n  So the path this bill has followed, the opposition to it, has been so \nfrustrating. People say this is money that is coming out of the public \nschool budget. The whole design of this original program was to add \nmoney in equal parts to the DC public schools--money it would not \notherwise have received. It was a kind of compensatory balance: the \nsame amount to the charter schools, which are doing very well here in \nWashington, and then the same amount to the opportunity scholarship \nprogram. So money not from the public schools, but an education \nopportunity for poor kids in Washington now going to schools designated \nas unable to educate them, and instead giving them the opportunity to \ngo to better private or faith-based schools.\n  I thank the Chair and my colleagues for allowing me the time to bring \nup my amendment. As I say, I look forward to engaging in the very near \nfuture in a larger discussion of these issues, and at greater length, \nby submitting this as an amendment to the next bill that comes to the \nSenate floor.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 3381, withdrawn\n\n  Pursuant, nonetheless, to the agreement I had with the leadership and \nmy colleagues in the Senate, understanding there was not consent to \nproceed, I will now withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n\n[[Page S1294]]\n\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we earlier had a cloture vote on, what I \nguess is called the jobs bill. It has some things in it that I think \nmight be helpful to this economy. Continuing certain tax cuts is \nimportant. But I have to say, it is very much a disappointment that the \nlegislation spends $100 billion more than we have. In other words, it \nwill add $100 billion to the debt of the United States.\n  It was a few weeks ago that this Senate voted for a pay-go idea that \nasserted we were not going to spend money we didn't have and we were \ngoing to pay for what we spent. In other words, if we increase \nspending, we are either going to raise taxes or cut spending somewhere \nelse to keep us on the right track. But we have not done that. This is \nactually a $140 billion bill.\n  This bill has $40 billion in costs assumed by the CBO for continuing \nthe tax credits that have been in place, some of them, for 10 years. \nThose are to be continued, and they score that as costing $40-some-odd \nbillion. But that is paid for. Our Democratic colleagues are prepared \nto pay for allowing the American people to keep money that is theirs; \nmoney that the government hasn't assessed against them and extracted \nfrom them over a 10-year period. That is paid for through other \nincreases in taxes and other activities which, so far, offset that. But \nthe $104 billion of new spending is not paid for.\n  Regardless, the bill is a bill that adds $104 billion to the debt. I \ndon't see how that is a responsible action for our Congress. Because \nlast year, in February, Congress passed an $800 billion stimulus \npackage--the largest spending bill in the history of America, and every \npenny of it was added to the debt of the United States. It was the kind \nof bill the likes of which Congress has never, ever seen before. We did \nthat. And that was not long after the $700 billion financial bailout \npackage--the TARP bill. The one thing about the TARP bill is that we \nalways understood we were to get some of it back. And we would have \ngotten a lot more of it if they had spent it to buy toxic assets, \ninstead of giving billions of dollars to one insurance company; giving \na huge amount of money to General Motors, which is unlikely ever to be \npaid back by that company. Now the government basically owns an \nautomobile company and an insurance company. And that is not anything \nlike what we were told when that TARP bill came before the Senate. I \nbelieved at the time, it was so unprincipled and such a dangerous piece \nof legislation that I opposed it vigorously. But Congress said we had \nto pass it and it passed. Then we came back in January after the new \nPresident was in office. We had to stimulate the economy, and many of \nus warned that the legislation was not stimulative in nature and it was \nnot going to create the kind of jobs we needed to create. It just was \nnot.\n\n  I remember quoting from a Wall Street Journal op-ed by Gary Becker, a \nNobel Prize economics winner. He warned the bill was not stimulative \nenough. But we had to pass it. It was supposed to be for crumbling \nbridges and infrastructure.\n  Yet less than 4 percent of the money went to crumbling bridges and \ninfrastructure. Most of it went to social programs, bail out a State, \nMedicaid--not job-creating things. Mr. Becker told us in his op-ed \nshortly before the vote, giving his best judgment about what would \nhappen, he said that it was not going to be a job-creating bill; that \nyou should look for well above $1 growth out of an investment of $1 in \nstimulus funds. Their impression was, he and his team, it was going to \nbe well below $1.\n  Now we come back this year, we want another stimulus, another jobs \nbill because the first one did not work. But now we are in a position \nwhere we are surging the debt of this country to a degree it has never \nbeen done before. This, in many ways, exceeds World War II, when we \nwere in a life-and-death struggle.\n  These are just the basic numbers. In 2008, the total American public \ndebt was $5.8 trillion. In 2013, according to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, our own experts, based on the 10-year budget the President has \nsubmitted that would double to $12.3 trillion. Congress actually ended \nup passing a 5-year budget very similar to his first 5 years, but this \nshows the track the President has proposed the country move on. I am \nnot making this up. Then, in 2019, it would go up to $17.5 trillion. \nCBO is stating that next year's deficit will exceed this year's \ndeficit. The deficit of the year ending September 30 of last year was \n$1.4 trillion. They are estimating our next year will be about $1.5 \ntrillion.\n  So, blithely, our leadership walks in today and says we have to \nextend unemployment insurance, we have to do a number of other things, \nand we have not figured out a way to raise the money for it or reduce \nspending on programs that do not work so we will just borrow it too. \nThat is not calculated in these numbers. That was not legislation that \nwas on the agenda or on the books before the Congressional Budget \nOffice made this scoring.\n  There are other things we know are going to be part of this. I will \ntalk about a few of them. One of the things that is in the legislation \nbefore us is what we have come to refer to as the doctor fix. I feel \nstrongly about that. We had passed the Balanced Budget Act in the late \n1990s, and it contained the growth of Medicare spending on payments of \nphysicians. As the years went by, we realized pretty quickly that the \ncuts were too large or at least Congress did not have the will to let \nthem go into effect, so we wiped it out. We did not let the cuts come \nin.\n  We have been doing it now for over a decade, Republicans and \nDemocrats--each one had a majority. Instead of facing up to the \nshortfall in the physicians' reimbursement, we have allowed this \nproblem to grow. What it amounts to is, if Congress does not act, the \ndoctors who are taking care of our parents and grandparents on Medicare \nwill have their payments cut 21 percent. A lot of physicians are losing \nmoney on Medicare today. If this were to happen, there would be a \nmassive quitting of taking care of Medicare patients. They would not do \nit anymore. It is not right. You cannot justify, from any logical \napproach to medicine, that we should cut physicians by that kind of \namount. I think fundamentally we need to restore it and put it on a \npath that is sustainable and a growth rate instead of a 21-percent cut. \nWe need to wrestle with how to do it.\n  If you fix the doctor fix, and you allow a modest growth instead of a \n21-percent cut over the next 10 years, it will cost the U.S. Treasury \n$250 billion. That is a lot of money, even by Federal Government \nstandards. Our annual highway bill has been about $40 billion. The \nannual budget of my State of Alabama is less than $10 billion--$7 or $8 \nbillion for the whole State, including education. That $250 billion is \na lot of money. But millions of American seniors are treated every day \nby physicians and they paid into the Medicare Program for 40 years. \nThey have been told that when they get to be seniors at retirement age, \nthey will get basically free physician services. It is a commitment we \nmade. Maybe it was improvident at the time. Maybe we could have been \nsmarter about the way it was done, but that is what we told them, and I \nbelieve we have to honor that in principle today.\n  This bill attempts to deal with it by extending it, as we have done \neach time, 1 year. That is what I call a budget gimmick. It is a \nmisrepresentation of the true state of our finances because what will \noccur is, we will put the money in for this year. It is going to cost \n$7.3 billion to fix this year's doctors' payments. But you know what \nthe CBO scores when they estimate what our debt will be? They assumed \nthe law will go back into effect next year, and there will be a 21- or \nmaybe then 22-percent or 23-percent cut in physician payments. They \nwill assume that is going to be true for 9 years, leaving about $240 \nbillion extra money that we in Congress can spend--except it is going \nto be paid. We cannot cut the physicians by that much money. We know we \nare going to fix it, 1 year at a time. It appears we do not have the \ncourage or the will to fix it permanently like we should, so we will \njust fix it and we will use that and then they can make the deficit \nlook better than that.\n\n[[Page S1295]]\n\n  This budget, this number CBO has scored, does not assume the doctors' \npayments are going to be increased 21 percent. They assume doctors' \nfees are going to be cut because that is what the law is, unless we act \nto change it. They make an estimate based on what the law is today, so \nwe can fix the doctors' payments for 1 year, but for the next 9 years \nthey assume we have a lot more money than we have because we are going \nto fix it every year. This kind of gimmickry is what put us in this \nfix.\n  Let me say this: An attempt was made earlier this year to do a doctor \nfix outside the health care reform bill. That was a very duplicitous \nact, in my opinion. I have to be frank with my colleagues. Why? What \nwas wrong about that? The President has always said that in health care \nreform, in fixing our health care problem, what we need to do was deal \nwith physician payments, the SGR. But when they sat in that secret room \naround here, moving the money around to try to figure out how to \npresent a bill and plop it out on the floor and ask us all to vote for \nit, they had a problem. They had promised the bill would be deficit \nneutral. But if they fix the doctor fix, it was going to cost $250 \nbillion. They could not make the numbers work.\n  Do you know what the Democratic leadership tried to do? They brought \nit up separately. We are going to pass a bill in the Congress that \nwould have funded the fix of the doctors. Every penny of it goes \nstraight to the debt. But because they took it out of health care \nreform and sat it over here, they were going to say the health care \nreform did not cost any money. I can dispute that and it is not \naccurate, but that is what they did.\n  But do you know what happened? Thirteen Democrats said no. To their \ngreat credit, under, I am sure, pressure, they decided: I am not going \nto vote for another big debt increase on a bill that is not paid for. \nWe ought to make this paid for. They were listening to their \nconstituents back home and they are concerned about it. I know \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle are definitely concerned about \nthis deficit. But I just wish to say if it had passed and it would have \nbeen another hiding of the debt by doing it in that fashion.\n  Since that failed, we now have it in this bill for 1 year. It is \ngoing to be unpaid for and it will go straight to the debt. I think \npeople who voted against the last doctor fix because it was not paid \nfor and added to the debt should vote against this legislation because \nit continues to take us in that direction.\n  Finally, I will say the entire debt process we are on is dangerous to \nour economy in the long run. This much money being poured into the \neconomy and being unwisely spent--as Mr. Becker warned us a year ago--\nhas to have some positive impact. For heaven's sake, you borrow $800 \nbillion from the future and you pump it into this economy today and now \nwe are talking about another $100 billion we borrow from the future and \npump into the economy today--those kinds of actions have to have some \npositive impact, at least in the short run. But nothing comes from \nnothing. There is no free lunch. We know somebody will pay. Can anybody \ndispute that--that anything we take in today and distribute among \nourselves and enjoy today somebody paid for?\n  Who is going to pay for this? Let me tell you. Last year, the \ninterest on the debt of the United States was $187 billion. That is a \nlot of money. The Federal highway bill is $40 billion. Interest on the \ndebt was $187 billion. Alabama, an average size State of 4 million \npeople, has a general fund budget of less than $10 billion. $187 \nbillion. But because we are tripling the debt in 10 years, in 2019, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, in that year alone people \nstill alive and well in the United States and making some money and \ntrying to feed their families will pay $800 billion on the debt in \ninterest--in that year alone, $800 billion.\n  This is a burden that our economy will be carrying for years. By the \nway, there is no plan to pay it down. In fact, in 2019, it is projected \nthe deficit will be almost $1 trillion that year. The debt, the \ndeficit, and the shortfall in income over expenditures in 2019 will \nstill be growing. The debt will still be surging.\n  Greece is in such a terrible fix today; their deficit amounts to \nabout 12.7 percent of the entire gross domestic product of the nation \nof Greece. They are considered to be very unstable. The economy is \nthoroughly in danger. They are going through some significant reforms \nto try to work their way out of it. Our deficit-to-GDP ratio this year \nis 9.7 percent.\n  This is one of the highest ratios in the world, and it is a danger \nthat we face. So to get down to the nub of the matter, I am not going \nto vote for this bill. I am sure some of my colleagues will say: That \nis because you do not like the unemployed, and you do not want to help \nthem. I do want to help them.\n  I am sure it is going to be because some of my colleagues will say: \nYou do not want to pay the doctors. You do not like doctors so you are \nmean and cold-hearted. And: Do not worry about the debt, Sessions.\n  But at some point we have to bring our house under control. Just like \na family budget, we cannot continue to spend dramatically more than we \ntake in.\n  We passed a resolution. This Senate passed a bill that is supposed to \nlimit expenditures through a pay-go mechanism. It was predicted then \nthat people were not serious when they were passing it. This would be \nthe second time we voted in a matter of weeks to break through pay-go, \nand this is $100 billion.\n  I would suggest there are a number of things that can be done. One of \nthem is, we can go back and look at the unspent stimulus money. There \nis about $170 billion not only unspent but unobligated at this point. \nThat money can be utilized to take care of some of these needs we have, \nand there is no doubt we could do that. We could find other mechanisms \nto deal with this, and one of the things we are going to have to face \nup to is that there are a lot of programs in this government that are \nnot returning value for the taxpayers. We are extracting money from \ntaxpayers. We are sending it out to programs that are not producing any \nlegitimate return, and they should be eliminated. When is the last time \nwe have ever eliminated any expenditure in this country where we can \nsee that it has not been effective?\n  Well, a lot of our reports show that a lot of our government programs \nare ineffective. There are a lot of things we can do to enhance our \nproductivity as a national government to eliminate this surge in debt \nand get us off the path we are on that I think leads to financial \nproblems in the future.\n  A witness before the Budget Committee testified that studies show \nthat this kind of debt with the high interest payments, will pull down \nour economic growth.\n  Most people think economic growth is going to get us out of this fix. \nBut if we are burdened with high interest rates, if the U.S. Government \nis going out in the marketplace and competing with private business to \nget people to loan you money, it tends to drive up interest rates. It \ntends to reduce the amount of money available in the marketplace for \nprivate business. They predict it would at least reduce the growth by 1 \npercentage point in the future. When you are talking about 2 percent \nannual growth, and you drop to 1 percent growth, or 3 percent and you \ndrop to 2 percent growth, this is serious.\n  So it is no doubt this kind of debt will crowd out spending when we \nhave $800 billion in the tenth year just to pay interest. It will be \nthe biggest expenditure the government has on any account. That is a \nproblem.\n  So I would say it is time to take this bill back. Let's look at it. \nLet's see if we cannot contain some of the spending that is in it, and \nlet's see if we cannot pay for the rest of it and produce a bill that \nwe can be proud of that will help people in need without socking it to \nthe debt of America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The assistant majority leader.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             National Debt\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I do not quarrel with the Senator from Alabama about our \nnational debt and the threat that it possesses. I certainly understand \nwe are borrowing a lot of money from countries overseas, and we want to \nsee that come to an end.\n  That kind of indebtedness leads to a dependency which is not healthy \nfor\n\n[[Page S1296]]\n\nour economy or our future or our children. I certainly would agree with \nthe Senator from Alabama on that.\n  I was not here for his entire presentation, but there are several \nthings I think should be made clear for the record. The point is, some \n9 years ago, when President William Clinton left office, he left office \nwith a national debt, total accumulated national debt throughout our \nhistory of about $5.7 trillion. But when he left office, we were in \nsurplus. We were actually generating a surplus in the Federal Treasury, \nand the surplus was being used to extend the life of the Social \nSecurity trust fund. We were adding more and more years of solvency to \nSocial Security because we were generating a surplus.\n  It is hard to imagine that this was the case only 9 years ago, and \nyet it was. The government was then handed over to President George W. \nBush, a new administration, an administration that ran on a platform of \nfiscal conservatism and dealing with overspending and the national \ndebt.\n  What happened at the end of 8 years? At the end of 8 years, the \nnational debt had grown from $5.7 trillion, on the last day that \nWilliam Jefferson Clinton was in office, to almost $13 trillion when \nPresident George W. Bush left office 8 years later. It more than \ndoubled in that period of time.\n  What happened? First, the situation beyond President Bush's control: \n9/11, devastating to our economy. We know what happened. People stopped \npurchasing, people stopped traveling. There was a general concern about \nthe safety of our country and the certainty of our future, and that \ntook its toll on our economy. There is no question about that. I am not \ngoing to go into any suggestion that President Bush was culpable in \nthat regard. He was a victim as we were as a nation on 9/11. But \nconscious decisions were then made by this administration after 9/11: \nFor instance, the decision to invade Iraq was a decision I did not \nshare. I was one of 23 Senators who voted against the invasion of Iraq. \nI happen to think that was the right decision to stay out of that war.\n  But, as a nation, we deciding to go forward. Congress voted that way. \nPresident Bush said: We are going to wage this war, but we will not pay \nfor it. We will take the cost of this war and add it to our national \ndebt.\n  If you look back at history, World War II, for example, most of us \nremember either reading about or seeing some evidence of war bonds--\nborrowing from the American people to pay for war. Yet we incurred a \nmassive debt at the same time. Wars are costly.\n  President Bush initiated this war in Iraq and Afghanistan and paid \nfor neither one. That added to our national debt. He also did something \nthat had never been done in the history of the United States. In the \nmidst of a war, President Bush said we are going to cut taxes. It is \ncounterintuitive.\n  We know that in a war we need more money, not just for the ordinary \ncourse of expenses of government but also because of war costs. \nInstead, the President cut taxes on the wealthiest Americans, adding to \nour national debt.\n  Then came a proposal to modify the Medicare Program for prescription \ndrugs. I thought it was a positive thing. We could have saved a lot of \nmoney if we would have built into it competition for the pharmaceutical \ncompanies. But the pharmaceutical companies did not want that. They \nprevailed. We ended up passing the Medicare Pharmaceutical Program, and \nit cost us about $400 billion, added to the deficit.\n  Start adding those things up and we realize that at the end of 8 \nyears, a President who had promised to be a fiscal conservative left us \nwith twice the national debt that he had inherited and the weakest \neconomy America had seen since the Great Depression.\n  When President Obama took the oath of office a little over a year \nago, he inherited this weak economy and two wars. He inherited another \n$1 trillion in debt that came out of this weak economy as soon as he \nwalked into the office. So when my Republican colleagues come to the \nfloor of the Senate and talk about how insensitive Democrats are to our \nnational debt, I have to remind them when they were in control and \ntheir President was in control we more than doubled the national debt. \nWe had two wars, unpaid for; we cut taxes on the wealthiest people in \nAmerica; we added a Medicare Program that was not paid for; we left the \neconomy in shambles; and left the debt for the next President. It was \nnot a welcome that most Presidents would like at the White House.\n\n  Now come the Republicans and say: Well, the thing we need to do at \nthis moment in time, with all of our unemployed, is to cut government \nspending.\n  I have to say to them, I want to cut out wasteful spending. But if \nyou ask any credible mainline economist, they will tell you that \ncutting government spending in general is exactly the wrong thing to do \nwhen the economy is in recession.\n  What we need to do is to infuse the economy with investments and \nspending that will keep aggregate demand growing for goods and \nservices, keeping people in business, hiring people, who then pay their \ntaxes and go on to buy products that help others. That is the nature of \nthe kind of economic activity that brings us out of recession.\n  So when the Republicans argue to cut spending in the midst of a \nrecession, they are going to dig the hole deeper. There will be less \nmoney spent in the economy. There will be less demand for goods and \nservices. Fewer people will be working, fewer businesses surviving, and \nthe recession will get worse instead of better.\n  So the bill before us is a bill that has several provisions in it, \nand one of them deals with providing unemployment insurance for those \nwho have no work. Now, I will concede the fact that we never dreamed \nthis recession would go on as long as it has. But for many people, some \nhave been out of work for over a year, some 2 years. They are \ndesperate. There are five unemployed people for every job in America. \nWhat we provide is about $1,100 or $1,200 a month--hardly a sum that \none can live on comfortably for any length of time in most places in \nAmerica. But that $1,200 a month keeps families together--barely.\n  Now the Republicans come to the floor and say this is a serious \nmistake. Providing unemployment insurance, according to the Senate \nRepublican whip, Senator Kyl, creates a disincentive for people to look \nfor work.\n  Well, I would challenge him. I have talked to the people who are out \nof work and have yet to find any who believe they are basking in the \nglow of unemployment insurance. It is barely enough to get by, and most \npeople are exhausting their savings.\n  Second, this bill is going to provide for additional help to pay for \nhealth insurance for the unemployed. If you lose your job, the first \ncasualty is your health insurance. So the President said, we need to \nhave our government pick up 65 percent of the health insurance premiums \nfor the unemployed.\n  How much do they run? It is $1,200 or $1,300 a month in my State, the \naverage for a family, health insurance plan. So it would eat up \nvirtually every penny of unemployment just to keep your health \ninsurance plan. So we pick up two-thirds of the cost, and the people \ntry to hang on, paying about $400 a month so they can keep their health \ninsurance.\n  What difference does it make if they lose their health insurance? \nWell, two things are going to happen if they lose their health \ninsurance. They may qualify for Medicaid, which is a government health \ninsurance plan, which we will ultimately pay for as taxpayers. They \nwill certainly lose their continuation of coverage, so that if someone \nin their family has a preexisting condition, they may find it difficult \nto ever qualify for insurance again until they find that job and get \ninto a group policy. If they have a child who is asthmatic or who has a \nserious illness, they may find that child uninsurable because they have \nlost their health insurance.\n  So when Members of the Senate come before us and say they are going \nto vote against unemployment benefits and health insurance, they are \nliterally voting against millions of Americans who are flat out of luck \nand have no place to turn and are merely trying to make it and trying \nto get by.\n  Part of this measure is paid for in offsets and sources of revenue. I \ncertainly applaud that.\n  I thank the Senator from Montana, the chairman of the Senate Finance \nCommittee. But then come the Republicans and say: Well, let's put more\n\n[[Page S1297]]\n\nmoney into this for all of the things included and take it out of the \nstimulus package.\n  Remember, the stimulus package was the President's way of trying to \nkeep this economy moving with tax cuts for working families, a safety \nnet for those out of work, money for local units of government that \nhave seen a downturn in revenues, and investments in America's future.\n  Now, I have seen some of those investments, and I will just say that \nI think those are investments that will pay off in jobs today and in \nassets in America and that will serve us for a long time to come.\n  Two weeks ago I was up on the west side of Chicago, in Austin, where \nthey opened a new family care health center. It is a primary care \nclinic for those who do not have health insurance or do not have much \nmoney, where they can see a doctor. It is going to be the nicest \nbuilding on the block. It is beautiful. One-fourth of the money came \nfrom the President's stimulus package. It put a lot of people to work \nbuilding it and now has created an asset that will serve that \nneighborhood and that city for a long time to come.\n  Two days ago, I was down in Caseyville, IL, 300 miles away from \nChicago. I saw another project with about $1.6 million of stimulus \nmoney that is going to build a community retirement home in this area. \nI saw the people out working on the jobs now just this week.\n  Ultimately, beyond the hundreds who will build this project, some 50 \nwill be full-time employees. We are investing back in the community, in \nhigh-speed rail, in highways and bridges, in basic infrastructure, and \nin things that will serve us for a long time to come.\n  The Senator from Alabama says: Let's stop doing that. Let's stop \nputting that money into those investments.\n  I think that is shortsighted. I think what we need to do is to follow \nthe President's lead and to make the investments in our economy today \nto get it chugging and moving forward. That, to me, is the first step \nin reducing our long-term deficit. Until we get out of this recession, \nget people back to work, paying taxes, the deficit will continue to \ngrow.\n  What is the second thing we can do to deal with our deficit? Health \ncare costs. Health care costs are going through the roof. I have said \nbefore that the mayor of Kankakee, IL, told me last week that she just \ngot the health insurance bill for 2,900 city employees for next year, \nand the premiums are going up 83 percent. She is going to cut back on \ncoverage, more copays, more deductibles, and hope to get it down to a \n50-percent increase. It will mean that in a city that is hard-pressed \nto meet basic needs, there will be an additional million dollars in \nhealth insurance premium costs next year for even less coverage. That \nstory is being repeated over and over across the United States.\n  On Sunday, at a press conference in Chicago with four small \nbusinesses, each one told the same story, that they had reached a point \nwhere they couldn't afford health insurance for themselves as owners or \nfor their employees. They told of terrible situations where some of \nthem had children who were literally dropped from coverage because they \ncouldn't continue to pay the high premiums that went through the roof.\n  The Republican side of the aisle has told us: Stop this debate on \nhealth care reform. Let's stop and start over. As the President said \nthe other day, the health insurance companies are not starting over. \nThe health insurance companies are continuing to do what they know how \nto do, and that is to raise prices.\n  Goldman Sachs is a firm with which most people are familiar. They put \nout a report very recently about what they considered the best thing \nfor the health insurance industry. Goldman Sachs said, in this article \nthat was published in the Huffington Post:\n\n       What the firm sees as the best path forward for the private \n     insurance industry's bottom line is, to be blunt, inaction.\n       The study's authors [at Goldman Sachs] advise that if no \n     reform is passed, earnings per share would grow an estimated \n     ten percent from 2010 to 2019, and the value of the stock \n     would rise an estimated 59 percent. The next best thing for \n     the insurance industry would be if the legislation passed by \n     the Senate Finance Committee is watered down significantly.\n\n  This says that the best way to reach higher profitability for health \ninsurance is for us to do nothing. The second best way is to do very \nlittle. That is what we are being asked to do by the Republican side of \nthe aisle, either do nothing or do very little, take baby steps, don't \nreally deal with the issue. That is not going to solve the problem.\n  If we are going to provide competition and choice for small \nbusinesses and people buying health insurance, we should offer them \nwhat we have as Members of Congress. If it is good enough for us, \nwouldn't it be good enough for the rest of America? Our plan is pretty \ngood. It is called the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. Eight \nmillion Federal employees and their families are in there. It has been \nin existence for 40 years.\n  My wife and I each year have an open enrollment period to choose from \nnine different private insurance plans in my State of Illinois. These \nare plans that have to meet the basic requirements of Illinois so that \nthey are not plans that are worthless and they are plans that we pick \nbased on our state in life. My wife and I are at a point where we buy \nthe biggest plan, the high-option plan. The Federal Government pays a \nshare of the premium cost; we pay the rest. We would pay less if we had \nless coverage. But if we don't like the plan, next year we have open \nenrollment again. We can pick another one. What a great idea for \nconsumers, to be able to pick and choose, go shopping just like one \nwould for an automobile, to pick the one that is right for your family, \nthe one you can afford, the one that gives you the coverage you need.\n  If that is good enough for Republican and Democratic Members of \nCongress, Senate and House, why isn't it good enough for America? Why \ndon't we have exchanges just like that available for businesses and \nindividuals to choose from, the best private health insurance plan that \nmeets their pocketbook needs and their health needs? That is what our \nbill does. Many on the Republican side have condemned it as socialism. \nThe government administers it, at least sets up the plans on the \ninsurance exchange. Guess what. Every Senator's health insurance plan \nwould be socialistic by that definition. I don't see them rushing down \nto the Secretary of the Senate to cancel their coverage. They love it. \nI do too. It is the best health insurance you could ask for. To require \nminimum requirements in terms of what coverage it will have, that is \nwhat our plans do. When we say, do that in the bill, they say, there it \nis, government-run health insurance. It is not. It is private health \ninsurance plans.\n  There are 50 million Americans without insurance. We provide coverage \nfor 30 million. Those are people who, when they get sick, go to the \nhospital, get taken care of, and the cost of their care is passed on to \neverybody else who has health insurance. That is not fair. It costs us \na lot of money as individuals. We pay $1,000 a year in extra premiums \nfor the uninsured. Our idea is to bring people under coverage so that \nwhen they go to the hospital, their care is paid for, not by us but, in \nthis case, either by private health insurance or by Medicaid, the \ngovernment health insurance plan.\n  When we asked the Republicans, if we cover 30 million in our \napproach, how many do you cover of 50 million uninsured, their answer \nis 3 million. That is not much of an effort, when you think about it. I \ncan understand why we need to do more.\n  There are two last points I wish to make. One is that if we are going \nto deal with health insurance in an honest way, we need to at least \ntell the health insurance companies that the party is over. First, \ntheir antitrust exemption, which they have had for 65 years, has to \ncome to an end. Should they be allowed to collude and conspire on \nprices and divide up the market at the expense of consumers? We ought \nto put an end to it. The House voted to do that. Secondly, we have to \nput an end to the awful practice by many health insurance companies to \ndeny coverage to individuals because of preexisting conditions, for \nexample, or to say, if you get really sick, they will just cut you off \nin terms of how much they will pay. Those things are gross abuses. They \nneed to change. The Republicans have yet to offer a plan that deals \nwith those gross insurance abuses. Their baby steps don't even deal \nwith the serious issues.\n\n[[Page S1298]]\n\n  Finally, when it comes to Medicare, 40 million Americans count on it, \nthose who are seniors and disabled. It only has about 9 years of \nsolvency left. Our bill doubles the life of Medicare, another 9 or 10 \nyears of longevity. That is good for seniors and for all of us. We want \nto cut out the waste, and there is waste. We want to provide basic \nquality care. But doing nothing, as many Republicans counsel us to do \non health care reform, means Medicare will go broke in 9 years. I don't \nwant to be around to see that happen. I want to be part of the \nsolution.\n  My final point is this: We started off talking about the deficit and \ndebt. If we don't deal with health care costs and bringing them down, \nwe can't raise enough money in taxes to keep up with this skyrocketing \ncost. State governments, local governments, and the Federal Government \nwill all be faced with this kind of increased bill and increased debt \nand increased deficit each year. That is the reality of doing nothing \non health care reform when it comes to deficit and debt.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a New York \nTimes piece relative to the health care insurance industry, as well as \nthis analysis of managed care by Goldman Sachs and several articles \nwhich outline exactly what is going to happen. The health care \ninsurance industry is praying that we do nothing because their profits \nwill continue to skyrocket. That is not fair to the families across \nAmerica.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, Mar. 6, 2010]\n\n           Obama Wields Analysis of Insurers in Health Battle\n\n                       (By David M. Herszenhorn)\n\n       Washington.--To bolster the case for a far-reaching \n     overhaul of the health care system, the Obama administration \n     is seizing on a new analysis by Goldman Sachs, the New York \n     investment bank, recommending that investors buy shares in \n     two big insurance companies, the UnitedHealth Group and \n     Cigna, because insurance rates are up sharply and competition \n     is down.\n       White House officials on Saturday said that the Goldman \n     Sachs analysis would be a ``centerpiece'' of their closing \n     argument in the push for major health care legislation. The \n     president and Democratic Congressional leaders are hoping to \n     win passage of the legislation before the Easter recess. \n     Republicans remain fiercely opposed to the bill.\n       The Goldman Sachs analysis shows that while insurers can be \n     aggressive in raising prices, they also walk away from \n     clients because competition in the industry is so weak, the \n     White House said. And officials will point to a finding that \n     rate increases ran as high as 50 percent, with most in ``the \n     low- to mid-teens''--far higher than overall inflation.\n       The analysis could be a powerful weapon for the White House \n     because it offers evidence that an overhaul of the health \n     care system is needed not only to help cover the millions of \n     uninsured but to prevent soaring health care expenses from \n     undermining the coverage that the majority of Americans \n     already have through employers.\n       Republicans, however, could also point to the analysis as \n     bolstering their contention that Democrats should be focused \n     more on controlling costs and less on broadly expanding \n     coverage to the uninsured.\n       The research brief is largely based on a recent conference \n     call with Steve Lewis, an industry expert with Willis, a \n     major insurance broker.\n       In the call, Mr. Lewis noted that ``price competition is \n     down from a year ago'' and explained that his clients--mostly \n     midsize employers seeking to buy health coverage for their \n     employees--were facing a tough market, in which insurance \n     carriers are increasingly willing to abandon existing \n     customers to improve their profit margins.\n       ``We feel this is the most challenging environment for us \n     and our clients in my 20 years in the business,'' Mr. Lewis \n     said, according to a transcript included in the Goldman \n     brief. ``Not only is price competition down from a year \n     ago,'' he added, ``but trend or (health care) inflation is \n     also up and appears to be rising. The incumbent carriers seem \n     more willing than ever to walk away from existing business \n     resulting in some carrier changes.''\n       The report also indicated that employers are reducing \n     benefit levels, in some cases by adding deductibles for \n     prescription drug coverage in addition to co-payments, and \n     raising other out-of-pocket costs for employees as a way of \n     lowering the cost of insurance without increasing annual \n     premiums and employee contributions to them.\n       Kathleen Sebelius, the secretary of health and human \n     services, is expected to discuss the Goldman analysis on two \n     Sunday television talk shows, ``Meet the Press'' on NBC and \n     ``This Week'' on ABC.\n       In his call with Goldman, Mr. Lewis said beneficiaries were \n     feeling the brunt of the changes to existing policies. \n     ``Visually to employees, they're fairly significant,'' he \n     said.\n       But the report also sounded cautionary notes that the \n     administration will probably not want to highlight.\n       Asked by Goldman analysts about the effort to pass major \n     health care legislation, Mr. Lewis said many employers \n     experiencing increases in their insurance costs were \n     nonetheless apprehensive about the president's proposal.\n       ``They're very mixed in their reaction, quite candidly \n     consistent with what we're seeing in the polling numbers by \n     party lines,'' Mr. Lewis said. ``I think most people would \n     acknowledge that there's a need for health care reform; \n     employers continue to be very frustrated. So when they look \n     at what the Obama administration and the Democratic majority \n     state as their goals to increase access and lower cost and \n     rail at what may be termed oligopolistic behavior of carriers \n     in certain markets, I think employers really buy in to that \n     message and have much of that frustration and anger at our \n     lack of solutions.''\n       And yet, he said, there is little enthusiastic support from \n     employers for the Democrats' proposals.\n       ``Many of them still view the legislation and the \n     partisanship coming out of Washington as possibly the \n     medicine worse than the disease,'' he said. ``So many \n     employer groups that we're talking to feel like it would be a \n     shame to lose an opportunity to do something with respect to \n     health care reform. But many are starting to feel like maybe \n     nothing is better than something in this current \n     environment.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   [From Goldman Sachs, Mar. 3, 2010]\n\n  Americas: Managed Care--A Front-Line Perspective on 2010 Commercial \n                         Price & Product Trends\n\n\n         Transcript from our sixth annual call with Steve Lewis\n\n       We hosted our seventh-annual industry expert conference \n     call with Steve Lewis, regional leader for the employee \n     benefits practice of Willis, the third largest insurance \n     broker in the world.

Thanks for joining us today for the \n     Goldman Sachs Managed Care Industry Expert Conference Call \n     with Steve Lewis of employer benefit consulting firm Willis. \n     This will represent our 7th annual conference call with Steve \n     Lewis.\n       Steve and his team have agreed to give us frontline \n     perspective on 2010 managed care pricing and product trends. \n     As background, Willis is the third largest insurance broker \n     in the world with approximately 350 million in employee \n     benefits revenues in North America with a focus on the middle \n     market employer segment.\n       That focus is particularly valuable given the lack of \n     visibility on the segment from the other health benefit \n     consulting firms. And let me just elaborate on that. The \n     context is that national employer benefit consultants such as \n     Hewitt, Mercer, Towers Perrin, and others really focus their \n     attention on the jumbo employer segment, which is \n     overwhelmingly a fee-based non-risk model.\n       However, the biggest earnings driver for the managed care \n     companies are the fully insured risk lives, and those are \n     mostly through the small and mid-size employers that buy \n     through health insurance brokers. And we found that the \n     brokers typically lack the scale and sophistication to have a \n     good perspective on macro industry trends.\n       However, as healthcare coverage has become more and more of \n     a significant outlay for employers, they've needed greater \n     expertise but are often under served by the national benefit \n     consultants that focused on\n\n[[Page S1299]]\n\n     jumbo employers, so that's where Willis has built its focus, \n     serving as a high service benefit consultant for the middle-\n     sized employers.\n       With that as an intro, let me reintroduce our guest speaker \n     Steve Lewis, executive vice president at Willis and regional \n     practice leader. As background, Steve has 20 years of \n     experience in the employer benefits industry and previously \n     served as a national account executive with Oxford Health \n     Plans, and also worked previously as a consultant with Hewitt \n     Associates.\n       With that, I'll turn it over to Steve to kick it off. \n     Following that, I will serve as moderator for a series of \n     topical questions, and then, we will open it up to investor \n     Q\n     Steve Lewis, Willis HRH:\n       Good morning, Matt. Thank you again, for hosting us on this \n     call. As always, I enjoy the opportunity to do this with you \n     each year. I also want to publicly acknowledge and thank our \n     team here for their support. The insight that I'll provide \n     today and have previously provided is largely the \n     amalgamation of information that's developed from our team \n     working day in and day out with clients throughout the \n     country.\n       I would add that my comments on this call will be directly \n     based on my team's experiences and do not necessarily reflect \n     the experience of my Willis colleagues from around the \n     country.\n     Borsch:\n       Thank you for that, Steve. Let me jump right in here with, \n     perhaps, the most important question from the standpoint of \n     institutional investors looking at the sector, and that is, \n     what are you seeing in terms of competition between the \n     carriers, specifically relative to last year or two years ago \n     or whatever you want to use as the baseline, has price \n     competition increased or decreased?\n     Lewis:\n       As a specific answer to that, we would say, price \n     competition is down from year ago. An overall theme that we \n     would characterize this year, meaning, when I say this year, \n     the just completed January 1 renewals, and continuing up and \n     through today. We feel this is the most challenging \n     environment for us and our clients in my 20 years in the \n     business.\n       Not only is price competition down from year ago (when we \n     had characterized last year's price competition as being down \n     from the prior year), but trend or (healthcare) inflation is \n     also up and appears to be rising. The incumbent carriers seem \n     more willing than ever to walk away from existing business \n     resulting in some carrier changes.\n       And that's a significant adjustment from last year where we \n     saw aggressive pricing on the renewal front but not so much \n     on the new business front. And then I'd say the other real \n     theme is we've seen some service levels that have gapped \n     among few of the major players which has further increased \n     switching of carriers.\n     Borsch:\n       Let me move on to the next question here. If you look at \n     the landscape, what role do you see Third Party \n     Administrators or TPAs playing in the competitive landscape? \n     And I guess this gets down to a related question if you could \n     address between the employer decision to self-fund or go with \n     the fully insured purchase, are employers shifting one way or \n     the other.\n     Lewis:\n       Yes, I think taking the Third Party Administrator piece \n     first, as in prior years, we've seen little to no new \n     penetration in our client base from the TPAs. There's still \n     an occasional place for them in the marketplace, but fewer \n     and farther between in our opinion.\n       The networks have expanded to the extent across the country \n     that there is now very significant overlap, and the TPA \n     discounts no longer really compete with what the major \n     managed care carriers have been able to do from a network \n     standpoint.\n       With respect to the second part of your question (related \n     to the self-funding versus fully insured question), our \n     clients primarily seem to want certainty in this economic \n     environment with respect to their healthcare spend.\n       So, unless they have either a reasonable track record of \n     consistent and relatively predictable claim patterns, clients \n     that we expect to be fully insured are still largely biased \n     in that direction, and those that are on the fence as to \n     whether they should be fully insured or self-funded seem to, \n     again, be biased more towards the fully insured product.\n       I would add that where we have had increased conversations \n     is with our smaller client segment that are increasingly \n     frustrated with what we call blind renewals, meaning, no \n     claims data, and experiencing large increases on top of no \n     claims data.\n       As a result, there's absolutely increased interest at the \n     smaller client segment in evaluating potential self-funding \n     with stop loss protection.\n     Borsch:\n       Getting back into the topic of the competitive dynamics, \n     can you touch on how criteria other than price play a role in \n     carrier competition, whether that's in fully insured or self-\n     insured or to the extent you draw a distinction, and to the \n     extent that maybe that's changed or not changed a little bit \n     versus a year or two ago?\n     Lewis:\n       Yes, I think, as we've talked about in prior calls, price \n     remains king in the middle market, and is probably queen as \n     well. Factors that can be a tie breaker other than price \n     would include network disruption to the specific population; \n     market perception of the competitive carrier's reputation; \n     product flexibility, meaning willingness to allow \n     prescription drug carve-outs; ability to provide detailed \n     reporting in a certain employee population level, and funding \n     arrangements offered. Not just the self-funded versus fully \n     insured argument but some of the hybrids or the more creative \n     solutions within the fully insured marketplace such as \n     minimum premium or participating contracts in the fully \n     insured environment.\n       Those things taken together can all factor in as tie \n     breakers with respect to how employers are evaluating \n     carriers. But even still, price certainly remained the most \n     significant driver.\n       I would add one thing; you asked how it's changed from \n     prior years. I think last year on this call, we talked \n     specifically about the playing field that was fairly level on \n     the service end of the equation and as I mentioned at my \n     opening comment, we have seen a bit of gapping with respect \n     to the services at some carriers. And that is driving \n     employers to certainly take a look at what's available on the \n     marketplace. Then again, finding that there's not a lot of \n     aggressive price competition, the service disruption would \n     have to be fairly significant for somebody to move knowing \n     that they're not going to be able to trade down pricing very \n     significantly.\n     Borsch:\n       Is it the case that the service disruptions that you've \n     seen in some instances are severe enough to reach the \n     threshold where they switch?\n     Lewis:\n       The short answer is yes. We have seen some of that, and I \n     think we've seen it at a lower price threshold than what we \n     would've seen in the past.\n     Borsch:\n       Let me move to a slightly different topic here, and \n     obviously, the background here is the severe recession that \n     was certainly having an impact when we talked a year ago. \n     But, now we've been through a lot more pain even though the \n     economy is showing signs of recovery. A lot of the impacts of \n     these types of things are lagged.\n       So, I guess, it's sort of a general question how \n     significant a role has the recession played in the clients' \n     product managed care strategies. And, what have you seen in \n     terms of the overall group enrollment changes related to \n     that? It's sort of a high level question there, but trying to \n     understand what the impact of the severe recession has been \n     on the way employers look at things, buy things, and on \n     enrollment?\n     Lewis:\n       Yes, I'd say, it's a great question and an interesting one \n     particularly as we look at this market. You mentioned the lag \n     factor and the timing of the stock market drop of mid-\n     September 2008 was fairly late in the game to impact many \n     employers' January 2009 strategies. So, most were not making \n     any significant benefit changes, and/or made the specific \n     decision to hold the line when it came to health benefits at \n     the end of the day due to the freezes or cutbacks in other \n     areas such as pay, 401K matches, and staffing levels.\n       So this year, I think, we saw a lot of employers saying, \n     they were not going to make that mistake again or very early \n     on in 2009 looking back and saying, if I had to do it over \n     again, I probably would've made more drastic changes and not \n     held the line with health benefits.\n       So, it is a bit ironic that they didn't--a lot of employers \n     chose not to make the change last year when we were in the \n     deepest part of the recession. But this past year the renewal \n     process started much, much earlier for employers even knowing \n     that the sooner they started, the more impact trend \n     uncertainty would have on their renewal.\n       Strategic planning just started much earlier, and employers \n     wanted to see just about every option under the sun both in \n     terms of pricing, plan design, extreme options, really \n     hedging themselves trying to get some clarity as to what \n     their options were with respect to health benefits, because \n     they didn't have clarity on either the direction of the \n     market, the economy, or even their own specific prospects.\n       So, as I mentioned at the outset, it was without a doubt \n     the most challenging renewal cycle in my 20 years of this \n     business with employers really struggling with how and what \n     was going to drive their decision combined with the lack of \n     aggressive and competitive pricing in the marketplace.\n       I think, to your last point about how that may have \n     impacted group enrollment, I'm not sure I have anything \n     significant statistically to share with you today. However, \n     anecdotally, I would say that enrollment is down across our \n     book of business. We looked at 2009 going into the year and \n     planned for the enrollment on our client base to be down \n     10 percent, and I would say that was fairly accurate.\n     Borsch:\n       You alluded to something I just wanted to clarify--it may \n     be that this isn't measurable, but on the question of adverse \n     selection (and, here, we're talking about the employer \n     market, not the individual market), you alluded to the \n     potential that some employees might be more likely not to \n     take up coverage or, in fact, to discontinue employer \n     subsidized coverage, because even though it is subsidized it\n\n[[Page S1300]]\n\n     can be a very sizable chunk out of their pay for a benefit \n     package that may look less attractive after some of the \n     changes the employers have made.\n       So, to the extent you can infer if you're seeing any of \n     that (and, related to that, the COBRA uptake), has that been \n     something that you measure? Has it come up in how the \n     carriers have presented their pricing? Finally, do you have \n     any sort of visibility on whether that trend is increasing or \n     abating?\n     Lewis:\n       Let me take the first part on something I've alluded to \n     about the potential for adverse selection due to younger, \n     healthier folks dropping and/or not selecting coverage to \n     begin with. You know, I think it depends a bit on the \n     demographics of the population, the type of industry; our \n     clients really span just about every industry out there.\n       So is adverse selection on the rise in the group market? I \n     would say it is, but I don't have any data to back that up, \n     but just based on the fact that the population is down 10 \n     percent across our book. And we look how the census in those \n     client populations has shifted. I would suggest that there \n     is: I don't want to overstate it because I'm not sure it's \n     significant at this point, but I certainly would see some \n     creep, if you will on adverse selection.\n       I think that ties to your second point about COBRA uptake. \n     We did not keep specific statistics on the extent of COBRA \n     uptake. But we certainly saw it across the board, in our \n     client base, and we certainly believe that it is impacting \n     the pricing that our clients are experiencing.\n     Borsch:\n       Given what you're facing from a more conservative \n     underwriting environment amongst the carriers, how are you \n     leveraging or seeking to leverage current market conditions \n     to your clients' advantage in renewal negotiations?\n     Lewis:\n       Well, as stated the outset, and probably ad nauseum at this \n     point and it's been a tough year.\n       Carriers were very selective in going after new business, \n     and incumbents were willing to walk away from existing \n     clients. So we had to be incredibly creative in our \n     negotiation tactics as well as in our strategic advice with \n     clients. And again, it was something that fortunately for us, \n     in the process, we did start early and while it consumed a \n     lot of energy from all of the stakeholders it was probably \n     the year of creativity.\n       With respect to negotiation tactics, one of the interesting \n     things is that we seemed to have seen a bit of a bifurcation \n     in the marketplace at the plus or minus 300-employee size.\n       In the groups under 300 employees, many of them don't have \n     or are unable to get control of their claims data either as a \n     result of the products they've purchased or just underwriting \n     guidelines at the carrier level where they don't have \n     complete control of their claims data. In that under 300-\n     market place, there was very little competition and very high \n     renewals right out of the gates.\n       However, in the over 300-employee market, if the claims \n     data was available and in a detailed way and you could make a \n     story about that claim's pattern and possibly make \n     adjustments for a spike--a one-time spike. Then, you would \n     see competition pick up. But again, it was very selective and \n     certainly not anything we would characterize as overly \n     aggressive.\n     Borsch:\n       This lead in to the next question: Can you generalize about \n     what is the average rate increase that you're observing: both \n     the initial carrier request and the final end point, post \n     negotiation and plan changes? And can you tell us about the \n     extent of plan benefit reductions in achieving final results \n     for your clients?\n     Lewis:\n       Averages are tough, you're right, and probably don't tell a \n     very good story and some clients look at that and say, wow, \n     how did you get that average? I must've been the high person. \n     But the range was all over the place and fairly extreme. I'd \n     say we settled in a range, on our book of business, from a 5% \n     reduction to a 50% increase.\n       But generally speaking, we were in low to mid-teens out of \n     the gates, and this is where the real challenges begin. \n     Because negotiations generated no more than one to one and a \n     half points with no plan changes. And so it's almost like you \n     were getting a first and final and you had to dig through the \n     renewals to find a mistake.\n       That's less movement than we've had in each of the prior \n     years and certainly, not turned in the right direction from \n     our clients' perspective.\n     Borsch:\n       But on the benefit plan changes that your clients have \n     implemented, would you say those are more substantial today \n     than what you saw a year ago?\n     Lewis:\n       I would say that incrementally the changes are more \n     substantial, but visually to employees, they're fairly \n     significant. You know, just about everybody did something \n     this year. And it did vary as you would imagine by the extent \n     of the renewal and the existing plan structure, but things \n     like 100% co-insurance are virtually gone.\n     Borsch:\n       Yes.\n     Lewis:\n       What we saw was a lot of tweaking, where we'd see the \n     employers bifurcating the primary and specialist co-payments, \n     adding prescription drug deductibles on top of co-payments, \n     and really focusing on plan changes first and foremost before \n     looking at impacting employee contributions.\n     Investor Question:\n       You talked about client renewal process starting earlier as \n     the planning process started earlier. Does that mean the \n     contracts are actually being signed earlier and therefore the \n     carriers will have more visibility into the premium yield \n     this year compared to previous years?\n     Lewis:\n       Great question. The answer is no. The contracts are not \n     renewing any earlier, just the negotiation process. So, in \n     our world, generally speaking, we would look to get a renewal \n     (depending on the size of the group) from 90 to 120 days \n     before the expiration of a renewal.\n       This year, clients were looking to us (and to a certain \n     extent from the carriers) to extend that to 6 months out: \n     where we start predicting where the renewal is going to end \n     up. And to the extent that the carriers were willing to \n     provide a preliminary renewal, they have to load in a lot of \n     trend because they have to make guesses on the claims going \n     forward.\n       And then as you move closer to the expiration date, they \n     offset trend with the wrong claims experience. So nobody was \n     renewing or signing contracts earlier, they were just \n     dragging the process out much, much longer from both the \n     carrier side and the employer side.\n     Borsch:\n       Let me ask a question, and hopefully, this is isn't \n     repetitive, but in the market studies that you've reviewed, \n     how wide have the gaps been between the different carriers? \n     Have you noted one carrier or groups of carriers relative to \n     the others that have been especially aggressive or perhaps \n     overly conservative that stand out?\n     Lewis:\n       The short answer is no. I think in particular situations, \n     we've seen a couple of carriers be more aggressive than \n     others. But I'm putting quotes around more aggressive because \n     we're generally in the three to five percent range between \n     pricing from where an incumbent renewal might be and what \n     might be considered aggressive.\n       Now, there were few exceptions on some of our larger middle \n     market clients, as I've mentioned earlier, with very clean \n     data, stable business, perhaps a one-year blip with the \n     incumbent that cause the incumbent to get skittish and want \n     to shut the business and a competitor to come in and price it \n     more aggressively. But as a general rule, Matt, we were in a \n     pretty tight range during the market study process.\n     Borsch:\n       We've talked in prior years about tracking the gradually \n     growing interest in the consumer-directed health plan \n     products. Where you would say we stand now? Have you seen the \n     uptake increase meaningfully as a result of all the pressure \n     of the last year? And, you know, if you can offer a little \n     bit of a forecast, do you think that may change going into \n     2011?\n     Lewis:\n       Yes. Surprisingly, we have not seen a significant shift \n     towards the consumer directive plan. Across the board, it's \n     now an option for most employer groups. And the clients that \n     have offered it for the longest period of time (call it \n     three-plus years) are now exceeding double-digits, but that's \n     the low double-digits for enrollment as an option.\n       New offerings continue to generate very low enrollments out \n     of the gates with still almost no full replacements at this \n     point. I think the one shift we have seen is a swing towards \n     health reimbursement accounts and away from health savings \n     accounts that more employer-friendly. And employers are doing \n     more to tie their wellness rewards and strategies to their \n     health reimbursements accounts.\n       So I'd say if you ask about a crystal ball, really the \n     tying of wellness and to focus on improving the health of a \n     population, then consumer health plans tied to an HRA account \n     is where we see this market moving and really the potential \n     for the biggest surge.\n     Borsch:\n       Let me just conclude with one last one I want to throw at \n     you here, Steve. This has been tremendous insight that you've \n     brought for us so I want to thank you. On health reform, \n     obviously, this is a huge thing in the background but it's a \n     practical matter, but it doesn't necessarily have that much \n     day-to-day impact on things.\n       But to what extent is health reform something that the \n     employers are looking at? Are they talking to you about it? \n     Have you got ``two cents'' on where opinions fall amongst \n     employers about what they would like to see happen relative \n     to what's been presented in Washington?\n     Lewis:\n       Yes, we are talking to our clients a lot about it. There is \n     a lot of what I would call academic interest at this stage of \n     the game. They're very mixed in their reaction, quite \n     candidly consistent with what we're seeing in the polling \n     numbers by party lines.\n       I think most people would acknowledge that there's a need \n     for healthcare reform,\n\n[[Page S1301]]\n\n     employers continue to be very frustrated. So when they look \n     at what the Obama administration and the Democratic Majority \n     state as their goals to increase access and lower cost and \n     rail at what maybe termed oligopolistic behavior of carriers \n     in certain markets, I think employers really buy in to that \n     message and have much of that frustration and anger at our \n     lack of solutions.\n       But I would also say that many of them still view the \n     legislation and the partisanship coming out of Washington as \n     possibly the medicine worse than the disease. So, many \n     employer groups that we're talking to feel like it would be a \n     shame to lose an opportunity to do something with respect to \n     healthcare reform. But many are starting to feel like maybe \n     nothing is better than something in this current environment.\n     Borsch:\n       This is probably a good place to end our call. Steve, thank \n     you very much. This is really a great frontline perspective \n     on industry trends and I want to thank you and your firm \n     Willis, and also thank our investor clients who dialed in.\n     Lewis:\n       Thank you, Matt. I appreciate it.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Huffington Post, Mar. 8, 2010]\n\n   Goldman to Private Insurers: No Health Care Reform at All Is Best\n\n                             (By Sam Stein)\n\n       What's Your Reaction?\n       A Goldman Sachs analysis of health care legislation has \n     concluded that, as far as the bottom line for insurance \n     companies is concerned, the best thing to do is nothing. A \n     close second would be passing a watered-down version of the \n     Senate Finance Committee's bill.\n       A study put together by Goldman in mid-October looks at the \n     estimated stock performance of the private insurance industry \n     under four variations of reform legislation. The study \n     focused on the five biggest insurers whose shares are traded \n     on Wall Street: Aetna, UnitedHealth, WellPoint, CIGNA and \n     Humana.\n       The Senate Finance Committee bill, which Goldman's analysts \n     conclude is the version most likely to survive the \n     legislative process, is described as the ``base'' scenario. \n     Under that legislation (which did not include a public plan) \n     the earnings per share for the top five insurers would grow \n     an estimated five percent from 2010 through 2019. And yet, \n     the ``variance with current valuation''--essentially, what \n     the value of the stock is on the market--is projected to drop \n     four percent.\n       Things are much worse, Goldman estimates, for legislation \n     that resembles what was considered and (to a certain extent) \n     passed by the House of Representatives. This is, the firm \n     deems, the ``bear case'' scenario--in which earnings per \n     share for the top five insurers would decline an estimated \n     one percent from 2010 through 2019 and the variance with \n     current valuation is projected to be negative 36 percent.\n       What the firm sees as the best path forward for the private \n     insurance industry's bottom line is, to be blunt, inaction.\n       The study's authors advise that if no reform is passed, \n     earnings per share would grow an estimated ten percent from \n     2010 through 2019, and the value of the stock would rise an \n     estimated 59 percent during that time period.\n       The next best thing for the insurance industry would be if \n     the legislation passed by the Senate Finance Committee is \n     watered down significantly. Described as a ``bull case'' \n     scenario--in which there is ``moderation of provisions in the \n     current SFC plan'' or ``changes prior to the major \n     implementation in 2013''--earnings per share for the five \n     biggest insurers would grow an estimated 10 percent and the \n     variance with current valuation would rise an estimated 47 \n     percent.\n       The report, a Goldman official stressed, was analytic not \n     advocacy-based. Their job was to provide a sober assessment \n     of the market realities facing private insurers under various \n     versions of health care reform.\n       ``If no reform at all happens you would see the largest \n     rise in EPS,'' a Goldman official acknowledged. ``But what we \n     are doing is just analyzing what the stocks would do under \n     different scenarios.''\n       The study does note on the front page that the firm ``does \n     and seeks to do business with companies covered in its \n     research reports.'' Those companies include Aetna, Wells \n     Point and United Health.\n       In the context of the current health care debate, the \n     findings provide a small window into the concerns that have \n     driven the private insurance industry's opposition to reform \n     legislation. Simply put: health care reform is going to hurt \n     their bottom line. No less a prestigious voice than Goldman \n     Sachs is telling them so.\n       Some insurers, in the end, will be hit harder than others. \n     CIGNA is the lowest of the big five, for instance, because it \n     does little business providing insurance plans to Medicare \n     patients, individuals and families buying health plans \n     directly, or small employers that offer health plans to their \n     workers.\n       In addition, some reforms are going to hurt the industry \n     more than others. Regulatory changes--such as prohibiting the \n     prejudice against consumers with pre-existing conditions--\n     will have an impact across the board, as will the funding \n     cuts to Medicare Advantage.\n       Overall, Goldman calculates the probability of reform \n     passing Congress at 75 percent. Though the limitations of \n     Goldman's political prognostications were on full display \n     earlier in the document:\n       By mid-late October, we expect a cloture vote (60 votes) to \n     bypass a potential filibuster followed by several weeks of \n     debate over proposed amendments on the Senate floor (with a \n     similar process under way in the House). If both the Senate \n     and House are able to pass legislation (perhaps before the \n     Thanksgiving recess), a House-Senate conference negotiation \n     should produce combined legislation for final approval \n     (perhaps by mid-December).\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From Goldman Sachs, Oct. 19, 2009]\n\n           America's Managed Care--10 Years of Health Reform\n\n\n             We have published a new 10-year industry model\n\n       As we near the final weeks for health reform efforts in \n     Congress, we have published a new, interactive 10 year model \n     to forecast potential impact.\n\n\n     We now forecast 2010-2019 EPS growth of 5% under health reform\n\n       Under our ``base'' case scenario, we forecast core managed \n     care earnings growth would be cut by 50% over the next decade \n     under implementation of the current Senate Finance Committee \n     reform plan. Specifically, we see sector EPS growth at \n     approximately 5% per year under health reform (2010-2019) as \n     compared to 10% EPS growth with no health reform.\n       We also consider a ``bear'' case scenario for reform that \n     would drive declining EPS for the sector in aggregate over \n     the next decade.

I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I ask unanimous consent to speak in morning business for \nsuch time as I shall consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, let me respond to a couple of the remarks \nof my good friend from Illinois. I listen to this all the time, people \ntalking about during the Bush administration, the costs that have gone \nup, the deficits and all this stuff. I appreciate the fact that the \nSenator from Illinois did state that the situation was a little \ndifferent when President Bush came into office because, of course, 9/11 \nhappened and we ended up in a couple wars. But that is understating the \nsituation.\n\n[[Page S1302]]\n\n  Right after the Clinton administration--I remember it so well--I was \na member of the Senate Armed Services Committee at that time and \nactually was a member of the House Armed Services Committee when \nPresident Clinton first came in. The euphoric attitude everyone had at \nthat time was that the war is over. Remember we talked about the peace \ndividend and all this stuff. The war is over and we no longer need to \nhave a strong national defense. That is what they were saying, though \nthey used different words. They started cutting our defense system. I \nhave a chart that shows what happened to--the demise of our ability to \ndefend ourselves during the Clinton administration. We went through the \nsame thing back during the Carter administration. People remember the \nhollow force at that time.\n  During the Clinton administration, we started degrading our military. \nIt was reduced by 40 percent from what it was when he took office \nduring those 8 years. When I say 40 percent reduction, I am talking \nabout end strength, military expenditures. The problem President Bush \nhad when he came into office was not just that two wars broke out, but \nthey broke out when we had a defense system that had been reduced by 40 \npercent.\n  The second thing that happened during that time--and this is by \nadmission--I remember Senator Gore had made the statement prior to that \nthat the recession actually started in March of the previous year \nbefore the second Bush administration started. It is kind of an \ninteresting thing. People forget that for every 1 percent drop in \neconomic activity, that translates into about $40 billion of lost \nrevenue. Turning that around, for every 1 percent increase in economic \nactivity, that increases revenues about $40 billion when that happens.\n  Of course, we started out with a reduced military, negotiating two \nwars, and with a recession at the same time. Obviously, that had very \nadverse effects.\n  Before I get carried away with the remarks of the Senator from \nIllinois, that he voted against going into the Iraq war, let me remind \nmy fellow Senators that I happened to have been privileged, right after \nthe first gulf war--that was when Saddam Hussein--all the atrocities \nhad taken place, and we had what we called the first freedom flight. \nThat is when we went back into Kuwait to see what the situation was in \nKuwait. It was so close to the end of the war that the Iraqis didn't \nrealize the war was over. They were still fighting. You remember they \nwere burning the oilfields and the wind would shift. All of a sudden, \nit would be daytime, and it would turn into night. I remember going \nback there. I was with nine other people. There were some Democrats. \nTony Coelho, former whip of the House, was there. Alexander Haig, a man \nwe revere, the man I always thought should have been President, was \nthere. We were watching and looking to see the remnants of the first \ngulf war.\n  I had a young girl with me who had fled Kuwait. She was a royalty. \nShe was going back. She wanted to see if a palace on the Persian Gulf \nwas still there. When we got there, we found out that it had been used \nby Saddam Hussein as one of his headquarters. She wanted to go up in \nher bedroom. She was 7 years old, and she wanted to see if her animals \nwere still there. They had used her bedroom for a torture chamber. \nThere were body parts stuck to the walls. A little kid had his ears cut \noff because he was caught carrying an American flag.\n  I can remember the mass graves. We looked at the mass graves where \nSaddam Hussein had tortured these people. When he had them sentenced to \ndeath, some begged to be dropped--eased into the acid vats head first \nso they would die quicker. I mean, this is the type of thing that was \ntaking place. Here is a guy who had actually murdered hundreds of \nthousands of his own people up in the Kurd area by the most painful way \nof dying. So to suggest we should not have gone back in to finish him \noff I think is unacceptable.\n\n  Before I finish responding to the comments made by the Senator from \nIllinois, I would only mention, when he talked about how George W. Bush \ncame into office and he cut taxes for the rich and all that, I recall \none time in history--actually, it has happened several times in \nhistory; it happened right after World War I--they passed tax increases \nto support the war and when the war was over, they said, we can now \nrepeal the taxes. They repealed the taxes, and it didn't reduce \nrevenue, it increased revenue. That is something that was kind of \nforgotten until one of the great Presidents came along, John Kennedy.\n  During the Great Society days he said we are going to have to have \nincreased revenue to pay for all of these Great Society programs. He \nsaid the best way to increase revenue is to decrease marginal rates, so \nhe did. Remember, he dropped them down from I think 90 percent to 70 \npercent or something like that, and during the next 6 years taxes went \ndown and we had the increase in the revenue, which was phenomenal. The \nlast time I checked, President John Kennedy was a Democrat, not a \nRepublican. So I don't know how they forgot that along the way.\n  We saw when Reagan came into office, he actually made those dramatic \ncuts as well. I remember--I am going from memory now--but the amount of \nmoney that came in from marginal rates in 1980 when President Reagan \ntook office was $244 billion. When he left office, it was $488 billion. \nIt doubled in that period of time, the largest tax reductions in \nhistory. Revenues increased when tax reductions went down. Anyway, that \nall ended when the Clinton administration came in. We all remember the \n1993 tax increases, the greatest tax increases in about four decades. \nThat is when they increased them on everything.\n  The bottom line is, yes, he did cut taxes and that had the effect of \nincreasing revenues. I think when we talk about the deficit, as the \nSenator from Illinois mentioned, that was inherited by this President, \nPresident Obama, we have to remember that the deficits during the Bush \nadministration, if you add them all up, were a little bit more than the \ndeficit in the first year of the Obama administration.\n  As far as his comments about the $787 billion stimulus bill, that \nwouldn't have been that bad of an idea. I opposed it, of course, but it \ndidn't stimulate. It had all of this social engineering in there, all \nof the equal distribution of wealth, yet I tried to add an amendment on \nthere which was cosponsored by Senator Boxer to increase, quadruple the \namount of money that went into roads and highways. It didn't work. They \ndefeated it. So it could have had the opportunity to do something.\n  The last thing I would say about the government-run system is I \nthought it was interesting when the Senator from Illinois talked about \nthe wonderful opportunities I have and he has in choosing from the \nprivate sector good coverages. I think what he is describing is what we \nhave today. I agree with what he said in that respect. But when you \ntalk about a system that is very similar to the Canadian system, all \nyou have to do is go up in the northern part of the United States, go \nto Mayo Clinic and look at the number of people there who have come \ndown from Canada because they can't get the health care they want in \nthat kind of government-run system. So I would agree with my friend \nfrom Alabama when he was talking about describing what we are up \nagainst.\n  That is not why I came to the floor this evening. I have come to \nintroduce a bill.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Inhofe pertaining to the introduction of S. 3095 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3430, as Further Modified\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nnotwithstanding its adoption, the Isakson amendment be further \nmodified, with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S1303]]\n\n  The amendment is further modified by striking the word ``ending'' on \npages 58, 63, and 67 and inserting the word ``beginning''.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2 p.m. \nWednesday, March 10, the Senate resume consideration of H.R. 4213 and \nall postcloture time be considered expired, and upon disposition of the \npending amendments, no further amendments or motions be in order; the \nsubstitute amendment, as amended, be agreed to; that the Senate then \nproceed to vote on the motion to invoke cloture on H.R. 4213, as \namended, with the mandatory quorum waived; that if cloture is invoked, \nthen all postcloture time be yielded back, the bill, as amended, be \nread a third time, and the Senate then proceed to vote on passage of \nthe bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I voted against waving a budget point of \norder to the Murray/Kerry amendment on the grounds that it is not paid \nfor and contained terrible welfare and Medicare policies.\n  The Congress cannot keep spending money it does not have. It is \nunconscionable to put forth an amendment that is not being paid for at \na time of exploding deficits to an underlying bill that already has \nanother $104 billion not paid for.\n  In addition to adding to the deficit during a fiscal crisis, the \nunderlying Murray/Kerry amendment perpetuates flawed welfare policies \nthat undermine key principles of welfare reform.\n  The Murray/Kerry amendment perpetuates the fund established in the \nstimulus bill that, for the first time since the landmark 1996 welfare \nreform act, rewards States for increasing their welfare caseload and \ndoes not require these additional eligible adults to participate in \nwork, education or training activities.\n  This in turn adds to the current deplorable situation where, \naccording to the latest data we have from the Department of Health and \nHuman Services, the U.S. average for eligible adults receiving welfare \ndoing nothing is 56 percent.\n  That is right--on average 56 percent of adults receiving welfare are \nengaged in zero hours of work, training or education activity. Some \nStates have over 70 percent of eligible adults doing nothing.\n  That is zero hours of job search. Zero hours of education. Zero hours \nof substance abuse treatment. Zero hours of job training. Zero hours of \nsubsidized work activities.\n  I bet if you asked the American people--how many adults on welfare \nshould be doing something to qualify for their welfare check--I bet the \nanswer would be: all of them!\n  I bet if the American people knew that the majority of adults on \nwelfare were doing nothing, they would be as stunned and appalled as I \nam.\n  We need to do better by these families. Allowing them to languish in \nthe soul crushing, deep and persistent poverty of welfare is a \ntravesty. The Murray/Kerry amendment does nothing to address the issue \nthat the majority of adults on welfare are not doing anything to get \nthemselves out of poverty.\n  That makes no sense, Mr. President, and I cannot support it.\n  Finally, in addition to the misguided welfare policies, I also had \nreservations about the use of ``intelligent assignment'' in Part D to \npay for this amendment. I fully support efforts to make sure vulnerable \npopulations are in the lowest cost plan that meets their personal \nhealth care needs and look forward to continuing to work on this issue \nin the future. But the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS, \nand MedPAC commissioners have raised concerns that ``intelligent \nassignment'' could lead to increased disruption, higher costs and \nlittle overall improvement for beneficiaries.\n  Therefore, I opposed waving the Budget Act that would have allowed \nthe Murray/Kerry amendment to undermine welfare policy, advance \nmisguided Medicare policy and increase the deficit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1303-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1303]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, yesterday marked the 100th anniversary of \nInternational Women's Day--an occasion that celebrates the many \ncontributions women have made to our communities, societies, and \nnations. Women have made great progress, but the sad reality is that \nwomen around the world are not participating equally in business or \npolitics, are not paid the equivalent of their male counterparts, and \nare more likely to be denied educational opportunities, property \nownership, and other basic rights.\n  The inequities facing women today represent some of the world's \ngreatest global-development challenges. Investing in women is vital to \nthe world's growth potential. I have introduced two bills this Congress \nthat take important steps towards equity and human rights for women \nworldwide.\n  In July 2009, I introduced the Global Resources and Opportunities for \nWomen to Thrive--GROWTH--Act of 2009. The GROWTH Act is designed to \nreduce these economic inequities in developing countries. By providing \nwomen with the economic resources to start and grow their own \nbusinesses, the GROWTH Act would create broad educational, legal, and \ncommunity-based programs that would promote female property ownership \nand empower women in their communities.\n  Today, women account for 64 percent of adults who lack basic literacy \nskills, 70 percent of the hungry, and 56 percent of those subject to \nforced labor.\n  Women typically invest 90 percent of their income back into their \nhousehold compared to only 30 to 40 percent by men. Developing programs \nthat allow women to increase their education and thrive professionally \nis good for the family, as well as the woman.\n  In May 2009, I also introduced the International Protecting Girls by \nPreventing Child Marriage Act. This bill sets out to strategically \neliminate the harmful practice of child marriage overseas. Child \nmarriage poses a direct threat to investments in education for girls \noverseas, HIV/AIDS prevention, poverty reduction, maternal and child \nsafety, and human rights.\n  Too often the potential of children and developing women is crushed \nby early marriage, sometimes occurring when girls are as young as 7 \nyears of age. Child marriage is a direct challenge to guaranteeing \nequality and basic human rights to children and developing women around \nthe globe.\n  International Women's Day calls on us to acknowledge the achievements \nof women, but it is also a reminder of the sometimes immovable barriers \nwomen in many countries still face. I commend my colleague Senator \nShaheen for submitting S. Res. 433 recognizing International Women's \nDay. This resolution is a testament to the Senate's commitment to the \nadvancement of women worldwide.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for the \nInternational Women's Day.\n  Rooted in the long-term struggle for equality, International Women's \nDay has been observed since the beginning of the last century, at a \ntime when American women were fighting for basic rights, such as voting \nor fair employment. We should commemorate the determined and courageous \nwomen who have played an extraordinary role in the history of women's \nrights.\n  While women have made hard fought and important strides towards \nequality since then, they continue to face significant obstacles in all \naspects of their lives, particularly those living in poverty. Over a \nbillion people worldwide live on a dollar a day or less--and women are \nmost likely to be among them. This is a problem that affects all of \nhumanity--when women are poor, entire communities suffer because they \nare not free to earn an income, feed their families, or protect \nthemselves and their children from violence. And their efforts are \ncritical to rebuilding countries in peril like Afghanistan and Haiti. \nUntil women around the world have improved access to economic, \npolitical and social opportunities, the great challenges we face today \nwill go unresolved.\n  Indeed, investing in women and girls is one of the most efficient \nuses of our foreign assistance dollars and best ways to make the world \nmore peaceful\n\n[[Page S1304]]\n\nand prosperous. Decades of research and experience prove that women are \nmore likely to invest their income in food, clean water, education, and \nhealth care for their children, creating a positive cycle of change \nthat lifts entire families, communities and nations out of poverty. \nSimply put, when women succeed, we all do.\n  If we ignore these realities, the results will undoubtedly be \nnegative. The statistics are staggering. A World Bank report confirms \nthat societies that discriminate on the basis of gender pay the cost of \ngreater poverty, slower economic growth, weaker governance, and a lower \nliving standard of their people.\n  In sub-Saharan Africa, for example, less than 2 out of 10 women have \na job with a regular income and lower economic risk. GNP per capita is \nfar lower in countries where females are significantly less well \neducated than men. Also in sub-Saharan Africa, inequality between men \nand women in education and employment suppressed annual per capita \ngrowth between 1960 and 1992 by 0.8 percentage points per year. This is \nsignificant, as a boost of 0.8 percentage points per year would have \ndoubled economic growth over that time period.\n  But when women's voices are fully included in societies and \neconomies, the reverse is true. According to UNICEF, when women hold \ndecisionmaking power, ``they see to it that their children eat well, \nreceive adequate medical care and finish school. Women who have access \nto meaningful, income-producing work are more likely to increase their \nfamilies' standards of living, leading children out of poverty.''\n  The World Bank states that, at the macroeconomic level, there is \nevidence that removing gender disparities spurs growth. According to \none estimate, growth rates in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and the \nMiddle East and North Africa would have been 30-45 percent higher had \nthese regions closed the gender gaps during the school years as fast as \nEast Asia did between 1960 and 1992.\n  The economic growth that can result from gender equality is \nexemplified by Eugenia Akuete. Eugenia grew up in Ghana surrounded by \npoverty and started making products from shea butter because she was \nlooking for a way to earn money to help supplement her family's income. \nAt first the market was difficult--she was only producing a small \namount, she lacked necessary business and technical training and it was \nhard to get the shea butter soaps and lotions to U.S. customers. She \neventually received training that focused on women's entrepreneurship.\n  Now she is earning a steady income and teaching other women to do the \nsame by producing and selling shea butter. She has 10 employees, most \nof whom are women, who she pays above than the government minimum and \ngoing market rate. She also now employs 300 women in northern Ghana who \ngather nuts for the factory to convert into shea butter. Stressing that \nthey are all connected to each other, she explained that it is in her \nbest interest that everyone produce the best quality possible--so that \nall communities benefit.\n  When asked what she would like to tell Americans, Eugenia said that \nwhat women like her need most are tools so that they can help each \nother and themselves.''Yes, we need help,'' she said, ``[but] we are \nalso responsible to other people so that we'll have a multiplying \neffect. I don't believe in freebies: part of the package of \nresponsibility is that if you are helped you in turn have the \nresponsibility to help someone else.''\n  As we in Congress and in the administration are moving forward with \nthe vital process to revamp our foreign assistance, we have an \nopportunity to make women's empowerment a central focus of U.S. foreign \npolicy. With these unprecedented plans as a backdrop, we should \nremember Eugenia when we are thinking of ways to maximize our foreign \naid dollars. Because of the obvious multiplier effect, one of the best \nways to do that is to ensure that women are empowered. Women's success \nalways benefits more than one person.\n  While we should reflect on progress that women have made in pushing \nfor greater rights and equal opportunities, we must be conscious we \nstill have much to do in working towards greater global gender \nequality. As a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, I am \ncommitted to continuing to work with my colleagues to put women at the \ncenter of U.S. foreign assistance and to marshal all the resources \nnecessary to achieve this goal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1304-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1304-S1305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ALASKAN OLYMPIANS\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, from February 12 to February 28, \nAmericans were united in cheering on some of our Nation's most elite \nathletes as they competed at the 22nd Winter Olympics in Vancouver. I \ncommend all of our athletes for their exemplary performance and thank \nthe coaches, the team leaders and the U.S. Olympic staff. With such a \ntalented group of people working together, it is no surprise that the \nUnited States won a record breaking 37 medals. Americans watched with \nan extraordinary sense of pride as our flag was raised and our anthem \nplayed, and our fellow countrymen and women competed and won on an \ninternational stage. I am especially proud of the seven Alaskans that \ncontributed their talent to their country and competed at these Winter \nOlympics.\n  Holly Brooks, the coach turned athlete, participated in her first \never Winter Olympics this year. Holly quickly became a beloved member \nof the Alaskan community after moving there from Seattle. Her work as a \ncoach at Alaska Pacific University and subsequent Olympic success has \nbeen an inspiration to many of Alaska's young skiers. I know that Holly \nreceived an outpouring of support during her run up to qualifying for \nthe Olympics from many of her fellow athletes and Alaskans led by her \nhusband who made hundreds of ``Go Holly'' stickers for her supporters \nto wear. I wish Holly luck in her further competitions and hope that \nshe will continue to be a great role model for the young people of \nAlaska.\n  Callan Chythlook-Sifsof is the first Alaska Native to be selected to \nthe U.S. National Ski and Snowboard Team and the first to make an \nOlympic Team. Growing up in a small rural village on the coast of the \nBering Sea, Callan learned to board on the mountains surrounding her \nhome. In 2006, at age 17, she earned a position on the U.S. snowboard \nteam and a bronze medal in her first World Cup Boardercross in Japan. \nShe also received a bronze medal at the start of the 2009 season in the \nSouth America Continental Cup. Callan continues to quickly excel and is \ncurrently ranked No. 2 in the U.S. and No. 14 in the world in Ladies' \nBoardercross. I hope she continues to compete for many years to come \nand hopefully we will see her in 2014 in Sochi.\n  Jay Hakkinen is a familiar name in Alaska where he has been a \nprofessional biathlete for over 13 years and just finished his fourth \nWinter Olympics. Jay is one of the most accomplished U.S. biathletes in \nOlympic history and his 10th-place finish in the 20 Kilometer \nIndividual at the 2006 Torino Games previously served as the benchmark \nfor the U.S. in an individual event. Jay has shown his perseverance and \npersistence throughout his illustrious career as a biathlete. I know \nthis is not the last we have heard of Jay and wish him luck as he \nfinishes out the World Cup season.\n  Jeremy Teela surpassed Jay's benchmark this Olympic Games with his \n9th place finish in the Men's 10 Kilometer Sprint. The 34-year-old \nbiathlete from Anchorage is a three-time consecutive Olympian. However, \nhis service to his country goes beyond his athletic talent as Jeremy is \na sergeant in the U.S. Army National Guard. As one of five soldier \nathletes competing in the Olympics, Jeremy and his other servicemembers \nremind us of the sacrifices that many young Americans have made in \nservice to their country. Jeremy previously earned the bronze medal in \nthe Men's 20 Kilometer in last year's World Cup and I hope he has \nsimilar success this year.\n  Kikkan Randal, the 27-year-old cross country skier from Anchorage, \ncompeted in her third consecutive Winter Olympic Games where she had \nher best-ever finish in the Women's 30 Kilometer Classic--finishing \n24th. A former resident of Salt Lake City, UT, she moved at an early \nage to Anchorage with her family. She is also the niece of former \nOlympic cross country-skiers, Betsy Haines and Chris Haines, and\n\n[[Page S1305]]\n\nin 2007 she became the first American woman to ever win a cross-country \nWorld Cup Title.\n  During his second consecutive Winter Olympic Games, James Southam \ncompeted in three events, including the 50 Kilometer Classic where he \nachieved a personal best finishing in 28th place. James was born and \nraised in Anchorage and participates in training along with Holly \nBrooks and Kikkan Randall at the Alaska Pacific University Ski Center. \nThe APU Ski Center was a vital source of support for these Olympic \nathletes and kept many Alaskans informed of their progress through \ntheir facebook page. James, Holly, and Kikkan are a tremendous \ninspiration for the other skiers at APU and I look forward to hearing \nof more of their successes over the years.\n  Our Olympic Silver medalist Kerry Weiland, from Palmer, is a fierce \ndefender on the ice. Her intensity has earned her the nickname Kamikaze \nKerry, because she has the ability to take out two players with one \nhit. Not only did Kerry's defense help lead the U.S. to a Silver medal, \nbut the U.S. Women's Hockey team outscored their opponents 40-2 leading \nup to the gold-medal game. Kerry is also a dominant force on the U.S. \nNational Team where she was a member of the 2008 Gold Medal World \nChampionship team. She is also the founder and instructor of the \nWeiland Hockey Development in Ontario where she teaches young women the \nfundamentals of hockey, inspiring a new generation of female athletes.\n  I want to thank again all the U.S. Olympic athletes for all of their \nhard work and dedication. It is difficult to comprehend the high degree \nof training and commitment required to compete in the Olympic Games and \nwe have watched in awe as they have inspired us with their \nachievements. As Alaskans, we are exceptionally proud of these \nindividuals. We regard our athletes as role models in many ways, and \nthe sportsmanship that all our American Olympians displayed during \nthese games exemplified some of our Nation's most important values. Our \nathletes were humble in victory and gracious in defeat, and made all \nAmericans proud. I thank these individuals for being such great \nambassadors for Alaska and for America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1305-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1305]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    STRATEGIC ARMS REDUCTION TREATY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I thank you for the opportunity to speak \ntoday in support of our administration's efforts to negotiate a follow-\non agreement to the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, START. Our \nnegotiating team in Vienna is currently working with the Russian \ndelegation to finalize this agreement, and I look forward to reviewing \nthe treaty when it is submitted to the Senate.\n  The United States and Russia maintain over 90 percent of the world's \napproximately 23,000 nuclear weapons. Each of these weapons has the \ncapacity to destroy an entire city; collectively, they can destroy the \nworld. The mere existence of these weapons creates the risk of a \nnuclear accident, unauthorized use, and theft by a terrorist group. The \nsize and structure of the American and Russian nuclear arsenals reflect \nan antiquated Cold War mindset that we must move beyond.\n  It is in the national security interest of the United States to reach \nan agreement with Russia to reduce the number of nuclear weapons and \nensure that strong verification and transparency measures remain in \neffect. This is the core purpose and focus of the START follow-on \nagreement.\n  The START follow-on agreement is an important component of our \nefforts to work with Russia and other international partners to \ncollectively address the dangers posed by nuclear weapons. These \ndangers include the vulnerability of nuclear material to theft by \nterrorists, as well as the risk of nuclear proliferation by other \ncountries.\n  Ratification of a START follow-on agreement would also be a clear \nsignal that the United States is upholding our obligations under the \nnonproliferation treaty. It would reaffirm our leadership on \nnonproliferation issues and demonstrate, as the President has \nadvocated, that we are serious about moving towards a world without \nnuclear weapons while maintaining a reliable deterrent for so long as \nit is needed. We cannot afford to miss this opportunity; without a \ndemonstrated effort to fulfilling our nonproliferation responsibilities \nthrough a new START agreement, it will be increasingly difficult for \nthe U.S. to secure the international support needed to address the \nurgent security threats posed by the spread of nuclear weapons.\n  The Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the United \nStates concluded that ``terrorist use of a nuclear weapon against the \nUnited States or its friends and allies is more likely than deliberate \nuse by a state.'' Our priority, therefore, should be to work together \nwith Russia to reduce the size and vulnerability of our nuclear \narsenals, and ensure that proper security and surveillance safeguards \nare in place.\n  Unfortunately, today Russia continues to possess huge stores of \nnuclear materials that are inadequately secured and which, if stolen by \nterrorists, could be used to destroy an American city. The size of our \nown nuclear arsenal is also unsustainable, both from a security and \ncost perspective, and should be tailored to the new 21st century \nthreats we face.\n  The reductions required by the START follow-on agreement will not \nadversely affect our national security. The United States could pursue \nmuch deeper reductions in the size of our arsenal and still have more \nweapons that we would ever need. In fact, it is precisely the size of \nour nuclear arsenal and complex that makes them vulnerable to \nexploitation by terrorists. There is no longer any compelling national \nsecurity reason to maintain or expand the size of our nuclear \nstockpile.\n  Nor is there any reason to continue to develop new nuclear weapon \ntechnologies or warheads. Our brightest experts have concluded that we \nno longer need new nuclear weapons in order to maintain a credible \ndeterrent. A recent report from the independent JASON Defense Advisory \nGroup concluded that, as a result of our nuclear laboratories' \nsuccessful life-extension programs, the lifetimes of our nuclear \nwarheads can be extended for decades.\n  I am encouraged that efforts to negotiate a START follow-on agreement \nhave bipartisan support among national security experts. Notably, the \nbipartisan Congressional Commission on the Strategic Posture of the \nUnited States, headed by former Defense Secretaries William Perry and \nJames Schlesinger, endorsed a follow-on agreement to START. Similarly, \nSecretary Perry joined with former Senate Armed Services Committee \nChairman Sam Nunn and former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and \nGeorge Shultz to pen an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal calling for \nthe extension of the key provisions of START and further reductions in \nour nuclear stockpile.\n  In conclusion, I commend the administration for its efforts to \nreinvigorate the nonproliferation regime by negotiating a follow-on to \nthe START treaty. We must act now to address the spread of nuclear \nweapons and materials, which is one of the gravest dangers facing the \nUnited States. In a time of terrorism and of rising international \nconcern about Iran's nuclear program, international cooperation remains \nkey to preventing the spread of weapons of mass destruction. The START \nfollow-on agreement is an essential step towards that goal, and towards \na world without nuclear weapons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1305-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1305-S1306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HAWAII'S TSUNAMI RESPONSE\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I would like to commend the people of \nHawaii for their quick response to the tsunami caused by the earthquake \nin Chile.\n  On Saturday, February 27, 2010, an 8.8 magnitude earthquake off the \ncoast of Chile generated a tsunami throughout the Pacific. A tsunami \nwarning was issued for Hawaii, the Northern Mariana Islands, American \nSamoa, and the Marshall and Solomon Islands. Additionally, a tsunami \nadvisory was issued for the west coast of the United States and Alaska.\n  My staff and I monitored the situation closely, and were in contact \nwith the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, and the Hawaii \nState Civil Defense. FEMA was monitoring the situation in Hawaii and \nthe other\n\n[[Page S1306]]\n\nterritories from the FEMA Region IX office in California and Region X \noffice in Washington State. Supplies for any recovery effort in the \nPacific are prepositioned in Hawaii at FEMA's Pacific Area Office \nwarehouse, as well as in Guam and American Samoa. I worked to establish \nand maintain the FEMA Pacific Area Office headquartered in Honolulu in \norder to protect our isolated island communities. The office has been \nessential for preparedness efforts in Hawaii and critical for disaster \nresponse throughout the Pacific region.\n  Equally important, the actions of State and local officials and the \npeople of Hawaii have demonstrated the value of citizen and community \npreparedness. Thanks to the efforts of the people of Hawaii, we were \nprepared to save lives and avert considerable damage had a large \ntsunami come ashore. Around 6:00 a.m. on Saturday, tsunami warning \nsirens sounded in Hawaii, which notified people to evacuate the low-\nlying areas. The people of Hawaii followed the directions of our local \nauthorities, stayed calm, and evacuated all shorelines.\n  Hawaii is familiar with the destructive power of tsunamis. In 1960, a \n9.5 magnitude earthquake off the coast of Chile generated a tsunami \nthat killed over 60 people in Hawaii. More recently, Hawaii faced a \ndisaster of a different kind, in 1992, when Hurricane Iniki caused \nbillions of dollars in damage.\n  The Chilean earthquake reminded us that when a disaster occurs, we \nneed to be prepared. Because Hawaii is isolated from the rest of the \nUnited States, it is even more critical that we are prepared to take \ncare of ourselves. I want to congratulate the people of Hawaii, as well \nas Federal, State, and local authorities who successfully prepared for \nand responded to the tsunami.\n  While I am thankful for the tsunami's minimal impact on my home \nState, we cannot forget the tragedy in Chile. My thoughts and prayers \nare with everyone affected by the earthquake.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1306-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1306]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        SATELLITE TELEVISION EXTENSION AND LOCALISM ACT OF 2010\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to urge passage of the \nSatellite Television Extension and Localism Act of 2010, or STELA, as \npart of the American Workers, State, and Business Relief Act of 2010.\n  Over the past 15 years, satellite television has grown into a strong \ncompetitor to cable by offering consumers in rural as well as urban \nmarkets a choice in pay television providers. Where residents once were \nlimited to a single cable operator, satellite providers now offer most \nconsumers an alternative. This has led to price and service \ncompetition, which is good for consumers. Congress supported such \ncompetition through the passage of the Satellite Home Viewer Act and \nits progeny, including the Satellite Home Viewer Extension and \nReauthorization Act, or SHVERA. And now Congress has the same \nopportunity with passage of STELA, which reauthorizes and extends \ncertain communications and copyright provisions.\n  A decade ago, Congress, recognizing that consumers want access to \nlocal news, weather, and community-oriented programming, established a \nmechanism by which satellite providers could offer local broadcast \nstations to residents in the local market. This means that when a \nsatellite subscriber in Huntington, West Virginia tunes-in to CBS, PBS, \nABC, FOX or NBC, they hear about events in the state capital and see \nthe successes and trials of their neighbors--not the weather in \nManhattan.\n  Recognizing the limits of satellite providers at the time, Congress \ndid not require the companies to offer local channels to every market \nin the country. Over time, this has created a division between haves \nand have-nots in which satellite companies are not providing local \nchannels to residents in the smallest markets.\n  In West Virginia, satellite subscribers in the Parkersburg and \nWheeling markets cannot receive local channels from either satellite \nprovider. In certain other markets in the State, only one provider \noffers local channels. Rural consumers deserve better.\n  That is why I am particularly pleased that STELA provides incentives \nto provide local service into all 210 markets across the county, which \nsets the stage for consumers in even the most rural regions to gain \naccess to local news, sports, and community programming.\n  Another important provision of STELA changes existing law to promote \nthe carriage of high-definition local public broadcasting stations and \nto make it easier for statewide public television networks, like that \nin West Virginia and 14 other States, to reach every resident of the \nStates they serve.\n  As some broadcast television has become coarser and less informative, \nthe importance of the mission and programming provided by public \ntelevision has grown. STELA makes sure that more satellite subscribers \nwill have access to the compelling programming available on public \ntelevision.\n  Passage of STELA provides us with the opportunity to encourage \ngreater competition and access to quality programming to consumers \nthroughout the nation. For this reason, I urge my colleagues to support \npassage of this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1306-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1306-S1307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, as we move closer than ever to \nenacting legislation that delivers on the promise of secure and \naffordable health care across America, it is important to remember what \nis at stake and whom we are fighting for.\n  Over the last year, I have told many of my colleagues about the Bord \nfamily of West Virginia and their son Samuel who suffered from \nleukemia.\n  Stories like the Bords' are a reminder that our work in Congress has \na profound and personal impact on millions of lives every day. Each of \nus brings to this critical work the shared tragic and trying personal \nexperiences of our friends and neighbors back home. They are real: \nThese stories are a picture of people's lives and their pain. And we \nhave an obligation to honor those struggles and sacrifices by working \nto make things better for everyone. Yet recently, radio host Rush \nLimbaugh sneered at the Bords' experience, describing it and other \nstories highlighted during last week's bipartisan health care summit as \n``sob stories.'' Always the cynic, he dismissed them entirely, ``Can \nyou believe these stories happen in America?'' These stories do happen \nin America--every day. And it is a shame that anyone could hear of this \nheartbreak and fail to recognize what it says so clearly about the \nterrible burden our failed health care policies have placed on \ncountless families across this country.\n  Rich and Amy Bord of Fairmont, WV, are two dedicated schoolteachers \nwith health insurance through their employer. Let me repeat that: They \nhave health insurance. Their 9-year-old son, Samuel, suffered from \nleukemia, and he needed significant invasive medical therapy. They \nthought they were covered, only to learn that their policy had a \nmillion-dollar lifetime cap. A million dollars sounds like a lot of \nmoney--and it is--they surely never would have expected to exceed it. \nBut health care costs are spiraling out of control and the reality is, \nhealth insurance companies don't want to cover sick people.\n  In addition to Samuel, the Bords have two young twin sons at home, \nand the entire family's health care decisions were impacted by Samuel's \nbills.\n  After multiple rounds of chemotherapy and a relapse that required \nadditional treatment for Samuel, the Bords reached their insurance \nfund's cap. Even with the help of my office and from the Public \nEmployees Insurance Agency to get supplemental coverage for the Bords, \nSamuel still needed surgery and lots of additional care. Soon they \nwould be approaching the next cap on their supplemental coverage. So \nthe Bords were left with only heart-wrenching suggestions--consider \ngetting a divorce so that Samuel would qualify for Medicaid or stop \ntaking their other children to the doctor altogether, even if they get \nsick, in order to save every penny for Samuel. That is right. Get a \ndivorce or choose one child's health care needs over another's. Those \nare the suggestions our Nation offered to these caring, hardworking \nparents with a sick child?\n  They did everything in their power to save Samuel, but this fall, he \npassed away--and there are simply no words to ease his family's loss \nand pain.\n  I understand that, to many, circumstances like these may seem rare.\n\n[[Page S1307]]\n\nBut I cannot tell you how many times, over the many years I have served \nas U.S. Senator and before that, Governor, that I heard families' \ndesperate pleas for help because their medical needs could not be met.\n  It breaks my heart to think of what the Bords went through: not only \nthe pain of watching their son fight a terrible disease but also the \nuncertainty of paying for his treatment when the coverage they counted \non--and paid for--would run out. For anyone, especially a public \nfigure, to aggressively question and attack a family's extraordinary \npersonal anguish is deeply offensive and morally reprehensible.\n  No parents should have to spend the precious, fleeting time they have \nwith their child, struggling to navigate a broken system, worrying how \nthey are going to provide care. And no one, especially a child like \nSamuel, should be forced to walk such a dangerous tightrope between \nlife and death because he or she lacks meaningful health insurance \ncoverage, because of runaway costs, and caps, and exclusions. Yet that \ngrowing and deeply felt insecurity runs like a common thread through \nour entire health care system.\n  It is these stories--real stories of real people--and the \nunbelievable pain behind them and the battle of so many West Virginians \nthat drive me to fight for comprehensive health reform every single \nday. We must listen to these stories, take them in, and never ever \nforget them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1307-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1307]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        DIFFICULT ECONOMIC TIMES\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, as I have traveled throughout Rhode \nIsland, I have heard from countless constituents about the sacrifices \nthey have made during these difficult economic times. Many of my \nconstituents have adjusted to the economic climate by cutting back on \nextras and finding savings where they can.\n  For seniors living on a limited budget, however, simply cutting back \nis not an option. I have heard from seniors who have turned off the \nheat in their homes because oil prices are so high. I have heard from \nothers who are splitting pills and skipping doses because they cannot \nafford to refill a prescription. These are seniors who have worked hard \ntheir whole lives, paid into the system, and believed that they would \nbe able to grow old comfortably. Instead, many are barely scraping by \non Social Security benefits that no longer cover their daily living \nexpenses.\n  Last Wednesday, the Senate had the opportunity to provide some extra \nhelp for seniors, veterans, and individuals with disabilities who rely \non Social Security. We voted on an amendment offered by Senator \nSanders, which I cosponsored, that would have provided an extra $250 \npayment to Social Security beneficiaries. The payment would have been \nan extension of the financial assistance I successfully fought for as \npart of the economic recovery package last year, and these funds would \nplow right through into our economy to help further stimulate demand \nand economic recovery. Unfortunately, this year, the amendment failed \nto receive enough votes for passage.\n  Although a $250 payment may not sound like much to some, for those on \na limited budget the extra financial assistance provides peace of mind \namid skyrocketing health care and prescription drug costs. The payment \nwould provide added relief for the millions of older Americans who, for \nthe first time since 1975, did not receive a cost-of-living adjustment \nin their Social Security benefits. Without some extra help, these \nbeneficiaries are hard-pressed to make ends meet.\n  Just ask Jackie, a North Smithfield resident, who has seen her health \ninsurance premiums increase by double digits this past year and the \ncost of her prescription drugs continue to rise. At a time when every \npenny counts, Jackie says the winter months are particularly hard for \nher. When Jackie hears the oil truck drive by, she cringes knowing that \nthe cost of heating her home is another bill she simply cannot afford.\n  I also heard from Edward, a senior living in Warren, who is worried \nhow he will make ends meet without the increase in his Social Security \nbenefit. In recent months, he is seen his car and home insurance \nincrease by $200, and other daily living costs, such as heating oil, \ngas, and groceries, rise significantly. In these tough times, Edward \ncould just use a little help. He writes, ``I just don't understand why \nCongress cannot do something to help seniors at least maintain a status \nquo.''\n  Linda, a Rhode Islander from Providence, survives on only $500 a \nmonth. Like so many older Americans, Linda takes multiple prescriptions \nevery day. The out-of-pocket costs for her prescriptions add up, even \non Medicare. Between her medical costs, food, heating, and other daily \nexpenses, she can barely make ends meet. Linda would welcome any \nfinancial assistance she can get, so that she can save for copayments \nfor visits to the doctor which she knows she will soon need. Linda says \nshe is disappointed that the Senate does not realize how desperately \nseniors need added financial help.\n  Like Linda, I am disappointed by the vote this past Wednesday. My \ncolleagues failed to act on an opportunity to help our seniors when \nthey need it the most; at a time when just a little help would go a \nlong way.\n  For Jackie, Edward, Linda, and seniors across our country facing \nsimilar challenges, I will continue fighting to assist older Americans \nduring these difficult economic times. I urge my colleagues join me in \nstanding by our Nation's seniors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1307-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1307-S1308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NEW HAMPSHIRE OLYMPIANS\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the athletes from \nNew Hampshire who represented our country at the Olympic games in \nVancouver.\n  As I watched the games over those 2 exciting weeks in February, I \nknow I joined all Granite Staters in celebrating New Hampshire's \nenduring tradition of excellence in winter sports.\n  More than 125 years ago, in 1882, residents of Berlin, NH, formed the \nfirst modern ski club in America.\n  In 1927, the Dartmouth Outing Club organized the first downhill race \nin the United States at Mount Moosilauke in New Hampshire's White \nMountains, where the Outing Club still hikes to this day. The next \nyear, a Dartmouth professor organized the country's first slalom race.\n  In the 1930s and 1940s, as skiing grew in popularity, J-bars and \nchairlifts were added at mountains in Europe, in the West and across \nNew England, but none could rival Cannon Mountain's Aerial Tramway in \nFranconia, which was built by the New Hampshire State Legislature and \ncontinues to be the platform from which millions of visitors first see \nour White Mountain range.\n  At the 1960 winter games in Squaw Valley, CA, 37 years after that \nfirst race in the White Mountains, a 22-year-old from Center Harbor \nnamed Penny Pitou became the first American to win an Olympic medal in \ndownhill. The great ``Skiing Cochrans'' have roots on both sides of the \nConnecticut River, including Barbara Ann, who won a gold medal in 1972, \nher brother Bob, and Bob's son Jimmy, who competed in the slalom in \nVancouver and grew up in Keene.\n  There were 12 athletes on the U.S. team in Vancouver who have strong \nNew Hampshire ties. On the Alpine team, Jimmy Cochran was joined by \nLeanne Smith from Conway and Bode Miller from Franconia, along with \nAndrew Weibrecht, an environmental studies major at Dartmouth.\n  Hillary Knight from Hanover competed in her first Olympics as the \nyoungest member of the U.S. Women's ice hockey team. And from just down \nthe road in Lebanon, Nick Alexander competed in three ski jumping \nevents including the normal hill event, known in the sport as the ``NH \nIndividual.''\n  Kris Freeman from Andover competed in his third Olympic games in \nNordic skiing. Kris trains at Waterville Valley, alongside Michelle \nGorgone and Hannah Kearney, members of the famous Waterville Valley \nBlack & Blue Trail Smashers Club. Snowboarder Scotty Lago from Seabrook \nwent to his first Olympics in Vancouver after years of practice at \nWaterville and Loon. My husband Billy would want me to mention that he \nwent to Dover High School with Jim Westcott, father of snowboarder Seth \nWestcott, who won back-to-back golds in snowboard cross.\n  The New Hampshire medalists at these Vancouver Games were really \nspectacular. Scotty Lago spoke with such pride about representing\n\n[[Page S1308]]\n\nSeabrook and all of New Hampshire when he won a bronze medal in the \nmen's halfpipe competition. We are all very proud of Andrew Weibrecht, \nwho won bronze in the Super-G, and Hillary Knight, who took silver with \nher team.\n  Of course, the State is still celebrating Bode Miller, who, by \nwinning a gold, silver, and bronze medal on the Whistler slopes, became \nthe most decorated American alpine skier in history.\n  But I am proud of every Granite Stater who represented our country in \nthese Games. As someone in elected office, I can tell you that not \nevery race goes exactly how you would like. What is important is that \neach of you has achieved so much through focus and hard work, far away \nfrom the spotlight. You represent the best of our State.\n  Finally, I want to take a moment to recognize Tyler Walker of \nFranconia and Chris Devlin-Young of Campton, who will be skiing for \nTeam USA later this week at the Vancouver Paralympic games. The \nParalymic games continue to shine as an example to the world of what \neach of us can achieve. Thank you for representing our State and our \ncountry. Good luck.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1308-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   MOUNTAIN WEST CONFERENCE CHAMPIONS\n\n Mr. BINGAMAN.

Rothbart Outstanding Early Career \nResearch Scientist Award, which goes to the top scientist who has \nworked for less than 7 years.\n  I commend Dr. Looper for his research on how improved livestock \nmanagement can have a positive economic impact on our rural farmers. \nThrough his research efforts, Dr. Looper represents the best of our \nArkansas values: hard work, dedication, and perseverance. He also \ninspires the next generation of Arkansas leaders as an adjunct \ninstructor of biology and physiology at the University of Arkansas.\n  As a seventh-generation Arkansan and farmer's daughter, and as \nchairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I understand firsthand \nand appreciate the hard work and contributions of our Arkansas \nagriculture community. Agriculture is the backbone of Arkansas's \neconomy, creating more than 270,000 jobs in the State and providing \n$9.1 billion in wages and salaries. In total, agriculture contributes \nroughly $15.9 billion to the Arkansas economy each year.\n  I salute Dr. Looper and the entire Arkansans agriculture community \nfor their hard work and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1308-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNIZING THE ARKANSAS RED CROSS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today, during Red Cross Month, I \nsalute the efforts of the Arkansas Red Cross. The men and women who \nwork in support of our local Red Cross chapters are part of a global \nnetwork that mobilizes during the most devastating of times. They \nprovide comfort and care for those who need it most, whether that need \nis clothing, shelter, or blood.\n  The Arkansas Red Cross exemplifies our Arkansas values of humanity, \ncompassion, and a spirit of giving. Many times throughout the years, I \nhave seen the good work of our Arkansas Red Cross first hand. The \nsacrifice and commitment they make is to be acknowledged and \ncelebrated. On behalf of the people of our State, I thank everyone in \nthe Arkansas Red Cross family, from volunteers to staff members to \ndonors of blood or financial resources.\n  Since 1943, the President of the United States has proclaimed March \nas ``Red Cross Month.'' President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued the \nfirst Red Cross Month proclamation, recognizing the American Red Cross \nas a true reflection of the humanitarian and volunteer spirit and \ncalling on Americans to ``rededicate themselves to the splendid aims \nand activities of the Red Cross.''\n  Mr. President, communities depend on the Red Cross in times of need, \nand the Red Cross depends on the support of the public to achieve its \nmission.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1308-4", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1308]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO KEVIN WATTS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I congratulate Kevin Watts \nof McGehee, AR, for being named Ginner of the Year by the Southern \nCotton Ginners Association. Kevin is an excellent example of Arkansas's \nagriculture tradition. After working with his father in a cotton gin, \nKevin knew by the time he graduated from high school what he wanted to \ndo with the rest of his life.\n  As a seventh-generation Arkansan and farmer's daughter, and as \nchairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee, I understand firsthand \nand appreciate the hard work and contributions of our farm families. \nAgriculture is the backbone of Arkansas's economy, creating more than \n270,000 jobs in the State and providing $9.1 billion in wages and \nsalaries. In total, agriculture contributes roughly $15.9 billion to \nthe Arkansas economy each year.\n  Our farm families are critical to our Nation's economic stability. \nAgriculture is one of the leading U.S. industries in exports, with a \ntrade surplus of $23 billion in fiscal year 2009. We must work to \ncontinue the farm family tradition, so families are able to maintain \ntheir livelihoods and continue to help provide the safe, abundant, and \naffordable food supply that feeds our own country and the world and \nthat is essential to our own economic stability.\n  I salute Kevin and all Arkansas farm families for their hard work and \ndedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1308-5", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1308-S1309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DIANA TILLION\n\n Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I wish to honor Diana \nTillion, of Halibut Cove, AK. I am saddened to report that Diana, a \ntrue Alaskan spirit and invaluable public servant, passed away at home, \nwith her family surrounding her, on February 3, 2010, at the age of 81. \nDiana is remembered by those who knew her as a beloved wife and mother, \npublic servant, teacher, writer, poet, and friend. She is treasured by \nthe people back home as an incredible artist who depicted Alaska's \nbeauty in a unique way. Diana had the ability to create a window \nthrough her art--a window into the impressive and untamed landscape of \nour great State. Any one of her pieces could draw you into that scene \nand that moment in a meaningful and memorable way.\n  Alaska is a vast open land full of breathtaking scenery, wild \nanimals, and diverse terrain. It is also a place that is rich in \nculture. From Alaska's native peoples and the traditions passed down by \ntheir ancestors, to the pioneers of the gold rush, to Alaskans who are \nbreaking new ground today--it is not a place for the faint of heart. \nAlaskans take pride in this, and Diana Tillion undoubtedly understood \nthis sense of pride and shared in it with us.\n  Diana was born in Paradise, CA on June 1, 1928. She migrated north to \nthe\n\n[[Page S1309]]\n\nterritory of Alaska at the age of 11 in 1939, when her stepfather and \nmother found work at the Independence Gold Mine outside of Palmer, AK. \nIn 1942 her family moved to Homer, AK. Before graduating from high \nschool in 1948, Diana had already gained attention and praise for her \nart. In her teens Diana won a juror's choice award for a painting and \nwas paid $100 a great--amount at that time--to paint a mural of Homer \nin the old Yah Sure Club saloon. She was recognized as a promising \nartist and began studying art by correspondence, since, at that time, \nthere was no road access to Homer and the lower Kenai Peninsula. As a \nyoung woman, Diana left Alaska to study under the prominent artists of \nthe time in New York, London, and Paris.\n  In 1952, Diana married an Alaskan commercial fisherman and the love \nof her life, Clem Tillion. Clem proposed to Diana on their first date, \nand they spent 59 wonderful years together. Clem and Diana built their \nlife together in Halibut Cove, a small scenic community located on the \nsouth shore of Kachemak Bay in Prince William Sound--a 6-mile trip by \nboat from Homer. The Tillions had four children: William, Marian, \nMartha, and Vincent. When Alaska celebrated statehood in 1958, Clem \nbecame active in the State legislature and served in both the House and \nSenate. Diana was a key supporter in Clem's political career and \nsuccessfully moved four children back and forth between Halibut Cove \nand Juneau when the State legislature was in session. She maintained \ntheir education as well as her career in the arts throughout this time. \nHer son Vincent has said that she ``supported [Clem] wholeheartedly in \na way many wouldn't be able to do''. The special friendship between \nClem and Diana Tillion was well recognized among political colleagues \nand friends in Juneau.\n  In 1958 Diana discovered a new medium, distinguishing herself as the \nfirst and only known artist to paint with octopus ink. A biologist \nfriend helped her perfect the extraction process so that removing the \nink caused no harm to the creatures found in the lagoon near her home. \nOnce removed, the ink naturally regenerates. Diana was fascinated by \nhow the color of the ink shifted from animal to animal--from purple to \ngold to green. She built an art gallery in Halibut Cove that drew many \nvisitors and renowned artists to the small community over several \ndecades. It was said that Diana turned Halibut Cove into an ``isolated \nhaven'' for Alaska's artists. Diana's work was featured in a solo \nexhibit at the Anchorage Museum in 1971 and her work was shown across \nthe country. She published six books, served as the vice president of \nthe Alaska Council on the Arts and taught art at Homer Community \nCollege for 10 years. Diana influenced many Alaskans through her \ncompassion for art and public service. Her living legacy is apparent \ntoday through her work, family, and those who were fortunate enough to \nhave known her.\n  You can go through life and meet thousands of people, but it is rare \nto meet someone as exceptional as Diana. She was a pioneer, in the \ntruest sense of the word. A lover of Alaska and the people. Diana \npainted her last picture just 8 days before she passed away. She is \nsurvived by her husband Clem, their four children, grandchildren, and \nfriends. Alaskans back home, myself included, are proud of the legacy \nthat is Diana's life and work. The person she was and the beautiful art \nshe left with us will forever be cherished.\n  On behalf of the U.S. Senate, I am proud to recognize and thank Diana \nRutzebeck Tillion for her passion for life and her family, her \noriginality, and years of giving to her community. I extend my \ncondolences and sincere sympathy on her passing to her family, friends, \nand students.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1309-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO CARL TUBBESING\n\n Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, today I honor Carl Tubbesing, \nexecutive director of the National Conference of State Legislatures, \nNCSL, on the occasion of his retirement after 35 years of service. \nCarl's dedication to the ideals of federalism has been steadfast and \nunwavering during the course of his time at NCSL, and his \naccomplishments have been many. His tireless commitment to maintaining \nthe balance among Federal, State and local governments undoubtedly has \nmade a positive impact in the lives of many.\n  I am fortunate to have worked with Carl during my days as chairman of \nthe National Governors Association. Together, we fought to maintain a \nhealthy relationship between Federal and State governments, and to \nensure that the folks in Washington adhered to the same ideals of \nfederalism in which we believed.\n  In 1986, I made a speech as mayor of Cleveland lamenting the fact \nthat while Constitutional federalism was alive in theory, it had died \nin practice. We have made great progress since I gave that speech more \nthan 20 years ago. The comeback story of federalism and our success in \nthe proper delineation of responsibility from Federal centralization to \nlocal control is due, in no small part, to Carl's perseverance and hard \nwork.\n  Carl's efforts to devolve authority for domestic policy from the \nFederal to State level paid off, most notably, with the passage of \nseveral major pieces of legislation. These include the Unfunded \nMandates Reform Act, amendments to the Safe Drinking Water Reform Act, \nwelfare reform, and Medicaid reforms.\n  It is my privilege to recognize Carl Tubbesing for his diligent \ncommitment to federalism and dedicated service to the National \nConference of State Legislatures, and to congratulate him on his well-\ndeserved retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1309-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1309-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1309-4", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1309]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MEASURES READ THE FIRST TIME\n\n  The following bill was read the first time:\n\n       S. 3092.

A bill to require a study and report by the Office of \nAdvocacy of the\n\n[[Page S1313]]\n\nSmall Business Administration regarding the effects of proposed changes \nin patent law; to the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to speak on an \nissue that is of great importance to small businesses and independent \ninventors everywhere--patent reform.\n  I understand that the Senate Judiciary Committee has been hard at \nwork analyzing what reforms would improve the U.S. patent system. One \nof these reforms would involve changing the U.S. from a ``first to \ninvent'' to a ``first to file'' invention priority system. As Chair of \nthe Senate Committee on Small Business & Entrepreneurship, I want to \nensure that Congress' reform will create a patent regime that will not \nunduly burden small businesses and independent inventors, but instead, \nenhance their success as innovators in the U.S. economy.\n  Small businesses represent 99.7 percent of all employers, employing \n\\1/2\\ of the U.S. labor force. These businesses are at the forefront of \nU.S. innovation and have produced over 80 percent of net new jobs in \nthe U.S. economy over the past decade. At a time when our Nation's \neconomy is under stress, we need the help of small businesses in \ncreating new jobs and economic opportunities.\n  Today, we are living in what some call a ``Digital Age'' with an \never-increasing focus on how to incorporate advanced technology into \nour day to day activities. When it comes to advanced technology, small \nbusinesses are also leading the pack in terms of job growth, producing \napproximately 40 percent of all high-tech employment nation-wide.\n  One measurable way of tracking the rate of small business innovation \nin the U.S. is by analyzing patent statistics. For example, small \nbusinesses in the technology sector produce 13 times more patents per \nemployee than large businesses. Additionally, small firm patents \noutperform those of larger firms in a number of key areas, and tend to \nbe cited more frequently as these patents are more original and more \ngeneral. These metrics are important indicators of patent value, and \nindeed small firm patents are tightly linked to growth in the patenting \nfirms.\n  As you can see, the role that small businesses play as innovators in \nour economy is critical to our Nation's overall success as an \ninternational high-tech leader. In order to properly track and \nunderstand how changes to the U.S. patent system will impact our small \ninnovators, I am introducing the Small Business Patent Data Collection \nAct of 2010. This legislation will direct the Small Business \nAdministration's Office of Advocacy to conduct a study in consultation \nwith the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to analyze how changes to the \ncurrent system will impact the ability of small businesses to obtain \npatents, whether the change would create barriers, and how it will \nimpact the costs and benefits to small businesses overall.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3089\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to reduce the deficit by establishing discretionary \ncaps for non-security spending; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I come to the floor this evening to \nannounce the introduction of a bill, S. 3095. It is called the Honest \nExpenditure Limitation Act of 2010. It spells HELP. It is the HELP Act \nof 2010.\n  On February 1 of 2010, President Obama released his fiscal year 2011 \nbudget with a funding request of $3.8 trillion. In it he announced a 3-\nyear freeze on discretionary spending for all nonsecurity-related \nagencies at the fiscal year 2010 levels, which amounts to a total \nspending level of $460 billion each year for those agencies. \nNonsecurity spending is defined as all agencies except the Department \nof Defense, the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of \nVeterans Affairs, the Department of State, and one of the national \nsecurity-related agencies in the Department of Energy. The \nadministration's Office of Management and Budget estimates this \ninitiative will save $250 billion over the coming decade. Keep in mind, \nthat is $250 billion from where it started, which I will address in a \nminute.\n  On the surface, this proposal gives the President the appearance of \nbeing fiscally prudent--something the American people have been \ndemanding of their government, especially in recent months. But when \nyou look closely at the numbers he has presented, it is clear as day \nwhy he is able to offer this spending freeze without batting an eye. \nFor one, discretionary spending has increased by 20 percent in 2 years. \nSecondly, the massive $787 billion stimulus package provided a \nsubstantial spending cushion for nearly every agency, making a spending \nfreeze such as the President's inconsequential.\n  Let's stop and look at that. We are talking about $787 billion in a \nstimulus bill, but we are also talking about having increased from \nfiscal year 2008 to fiscal year 2010 by 20 percent. So what he is doing \nhere is raising it 20 percent and then freezing it. What he ought to \ndo, if he had to raise it 20 percent, is start bringing it down.\n  Additionally, this spending freeze proposal does too little to \nimprove the long-term fiscal aspects of our Nation. We all know we \nstand at the edge of disaster. Doug Elmendorf, who is the Director of \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, recently testified about \nour Nation's fiscal outlook before Congress and he didn't deliver very \ngood news. I will tell my colleagues what he said. He said that last \nyear our budget deficit was a staggering $1.4 trillion. Remember, just \na minute ago I said if you add up all of the--well, let's say that is \nactually more than all of the last 6 years of the Bush administration \ndeficits. That amounts to less than the $1.4 trillion. So he said last \nyear our budget deficit was a staggering $1.4 trillion, which \nrepresented\n\n[[Page S1314]]\n\nabout 10 percent of the total economy. He expects 2010's deficit only \nslightly lower at $1.3 trillion or 9.2 percent of GDP.\n  Looking further out, the average deficit between now and 2020 is \nforecast to be $600 billion per year. This is all coming from \nElmendorf. This is the CBO we are talking about. Additionally, CBO \nestimates the amount of debt held by the public will skyrocket to $15 \ntrillion by 2020. If it sounds like a staggering number, that is \nbecause it is. When you consider the amount of interest we will be \npaying to China and Japan and others, it is embarrassing: $700 billion \neach and every year until 2020 and beyond if we do nothing about our \nrising deficit levels. In other words, if we keep on what we are doing \nright now with this administration, with the help of the Democratic \nlegislators in both Houses, it is going to be $700 trillion.\n  Let's do the math and put that in perspective. If $700 billion of \ninterest were paid evenly by every household in the United States \ntoday, it would amount to more than $6,000 per household. That is kind \nof interesting. I always try to do my math. When I was fighting the \neffort by this administration to have a cap-and-trade bill which would \nhave been somewhere between $300 billion and $400 billion, whether you \nare talking about the McCain-Lieberman cap-and-trade bill of 2003 or \nthe McCain-Lieberman bill of 2005 or the bills of 2008, or later on the \nBoxer-Sanders bill, or even going back to Kyoto, it is going to cost \nsomewhere between $300 billion and $400 billion. I understand when we \ntalk about billions and trillions of dollars what we are really talking \nabout. So I do my math all the time and say, How much is this going to \ncost my average taxpaying families in my State of Oklahoma? It amounted \nto $3,100 a year. This would have been, if they had been successful in \npassing a cap-and-trade bill--it is all dead now. They are not going to \ndo it. I don't care what Senator Lindsey Graham and Senator John Kerry \nsay, it is history now. People are not going to pay that kind of thing \nto get nothing for it.\n  Back when we were talking about the $700 billion interest that would \nbe paid every year, that is what is going to happen by 2020 with this \nadministration if we let it continue. That would cost each tax-paying \nfamily in the United States of America $6,000 per household each and \nevery year after 2020.\n  Put another way: The entire financial industry bailout--remember the \nfamous bank bailout? I know Republicans were partially responsible for \nthat too. That happened. That vote took place in this Senate on October \n1 of 2008. It was back during the Bush administration. It was back when \nHank Paulson came in and told everybody that he was going to save our \nNation and so Republicans bought into it and many of my good \nconservative Republican friends voted for a $700 billion bailout. I did \nnot and a few others didn't, but a vast majority did. That is kind of \ninteresting because that $700 billion is the same figure we are using \nright now that it will cost people by the year 2020--just the interest \nalone. But the $700 billion that we could spend on interest in 2020 \nhappens each and every year. We don't get anything for it. It is the \ncost of living having this much debt in the first place.\n  At this rate, it will become more and more difficult for the \ngovernment to fund priorities we truly think are important, such as \nnational security and infrastructure spending. For some reason, nobody \naround here wants to spend money on infrastructure. I know I get \ncriticized. I am considered to be a conservative. I have been rated the \nNo. 1 most conservative Member of the Senate some time ago by the \nAmerican Conservative Union and just last week by the National Journal. \nSo you are looking at a conservative, but I am a big spender on some \nthings. One is protecting America. That is what we are supposed to be \ndoing around here. The other is infrastructure. We have a crumbling \ninfrastructure system. Look what happened with some of the bridges \ncrumbling down. I guess that was in Minnesota. People died up there. \nOur infrastructure is crumbling. It is aging. We need to do something \nabout it, but I can't find anyone who wants to spend money on \ninfrastructure. Instead we are spending money on social engineering.\n  To combat this, several proposals have been recently introduced that \nI support. In the House, Congressman Pence and Congressmen Hensarling \nintroduced a constitutional amendment that would cap the Federal \nspending at 20 percent of the economy--20 percent of GDP. It is one way \nof doing this. I think it is a good idea. I am all for it. \nAdditionally, Senator DeMint introduced an amendment requiring a \nbalanced budget. I am all for that. Some of my colleagues are \nsupporting a year-long earmark moratorium. That is kind of phony. It \nwas reported on Monday that Speaker Pelosi has suggested a year-long \nearmark moratorium as well. My colleagues need to consider a couple of \nissues in talking about earmarks.\n  One, an earmark moratorium does nothing to combat the increasing \ngovernment spending. In other words, if you have a moratorium on \nearmarks, it doesn't save a cent. Funding that would have been spent in \nearmarks will simply be spent by the Obama administration, by their \nbureaucrats. I suppose it should come as no surprise that Speaker \nPelosi supports the Democratic administration fully funding its own \npriorities.\n  Secondly, last year's earmarks accounted for only 1.5 percent of \ndiscretionary spending--1.5 percent. Where is the focus on the other \n98.5 percent? Where is the focus on what I call bureaucratic earmarks? \nHere is what happens. If you stop earmarks--if you read the \nConstitution, article I, section 9 of the Constitution, it says what we \nare supposed to be doing here in the House and in the Senate. We are \nsupposed to be making priorities. We are supposed to be doing the \nspending, and our Founding Fathers recognize that we do a better job \nknowing what our needs are in the local communities than the central \ngovernment does.\n  If we let the President and the President's budget dictate everything \nand then we try to make changes within that, people will say, Oh, that \nis an earmark. Well, wait a minute. If you don't do that, then you are \nhaving the unelected bureaucrats in government in the Obama \nadministration do the earmarking. So the President earmarks too. If you \ndon't believe it, look at the Appropriations Conference Report, where \nthe focus is on the vast majority of discretionary spending which is \ndoled out every year by unelected bureaucrats.\n  I wish more people would understand this, because I find that a lot \nof the people who hammer and demagog the earmark mantra are the ones \nwho are the biggest spenders and it is a nice way of deviating from \nyour behavior. I think something needs to be done immediately and \nseriously.\n  So today I am introducing the HELP Act, as I mentioned. It is called \nthe Honest Expenditure Limitation Program Act of 2010. The bill does \nthree things. One, it places caps on nonsecurity discretionary spending \nwhich I define exactly as President Obama's budget does. I do this \nbecause I wish to show the similarities between what he said he wants \nto do and what I want to do. The second thing is it enforces the caps \nby sequestering any spending above the cap through across-the-board \ncuts, a process that currently applies to mandatory spending, but not \nto discretionary. Three, it disallows Congress from evading the \nsequestration cuts through a 67-vote point of order against any attempt \nto exempt new spending from this legislation. That is going to make it \npretty tough to get through.\n  Rather than simply freezing the spending as the President wants to do \nat the 2010 levels--let's keep in mind, first, he increased \ndiscretionary spending for a year by 20 percent, and then he wants to \nfreeze it there.\n  Instead of doing that for 3 years and then allowing spending to \nexplode again, which is what his proposal does, my bill would actually \ncut discretionary spending for nonsecurity agencies, the same \nexemptions he has, back to fiscal year 2008 levels. It is cutting it \nback by 20 percent of what he tries to do, about $400 billion a year. \nSpending would be frozen for 5 years--not 3 years but 5 years, through \n2020. Rather than simply freezing spending levels for only 3 years and \nat an artificially high level, as the President's proposal does, my \ninitiative would hold the Federal Government more accountable for the \nnext\n\n[[Page S1315]]\n\n10 years by creating real, meaningful spending cuts and then placing \nthe cap at reduced levels.\n  The difference in savings between my plan and President Obama's plan \nis clearly displayed on this chart.\n  If we look at the chart, the blue bars represent how nonsecurity-\nrelated discretionary spending levels will rise over the next 10 years \nif allowed to increase. This is according to OMB's numbers.\n  The red line illustrates the impact of Obama's plan and what will \nhappen if spending is allowed to increase following the 3-year freezing \non the estimates of OMB, the Office of Management and Budget. They are \nnonpartisan, by the way, and very accurate. Clearly, the $250 billion \nin savings is not substantial when spread over a 10-year period. It \nreally does not tighten the belt at all.\n  My proposal is represented in the green bars. These are the spending \nlevels. Watch as they go down over the period of time from 2010 to \n2020. We phase down spending levels from the high point in 2010 to a \nmore reasonable level between 2011 and 2015 and then stay flat \nthereafter.\n  My plan, when compared to the blue bars of doing nothing, will save \nmore than $880 billion over the next 10 years. Let me say that again. \nBy reducing nonsecurity discretionary spending levels, using the same \ndefinition of ``nonsecurity'' as the President is using, to 2008 levels \nand then holding them there through 2020, our Nation can save nearly $1 \ntrillion. When I compare my plan directly with President Obama's, my \nplan saves $634 billion more than his.\n  I have made my estimates using the methodologies of the Office of \nManagement and Budget, and they are probably conservative. First off, \nif you look at the history of discretionary spending, annual increases \nare far greater than what they assume they are here. Second, we do not \nestimate how much we would be saving in interest by not having to \nborrow the spending we are cutting. Overall, this proposal will likely \nsave much more than the nearly $1 trillion we estimate.\n  If we do nothing to curtail skyrocketing government spending or \nmerely freeze it at an artificially high, elevated level for a few \nyears, as the Obama administration is trying to do, we will find \nourselves in a tragic situation. The clock is ticking. Congress is \ngoing to have to act.\n  Some of my colleagues will probably attack this proposal because the \nhardest thing to do around here is cut spending. Without cutting \nspending, we only leave one alternative, and that is massively raising \ntaxes. That is not what the American people want, and it would harm our \neconomic recovery.\n  Around these halls, we seem to forget. Most of the Members of the \nSenate have forgotten the recess last August when they had all the tea \nparties out there and people were yelling and screaming and people \nwanted to get involved. People were getting involved in politics who \nnever had been involved before. They were concerned primarily about two \nissues. At that time, it was government-run health care and cap-and-\ntrade, which would have been the largest tax increase in the history of \nthis country.\n  Right now, the Obama administration is saying: I don't care what \nanybody says, we are going to stay with it; we are going to be tough; \nwe are going to have this government-run health care system and bring \nback cap-and-trade. They have just completely forgotten what happened.\n  I have to agree with Senator McConnell. I hope people remember that \nall the way through the election because that is going to repeat what I \nremember in 1994.\n  Others may charge this proposal will harm the government's ability to \nhelp citizens in their time of need. But what is important to realize \nabout this spending reduction is that it will have no impact on \nmandatory spending programs such as unemployment benefits, Social \nSecurity, Medicare, and Medicaid. Those programs are in need of reform, \nbut this bill does not do that. This bill only affects the agencies \nidentified by President Obama as nonsecurity.\n  My bill, the HELP Act of 2010, would take President Obama's proposed \nspending freeze and truly make an impact. Rather than merely freezing \nspending at the inflated 20-percent increase of the 2010 levels, this \nwould bring it back down to 2008. I think this can be done.\n  I really do believe the American people are going to start getting \ninvolved. They have not forgotten. I was giving a speech in Florida. \nThis particular group was actually Club for Growth. Their group is \nconcerned about spending. I told them some of the things we could be \ndoing, some of the things to watch out for. Watch out for those who say \nyou can have a moratorium on earmarks and somehow affect--if you \naffected all of that, it would be something like 1.5 percent. My bill \naffects the other 98.5 percent.\n  We are going to have to do it right now. If we wait, each month that \ngoes by--as I said, the budget he increased and his deficit was as much \nas the last 6 entire years of the Bush administration.\n  This is the HELP Act. It is one that will work, and it is one that \nhas come along at the right time. Now is the time to act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/09/senate-section/article/S1315-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1315-S1316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 448--REAUTHORIZING THE JOHN HEINZ SENATE FELLOWSHIP \n                                PROGRAM\n\n  Mr. SPECTER (for himself and Mr. Casey) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                              S. Res. 448\n\n       Resolved,\n\n     SECTION 1. JOHN HEINZ SENATE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM.\n\n       Senate Resolution 356, 102d Congress, agreed to October 7, \n     1992, is amended by striking section 5 and inserting the \n     following:\n\n     ``SEC. 5. FUNDS.\n\n       ``There are authorized to be appropriated to carry out the \n     provisions of this resolution $85,000 for each of fiscal \n     years 2005 through 2014.''.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to submit a \nresolution reauthorizing the John Heinz Senate Fellowship Program. This \nCongressional fellowship program, created in 1992, is a fitting tribute \nto my late colleague and dear friend, United States Senator John Heinz. \nSenator Heinz dedicated his life and much of his Congressional career \nto improving the lives of senior citizens. He believed that Congress \nhas a special responsibility to serve as a guardian for those who \ncannot protect themselves. This fellowship program, which focuses on \naging issues, honors the life and continues the legacy of Senator \nHeinz.\n  During his 20 years in the Congress, John Heinz compiled an enviable \nrecord of accomplishments. While he was successful in many areas, he \nbuilt a national reputation for his strong commitment to improving the \nquality of life of our Nation's elderly. Pennsylvania, with nearly 2 \nmillion citizens aged 65 or older--over 15 percent of the population--\nhouses the third largest elderly population nationwide. As John \ntraveled throughout the State, he listened to the concerns of this \nimportant constituency and came back to Washington to address their \nneeds through policy and legislation.\n  Senator Heinz led the fight against age discrimination by championing \nlegislation to eliminate the requirement that older Americans must \nretire at age 65, and by ensuring full retirement pay for older workers \nemployed by factories forced to close. During his Chairmanship of the \nSenate Special Committee on Aging from 1981-1986 and his tenure as \nRanking Minority Member from 1987-1991, Senator Heinz used his position \nto improve health care accessibility and affordability for senior \ncitizens and to reduce fraud and abuse within Federal health care \nprograms. Congress enacted his legislation to provide Medicare \nrecipients a lower cost alternative to fee-for-service medicine, as \nwell as his legislation to add a hospice benefit to the Medicare \nprogram.\n  John also recognized the great need for nursing home reforms. He was \nsuccessful in passing legislation mandating that safety measures be \nimplemented in nursing homes and ensuring that nursing home residents \ncannot be bound and tied to their beds or wheelchairs.\n  The John Heinz Senate Fellowship Program will help continue the \nefforts of Senator Heinz to give our Nation's elderly the quality of \nlife they deserve. The program encourages the identification and \ntraining of new leadership in\n\n[[Page S1316]]\n\naging policy by awarding fellowships to qualified candidates to serve \nin a Senate office or with a Senate Committee. The goal of this program \nis to advance the development of public policy in issues affecting \nsenior citizens. Administered by the Heinz Family Foundation in \nconjunction with the Secretary of the Senate, the program allows \nfellows to bring their firsthand experience in aging issues to the work \nof Congress. Heinz fellows who are advocates for aging issues spend a \nyear to help us learn about the effects of Federal policies on our \nelderly citizens, those who are social workers help us find better ways \nto protect our Nation's elderly from abuse and neglect, and those who \nare health care providers help us to build a strong health care system \nthat addresses the unique needs of our seniors.\n  The Heinz fellowship enables us to train new leaders in senior \ncitizen advocacy and aging policy. The fellows return to their \nrespective careers with a new understanding about how to work \neffectively with government, so they may better fulfill their goals as \nsenior citizen advocates.\n  The John Heinz Senate Fellowship Program has been a valuable tool for \nCongress and our communities since its establishment in 1992.
