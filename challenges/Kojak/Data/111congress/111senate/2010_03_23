Mr. President, I now move to proceed to H.R. 4872 and ask \nfor the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, if the Chair would indulge me a couple \nof parliamentary inquiries, which won't delay the process very long.\n  As I understand it, the budget resolution instructed two Senate \ncommittees to report changes in law to reduce the deficit by $1 billion \neach over the next 5 years. The reconciliation instruction states that \nthey were to report those changes by October 15, 2009, and that those \nmeasures are then sent to the Budget Committee to report the final \nmeasure. It is my understanding that nothing has been reported to date. \nTherefore, my inquiry is: Has the Budget Committee reported any \nreconciliation legislation to the Senate pursuant to the current budget \nresolution, S. Con. Res. 13?\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It has not.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the answer is: No, it has not?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Correct.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, one other parliamentary inquiry: My \nunderstanding is, each time the Senate has taken up a reconciliation \nbill on the floor, a Senate committee has reported a bill to the \nSenate, either through the Budget Committee or directly from the \ncommittee instructed. Therefore, my question to the Chair is: Is this \nthe first time in history the Senate will consider a reconciliation \neven though no Senate committee has reported a bill to the Senate?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. It is the first time that the Chair \nis aware of it.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nand the Senator from New Mexico (Mr. Udall) are necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Utah (Mr. Bennett) and the Senator from Georgia (Mr. Isakson).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand).

Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4872) to provide for reconciliation pursuant \n     to Title II of the concurrent resolution on the budget for \n     fiscal year 2010, S. Con. Res. 13.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, for the information of all Senators--and \nI might ask the Senator from New Hampshire if he agrees--it is probably \nbest to alternate the time back and forth on each side with roughly \none-half hour blocks of time, if that meets the approval of the \nminority.\n  Mr. GREGG. I would suggest we do that for the first 2 hours, at least \nuntil we see how this is evolving. So the first half hour will go to \nthe majority and the second half hour will go to the Republican side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. That would be my intention.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this morning President Obama signed a \nlaw that will guarantee meaningful insurance reform, such as coverage \nfor people with preexisting conditions. He signed comprehensive health \ncare reform into law. Many of us have dreamed of that day for years. \nNow it is a fact. Now it is law. Now it is history. Indeed, it is \nhistoric. He signed a law that will ensure that average people without \ninsurance will get health insurance choices just as Members of Congress \ndo. This morning, President Obama signed a law that will control the \ngrowth of health care costs in years to come.\n  Today, we have before us a bill to improve the new law. We do not \nhave before us the whole health care reform bill. We do not have to \nreopen every argument we had over the last 2 years. We do not have to \nsay everything we said about health care one more time. Rather, we have \na bill before us that will do a few good things.\n  We have before us a bill that will improve affordability by \nincreasing tax credits to help pay for insurance premiums--increase \nthose tax credits. We have before us a bill that will help with out-of-\npocket costs for lower and middle-income families; that is, to raise \nthe assistance. We have before us a bill that will increase aid to \nStates to help them shoulder the costs of covering Americans under \nMedicaid. We have before us a bill that will give additional help to \nStates that took extra steps to cover the uninsured before reform took \nplace. Together, these improvements will level the playing field among \nStates under health care reform.\n  We have before us a bill that will make sure no State is singled out \nfor special treatment. We have before us a bill that will completely \nclose the doughnut hole; that is, the coverage gap for Medicare \nprescription drug coverage. It is closed by the end of the budget \nwindow. We have before us a bill that will start with a $250 increase \nin Federal assistance toward coverage of the doughnut hole right away, \nthis year, 2010. We have before us a bill that will fight fraud and \nfight waste and abuse in Medicare and Medicaid.\n  That is the bill we have before us today. This is not the whole \nhealth care reform bill; this is a set of commonsense improvements to \nthat new law signed by the President earlier today. I do not expect \nopponents of the bill to talk about these commonsense improvements. \nFrankly, it is pretty difficult to understand why Senators would want \nto oppose these commonsense improvements. Rather, if this debate is \nanything like the debate so far, opponents of this bill will try to \nchange the subject. When people look at what health reform really does, \nthey are more likely to support it, when they separate truth from \nfiction, separate the wheat from the chaff. So I expect that opponents \nof this bill will try to distract observers from what is really going \non.\n  Rather than talk about commonsense improvements to this bill, \nopponents will talk about the process. Over the 2 years we have been \nworking on health care reform, there have been many on the other side \nwho have sought to make the debate about process--not about what is in \nthe bill, what improves people's lives, but about the process, the \nlegislative process. They have sought to emphasize how messy the \nlegislative process is--and sometimes it is a bit messy--and, of \ncourse, criticizing how Congress works is a heck of a lot easier than \nimproving health care for the American people. Many opponents of health \ncare reform are obsessed with process and procedure.\n  I am much more focused on the people whom health care reform will \nhelp. I am focused on people such as Pat and her late husband Dan from \nLincoln County in the northwestern corner of Montana.\n  Pat and Dan used to have a ranch in southwestern Lincoln County. Dan \nwas the fourth generation of his family to run the ranch. He grew up on \nthe ranch, and he worked very hard every day of his life.\n  In 2000, the doctors told Dan he had Hodgkin's lymphoma, but Pat and \nDan did not have health insurance. Dan never took a handout, and Pat \nand Dan thought they could handle their bills on their own. That is the \nway they had always lived. That is the way a lot of people--I daresay \nmost people--live. Then the medical bills started piling up. Swallowing \nhis pride, Dan made what he called the hardest decision of his life: he \nfiled for Medicaid. The State told him the only way they could be \neligible for Medicaid was to put a lien on their ranch. As Dan's \nmedical bills piled out of control, Pat and Dan were forced to sell \ntheir land. Pat said the cancer ravaged her husband's body. But selling \ntheir ranch to pay for medical costs broke his spirit. That is why we \nneed to enact health care reform.\n\n  Most bankruptcies in America these days are related to medical costs. \nJust think of that: Most bankruptcies in America today are related to \nmedical costs. No one in America should have to sell everything they \nhave, no one should have to go bankrupt just to pay medical bills.\n  But I am not going to let the opponents' charges about the process go \nunanswered either. The idea that health care reform has been some sort \nof rush job is a total myth. It is a myth that deserves busting.\n  The facts are, the Finance Committee and the HELP Committee--\ncommittees with jurisdiction on health care reform--each went through a \nfull and transparent process to consider health care reform \nlegislation. By that I mean fully open, totally open to the public at \nall points. This has been the fullest and most transparent process for \nany major piece of legislation in memory.\n  I might say, a journalist once approached me about a year ago and \nsaid: Senator, are you starting a new trend with such openness and such \ntransparency, putting all the amendments on the Web, 8 days' notice; is \nthat a whole new approach the Senate is going to pursue from now on?\n  I said: I don't know, but I think it is the right thing to do today. \nFrom the start, I wanted us to develop a bipartisan consensus package. \nI wanted to work together. When someone gets ill or gets cancer, he or \nshe is not a member of one party or the other. It is personal. We have \nto work together. That is what the American public wants. That is what \nI tried so hard to do. I wanted a bill that would have broad political \nsupport across the political spectrum.\n\n[[Page S1823]]\n\n  There has been a long tradition in the Republican Party in favor of \ncomprehensive health care reform. That tradition stretches back to \nTheodore Roosevelt, to Richard Nixon, to Bob Dole, and to John Chafee. \nI believe what we set out to do and what we have done fits comfortably \nwithin the tradition of what those Republican leaders sought to do.\n  We began almost 2 years ago. On May 6, 2008, we held our first \nhearings in a series on health care reform. In fact, the Finance \nCommittee held 11 hearings in a series in 2008 alone. We held those \nhearings to help Senators come to a commonsense understanding of the \nhealth care crisis; to help explain why we are in such a crisis, what \nneeds to be done, how the various parts of our health care system work, \nand what parts do not work. I held these hearings purely from an \neducational point of view, not an ideological point of view. I held \nthem to educate all of us on the committee to get us ready for 2009. It \nwas clear to me this Congress was going to work very hard and pass \nhealth care reform. We sought in the last Congress to lay the \ngroundwork for passing the bill in this Congress.\n  On June 16, 2008, nearly 2 years ago, Senator Grassley, my good \nfriend and ranking member of the committee, and I convened a bipartisan \nhealth reform summit at the Library of Congress. We called it ``Prepare \nfor Launch, Health Care Reform Summit of 2008.'' Chairman Ben Bernanke \nwas there. Other notables were there. It was a full-day conference with \nmembers of the Finance Committee from both sides of the aisle to help \nus better understand how to solve our health care reform crisis. I was \nvery impressed that all day long most Senators stayed. Late in the \nafternoon, I counted a majority of Senators on both sides still there \nasking questions of experts.\n  Senator Grassley and I have brought some of the best minds in the \ncountry together to discuss health care reform. Senators from both \nsides of the aisle have engaged in open and constructive discussion.\n  Then right after the 2008 election, on November 12, 2008, this \nSenator released an 89-page blueprint on health care reform. I have it \nright here. We named it ``Call to Action: Health Reform 2009.'' It was \na comprehensive framework for health care reform. We posted that \nblueprint on the Internet for all to read.\n  The ideas in that white paper reflected the broad consensus of \nthinking among health care efforts. We searched far and wide. What is \nthe best thinking; what do other countries do. While looking at what \nother countries do, we clearly wanted to come up with a uniquely \nAmerican solution. We are America. We are not Canada. We are not Great \nBritain. We are not Ireland. We are America. We spent about $2.5 \ntrillion on health care in America with public Medicaid, Medicare, and \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program and private, commercial health \ninsurance. I wanted to maintain that same balance with a uniquely \nAmerican solution. They are reflected in this white paper.\n  The ideas in that white paper remain the foundations of health care \nreform that became law this morning. That is a strong statement to \nmake, but it is true--almost all the ideas all committees on both sides \nof the Congress have enacted and what are in the bill the President \nsigned today.\n  Of course, there are changes here and there. But the basic foundation \nin that white paper--this white paper right here that was put together \nin November 2008--remains the foundation of the health care bill that \nbecame law this morning.\n  The ideas behind our health care reform legislation have been \navailable for all Senators and the public to consider for more than 16 \nmonths.\n  The Washington Post called our white paper ``striking in both its \ntiming and scope.'' The Washington Post said:\n\n       Rarely, if ever, has a lawmaker with his clout moved so \n     early--eight days after the election of a new president--to \n     press for such an enormous undertaking.\n\n  Then in April and May of last year, Senator Grassley and I released \nthree bipartisan health care reform policy papers on the three major \nareas of reform. What are they? First, delivery system reform; second, \ninsurance coverage; and third, options for financing. Once again, we \nmade these papers public and posted them on the Finance Committee's Web \nsite.\n  Senator Grassley and I convened three open, televised bipartisan \nroundtable discussions with experts on those subjects. We held several \nday-long meetings of Finance Committee Senators to discuss the topics \nof those policy papers.\n  On April 20, 2009, the New York Times reported:\n\n       In setting forth detailed ``policy options'' and inviting \n     public comment, Mr. Baucus and Mr. Grassley set a precedent \n     for openness.\n  On May 18, 2009, the newspaper Politico reported on our efforts to \nbuild consensus. Politico said that my ``frequent progress reports to \nreporters always include some discussion of keeping peace in the \ndelicate alliance of Republicans, Democrats, industry, labor, \nphysicians and consumer advocates.''\n  That is so true. From the outset, I worked hard to keep all the \ngroups talking to each other. That was a shortcoming back in the early \nnineties when health care reform fell apart, when the groups proposed \nthe bills. By ``the groups,'' I mean consumer groups, hospitals, labor, \nmedical device manufacturers, nursing homes--all the groups. I called \nup their CEOs and kept talking with them constantly: What do you think? \nA problem here? Let's make an adjustment. Stay at the table. Don't walk \naway from the table. Suspend judgment for 5 minutes. Let's find a way \nto put this together that is in everybody's best interest, America's \nbest interest, if this passed.\n  I had more than 142 meetings, both one on one and in groups, to \ndiscuss health care reform with Senators on both sides of the aisle. In \nall, those meetings added up to more than 150 hours of discussions.\n  I tried to work out a bipartisan package with the Finance Committee. \nI started, as I always do, with the ranking Republican member of the \nFinance Committee, my good friend, Chuck Grassley. Since the Finance \nCommittee and the HELP Committee share jurisdiction over health care, \nSenator Grassley and I agreed we wanted to include the ranking \nRepublican member of the HELP Committee, Mike Enzi, and our colleague, \nJeff Bingaman, who is also a member of both those two committees. As \nwell, we reached out to the chairman of the Budget Committee, Kent \nConrad, and the ranking Republican member of the Small Business \nCommittee, Senator Olympia Snowe, both of whom are also members of the \nFinance Committee. Both Senators Conrad and Snowe have a long history \nof working across the aisle to reach a consensus. We also reached out \nto Senator Kennedy, then-chairman of the HELP Committee. We had \nmeetings with him, all the relevant chairmen and ranking members \ntogether, meeting over in the other part of the Capitol with Senator \nKennedy. How gracious he was and how he wanted to work together. He was \nnot trying to do it for Ted Kennedy but for people who needed health \ncare. It was very touching.\n  It ended up we had a group of six Senators--three Democrats and three \nRepublicans. We worked hard. We rolled up sleeves and plowed through \nthe issues. We met 31 times for 63 hours over the course of 4 months.\n  Many have said we met too long. Many said I should have broken up my \ndiscussions with my colleagues. But I wanted to go the extra mile. I \nwanted to try. I wanted to bend over backwards. I wanted to do \neverything I could to reach a bipartisan consensus. Why? Because that \nis the right thing to do.\n  That group of six Senators came very close to an agreement. We did \nnot end up reaching an agreement among all six of us, but I took the \nproduct of those bipartisan discussions, areas of tentative agreement, \nand made them the starting point for our committee markup; that is, the \ngroup of six helped forge through immense hours of discussing major \nimprovements on our thinking.\n  We converted that product into a committee mark. I made that mark \npublic and posted it online on the Finance Committee's Web site on \nSeptember 16, 2009. That was a full 6 days before the markup and 4 days \nlonger than committee rules require.\n  For the first time in history, on September 19, the Finance Committee\n\n[[Page S1824]]\n\nposted online every amendment submitted to the clerk. We posted the \nfull text of all 564 amendments. Members of the committee and the \npublic had 3 days to review the amendments and prepare for the markup.\n  Our Finance Committee markup stretched over 8 days. They were fully \npublic. We worked well past 10 p.m. on most of the those days. The \nmarkup was the longest that the Finance Committee has conducted on any \nbill in 22 years.\n  Prior to the markup, I accepted 122 amendments as part of a modified \nchairman's mark; 26 of those amendments incorporated into the mark came \nfrom Republican colleagues.\n  During the markup, the committee considered 135 amendments. The \ncommittee accepted 41 amendments and rejected 55.\n  On October 2, 2009, a full 11 days prior to a committee vote on the \nbill, I posted online the mark, as amended.\n  On October 13, 2009, the Finance Committee ordered the bill reported \nby a bipartisan vote of 14 to 9.\n  The majority leader then melded the Finance Committee and HELP \nCommittee work products into a single bill. The majority leader moved \nto proceed to the bill on November 19 of last year. We had a full and \nopen debate on the bill on the Senate floor, and on December 24 of last \nyear, Christmas Eve, more than a month later, the Senate finally passed \nhealth care reform.\n  I have taken some time to detail the long legislative history of this \neffort, and I did so because I believe that any fair observer of this \nlegislative history will draw three conclusions: One, we tried mightily \nto work with our Republican colleagues to reach a broad consensus bill. \nWe went the extra mile. We bent over backwards, and for a variety of \nreasons, our Republican colleagues simply did not want to be part, in \nthe end, of this effort.\n  Two, nobody rushed this bill. This has been a full and deliberative \nprocess--about 2 years. There is no way that health care reform was \n``rammed'' through the Congress. No way. Not true.\n  Three, we have conducted a process more open than for any other major \npiece of legislation in the modern Senate. But opponents of the bill \nhave tried to raise as many charges as they can. They have tried to \nthrow as much mud at this effort as they can, hoping that something \nsticks.\n  Their latest attack has been to criticize the use of the budget \nreconciliation process for the bill before us today. Some have charged \nthat using reconciliation is somehow unusual. They argue that using \nbudget reconciliation for health care is somehow unheard of. And they \nargue that we never use reconciliation for major bills. Nothing could \nbe further from the truth.\n  Is reconciliation unusual? The answer is clearly no. Budget \nreconciliation is a pretty common process in Congress. Since Congress \nbegan using the budget reconciliation process in 1980, some 30 years \nago, Congress has passed some 23 reconciliation bills--23 in the last \n30 years. Thus, most years have seen reconciliation bills. It is an \nexceptional year that Congress does not pass a reconciliation bill.\n  What about health care? Is health care something unusual for \nreconciliation? Once again, the answer is no.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service took a survey of the \n22 reconciliation bills that made it through Congress to the \nPresident's desk. Of those 22 reconciliation bills, CRS, the \nCongressional Research Service, identified 12 of them with titles or \nother major legislative components pertaining to Medicare or Medicaid \nPrograms. In other words, most reconciliation bills have addressed \nhealth care. Once again, it is the exceptional case where a \nreconciliation bill does not contain health care matters.\n  What about major health care legislation? Is major health care \nlegislation in reconciliation unusual? No. Once again the answer is no. \nCRS counted the number of pages in the law books on health care that \nthe reconciliation process has put there. It was not a small number. \nCRS found that bills enacted using the reconciliation process \ncontributed some 1,366 pages on health care to the Statutes at Large. \nCRS found that the average reconciliation bill with health care in it \ncontributed some 124 pages to the Statutes at Large.\n  Pages in Statutes at Large have more words than bills do, so these \npages reflect far more pages than in bill text.\n  Let's consider some of the major changes through health care that \nCongress has enacted in the last 30 years. There is COBRA, a health \ninsurance program for people who lose their jobs. Congress enacted the \nCOBRA health insurance program as part of a reconciliation bill. COBRA \nstands for the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act--\nreconciliation. A Republican-controlled Senate passed the COBRA health \ninsurance program as part of reconciliation in 1986. Since then, three \nlater reconciliation bills have amended the COBRA continuation coverage \nrules. Congress changed COBRA in reconciliation bills in years 1989, \n1990, and again in 1993.\n  Another one of the largest health care expansions that Congress \nenacted in the last 30 years was the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, otherwise known as CHIP. Once again, we enacted it--you got it \nright--in reconciliation. Congress enacted CHIP as part of the Balanced \nBudget Act of 1997. Once again, it was a Republican-controlled Senate \nthat passed the Children's Health Insurance Program as part of \nreconciliation in 1997.\n  Then there is the Medicare Advantage Program. Medicare Advantage, or \nMedicare+Choice they called it then, was a major change in Medicare, \nintroducing private insurance companies into the system. Once again, a \nRepublican-controlled Senate passed that in reconciliation in 1997.\n  It is hard to think of a major health insurance expansion that has \nnot involved reconciliation. Sure, there were some. But it is an \nexceptional case where Congress enacts major changes to health care \noutside of reconciliation. When you think about it, that makes more \nsense. Congress created the budget reconciliation process to affect the \nbudget, and any competent budget economist will tell you that health \ncare cost growth is the biggest financial challenge facing our Nation. \nThe President and other commentators on our fiscal plight make that \nstatement repeatedly.\n  If you want to address the budget in a significant way you need to \naddress health care. Health care is exactly what the budget process was \ndesigned to address.\n  Why did Congress create the budget process this way? Simple: Congress \ncreated the budget process so that Congress could make fiscal policy \nwith a simple majority vote. The Congress that created reconciliation \nwanted to ensure that future Congresses could vote budget matters up or \ndown, yes or no. Is it unusual for anything this large to have been \npassed in reconciliation? Once again, the answer is no. In terms of \ndollars and cents, the biggest reconciliation bill by far was the 2001 \nBush tax cuts. The 2001 reconciliation bill worsened the deficit by \nmore than $550 billion over the first 5 years. That was a \nreconciliation bill.\n  Not far behind was the 2003 Bush tax cut. That reconciliation bill \nworsened the deficit by more than $430 billion over the first 5 years.\n  In terms of policy changes, it is hard to match the two Bush tax \ncuts. But another measure that came close was the 1996 welfare reform \nbill. Once again, that was a reconciliation bill. The 1996 welfare \nreform bill was the most sweeping revision of poverty programs since \nthe Great Society. Once again, that reconciliation bill was passed by a \nRepublican-controlled Senate.\n  It is hard to say that we have not done big things in reconciliation. \nIn sum, it is not as though we sneaked health care reform through the \nSenate. We passed it with an exhaustive open process and the Senate \npassed health care reform with a supermajority. We passed it with 60 \nvotes.\n  Now all that remains to be done to complete health care reform is an \nup-or-down vote on this final bill. This last step in the health care \nreform deserves to get a simple majority vote. That is all that needs \nto be done to finish the job of reforming health care.\n  Let me return to what this bill would do. This bill would help to \nmake health care more affordable for people who do not have it and \nimprove upon the Senate bill which the President signed this morning. \nWe do it for people such as\n\n[[Page S1825]]\n\nCarmen and her daughter Merilee, from Paulson, MT. Carmen had \ninsurance, but she still had problems with coverage and costs. Before \nMarch 2008, Carmen had insurance with a $5,000 deductible. She found \nherself avoiding care because of the high deductible. She and her \ndaughter Merilee waited until they knew they needed help before they \nwent to a doctor--certainly, with a deductible that high, $5,000. At \none point Carmen's daughter contracted a urinary tract infection. \nWanting to avoid the high deductible, Carmen and her daughter decided \nto wait a day and see how it goes, but her daughter did not get better. \nShe needed to get care. Since it was Saturday and there was no urgent \ncare open for 50 miles, the only option was to go to the emergency \nroom. The hospital bill to Carmen was for $500, but her insurance \ncompany refused to pay it. Carmen appealed, asking them to pay the $70 \ninsurance would normally pay for urgent care and Carmen would pay the \nremaining balance, but her insurance company still denied her claim.\n  When Carmen broke her fingers, her insurance company refused to pay \nfor treatment. The insurance company paid only for x rays, even though \nCarmen was entitled to $650 of first-dollar coverage for accidents. \nCarmen paid for her own treatment, but she gave up on the therapy \nbecause it cost too much. Carmen's fingers will never fully heal.\n  In March 2008, Carmen switched to another insurance company and \nlowered the deductible to $2,500. Remember, the last policy was a \ndeductible of $5,000. Last month, Carmen received notice that her \npremiums would go up by about 32 percent. Carmen will have to keep her \npremiums down by decreasing her coverage. It is a strategy she has been \nusing for years.\n  We fight for health care for people such as Carmen and Merilee. We \nfight for health care for people such as William and Erinn, from Red \nLodge. Erinn lost her father William when he was only 59 years old \nbecause their insurance company denied and delayed his bone marrow \ntransplant until it was too late. William taught school for more than \n30 years. He thought he had good insurance through his retirement \npackage. The doctors told William he had leukemia, but the doctors were \nable to treat it with oral chemotherapy for a long time.\n  In 2002, the doctors determined that William would need more advanced \nchemotherapy. He underwent chemotherapy as long as he could and then \nthe doctors determined he would need a bone marrow transplant. The \ninsurance company paid for all the preparations, testing, and treatment \nleading up to the transplant, but the insurance company denied the \nprocedure itself.\n  Mr. President, I note I am running out of my half hour here. Let me \nsay I will conclude here by noting that this is why we fight for \npeople. This is why this health care bill is before us, for people such \nas Carmen and Merilee, Pat, and many people across this country who \ndeserve much better. We are at the very end here, about to pass this \nlegislation. The President signed the bill this morning. This is just \nto make it even a little bit better. It is a normal process, an open \nprocess. I urge all my colleagues to quickly pass this and help a lot \nof people and get on to other matters.\n\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wish I could stand here and agree with the Senator from \nMontana. I wish as I looked at these bills that passed the House, and \nnow we are getting the trailer bill, the buy-it bill, the bill that was \nused to purchase the votes in the House to pass the big bill, so I \ncould say: America's children are going to be better off; that the \npeople who have health care issues in this country are going to be \nbetter off. But that is impossible to say.\n  Why is it impossible to say? Because this bill as it passed the House \nwas an atrocity. It was an explosion of government the likes of which \nwe have never seen in this country. It grows the Government by $2.6 \ntrillion and in the process it will interfere with almost every \nAmerican who has private health insurance and how they get their \ninsurance. It will take Americans who have health insurance today and \nit will push them out of that health insurance as the small employers \nacross this country decide they can no longer afford it. It will say to \nMedicare recipients: We are going to cut your Medicare by $1 trillion \nwhen this is fully implemented--$1 trillion. We are going to take that \nmoney and we are going to use it to fund a brandnew entitlement over \nhere for people who are not on Medicare, who are not seniors, and we \nare going to use it to expand other entitlements for people who are not \non Medicare and who are not seniors.\n  Then the Medicare recipients who have seen their program reduced by \n$1 trillion are going to be left with a program that remains on a path \nto insolvency, a path which will inevitably lead to lesser quality of \ncare for people who get Medicare because providers will find themselves \nforced out of the system. People who are on Medicare Advantage will \nvirtually find that insurance plan is eliminated.\n  This bill has a lot of major problems, the big bill that passed the \nHouse. Now we get this trailer bill, this buy-it bill, which was used \nfor purposes of getting votes in the House. This bill aggravates the \nfundamental problems of the bigger bill the President signed today. \nThis bill adds more costs, creates more taxes, and will reduce \nMedicare's viability in a more significant way. Yet it is called good \npolicy. It is very hard to understand that.\n  When you look at these bills as a combination, especially when you \nput them in the context--thrown on this train was the nationalization \nof the student loan program, where 19 million students today are going \nto be forced into the process of getting their loans through the \nFederal Government instead of through their local banks, their \ncommunity banks. When you look at this in that context, what this bill \nis about--and the President has been very forthright about this--it is \na massive explosion in the size of the government, growing the \ngovernment for one fundamental purpose: because this administration \nbelieves a bigger government creates prosperity.\n  We do not believe that on our side of the aisle. We believe there are \na lot of good things that could have been done to make health care \nbetter. I have offered a proposal to do that. Other Senators--Senator \nBarrasso has a proposal to do that. They would have all addressed the \nhealth insurance issues of making sure that everybody could get \ncoverage if they have a preexisting condition. All these strawmen that \nare being thrown up as the reasons why this bill had to be passed would \nhave been taken care of if a more reasonable bill had been passed. But \nwhat would not have happened would be this massive explosion in the \nsize of the Federal Government which we will inevitably pass on to our \nchildren, a government they cannot afford.\n  Under this bill, the cost to the Federal Government, which has \ntraditionally been about 20 percent of our gross national product, will \njump up to about 25, 26, or 27 percent of our gross national product. \nIt will be unaffordable as a result of this.\n  But they claim they pay for it. The way they claim they pay for it \nprimarily is to cut Medicare by $1 trillion when fully implemented. \nThis seems fundamentally unfair to the people on our side of the aisle. \nWe all recognize that Medicare has serious problems. It has a $36 \ntrillion unfunded liability.\n  We all recognize that Medicare recipients depend on that program. So \nif we are going to adjust Medicare payments, cut them as they do in \nthis bill, eliminate programs such as Medicare Advantage for all \nintents and purposes, then those savings, as a matter of fairness, \nshould stay with the Medicare system. I mean, that is what should \nhappen. Those savings, which are huge in this bill--and I respect the \nfact that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle stepped up and \nmade this massive attempt to cut Medicare. That was quite a decision on \ntheir part. But what they did was they took these savings, which should \nhave gone to giving senior citizens a stronger and more vibrant \nprogram, they took them and they started a brandnew program and \nbrandnew entitlements and expansions of other existing entitlements, \nnone of which have anything to do with Medicare or senior citizens. So \nessentially they are funding this program, in large part, on the backs \nof the seniors of this country without doing anything substantive which \nwill, in the long run, have made Medicare more solvent. In\n\n[[Page S1826]]\n\nfact, they basically doubled down on the problem because we know \nMedicare is headed into insolvency, and then they created these new \nentitlements.\n  We know the record of the government around here on the issue of \nentitlements. We always underfund them. The promises are made, but they \nare never kept. So this will all end up rolling into a giant ball, like \na huge, massive asteroid headed to Earth which is basically going to \nland on our children's head as debt. That is what we have headed toward \nus here.\n  We already know we have a government we cannot afford. The debt of \nthis country is going to double in the next 5 years under the \nPresident's budget, and it is going to triple in the next 10 years. The \nPresident's budget is going to get to a level of unsustainability \nwithin 5 to 7 years. We are already seeing the warning signs. The \nChinese are telling us they might not want to buy our debt, and they \nare the ones who are financing us. Moody's says we may have to have our \nratings looked at. Even Warren Buffett's debt today, this week, for the \nfirst time, sold at a better premium than U.S. debt. What does that \nmean? People have more confidence that Warren Buffet will pay them back \nthan the United States. It is a pretty serious sign when the United \nStates is supposed to be the best creditor in the world.\n  What this bill does at its core on fiscal policy is to radically \nexpand the size of government. And we all know it will not be paid for, \nso we all know it will significantly--probably radically--expand the \ndebt our children are going to bear. Inevitably, we are not going to \npass on to our children a healthier country fiscally; we are going to \npass on to our children a sicker country fiscally. Are we going to get \nbetter health care for it? I seriously doubt it.\n  I think we will hear from Dr. Barrasso about how he sees this \naffecting health care, and other Members of our side of the aisle who \nhave some expertise in this area. Inevitably, when you start these \nmajor government programs, which essentially amount to quasi-\nnationalizations of different areas of the American economy, you end up \nwith less quality. It is inherent in having the government run things.\n  So the first amendment we are going to offer here today is to try to \nstraighten out this incredible inequity we would be paying for these \nnew entitlements for uninsured Americans and for people on Medicaid \nwith senior citizens' dollars by cutting the Medicare Program by over \n$1 trillion when fully implemented. So we have an amendment which \nessentially says this: You cannot reduce the Medicare spending if CBO \ncannot tell us that the other expenditures in this bill are paid for \nwith something other than Medicare. It is a hard-and-fast commitment \nthat Medicare savings will go to benefit Medicare, and that should be \nour purpose.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3567\n\n  I know some of my other colleagues wish to talk on this issue. First, \nI send an amendment to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg], for himself and \n     Mr. Coburn, proposes an amendment numbered 3567.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prevent Medicare from being raided for new entitlements \n             and to use Medicare savings to save Medicare)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. PREVENTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW ENTITLEMENTS \n                   THAT WOULD RAID MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Ban on New Spending Taking Effect.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services are prohibited from implementing \n     any spending increase or revenue reduction provision in \n     either the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or this \n     Act (referred to in this section as the ``Health Care Acts'') \n     unless both the Director of the Office of Management and \n     Budget (referred to in this section as ``OMB'') and the Chief \n     Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services \n     Office of the Actuary (referred to in this section as ``CMS \n     OACT'') certify that they project that all of the projected \n     Federal spending increases and revenue reductions resulting \n     from the Health Care Acts will be offset by projected gross \n     savings from the Health Care Acts.\n       (2) Calculations.--For purposes of this section, projected \n     gross savings shall--\n       (A) include gross reductions in Federal spending and gross \n     increases in revenues made by the Health Care Acts; and\n       (B) exclude any projected gross savings or other offsets \n     directly resulting from changes to Medicare made by the \n     Health Care Acts.\n       (b) Limit on Future Spending.--For the purpose of carrying \n     out this section and upon the enactment of this Act, CMS OACT \n     and the OMB shall--\n       (1) certify whether all of the projected Federal spending \n     increases and revenue reductions resulting from the Health \n     Care Acts, starting with fiscal year 2014 and for the \n     following 9 fiscal years, are fully offset by projected gross \n     savings resulting from the Health Care Acts (as calculated \n     under subsection (a)(2)); and\n       (2) provide detailed estimates of such spending increases, \n     revenue reductions, and gross savings, year by year, program \n     by program and provision by provision.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I have defined what the amendment's purpose is: to make \nsure that Medicare reductions in this bill, things that directly impact \nseniors, such as reducing their provider payments, so probably fewer \ndoctors will see them, or eliminating things or dramatically reducing \nMedicare Advantage--if we are going to do that as a Congress, those \nsavings have to go to benefit Medicare, not to create new programs no \nmatter how worthy they may be.\n  I see many of my colleagues rising wishing to talk about this. I ask \nunanimous consent to be able to proceed as if in a colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. If I might ask a question of the Senator from New \nHampshire, the President's budget said it would cost $371 billion over \n10 years to properly pay for doctors who see Medicare patients. I \nbelieve the Congressional Budget Office says the number was over $250 \nbillion. Can you imagine a comprehensive health care bill that improves \nMedicare without paying doctors to serve Medicare patients? Can you \nthen explain to me how you can possibly say the bill does not add to \nthe Federal deficit if it does not include paying doctors to serve \nMedicare patients?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, the Senator from Tennessee has asked an excellent \nquestion, which is, How can you pass a health care reform bill and \nleave off the reform that is necessary to pay the doctors to see their \npatients and claim you are actually covering the cost of health care? \nAnd CBO has scored that at about $250 billion, maybe as high as $350 \nbillion. It is simply ignored. It is as if paying doctors is not part \nof health care reform, and therefore it has been ignored by the \nmajority. But if you wanted to properly score the cost of this bill, \nyou have to add back in that $250 to $350 billion. Obviously, that puts \nthem in a very tight debt situation, deficit situation, even under the \ngamesmanship which was used to get to the score in the first place, \nwhich, as we all remember, was you score it 10 years of income, 10 \nyears of taxes, 10 years of spending cuts, against 6 years of actual \nprograms. That is how they got the score they claim. The real score on \nthis bill is $2.6 trillion of new spending, and it is a massive \nexpansion of the deficit, much of which will be caused by the failure \nto fix the doctor issue.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I would ask the Senator from New \nHampshire how it is that we can cut back on Medicare for our seniors, \nand I would like for him to talk about the impact especially on rural \nhospitals because rural hospitals serve a larger number, percentage-\nwise, of Medicare patients. In my home State of Texas, 29 percent of \nall of our hospitals are located in rural areas.\n  I received a letter from the Texas Organization of Rural and \nCommunity Hospitals, which represents 150 rural hospitals in the State, \nsaying: We fear the Medicare cuts, as proposed, could \ndisproportionately hurt rural hospitals, which are the health care \nsafety net for more than 2 million rural Texans.\n  I would ask the Senator from New Hampshire if, in his State and from \nwhat he is hearing from other States, they are likewise concerned about \nthe impact on our rural residents who are\n\n[[Page S1827]]\n\nMedicare patients and the cuts to hospitals that are going to be really \ndisproportionate when you look at the big picture, and for what \npurpose? Fewer people served, and that is supposed to be health care \nreform?\n  Mr. GREGG. Well, the Senator is absolutely right. This is going to \nhave a huge impact, especially on rural hospitals that have heavy \nMedicare populations because those populations will find their \nproviders are no longer able to make enough money to exist.\n  We actually have one of the leading Members of the Senate here, who \nis a doctor, who provided health care in a rural setting and is just \nrecently out of the field, so to say, who might be able to comment, to \nadd even more expertise on that.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I would absolutely like to do that because Wyoming \nclearly is a rural State, long distances between patients and the \nhospitals.\n  This Sunday, just 2 days ago, I was visiting the Elk Horn Valley \nRehab Hospital in Casper, WY, down the road from the Wyoming Medical \nCenter, to see a friend of mine, Ted Lee. Ted is now in his eighties. \nTed is a veteran of World War II. Ted actually drove a Jeep for \nEisenhower, who was a general at the time, and Ted has been back to \nWashington as part of the Honor Flights, as we honor our World War II \nveterans.\n  Ted had fallen at home on the Wyoming ice and snow and had broken his \nhip. His wife Jackie called my wife Bobbi and me at home over the \nweekend to say: Ted is in the hospital. Would you stop by?\n  Ted is a terrific guy. I repaired his shoulder. I operated on his \nleg, when, at the age of 70, he jumped from an airplane to show he \ncould still jump out of a plane with a parachute. And I replaced both \nof Jackie's knees. I know these people like family.\n  I went to the hospital to see Ted, and he said: What are those people \nin Washington thinking? What are they thinking?\n  Ted is very sharp. He said: I paid in. I fought for my country. I put \nmy money into Medicare. Why are they taking my Medicare money, not to \nsave Medicare but to start a whole new government program--a whole new \ngovernment program for people who did not pay into the system, did not \nfight for their country, on and on. What is wrong with the people in \nWashington? What are they thinking? Don't they realize that it is our \nmoney, we paid in, we are expecting care, and now all of a sudden they \nare going to take Medicare money and start a new government program.\n  Ted said--and he knows; this is a guy who follows us--they are going \nto take it from the hospitals, and he had just been in the hospital; \nthey are going to take it from Medicare Advantage, $120 billion, \nbecause there are a lot of people in Wyoming who see the advantages of \nsigning up for Medicare Advantage; they are taking it from the home \nhealth care agency, and Ted is likely to need home health care help \nwhen he gets home. It is a lifeline to allow him to stay out of the \nhospital and at home. He also knows it is going to cut a lot of money \nfrom nursing homes. We are trying to keep Ted out of a nursing home. \nBut he understands clearly that these Medicare cuts are going to affect \ndoctors, hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, even hospice \nproviders, and all of that money is going to be taken away not to save \nMedicare, which he knows is going to be broke in 2017, but to start a \nwhole new government program.\n  When we get to the specifics of rural hospitals and rural health--and \nI see my colleague from Nebraska, who is a former Governor of Nebraska.\n  There was a front-page story in the New York Times a few months back: \n``For Elderly in Rural Areas, Times Are Distinctly Harder.'' Times are \ndistinctly harder. And they quote a woman from Oshkosh, NE, who says: \n``One foot in the grave, the other sliding.'' One foot in the grave, \nthe other sliding.\n  So I ask my colleague and friend from Nebraska, who has served as \nGovernor--lots of rural areas in Nebraska--in Nebraska does the Senator \nsee these same concerns where folks here in Washington are taking money \naway from our seniors on Medicare, money they depend on for their \nhealth care, to start a whole new government program? And it is \nfundamentally not right, and that is why we are bringing this \namendment.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I so appreciate the opportunity to speak to this issue \nbecause this is enormously important for our rural States.\n  We took a look at this bill. We tried to give it a good, fair look in \nterms of its impact on Nebraska. If I might, let me cite some \nstatistics, and you can repeat these statistics whether you are in \nTexas or Tennessee or Wyoming or wherever. Two-thirds of our home \nhealth agencies, if this bill--well, this bill became law today--two-\nthirds will be operating in the red by 2016, home health agencies. So \nwhat does that mean? Here is what it means: Back home in Nebraska, if \nyou are in a major city such as Omaha, Lincoln, Kearney, whatever, it \nappears to me that you are probably going to get through this pretty \nreasonably. However, if you are in a rural area, you are going to lose \nservice. They are going to pull in on the services to these rural \nareas. Why? Because they can't afford to send a home health person out \n50 or 75 or 100 miles.\n  We asked ourselves, What would be the impact of this bill on nursing \nhomes? Again, we have rural nursing homes all over our State. This is \nexactly what has happened in other States. People want to spend their \nelderly years in their community or near their community. These nursing \nhomes are fighting to stay open today; they will take a $93 million \nhit. We are going to have nursing homes close in Nebraska.\n  Hospitals and hospice will also experience major reductions.\n  To those Nebraskans who are on Medicare Advantage, 35,000 Nebraskans \nare going to see a cut in the amount of money they receive only \nexacerbated by what we are talking about today.\n  If I might, let me anticipate an argument. I know, because you have \nbeen watching this, somebody from the other side is going to say: Come \non, Mike. This is the way it works. We extend the life of Medicare.\n  The Actuary in CBO has looked at that, in a rather amazing analysis, \nand said: Yes; right. What you are doing is double counting the same \ndollar. This comes from CBO, but I can take the same from CMS. CBO \nsaid: The key point is, the savings to the HI trust fund, under the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act, would be received by the \ngovernment only once, so they cannot be set aside to pay for future \nMedicare spending and at the same time pay for current spending.\n  That is exactly what they have tried to do here.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield on that point, CBO also says: In \neffect, the majority of the HI trust fund savings, under the big bill \nwhich was signed today and the reconciliation proposal which we are \ndealing with today, would be used to pay for other spending and, \ntherefore, would not enhance the ability of the government to pay for \nthe future of Medicare benefits.\n  The amendment we have at the desk does the opposite. It will allow us \nto use any savings to pay for Medicare benefits and enhance the \nstrength of the trust fund.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. That is exactly why I stand here today--to bring honesty \nto the accounting. If you bring honesty to the accounting, you can see \nwhat we are doing to the American people.\n  A former CBO Director recently said: Fantasy in, fantasy out. They \nwill only score what is laid in front of them. They had this gimmick \nlaid in front of them which is what they had to score. I applaud what \nthis amendment does because what it is saying is: Let's cut through all \nthis. Let's score this honestly. If we have savings in Medicare, let's \nkeep that money in Medicare. Believe me, that is the right way to go \nabout this. This idea of double counting the same dollar makes no sense \nwhatsoever.\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is right. It is important to note that one \nprogram under Medicare will be absolutely devastated. I understand \nTexas has a lot of people in that program. Maybe the Senator from Texas \ncould speak to that.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. The Senator from New Hampshire is correct. That is \nwhy I strongly support the amendment at the desk. The bill will wipe \nout Medicare Advantage, make no mistake about it. Texas has 500,000 \npeople who pay into Medicare Advantage because\n\n[[Page S1828]]\n\nit gives them extra things that they don't get under Medicare, such as \neye care and eye glasses and things that are so important. In fact, \nwhat is so interesting about the bill before us, the reconciliation \nbill, is it actually increases the cuts in Medicare Advantage over and \nabove what was in the Senate bill.\n  Mr. GREGG. It takes that money out of Medicare and uses it to fund a \nnew entitlement for people who are not on Medicare and have never paid \ninto Medicare.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Exactly; taking away way from seniors who tried to do \nsomething a little bit better for themselves, mostly in rural areas. It \ncuts them even more than the Senate bill the President signed today: \n$200 billion in cuts to Medicare Advantage. It will obliterate the \nMedicare Advantage Program for so many of our seniors, in the millions \nacross the country. In fact, here is a statistic: Between 2003 and \n2007, more than 600,000 beneficiaries in rural areas joined the \nMedicare Advantage Program, a 420-percent increase in Medicare \nAdvantage, because seniors saw it was a better deal for them and they \ndecided to take it.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I wonder if I might ask the Senator from New \nHampshire, I hear it often said by supporters of the bill, which became \nlaw today, that we on the Republican side are overstating it when we \nsay there are Medicare cuts. Don't I remember that the Director of the \nCBO testified that fully half of those on Medicare Advantage would see \ntheir benefits cut by a bill such as the one that became law today? \nDon't one out of four recipients of Medicare subscribe to Medicare \nAdvantage? Can we not expect for at least one out of those four \nMedicare Advantage beneficiaries to have their benefits affected by \nthis law?\n  Mr. GREGG. The Senator is absolutely right. The original number under \nthe original bill was 11 million seniors would lose their Medicare \nAdvantage. That number has to go up now because, if this bill passes, \nit increases the cut to Medicare Advantage. Again, it takes that money \nand funds bringing people onto the system who don't have insurance \ncoverage today but who are definitely not seniors and who have never \npaid into the Medicare trust fund.\n  I see the Senator from Idaho rising. Does he wish to speak?\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I came to the floor to join in this. I \ncan't understand this. It amazes me that the other side thinks the \nAmerican people are so stupid that they are going to believe you can \ntake $500 billion out of Medicare and that it is going to be good for \nthe American people and that it is going to be good for the system. In \naddition, what has been discussed about this phony smoke-and-mirrors \naccounting, the American people understand this. Most importantly, we \nhave heard from the American people over and over: Don't touch our \nMedicare. When they say ``our Medicare,'' they mean our Medicare. This \nisn't a gift from the Federal Government. There was a bipartisan \ncoalition of Republicans and Democrats who brought the Medicare system \nonline in America. They made a contract with the American people. If \nyou work, you are going to contribute into the Medicare trust fund, and \nyour employer is going to contribute into the Medicare trust fund. It \nis going to be there for you to be used when it is necessary for \nMedicare purposes.\n  My office is flooded with phone calls saying: You politicians, leave \nyour hands off our Medicare.\n  I have watched this process over the years and have seen people try \nto raid Medicare for substantially less than what we are talking about \nhere. We are talking about $\\1/2\\ trillion that is being stolen from \nMedicare. Where is the media on this? They tout this bill, that it will \ndo this and it will do that. Nobody ever talks about the downside of a \n$\\1/2\\ trillion theft from Medicare. The American people are smart. \nThey understand what is being done.\n  Anyone who supports this is going to pay the price for this in \nNovember. I guarantee you, your seniors at home, even young people and \npeople who are middle-aged who are looking forward to Medicare are \ngoing to ask: Did you vote to steal money from my Medicare?\n  You better be ready to answer that question. Don't give them an \nanswer with the smoke and mirrors, that by double accounting somehow \ntaking $\\1/2\\ trillion out is going to make Medicare better. The \nAmerican people are smarter than this. You are going to find that out \nthis fall.\n  Mr. GREGG. Remember, the only way that can be avoided, the only way \nthis bill and the bill that was just passed today, signed today by the \nPresident, can be kept from taking Medicare funds to fund new \ninitiatives that have nothing to do with Medicare, such as insurance \nfraud and the expansion of Medicaid, is to pass this amendment. This \nis it. If you don't vote for this amendment, then you are voting to \nraid Medicare for the purpose of using that money for some other \npurpose which has nothing to do with Medicare. Basically, you are \nfunding this bill on the backs of seniors.\n\n  How much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. I know the Senator from Tennessee wanted to conclude.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I conclude by congratulating the \nSenator from New Hampshire for a very straightforward amendment. As I \nunderstand it, it says: If you are going to take any money out of \nMedicare, it has to be spent on Medicare.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is correct.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. It can't be spent on some new government program.\n  Mr. GREGG. You can't create a new program until you can prove it is \npaid for with something other than Medicare money.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. You have reemphasized that $\\1/2\\ trillion is coming \nout of Medicare and that it will affect the benefits of one-fourth of \nthose who have Medicare Advantage. What you are trying to do is simply \nsay: If there are savings in Medicare, spend it on Medicare because \nMedicare is going broke. This will help keep it solvent.\n  Mr. GREGG. That is the only fair thing to do for the seniors of \nAmerica who are facing a system which has a very significant unfunded \nliability and which they paid into for all their lives and have a right \nto assume will be solvent and not have it used as a piggy bank for \nother programs which the other side of the aisle thinks are important \nbut which have nothing to do with Medicare.\n  As I understand, the Democratic side now has a half hour and then we \nhave a half hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Senator Harkin wishes to speak, but allow me to make a \nfew points clear. The amendment offered by the Senator from New \nHampshire is a killer amendment. It kills the bill. It is that simple. \nIt basically is an amendment that kills the health care bill that just \nbecame law that the President signed this morning. This is a debate we \nhad when we were on the bill. The Senate has already considered the \narguments made by the Senator from New Hampshire and others. The Senate \ndecided against those arguments. The Senate has decided to pass health \ncare reform, as has the House of Representatives, and the President \nsigned it. So this, in a certain sense, is a stale argument. This is an \nargument after the bill has already been passed. It makes more sense to \nmake these arguments beforehand, not after.\n  Second, what is the effect? Let me read from the amendment. It says: \nThe Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices are prohibited from implementing any spending increase/revenue \nreduction provisions in the bill just signed by the President unless \ncertain conditions occur. That means no spending to fill the doughnut \nhole. That means seniors will still have to spend more on drugs. That \nmeans no spending to help States cover Medicaid expenses for the \nexpanded population. That means States will be left high and dry. That \nmeans no primary care payments to primary care physicians, whether it \nis Medicaid or Medicare. That means no tax credits for Americans who \nare struggling to buy health insurance. That means no payments to help \nstruggling Americans make the out-of-pocket costs. It makes no sense. \nThis is an example of why this is a killer amendment.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to recognize we have had this debate \nalready. This is not new. They have not said anything new. This debate \noccurred while we were considering health care reform. The Senate has \nconsidered\n\n[[Page S1829]]\n\nthose arguments, has listened to those arguments. We debated this \namendment already back and forth. The Senate decided by a vote not to \naccept those arguments. So we are talking about something that is \nhistory. It has already passed. In a certain sense it is irrelevant.\n  On the other hand, this amendment is relevant on reconciliation. This \namendment is an attempt to kill the bill. I strongly urge my colleagues \nto reject this amendment.\n  Don't forget, our bill includes financial incentives for doctors and \nhospitals to collaborate and coordinate care for seniors. I thought \nthat is something we wanted. This amendment says: No, you can't do \nthat. We can't come up with financial incentives for doctors and \nhospitals to collaborate. This does not happen often enough in Medicare \ntoday. We need to have more collaboration. We need doctors and \nhospitals to work better together. We need some demonstration systems. \nWe need pilot projects to help us find ways to better pay doctors and \nhospitals based on quality of care and less on quantity of care. There \nis nobody who disagrees with that statement, at least nobody who has \ngiven a lot of thought to health care reform. This amendment would stop \nthat. It would prevent us from trying to find a way to reduce health \ncare costs which are eating us alive, eating up family budgets, eating \nup company budgets and also public budgets, in terms of Medicaid and \nMedicare, unless we get health care costs under control. The way to do \nthat is to change the delivery system. I think that is the game changer \nin the bill; frankly, one of the most important parts of the bill. \nBut--no, no, no--this amendment says you cannot do that. You cannot \nbegin to take the steps necessary in the long term to start reducing \nhealth care costs.\n\n  Our bill also--the underlying bill, which this amendment would kill--\nreduces Medicare spending by reducing hospital readmissions. I thought \nwe wanted to do that. I thought we wanted to reduce the hospital \nreadmissions. This amendment would, in effect, say: No, you cannot do \nthat.\n  Better coordination of care again means patients do not have to come \nback to the hospital because of complications, because of allergies and \nproblems post surgery. What else does the underlying bill do? It keeps \nmore money in the Medicare accounts by making smart reforms to the \nprogram. Fewer funds will be spent simply by paying doctors for quality \nof care and not quantity of care--by cutting out wasteful overpayments \nto providers and private insurance companies that do not add value to \npatients, and by creating an innovation center within the Medicare \nProgram so that groundbreaking ways to deliver health care better are \ndiscovered more often and put in place without delay.\n  That is a very important point. We need to have, by creating an \ninnovation center within the Medicare Program, groundbreaking ways to \ndeliver better health care. We have to spend some money on these new \ndemonstration and pilot projects so we can have a much better health \ncare system.\n  Mr. President, I now yield the remainder of the time in this half \nhour to the chairman of the HELP Committee. I yield time under control \non the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, thank you very much. I thank Chairman \nBaucus for yielding me this time.\n  I listened with great interest to the distinguished senior Senator \nfrom Montana as he recounted the extraordinary lengths to which \nDemocrats went on his committee in soliciting bipartisan Republican \nsupport in the drafting of the health reform bill in the Finance \nCommittee.\n  On both the Finance Committee, which Senator Baucus chairs, and on \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions, which I chair, \nthe majority party insisted on a process that was consistently open, \ntransparent, and inclusive.\n  At every step, the Democratic majority acted in good faith. \nRepublican Senators were fully involved during public committee \nhearings and markups, as well as in private discussions and \nnegotiations. The ideas and amendments of Republican Senators helped to \nshape the substance of the bill in a multitude of ways.\n  In the HELP Committee, in 2008 and 2009, we held 47 bipartisan \nmeetings on health reform, including 14 bipartisan roundtables, 13 \nbipartisan committee hearings, and 20 bipartisan walk-throughs on the \nbill.\n  Then the HELP Committee spent nearly 3 weeks during June and July \nmarking up the bill--June and July of last year. To be exact, our \nmarkup spanned 13 days and a total of 54 hours. We went out of our way \nto accommodate our Republican colleagues who offered over 200 \namendments. We accepted 161 Republican amendments on our bill. By any \nstandard, this was an extraordinarily open and inclusive process.\n  I must point out that Democrats in good faith and in the best spirit \nof bipartisanship insisted on this inclusive process, despite numerous \npublic statements by some Republican Senators to the effect that their \ngame plan was to delay and obstruct and filibuster and kill the bill. \nIndeed, the junior Senator from South Carolina famously said:\n\n       If we're able to stop Obama on this, it will be his \n     Waterloo. It will break him.\n\n  Even in the face of that, we said, nonetheless, that is just one \nperson. We are going to have an open and inclusive process.\n  Many critics have said that Democrats pursued inclusion and \nbipartisanship to a fault. They have criticized us for consuming many \nmonths negotiating with Republicans, accepting their amendments, \naccommodating their ideas and objections, even in the teeth of their \npublic declarations that they intended to kill the bill.\n  For the record, I am proud of the fact that we went the extra mile to \ninclude Republican Senators and to incorporate their ideas and input. \nIt was the right thing to do, even if the hand of cooperation and \nbipartisanship we extended was rejected.\n  With passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the \n111th Congress has made history, just as previous Congresses did in \n1935 by passing Social Security and in 1965 by passing the law creating \nMedicare. Each of those bills marked a giant step forward for the \nAmerican people, and each was stridently opposed by defenders of the \nstatus quo. But in the end, a critical mass of Senators and \nRepresentatives rose to the historic occasion. They voted their hopes \nand not their fears. And--as we now know in retrospect--they passed \nlaws that transformed America in profoundly positive ways.\n  The health reform law President Obama signed earlier today will also \ntransform America in profound and positive ways. Indeed, it already \nhas. Despite all the talk recently about how our Nation has become \ndivided and ungovernable, we have proved not only that we are \ngovernable, but also that we still have the capacity to take charge of \nour destiny and to act with boldness and vision.\n  One prominent commentator said passage of the health reform bill is \n``a victory for America's soul.'' I could not agree more. Yet this new \nlaw is fully paid for. Indeed, it helps to reduce the deficit by $143 \nbillion in the first decade, and by a whopping $1.2 trillion in the \nsecond decade. That is deficit reduction.\n  Yes, this new law includes important and long overdue measures to \ncrack down on abuses by health insurance companies--abuses that leave \nall Americans, including those with insurance, just one illness away \nfrom financial catastrophe. No longer will health insurance companies \nbe able to cancel your insurance when you get a serious illness. No \nlonger will they be able to impose lifetime caps or annual caps on \ntheir payoffs. No longer will they be able to systematically \ndiscriminate against women by charging higher premiums just because--\njust because--you are a woman. No longer--once this bill becomes fully \noperational--will they be able to deny coverage based on preexisting \nconditions.\n  In addition, the new law includes a whole array of provisions \npromoting wellness, prevention, and public health--something I have \npersonally championed for many years. This will finally begin to change \nthe paradigm from our current sick care system to a true health care \nsystem--one that keeps people healthy and out of the hospital in the \nfirst place. This bill will begin to recreate America as a wellness \nsociety, focused on healthful lifestyles, good nutrition, physical \nactivity, and\n\n[[Page S1830]]\n\npreventing the chronic diseases that take such a toll on our bodies and \non our budgets.\n  There has been a lot of talk about bending the cost curve in health \ncare, and there have been a lot of different ways people have suggested \non how we bend the cost curve. Quite frankly, I think the one biggest \nway we are going to be able to bend the cost curve is by focusing more \non prevention. We know how to do it. We know it works. We know it saves \nmoney. We have good data on this. If you do not believe me, ask Pitney \nBowes and what they did to their bottom line. Ask Safeway corporation \nwhat happened to their bottom line in terms of health care costs when \nthey put in place widespread prevention and wellness policies. So we \nhave private companies out there that are doing wonderful things we \ncould be doing nationwide, and we can have the same kind of savings \nnationally for America as these private companies have for their bottom \nline.\n  There is one more critical reform in this new law. It includes the \nCommunity First Choice Option, which represents a major advance in \nallowing people with disabilities and older Americans with chronic \nconditions to remain in their homes and with their family and \ncommunity. It will increase access to medical examination and \ndiagnostic equipment designed to accommodate people with disabilities.\n  Here I want to speak to all of my friends in the disability community \nin America. After the passage of the Americans with Disabilities Act in \n1990, the next big hurdle was to break down the discrimination that \nexists in Federal law that pertains to people who are eligible for \ninstitutional care but who would rather live in their own homes and in \ntheir communities. Right now, under Federal law, if you qualify for \ninstitutional care, Medicaid must pay for that--must pay for that. If, \nhowever, you do not want to live in an institution, and you want to \nlive on your own, near your friends or your family in the community, \nMedicaid does not have to pay for that. Yet we know that for every one \nperson in a nursing home, we can support three people with disabilities \nliving in the community.\n  So we have tried ever since 1990 to change this. We had the first \nbill in the mid-1990s. It was called MiCASSA, the Medicaid Community-\nBased Attendant Services and Supports Act. We tried for a long time to \nget that. We could never get it done. Then in the last few years, we \nchanged the name of it to the Community Choice Act, and we still could \nnot get that done.\n  Last year, at about this time, I paid my first visit to President \nObama in the White House. I wanted to have a personal meeting with him \nto talk about this one issue; that if we are going to do health care \nreform, we cannot leave people with disabilities behind, and the one \nthing that matters most is to ensure that people with disabilities have \ntheir own choice about where they want to live. If they want to live in \nan institution, fine. But if they would rather live by themselves in \nthe community, with their family and their friends, they ought to have \nthat choice. President Obama agreed with that, and so began the long \nprocess.\n  There is one part of the bill that not too many people know about. I \nsay to my friends in the disability community, we have finally overcome \nthe obstacle. In this bill is the Community First Choice Option, which \nwill allow the Federal Government--beginning in October of 2011--to \nbegin to pay to States an increased part of their Medicaid payment so \npeople with disabilities can choose where they want to live--not where \nthe government tells them they have to live.\n  To me, this is a profound change in how we are going to treat people \nwith disabilities in our society. This is one of the landmark \ndisability rights parts of this bill, and not too many people know \nabout it. But I think after the signing of the bill today, people in \nthe disability community all over America will know it is in there.\n  So these are important landmark reforms that benefit all Americans. \nBut, as a commentator put it, the new health care reform law is also a \nvictory for America's soul. At long last, we are realizing Senator \nKennedy's dream of extending access to quality affordable health \ninsurance to every American. We are ending the last shameful bastion of \nlegal discrimination and exclusion in our country.\n  I have stated this before when people said: What are you talking \nabout, discrimination, well, over the decades, we have outlawed \ndiscrimination in our country on the basis of race, color, national \norigin, based on gender. We have outlawed discrimination also based on \ndisability with the Americans with Disabilities Act in 1990. But until \nnow--think about it--it has been perfectly legal to discriminate \nagainst our fellow Americans because of illness, because of sickness--\nto exclude tens of millions of our citizens from decent health care \nsimply because they cannot afford it. Think about that.\n  I hear some people talking about setting up pools: They are going to \nhave a pool here and a pool here--a pool for the elderly, a pool for \nhigh risk--a pool here and a pool there; different people get in these \ndifferent pools. My friends, that is nothing more or less than blatant \ndiscrimination. Are we not all one American family? That is what we \nsaid when we passed the Americans with Disabilities Act. This is our \nfamily. It should not be shunted aside, separated out. We said the same \nthing on the basis of race years ago with the Civil Rights Act, on the \nbasis of gender, national origin.\n  With the signing of the bill today, we have said no longer are we \ngoing to discriminate against people because they are sick. Think about \nthat. No longer are we going to discriminate against people simply \nbecause they are sick. This is a profound change in the way we are \ngoing to deal with each other as a society.\n  So when President Obama signed that bill this morning, he set in \nmotion a series of changes that will tear down these last barriers of \ndiscrimination and exclusion. That truly is a great moral victory. And \nit is a victory for America's soul. It is a victory that every American \ncan be proud of.\n  On that score, I certainly include our Republican friends. In the \nend, not a single Republican in either the House or the Senate voted \nfor health care reform. I say that is unfortunate. But, make no \nmistake, Republican ideas are much a part of this new law. In our \ncommittee, the HELP Committee, which I chair, Republicans were full-\nfledged participants, as I said. They offered 210 amendments. We \naccepted 161--many of them making substantive contributions to the \nbill.\n\n  As others have pointed out, our national health reforms are similar \nin many respects to the very successful reforms undertaken by \nRepublican Governor Mitt Romney in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.\n  I fully predict that, as with Social Security and Medicare, the \nchanges in the new health reform law, as they become better known and \ntake effect, will win overwhelming bipartisan support among the \nAmerican people.\n  In the near term, however, it is disappointing that some Republican \nlegislators--I think maybe taking their cue from the more extreme \nvoices on talk radio or Fox TV--are pledging to repeal this new law. In \nfact, the distinguished minority leader, the Republican leader, a \ncouple of weeks ago in a press conference said if we pass this bill, \ntheir motto was going to be ``Elect Republicans and We'll Repeal It.'' \nThis strikes me as bad public policy and, quite frankly, bad politics.\n  Do Republicans really want to repeal the ban on denying insurance \ncoverage due to preexisting conditions? Do they really want to repeal \nthe ban on insurance companies cancelling your policy if you get sick? \nDo they really want to repeal the ban on annual and lifetime benefit \npayments? Do they really want to repeal the dramatic shrinking of the \ndoughnut hole? Do Republicans really want to take away from the \nAmerican people the fact that now in law your child can remain on your \npolicy until the age of 26? Do they want to take that away from you? Do \nthey want to take away from you the right you have now--the right under \nlaw--that no matter how sick your child gets--maybe born with a \ndisability, maybe born with an illness--the insurance company cannot \ndiscriminate against your child based on a preexisting condition? That \nis the law of the land. Do Republicans really want to take that away \nfrom you?\n  I would strongly advise against these scorching tactics. This health \nreform\n\n[[Page S1831]]\n\nbill has been passed and signed into law. It is now time for the bitter \npartisan rancor to stop. It is time to move forward united as an \nAmerican people, just as we did on Social Security and Medicare. It is \ntime to put politics aside and put our country first.\n  Today we have before us this reconciliation bill that includes a \nnumber of modifications to strengthen the reform bill President Obama \nsigned earlier today. The bill he signed earlier today was the exact \nsame bill we passed on Christmas Eve of last year. But there is \nsomething else. This reform bill also includes reforms in the student \nlending program that in their own way are also profound and historic.\n  Let me mention a few of these provisions that will build on the new \nhealth reform law. This reconciliation bill will make health \ninsurance--as Senator Baucus said earlier, all families between 133 \npercent and 400 percent of poverty will see lower health care costs. \nThe bill will shrink and notably do away with the doughnut hole in the \nMedicare prescription drug program. We have new provisions cutting back \non waste and fraud in Medicare and Medicaid. In fact, these are some \nideas proposed by Republicans at the White House summit, and we put it \nin the bill. It increases funding for community health centers by $2.5 \nbillion, new consumer protections for employer-provided health plans \nthat are grandfathered in by the health reform law.\n  In addition, the bill includes a provision that is critically \nimportant to ensuring that our health care providers and hospitals are \nfairly reimbursed. Many folks know Medicare varies reimbursement based \non geography. That means many rural States such as Iowa, Oregon, \nArkansas, Minnesota, and many others are reimbursed at much lower rates \nthan urban areas regardless of the quality of the services they \nprovide. This bill helps to right that, to address the geographic \ndisparities, both for doctors and hospitals. In addition, we have \nreceived a written guarantee from Health and Human Services Secretary \nKathleen Sebelius for further action to reform Medicare reimbursement \nrates.\n  This will finally move us to a fairer, more effective reimbursement \nmodel that emphasizes quality over quantity. I said this reconciliation \nbill includes both health care and education provisions. The education \ntitle of the bill includes landmark provisions to make college more \naffordable and accessible. It does so by eliminating tens of billions \nof dollars in wasteful subsidies to banks, redirecting most of that \nmoney to low-income college students in the form of increased Pell \ngrants. The status quo in student lending is just incredibly wasteful. \nIt is like a bizarre Rube Goldberg process that makes no sense.\n  Think about the present system. The Federal Government pays fees to \nprivate banks to make entirely risk-free loans using taxpayer money. \nThe loans, which are already guaranteed by the Federal Government, are \nthen sold back to the Federal Government. The banks pocket tens of \nbillions of dollars--taxpayers' dollars--in fees and totally risk-free \nprofits. This is a brazen case of corporate welfare--a huge government \ngiveaway to bankers and to Sallie Mae. It is time to end it. This bill \ndoes. Simply put, this bill cuts out the middleman, saves $61 billion \nover the next 10 years, and gives it to students. The remainder we have \ninvested, as I said, in more generous Pell grants.\n  We reduce the deficit by $10 billion. We have deficit reduction in \nhere. We increase the Pell grants from now, from 2010 to 2017, from \n$5,550 to $5,975, and then we put in a cost-of-living increase on Pell \ngrants based on the Consumer Price Index. This $36 billion includes an \ninvestment of $13.5 billion right now for the Pell grants--right now--\nto fill a hole in the Pell grant. That would increase student aid this \nyear for students going to college, low-income students who need that \nhelp. It also invests $2.5 billion in Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities. It also provides money to student services so they can \nsupport students and give them the support they need to stay in school \nand to graduate--money to help nonprofits do that.\n  So, again, this reconciliation bill builds on and strengthens the \nhealth reforms signed into law by President Obama today. As I have said \nmany times in the past, I look upon the health care bill we passed in \nDecember as a starter home, something on which we can build now and in \nthe future. We make modifications now, and we will make them in the \nfuture. We can always make modifications. It is a bill, a law. We can \nmake changes as we go along. So we are making some of those fixes today \nto bridge some of the differences between the House and the Senate, to \nmake some needed changes.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, again, says deficit reduction will \nbe $143 billion in the first decade, an additional $1.2 trillion in the \nsecond decade--big deficit reductions.\n  I am sorry the Republicans seem to take pride in their reputation as \nthe party of no. We all remember William F. Buckley's conservative \nmotto; William F. Buckley, the father of the conservative movement. He \nsaid: The role of conservatives is ``to stand athwart history yelling \nstop.'' Well, that is exactly what our Republican colleagues did by \nfilibustering and trying to kill health care reform. That is exactly \nwhat they are trying to do now--to obstruct and kill this \nreconciliation bill. But it will not succeed. We are going to get the \nreconciliation bill done. We are going to get it passed, and we are \ngoing to move beyond. We are going to move beyond the rancor and the \nbitterness and bring our American family together. We will bring them \ntogether so everyone is guaranteed the right to health care and that we \nstop the abusive practices of the health insurance industry we have \nseen in the past.\n  So, by any measure, this bill is good for the American people. It is \ngood for students. It is good for our colleges, our community colleges, \nour private colleges in getting rid of the guaranteed loan program and \ngoing to a direct loan program. It is also good for the health of the \nAmerican people.\n  As I said at the beginning, this bill is good for the soul of \nAmerica. It is good to remind us that we are, once again, an American \nfamily; that no one should be discriminated against simply because they \nare sick or have an illness or because fate has dealt them a blow by \nbecoming disabled. That is what this bill is about more than anything \nelse. It is time to get on with it, get it passed, and move on.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, how much time is remaining on this half-\nhour block?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No time remains for the Democrats.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, we are about to hear from Senator McCain \nwho has an amendment dealing with a number of these special deals that \nare in this bill. First off, this bill is an outrage on the body \npolitic to begin with, the way it was handled. It was drafted in a \nsecret room, behind a secret room, behind a hidden door somewhere over \non the majority side. It was brought out on Saturday night, put on our \ndesks. We were told we had to vote on it on Christmas Eve. Then it was \nsent to the House. The House didn't get to amend it. They sent it to \nthe President. But in order to get it passed in the House, they had to \ndo this trailer bill which we are dealing with tonight, and which I \ncall the buy-it bill, where they went around and bought votes. A lot of \nvotes were bought around here using the buy-it bill method.\n  Senator McCain has sort of been the conscience of the Senate on this \ntype of issue, where there are targeted benefits for special States \nwhich aren't appropriate and have nothing to do substantively with the \nbill. Therefore, we should address those openly. We haven't had a \nchance to do that because our side has never been allowed to amend \nanything around here on this bill of any substance.\n  So it is Senator McCain's intention, when he gets here, to offer an \namendment dealing with one of these, or maybe a series of these \nsituations where there were special deals cut which have been given \ncertain names, such as the ``Cornhusker kickback'' and the ``Louisiana \npurchase'' and the Florida ``Gator aid.'' So I believe that is what \nSenator McCain is here for, and we are looking forward to it because it \nis appropriate that we bring out into the light these deals which no \nAmerican had a chance to participate in\n\n[[Page S1832]]\n\nother than that small cadre in that small room--as I said, the hidden \nroom behind the hidden room behind the hidden door.\n  Certainly, they didn't go through any committee, these deals. They \ndidn't come across the floor of the Senate, these deals, and they \ndidn't go through the floor of the House, and they should be voted on \nas to whether they are appropriate.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to proceed as in \na colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, could Senator McCain be allowed to \nlead the colloquy? I ask unanimous consent that Senator McCain be \nallowed to lead the colloquy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I am glad to see the Senator from \nArizona who has been a consistent proponent of openness in government. \nI heard the Senator from New Hampshire say that a lot of these \nsweetheart deals hadn't been voted on. I wonder if we may have a chance \nto vote on them soon, I ask the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my friend from Tennessee. May I \nsay I am going to offer an amendment that would remove some of the \nremaining sweetheart deals. To be honest with my colleagues, I don't \nthink we are going to find out all of what was in this 2,733-page \nlegislation for a long time.\n  As you know, it is that size, and it takes an expert, even though I \nread the bill, to go from one point to another. For example, it took us \na long time to figure out that the State of Connecticut has a $100 \nmillion deal to build a hospital in Connecticut.\n  Now, you wouldn't know that at first glance, but after going through \nit, you figure out it is there. There are a lot of provisions in this \n2,733-page piece of legislation that we will find, but we are going to \ntry to get rid of some of them in this amendment, which is, by the way, \na commitment I thought had been made but obviously was not.\n  The most egregious have been removed. The ``Cornhusker kickback'' has \nbeen removed, and I believe the ``Gator aid'' provision has been \nremoved as well. But we certainly have a number of others that remain \nin the bill, and we will be finding them in the future.\n  I ask my colleague from New Hampshire, is it in order for me to \npropose the amendment? What is the parliamentary situation?\n  Mr. GREGG. As I understand it, the majority would like to see the \namendment, which is certainly reasonable. We will give them a copy of \nthe amendment, and then hopefully at the end of our debate time we will \nbe able to set my amendment aside. We will get a copy.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I say to my friend from New Hampshire, while we are on \nthe subject, it is not only the sweetheart deals that are carved out \nfor individual Members, the latest being additional Medicaid funding \nfor Tennessee hospitals, which was just added, I understand, within the \nlast 48 hours or so, but there is also the part that is really hard for \nus to amend, as I am sure the Senator from New Hampshire knows--for \nexample, the PhRMA deal, the deal that was cut for the pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire may remember that back in August, \nthere was a story in the New York Times:\n\n       Drug industry lobbyists reacted with alarm this week to a \n     House health care overhaul measure that would allow the \n     government to negotiate drug prices and demand additional \n     rebates from drug manufacturers.\n       In response, the industry successfully demanded that the \n     White House explicitly acknowledge for the first time that it \n     had committed to protect drug makers from bearing further \n     costs in the overhaul. The Obama administration had never \n     spelled out the details of the agreement.\n       ``We were assured: `We need somebody to come in first. If \n     you come in first, you will have a rock-solid deal.' '' Billy \n     Tauzin--\n\n  By the way, I understand he has a salary of over $2 million a year--\n\n     the former Republican House member from Louisiana who now \n     leads the pharmaceutical trade group, said Wednesday: ``Who \n     is ever going to go into a deal with the White House again if \n     they don't keep their word? You are just going to duke it out \n     instead.''\n       A deputy White House chief of staff, Jim Messina, confirmed \n     Mr. Tauzin's account of the deal in an e-mail message on \n     Wednesday night.\n       ``The president encouraged this approach,'' Mr. Messina \n     wrote. ``He wanted to bring all the parties to the table to \n     discuss health insurance reform.''\n\n  I say to my friend from New Hampshire, while we are awaiting approval \nof this amendment from the other side, how many deals were cut with \nPhRMA? What were the deals cut for the AMA? What were the deals cut \nwith the hospital association? What were the deals cut with all these \nother organizations that have caused Americans to be so unhappy with \nthis process we have gone through?\n  There really is not any way, I say to my colleague from New \nHampshire, that I can amend the PhRMA deal. We tried to have drug \nreimportation from Canada. We tried to have pharmaceutical companies \ncompete for Medicare recipients. As Mr. Tauzin said:\n\n       ``We were assured: `We need somebody to come in first. If \n     you come in first, you will have a rock-solid deal' ''. . . .\n\n  I don't know whether it was the President found himself on the road \nto Damascus or what caused the conversion from then-Senator Obama who \nstrongly supported drug reimportation from Canada for prescription \ndrugs to the administration now opposing it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3570\n\n  Anyway, I understand my amendment has been agreed to.\n  I call up the McCain-Burr-Coburn amendment.\n  Mr. GREGG. I believe the Senator has to set my amendment aside.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Gregg amendment is already pending. I understand \nSenator McCain would like to ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside so that his amendment could then be in order. If \nso, I have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there an objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. McCain] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 3570.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To eliminate the sweetheart deals for Tennessee, Hawaii, \n         Louisiana, Montana, Connecticut, and frontier States)\n\n       At the end of subtitle F of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 1502. ELIMINATION OF SWEETHEART DEALS.\n\n       (a) Repeals.--Effective as if included in the enactment of \n     the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, the following \n     provisions are repealed:\n       (1) Sweetheart deal to provide tennessee with medicaid dsh \n     funds.--Clause (v) of section 1923(f)(6)(A) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-4(f)(6)(A)), as added by \n     section 1203(b) of this Act.\n       (2) Sweetheart deal to provide hawaii with medicaid dsh \n     funds.--Clause (iii) of section 1923(f)(6)(B) of the Social \n     Security Act (42 U.S.C. 1396r-4(f)(6)(B)), as added by \n     section 10201(e)(1)(A) of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act.\n       (3) Sweetheart deal to provide louisiana with a special \n     increased medicaid fmap.--Subsection (aa) of section 1905 of \n     the Social Security Act, as added by section 2006 of the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n       (4) Sweetheart deal that increases medicare reimbursement \n     just for frontier states.--Section 10324 of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act (and the amendments made \n     by such section).\n       (5) Sweetheart deal granting medicare coverage for \n     individuals exposed to environmental hazards in libby, \n     montana.--Section 10323 of the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act (and the amendments made by such \n     section).\n       (6) Sweetheart deal for a hospital in connecticut.--Section \n     10502 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act.\n       (b) Elimination of Sweetheart Deal That Reclassifies \n     Hospitals in Michigan and Connecticut to Increase Their \n     Medicare Reimbursement.--Section 3137(a) of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act, as amended by section \n     10317 of such Act, is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) by striking ``fiscal year 2010'' and all that follows \n     through ``for purposes of implementation of the amendment'' \n     and inserting ``fiscal year 2010.--For purposes of \n     implementation of the amendment''; and\n       (B) by striking subparagraph (B); and\n\n[[Page S1833]]\n\n       (2) by striking paragraph (3).\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I thank my colleague, the Senator from \nMontana, for his courtesy.\n  This amendment removes some of the remaining egregious sweetheart \ndeals contained in the health reform legislation. It removes the \nfollowing items from the health reform legislation: additional Medicaid \nfunding for Hawaii hospitals; additional Medicaid funding for Tennessee \nhospitals; the ``Louisiana purchase'' provided special Medicaid funding \nfor Louisiana; special Medicare funding primarily for reclassified \nhospitals in Michigan and Connecticut; the UConn proposal that provides \n$100 million for a Connecticut hospital; the frontier funding provision \nproviding new Medicare money for Montana, South Dakota, North Dakota, \nand Wyoming; the provision allowing for certain residents in Libby, MT, \nto participate in a new Medicare Program.\n  Let me say that I believe many of these proposals, including the \nLibby, MT, proposal, may be worthwhile, but what are they doing in a \nhealth care reform bill? What is the purpose except to put in a special \ndeal for a favored group? They may need this help. They may possibly \nvery badly and urgently need it. It seems to me, if that were the case, \nwe could make that argument and provide the people in Libby, MT, the \nability to participate in a Medicare Program as it stands. It is \nsomething that is not in keeping with health care reform.\n  The funding for Hawaii hospitals is there.\n  I want to say a word about the ``Louisiana purchase.'' The Senator \nfrom Louisiana comes down and forcefully and very convincingly argues \nthat this is very needed for the State of Louisiana, and Louisiana was \nhit by Hurricane Katrina. I point out that the State of Mississippi was \nalso hit and devastated by Hurricane Katrina, but we do not have \nanything in here for the State of Mississippi. I know the Governor of \nMississippi would argue that the devastation on the Mississippi coast \nwas equally as terrible as that for Louisiana. Instead, we have $300 \nmillion providing special Medicaid funding for Louisiana.\n  There are also States, including my own, that have suffered \ndevastating acts of God, acts of nature also from time to time.\n  Here we are at the eleventh hour with a situation where there are \nstill these backroom deals done that possibly we could address with an \namendment. The other deals we cannot because they were side agreements, \nsuch as the pharmaceutical companies I just read from, such as the deal \nwith the American Medical Association, the ones with the hospitals, the \nothers that were cut in order to get Members to come on board and \nsupport this legislation. This provides for an opportunity to remove \nthese provisions from the bill.\n  Comments made by Senator Reid's office:\n\n       You will find a number of States are treated different from \n     other States. That's what legislation is all about. It's \n     compromise. We worked on a number of things to get different \n     people's votes. There are many things you will look at in \n     this legislation and say: I wonder why that happened? A lot \n     of times you think something was done and, oh, that's how you \n     got their vote. Most of the time, that's really not true. \n     Some of the time it is.\n\n  If I could quote to my colleagues again the recent article from March \n21 called ``Inside the Pelosi Sausage Factory,'' I quote from the Wall \nStreet Journal article:\n\n       Never before has the average American been treated to such \n     a live-action view of the sordid politics necessary to push a \n     deeply flawed bill to completion. It was dirty deals, open \n     threats, broken promises and disregard for democracy that \n     pulled ObamaCare to this point, and yesterday the same \n     machinations pushed it across the finish line . . .\n       As for those who needed more persuasion: California Rep. \n     Jim Costa bragged publicly that during his meeting in the \n     Oval Office, he'd demanded the administration increase water \n     to his Central Valley district. On Tuesday, Interior pushed \n     up its announcement, giving the Central Valley farmers 25 \n     percent of water supplies, rather than the expected 5 percent \n     allocation. Mr. Costa, who denies there was a quid pro quo, \n     on Saturday said he'd flip to a yes.\n       Florida Rep. Susan Kosmas (whose district is home to the \n     Kennedy Space Center) admitted that in her own Thursday \n     meeting with the president, she'd brought up the need for \n     more NASA funding. On Friday she flipped to a yes. So watch \n     the NASA budget.\n       Democrats inserted a new provision providing $100 million \n     in extra Medicaid money for Tennessee. Retiring Tennessee \n     Rep. Bart Gordon flipped to a yes vote on Thursday.\n       Outside heavies were enlisted to warn potential no votes \n     that unions and other Democrats would run them out of \n     Congress.\n\n  The list goes on and on.\n  Again, eight times the President of the United States said in the \ncampaign that all negotiations on health care reform would be conducted \nwith C-SPAN cameras in the room. He said: We will find out who is on \nthe side of pharmaceutical companies, who is on the side of the voters. \nUnfortunately, these deals were made out of the view of the C-SPAN \ncameras--in fact, behind closed doors.\n  This is a pretty simple amendment. I repeat, it removes the \nadditional Medicaid funding for Hawaii hospitals; additional Medicaid \nfunding for Tennessee hospitals; the ``Louisiana purchase;'' special \nMedicare funding primarily for reclassified hospitals in Michigan and \nConnecticut; $100 million for a Connecticut hospital; the frontier \nfunding provision providing new Medicare money for Montana, South \nDakota, North Dakota, and Wyoming; and the special provision for Libby, \nMT.\n  I know, again, that people will stand and defend each one of these \nprovisions. They are provisions that were not allowed or provided to \nevery other State in America. That is what makes them a special deal. \nThat is what makes Americans think that the way we do business around \nhere is not in their interest. It makes Americans believe we are \ncutting these deals in order to secure votes. Whenever these deals are \ncut, then the residents of other States are the ones who foot the bill.\n  I hope my colleagues will consider this amendment and remove all of \nthese remaining provisions. I cannot assure my colleagues or my \nconstituents that we have found them all, but at least it is a step in \nthe right direction.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will be glad to.\n  Mr. GREGG. It seems to me that what the Senator is trying to do is \nget back to what the other side claimed they were doing, which is \nhealth care reform. What the Senator is trying to do is take out of \nthis health care bill a lot of special walking-around money events that \ndid not have anything to do with health care reform; they just had to \ndo with getting a vote--getting a vote here, getting a vote there. If \nthey were going to do real health care reform, then it should rise and \nfall of its own weight. It should not require that these special deals \nbe put in there to get a vote, should it?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I believe all of my colleagues are of the highest \nintegrity, honorable people. I respect and admire their service to \ntheir States and the Nation. But there is no doubt, I say to my friend \nfrom New Hampshire, there is no doubt that these kinds of provisions in \na 2,700-page piece of legislation create the appearance that some \nStates are favored over others because of either the influence of their \nelected representative or in order to secure those votes. That is the \nappearance the American people have when we find these earmarks in \nlegislation which are somehow inserted without votes, without debate, \nwithout discussion, and there they are.\n  Mr. GREGG. I guess my point is, independent of these amendments, \nMembers should be able to vote on this bill up or down without these \namendments in it. These amendments are extraneous to health care \nreform. The core of health care reform has nothing to do with any of \nthese amendments. As the Senator from Arizona says, they may be \nworthwhile in some instances, but they are not tied to the purpose of \nthis bill, which was allegedly health care reform; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I totally agree. Again, I pointed out a short time ago--\nas in the day before yesterday--what was the rationale for adding $100 \nmillion in extra Medicaid money for Tennessee? Why, after a year of \ndebate and discussion on this, all of a sudden $100 million extra for \nMedicaid is deemed necessary for the State of Tennessee? This is what \narouses the suspicion of the American people, I say to my colleague.\n\n  There will be a stout defense of every one of these. But the point is \nthat if they are done in the regular authorization and appropriations \nbills, and certainly not in the name of health care\n\n[[Page S1834]]\n\nreform, they are extra money. Where is the reform in $100 million for a \nhospital in Connecticut? What does that have to do with reform? \nNothing.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time to the Senator from Wyoming?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I yield to the Senator from Wyoming such time as he may \nconsume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, it is a privilege to be here on the \nfloor with my colleague from Arizona because he talks so well on this \ntopic and he knows it so very well. He knows how to read this \nlegislation and look through the nooks and the crannies.\n  I will tell all of you and my colleagues that I spent some time \nSunday visiting my friend, a veteran from World War II, in the \nhospital. He broke his hip and he is recovering and he is bothered by a \nlot of things. He said what are the people in Washington thinking? He \nis recovering from his surgery and he said why are they taking my \nMedicare money to start a new government program and how in the heck \ndid they get all of those votes that they needed to get this bill \npassed? He said has it been vote buying, sweetheart deals, a culture of \ncorruption in Washington?\n  Those are the questions being asked by people all around this country \nwhich is why this bill, when it was brought to the floor in the House, \nwhat we have seen is that half of the people of America are vehemently \nopposed, strongly opposed to the bill and fewer than one in four \nsupports it.\n  The thing that touched the nerve of the American people before \nChristmas was the ``Cornhusker kickback.'' That actually has not been \ntaken out of the bill. What they have done is said let's spend more \nmoney and give that same special sweetheart deal to other States around \nthe rest of the country. So that actually is still in there. Yet the \nPresident said we are not going to have any special deals. It happened \nwhen Senator McCain and I were at the White House for this summit and \nSenator McCain asked the specific question of the President, he said, \nWhat about all these deals.\n  He said they should come out.\n  Yet we see today that not only have many of those deals not come out, \nthere is a whole list of additional sweetheart deals put in to get this \nbill through the House of Representatives. The people of Wyoming are \nasking why.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator from Wyoming on that point yield because \nI think he has made a very important point. I was not at the summit but \nI would like the Senator from Arizona to relate to us what the exchange \nwas with the President on the issue of those sweetheart deals because I \nthink if the President's position is they should be out and they don't \nhave anything to do with the fundamental reform exercise, shouldn't \nthey be out?\n  Mr. McCAIN. I would say to my friend, I had the exchange with the \nPresident specifically over the so-called ``Gator Aid'' amendment \nbecause 330,000 citizens of my State were enrolled in Medicare \nAdvantage who are going to be placed at a great disadvantage because we \nhad carved out a special provision for 800,000 citizens of Florida who \nwere under the Medicare Advantage Program.\n  By the way, I remind my colleagues that I proposed an amendment to \nremove that on this floor from that bill. Does anybody really believe \nthat if it had not been for the publicity surrounding these special \ndeals that they would have voluntarily taken out the 800,000-person \ncarve-out for the State of Florida? I do not think so because I \nproposed an amendment to take it out and it was defeated. It was kept \nin on a party-line vote.\n  Fortunately I brought it up at the White House with the President and \nthe President agreed it was not a good idea. So, after voting to keep \nit in, after defeating an amendment that--I tried to remove it--\nfortunately there was enough publicity, there was enough focus on it \nthat it forced them to take it out.\n  Unfortunately, there is not enough focus on the hospital in \nConnecticut and these other provisions which are special deals.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. So here we are. We are looking at a bill, in my \nopinion, having practiced medicine for 25 years, taking care of \nfamilies all across the State of Wyoming, that is fundamentally going \nto be bad for patients, bad for providers, our nurses and our doctors, \nand bad for payers, the people who are going to pay the bill, the \nAmerican taxpayers. That is why Warren Buffett, when he looked at this \nwhole piece of legislation, said it is time to eliminate about 2,500 \npages of the nonsense and focus on cutting costs.\n  In my opinion, having looked at this and visiting with other \nphysicians and hospital administrators, it looks to me that with the \nbill the President signed into law today, which cuts Medicare by $500 \nbillion, not to save Medicare but to start a whole new government \nprogram, which raises taxes by another $500 billion on American \nfamilies, I believe this bill, still loaded with sweetheart deals, is \ngoing to cause people to see that their own insurance premiums are \ngoing to go up, their taxes are going to go up, and they are going to \nfind out that the quality of their medical care is going to go down.\n  We saw it in Massachusetts where, with the result of this program, a \nprogram very similar, it is now the most expensive State in the country \nfor health insurance. It is breaking the budget of the State and people \nhave to wait 42 days to get a physician. Yet the President says we are \ngoing to cover more people and he is going to do it by cramming 16 \nmillion more Americans onto Medicaid, a program in which many doctors \nwill not even see those patients because the reimbursement is so low.\n  I see my colleague from New Hampshire and I said that is what I am \nhearing in Wyoming. Is that what we are hearing in New Hampshire? And \nthen maybe our friend from Arizona has different thoughts.\n  Mr. GREGG. It absolutely is, and the doctor has described it \npersonally, from his own personal experience and that is a lot of \ndoctors are not going to see patients, especially on Medicaid or \nMedicare, because the reimbursement rates are so low.\n  There is a philosophical issue here of whether a bill should be \nfilled with these sweetheart deals, but there is a practical issue too. \nI can't imagine why anybody on the other side of the aisle would be \nagainst eliminating these sweetheart deals other than the people who \ncome from these States that benefit from them. This is not going to be \nextraordinarily disruptive to this bill. If this amendment were to \npass, which took out these various deals which should not be in the \nbill to begin with, the bill goes back to the House. The House doesn't \nlike these deals. Heck, they are for Senators. I suspect the House \nwould be happy to have these deals come out so they will repass the \nbill without these deals.\n  Why not vote this amendment? Why not positively vote this amendment? \nThere is no logical reason not to do it other than, I guess, nobody \nwants to let any amendments pass that deal with this bill in any way, \neven if they are extraordinarily reasonable amendments such as this, on \nwhich there should be unanimity, except for the folks who benefit from \nthe specific deals.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I wish to summarize by saying I hope we \nwill take out these deals. I hope every time we find another one in \nthis 2,733-page legislation, we will take it out too. But I hope also \nthat my friends on the other side of the aisle and the President of the \nUnited States will learn a lesson. Next time you want to sit down and \nenact a major piece of legislation, bring us in in the beginning. Bring \nus in so we can have true bipartisan negotiations, and any allegation \nto the contrary is patently false. I know because I have been involved \nin bipartisan negotiations and this is what happens when you have to go \naround shopping for votes to finally put you over the top. The American \npeople, with the election of a new Senator from Massachusetts, have \nrejected this process. They have rejected this process.\n  Let's listen to the people of this country who say they want these \nthings out. That is not how they want the Congress of the United States \nto do business. Let's take them out. Let's stop this legislation and \nlet's start from the beginning and let's fix health\n\n[[Page S1835]]\n\ncare in America. And, certainly, let's all pledge to stop doing these \nkinds of backroom behaviors that the American people have grown sick \nand tired of.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I congratulate the Senator from Arizona, \nagain, for being the voice of conscience for this body relative to \nmaking sure we are playing straight with the American people and their \ntax dollars by not allowing these types of special deals to be put into \nbills. He has a long and very strong record in this area. This \namendment--I cannot imagine why it would be opposed.\n  I understand that the 2 hours which we had time agreements under has \nbasically been completed. I suggest for the next 2 hours we continue \nwith this same course of action, if it is agreeable to the Democratic \nmanager. We have a half hour on the Democratic side, a half hour on our \nside; a half hour on the Democratic side, a half hour on our side. Is \nthat acceptable?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. At this point let's keep it to 1 hour; a half hour to \neach side and we can go back and revisit it.\n  Mr. GREGG. So the next hour will be divided 30 minutes with the \nmajority and 30 minutes with the minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I am sorry, was there consent?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 1 hour equally divided, with the \nmajority having the first half hour.\n  The Senator from Arizona has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will summarize again. These deals were cut for special \nsituations. We have had disasters all over America. We had a disaster \nin the State of Mississippi. There was nothing in this for the State of \nMississippi, which was struck by Katrina as well. The fact is it was \nalso done in a managers' package. There was no debate, there was no \ndiscussion. I certainly, and the rest of this side, was not told about \nit and I was not the only one.\n  It was a deal that was cut. These deals have all got to be removed. I \ncertainly will support doing anything necessary to help any State in \nAmerica that is struck by a disaster, not just Louisiana, but Arizona \nand California and every other State that has been. But I will not do \nit by inserting a special provision in what is supposed to be a health \ncare reform bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to remove all of these sweetheart deals.\n  I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee, Senator Conrad, 20 minutes from our time in opposition to \nthe McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank Chairman Baucus for his \nextraordinary leadership in legislation that became the law of the land \ntoday with the signature by the President. That is the bill that came \nout of the Senate. It came out of the Finance Committee, it came out of \nthe HELP Committee. This bill went to the House, was passed and was \nsigned into law by the President today.\n  This was the headline from the New York Times yesterday: ``Congress \nSends White House Landmark Health Overhaul.'' Landmark health overhaul \nindeed it is.\n  The Senate is now turning to a separate reconciliation bill passed by \nthe House. That bill includes modifications to the comprehensive reform \nmeasure President Obama signed today.\n  These are changes that have been negotiated with the House. This \nhealth care fixer bill represents a limited and appropriate use of the \nreconciliation process. And the reconciliation bill also includes \ncertain education provisions to make college more affordable, and to \nsupport higher education.\n  I want to begin by highlighting the impact of the comprehensive bill \npassed by the Senate on Christmas Eve, passed by the House over the \nweekend, signed into law by the President today. That bill meets key \nreform benchmarks. It is fully paid for and in fact reduces both the \nshort- and long-term deficits. It expands coverage to 94 percent of \nAmericans. It promotes choice and competition. It contains critical \ninsurance market reforms and bans the denial of coverage based on \npreexisting conditions. It contains delivery system reforms that will \nbring us better quality at lower cost.\n  Here is what this health care reform bill will mean for my State of \nNorth Dakota. It ends insurance abuses. Insurers will no longer be able \nto deny coverage for you or your children because of preexisting \nconditions or raise premiums when you get sick.\n  It provides tax breaks for small businesses. Small businesses will \nget tax credits to help buy coverage for their workers.\n  I had a Republican businessman tell a friend of mine over the weekend \nthat he has had to stop coverage of his employees, although he would \nlike to extend it to them, but believes that this bill now will allow \nhim to once again provide insurance coverage to his employees.\n  It insures young people. Young North Dakotans will be able to stay on \ntheir parents' health insurance until they are 26 years old. It expands \ncoverage. North Dakotans will get more choice and tax credits to make \nhealth coverage more affordable. It helps workers. Workers will be able \nto change jobs without fear of losing health care coverage. It improves \nMedicare. Seniors will get preventive services without copayments, and \nthe gap in prescription drug coverage will be eliminated. It lowers \ncosts. Premiums for the same level of coverage will be lower after \nhealth care reform than they would have been without it.\n  Despite claims from some of my Republican colleagues that this health \ncare reform adds to the deficit, it does not. The Congressional Budget \nOffice, which is the official scorer, has said that the comprehensive \nbill signed by the President today reduces the deficit by $118 billion \nover the first 10 years. As I will show later, when you add in the \nimpact of the reconciliation bill before us now, the total deficit \nreduction in the first 10-year period is $143 billion. It is not my \nestimate, not the Democratic Party's estimate, not the Democratic \nleadership's estimate; that is the estimate by the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office that officially scores legislation before \nthis Congress.\n  This reform continues to reduce the deficit in the second 10 years. \nHere is what CBO said in its analysis of the reform signed into law by \nthe President today:\n\n       CBO expects that the legislation would reduce Federal \n     budget deficits over the decade after 2019 relative to those \n     projected and under current law, with a total effect during \n     that decade that is in a broad range between one-quarter and \n     one-half percent of GDP.\n\n  To translate that into dollar terms, that would be a reduction in the \ndeficit in the second 10 years of $650 billion to $1.3 trillion. And \nnow we have the happy ability to inform our colleagues that with the \nreconciliation bill added in, the total deficit reduction will be one-\nhalf of 1 percent of GDP in the second 10 years or $1.3 trillion.\n  This health care reform package also expands coverage. Again, I am \nreferring now to the bill signed into law by the President today \nbecause that bill alone expands coverage to 94 percent of the American \npeople by building off the existing employer-based system. It creates \nState-based health exchanges for individuals and small businesses. It \nprovides tax credits to help individuals and small businesses buy \ninsurance. It expands Medicaid eligibility while providing additional \nassistance to the States to pay for it.\n  This health care reform also includes dramatic reforms in the health \ninsurance market--measures that will positively impact millions of \nAmericans. It prohibits insurers from denying coverage for preexisting \nconditions. It prohibits insurers from rescinding coverage when people \nget sick. It bans insurers from imposing lifetime caps and unreasonable \nannual limits on health care benefits. It prevents insurers from \ncharging more based on health status.\n  This reform package signed by the President today takes a number of \nimportant steps to improve the quality of care. It covers preventive \nservices. It provides incentives for healthy lifestyles. It promotes \nthe adoption of best practices and the use of comparative effectiveness \nresearch to find out, on a scientific basis, what actually works. Who \nis against using something that actually works?\n  It includes delivery system reforms that encourage quality over \nquantity\n\n[[Page S1836]]\n\nof care--something health care economists have told us is the single \nmost important part of this package. These delivery system reforms do \nnot get a lot of attention, but they have the potential to dramatically \nimprove our long-term health outcomes. These reforms include \naccountable care organizations, primary care payment bonuses, \nreadmissions, hospital value-based purchasing, comparative \neffectiveness research, a CMS innovation center, an independent payment \nadvisory board and payment bundling--all of them recommended by \nDemocratic and Republican health care economists who told us these are \nthe things that can fundamentally change our system to lower costs over \ntime and improve quality.\n  You would not know it from listening to some of the coverage, but \nthis health care reform has widespread support among health care \nexperts and health care organizations in my State of North Dakota. This \nlegislation has been endorsed by the North Dakota Hospital Association; \nthe North Dakota Medical Association, representing our State's doctors; \nthe North Dakota Nurses Association, representing our State's nurses; \nthe North Dakota AARP, representing our State's seniors; the Community \nHealth Care Association, and on and on.\n  There has been a lot of misinformation spread about this health care \nreform package, so I want to take a moment to say what is not in this \nplan. It does not include government-run health care. There is no \ngovernment takeover. This is private insurance, not government \ninsurance. It includes no cut in guaranteed benefits for seniors. The \nMedicare savings overwhelmingly are savings from providers negotiated \nwith providers. Why would they agree to hundreds of billions of dollars \nin lower payments than they were expecting--in other words, less of an \nincrease than they were anticipating? Because they know, with 30 \nmillion more people insured, that their costs will be reduced and they \ncan afford less of an increase. It includes no death panels. It \nincludes no coverage for illegal immigrants. It includes no expansion \nof Federal funding for abortion services.\n  I would like to briefly address the reconciliation bill that is \nbefore us now. Remember, we have already passed comprehensive reform. \nThat was done on Christmas Eve. That was passed by the House this \nweekend. That was signed into law by the President today. What is \nbefore us now is a reconciliation package. It includes limited \nmodifications or fixes to the comprehensive health care bill which \npassed earlier. It is fully paid for and includes additional deficit \nreductions over and above the comprehensive bill that became law today. \nThis reconciliation bill follows the requirements of reconciliation by \nincluding budget-related provisions only, no proposed changes on \nstrictly policy matters.\n  Here are key health care fixes in this bill: It improves the \naffordability of health care. It eliminates the gap in Medicare drug \ncoverage, also known as the doughnut hole. It adjusts the amount of \nFederal aid going to States for Medicare, and also States are treated \nthe same. Despite the rhetoric on the other side, let's be clear on \nMedicaid. All States are treated the same. It further reduces \noverpayments to Medicare Advantage, and it takes additional steps to \nreduce waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  Here are key education provisions in the reconciliation bill as well: \nIt expands Pell grants to make college more affordable. It eliminates \nbank-based student lending, which saves, according to CBO, $61 billion \nof taxpayer money that can then be redirected to actually support \nstudents. I thought that is what student aid was about, to support \nstudents. It supports historically Black colleges and extends funding \nfor higher education.\n  Some of my colleagues of the party opposite have described \nreconciliation as an obscure and rarely used procedure. The fact is, it \nhas been used 22 times, 16 times when they were in control of the \nSenate. And we are using reconciliation to appropriately reduce the \ndeficit, unlike our friends on the other side, who used the process to \npass unpaid-for tax cuts that resulted in much higher deficits.\n  Here is how Senator Gregg justified the use of reconciliation by the \nthen Republican majority in 2005 in its effort to open the Arctic \nNational Wildlife Refuge to drilling. He stated:\n\n       Reconciliation is a rule of the Senate set up under the \n     Budget Act . . . The fact is, all this rule of the Senate \n     does is allow a majority of the Senate to take a position and \n     pass a piece of legislation [and it does it with a simple \n     majority vote.] Is there something wrong with majority rules? \n     I do not think so. The reason the Budget Act was written in \n     this way was to allow certain unique issues to be passed with \n     a majority vote. That is what is being asked for here.\n\n  That is the quote of Senator Gregg, who was then chairman of the \nBudget Committee. He said: It allows a simple majority vote. He asked: \nWhat is wrong with that? It is interesting now to hear the other side \nsay that somehow that is wrong.\n  As I noted, this reconciliation bill will add further deficit \nreduction to the health care reform estimate. Here is CBO's estimate of \nthe combined effect of the bill signed into law by the President today \nand the bill that is before us now. It shows that the deficits will be \nreduced by a total of $143 billion over the first 10 years--$143 \nbillion. That is according to the Congressional Budget Office. The two \nmeasures taken together will continue to reduce deficits in the second \n10 years and beyond.\n  Here is what CBO said in its cost estimate:\n\n       . . . [T]he combined effect of enacting [the Senate bill] \n     and the reconciliation proposal would . . . be to reduce \n     federal budget deficits over the ensuing decade [beyond 2019] \n     relative to those projected under current law--with a total \n     effect during that decade in a broad range around one-half \n     percent of GDP.\n\n  That translates into dollars of $1.38 trillion. One-half percent of \nGDP in the second decade is $1.3 trillion of deficit reduction--not \nmillion, not billion; trillion--$1.3 trillion dollars of deficit \nreduction, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Anybody who does not want additional deficit reduction ought to vote \nno. Those who want to reduce the burgeoning deficit and debt ought to \nvote aye.\n  This health care reform bill does not represent the end of the story. \nIt is a beginning. But it is an important beginning, one that reduces \nthe deficit and reduces the debt--not according to Democrats, not \naccording to Republicans, but according to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, which has the responsibility of giving us \nobjective analysis. That is their job. They do it well.\n  This bill, combined with the bill signed earlier today by the \nPresident, reduces the deficit by $1.3 trillion. In addition, it has \nthese critically important insurance and delivery system reforms that \nevery health care economist who came before us said would, over time, \nmake a meaningful difference in reducing health care costs for American \nconsumers.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would like to end by talking about a matter that has \nbeen brought up by some on the other side, the so-called frontier \namendment. The frontier amendment was offered openly here on the floor \nof the Senate by my colleague, Senator Dorgan. Everybody had a chance \nto review that amendment. It does not affect one State; it affects five \nStates. Some of the States are represented by just Republican Senators. \nIn fact, two of the States are represented just by Republican Senators. \nOne of the States is represented by one Democrat and one Republican, \nthe other two by two Democrats. This is certainly not a partisan \namendment.\n  Why was it offered by my colleague, Senator Dorgan? It was offered \nbecause these five States are at the bottom in Medicare reimbursement \nand have been for many years. They are the most rural States in the \nNation. The way the formula works, those States have been penalized.\n  Let me just say that in my State, to treat the exact same illness, \nthe hospitals in my State get one-third to one-half as much as the more \npopulous States in the country to treat the exact same illness.\n  When we go to get technology, we don't get a rural discount. In fact, \nwe pay more because we are buying in smaller order quantities. When we \ngo to attract a doctor or nurse, they don't say to us: Because you get \none-third or one-half as much in Medicare reimbursement, we will only \ncharge you one-third to one-half as much to come\n\n[[Page S1837]]\n\nto your State or to stay in your State. That isn't what happens.\n  I have had the major hospital administrators in my State say: Unless \nhealth care reform fixes this, we are going to begin to have to lay off \npeople and to begin to reduce services, and reduce them dramatically, \nbecause we can no longer survive getting reimbursement for the majority \nof our patients because, remember, the majority of the patients in \nthese rural hospitals are Medicare-eligible patients. They are getting \none-third to one-half as much as the more populous States, the \nhospitals in the more populous States, to treat the exact same \nillnesses.\n  That is not fair. That is fundamentally an issue for health care \nreform. That is why this amendment is included, and that is why it \ndeserves to be retained.\n  I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for his extraordinary \neffort. I am in my 24th year here. I have never seen a Member put in \nthe kind of concentrated and focused effort as the chairman of the \nFinance Committee did on this bill--hundreds of hours of his personal \ntime over a year and a half to get a good package, a responsible \npackage.\n  I also thank Chris Dodd, chairman of the HELP Committee, for his \nexceptional efforts; and certainly our leader, Harry Reid, for bringing \nthe two together in a way that enjoyed the unanimous support of the \nMembers on our side of the aisle. That is a remarkable accomplishment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nMontana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, speaking on the bill, I thank my friend \nfrom North Dakota for his kind statement. Knowing all the hours and \ndays and weeks, months that we spent on this bill, I thank him because \nmy good friend has been there for most of those hours and weeks and \nmonths spent on this bill. I thank him very much for that observation, \nas well as Senators Harkin and Dodd and the ranking members, too, in \nmany respects.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Louisiana from the time under \nour control on the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the chairman and add my compliments to him for \nhis extraordinary leadership over the last several months in managing \nthis very important piece of legislation through the process, a major \npiece of legislation that garnered 60 votes on the floor of the Senate.\n  The Chair knows because he has worked on many pieces of legislation, \neven in his short time in the Senate, but his longer time in the House, \nhow difficult that is, particularly on an issue such as this that has \neluded our country time and time again. Even though great attempts were \nmade by extraordinary Presidents and wonderful Congresses in the past, \nthis victory has eluded them. But we are close to capturing it now.\n  I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee. He probably spent more \ntime, except maybe for Harry Reid himself, on ushering us to this \npoint. I was in many of those meetings, and his patience was \ninspirational, as was his steady hand when things got tough. I thank \nhim, and I also thank the chairman of the Budget Committee. No one has \na better command of this budget in this entire body than Kent Conrad. \nHe has spoken in some detail and depth about the significant cost \nreductions and deficit reductions that will occur because of our work.\n  I came down to speak specifically about the amendment just offered by \nthe Senator from Arizona. I actually went to the desk to get a copy of \nit because I wanted to read it for myself. This amendment is a stunt. \nIt doesn't deserve the time I am going to give to explain the portion \nof it that refers to Louisiana. The reason I say it is a stunt is \nbecause it is actually written for television or the Internet. It is \nnot written for any serious debate. In my view, it is beneath the \nSenator from Arizona who at one time was a candidate for President. The \nreason I say it is a stunt is because the word ``sweetheart'' is \nactually written in this amendment.\n  Normally, the only time I see that word is when my husband sends me a \ndozen roses on Valentine's Day, which he does most years. But to \nactually draft an amendment like this that actually uses the words \n``sweetheart deal'' is an insult to the people of our country, and I \nwould expect more from him.\n  I have tried to explain this to him privately on any number of \noccasions. I have provided him and his staff with every document they \nhave ever requested. I am here to say one more time, the people of \nLouisiana do not deserve the derision from him or from any member of \nthe Republican team, my Republican allies, because of asking for a \ncorrection in a formula that would have been devastating to the State \nof Louisiana or to any State that experienced the kind of catastrophic \ndisaster we did.\n  This amendment that I got on might have been unknown to Senator \nMcCain, but it was not a secret. How would I know that? Because \nactually I called a press conference with the Governor of Louisiana, \nRepublican Governor, and announced it. That is why I know it wasn't a \nsecret. We didn't have one press conference together; we had three.\n  As I have explained to the Senator from Arizona, just because he \ndidn't know about it doesn't mean it was a secret. There are lots of \nthings that happen in Washington--it is a big place; it is a big \ncountry--that he doesn't know about. This is one of them.\n  There were three press conferences called, and our entire delegation \nwrote a letter, a public letter, which I have given to every reporter \nwho has asked for it, asking for consideration for this.\n  No. 3, how would I know it is not a secret? Because my legislature, \nwhich is represented by 50 percent Republican and 50 percent Democrat, \nunanimously passed it in a public forum. So the people of Louisiana, \nwhom I represent, believe me, are sick and tired of hearing their name \ndragged through the mud. You want to drag a name through the mud, drag \nmine. But leave the people I represent out of it.\n  When the health care debate came forward and we recognized, at the \nGovernor's request--I ask for a minute more.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Off the bill.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. When the health care debate started, our Governor \nrecognized that without this change, the State of Louisiana would lose \nsomewhere about $450 million because, under the formula that was \ncalculated, which is done publicly, the Federal Government declared \nthat the Louisiana per capita income had increased 40 percent. It has \nnever happened in the history of the United States. No State in no year \nin no decade--even with the gold rush, even with discovering oil, even \nwith the greatest inventions of the world--no State's income has ever \ngone up 40 percent. And ours did not. The people I represent are not \nricher because of Katrina; we are poorer.\n  I will not back up a minute to ask for help for them. All I have \nasked in this bill, and we have gotten, despite the effort on the other \nside to undo it, and we will not undo it--all we are asking for is to \nlet us pay the same Medicaid match that we have paid for the last 10 \nyears, as long as I know. Louisiana pays 30 cents; the Federal \nGovernment pays 70. Our people are covered.\n  I ask for 30 more seconds, and I promise I will end here. We are not \nasking for special treatment. We are asking just to pay the same amount \nof Medicaid as we have paid for the last 10 years. It was not done \nsecretly. It was not done behind closed doors. It was not done to buy \nmy vote. My vote was given to this bill because this bill deserves it, \nbecause it is a very good piece of legislation.\n  I told the leader I would vote for it whether this was in it or not. \nI am tired, but I am not going to sit down and not defend the people of \nmy State.\n  The other Members can speak about what they wanted. This is not a \nsweetheart deal. It is a stunt from a Senator I would expect more from.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have very little time left, perhaps \nmaybe a minute or two. I will use it. But I want to speak more on this \nsubject at a later time. I might also inform my colleagues that the \nnext half hour, which is allocated to the Republican side, will expire \nat around roughly 6:40. At that time, we will try to work out an \nagreement where we trade, both sides, half hour per side.\n\n[[Page S1838]]\n\n  I alert colleagues, if they wish to speak on this reconciliation \nbill, in about 30 minutes we will try to set up an arrangement for \ncolleagues to speak.\n  How much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 55 seconds.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think it more prudent not to use those 55 seconds but \nto keep it. I will let the Senator from New Hampshire allocate time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would like to respond to a couple \ncomments just made and then at the first available option, I will file \na motion to recommit the bill. Before I get into a discussion of this \nmotion, I would like to respond to the argument that is consistently \nmade that the health care legislation that was signed by the President \ntoday and is supplemented by this reconciliation bill is going to \nactually result in deficit reduction.\n  What we need to understand is that among the many other pieces of \nthis bill, ultimately it will result in growing the Federal Government \nby about $2.6 trillion over the next 10 years. This chart shows \ngraphically or pictorially what will happen.\n  You will notice I have had to mark out the numbers there and change \nthe 2.5 to 2.6. That is because under the original bill it was 2.5. Now \nwith the bill before us today it is going up, not down, to $2.6 \ntrillion of new spending.\n  There are only a few ways you can claim that is going to result in a \nreduction of our deficit. Nobody denies it is going to result in a \nmassive increase in the size of the Federal Government, regardless of \nthe other portions of this bill.\n  How does a $2.6 trillion increase in spending result in deficit \nreduction? First, because there are massive new taxes in this bill that \ngo along with this increase in spending that are offset against it. \nSecondly, because there are massive cuts in Medicare, over $500 \nbillion, $610 billion of new taxes, $529 billion of new Medicare cuts, \nwhich results in about a $1 trillion offset, about $1.1 trillion of \noffset. How do you get to the rest of the offset to claim that this \nbill is deficit neutral or reduces the deficit?\n  That is what I call the gimmicks. For example, $29 billion of Social \nSecurity revenue is raided from the Social Security trust fund and \nallocated to this bill. The CLASS Act, which has been called a Ponzi \nscheme by Members of the other side of the aisle, is adding another $70 \nbillion of revenue. The Medicare cuts are actually counted twice \nbecause they are not used to sustain the Medicare system. They are used \nto finance a brandnew entitlement system in this bill.\n  When you sort through it all, if you stop the gimmicks, and if you do \nthe math with the gimmicks taken out, we don't have deficit reduction. \nWe actually have a deficit increase, about $619 billion of increased \ndeficit under this bill.\n  I think we need to get the facts all out in front of us and discuss \nthem. But I want to talk specifically for just a moment now about the \nmotion I am going to make. The motion I am going to make is the same \nmotion I made when we debated the main health care bill last December. \nIt is a motion that simply helps us make sure this bill complies with \nthe President's promise.\n  What did the President promise? The President has said multiple \ntimes--and here is one of his quotes:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge . . . no family making less than \n     $250,000 will see their taxes increase--not your income \n     taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, \n     not any of your taxes . . . you will not see any of your \n     taxes increase one single dime.\n\n  That was the President's pledge.\n  When I brought this motion--when we debated the original health care \nbill that was signed into law by the President today--it was attacked \nand actually defeated on the floor on the grounds that to do so, to \nadopt my motion, would result in killing the bill. It would destroy the \nbill. All my motion did was say, let's temporarily send this bill back \nto the committee, have them strip out all of the taxes that hit the \nmiddle class--families making less than $250,000--and bring the bill \nright back to the floor. I was told that would kill the bill, that \nwould gut the bill.\n  Well, first of all, if that was going to gut the bill, then that is a \nconcession that the bill is full of taxes on families who make less \nthan 250,000. As a matter of fact, that is true. Again, the bill before \nthis reconciliation bill was analyzed by the Joint Committee on \nTaxation, and their conclusion--not mine--was that by 2019 at least 73 \nmillion American households earning below $200,000 will be paying more \ntaxes because of the taxes imposed by this bill--that $610 billion of \ntaxes that is used to help claim that this bill does not increase the \ndeficit.\n  Well, what happened last time when we debated it? It was attacked \nbecause it would gut the bill if we took these taxes out of it, and my \nmotion was defeated.\n  There was another argument made against the motion at that time; that \nis, the bill we were debating was not actually a tax increase, it was a \ntax cut. The way that argument went was: We have more tax cuts in the \nbill than we have tax increases. The only way that argument could be \nmade is by saying the subsidies that are provided to low-income \nindividuals in our country are tax cuts, even though they do not pay \nany taxes. Yet, all of the subsidies in the new entitlement program \nwere counted as tax cuts, and they were offset against the true tax \nincreases that are going to be paid by the middle class in America; and \nthe argument was made it was a tax cut.\n  Well, first of all, it is not a valid argument. There are $610 \nbillion of new taxes in this bill. Secondly, I do not think that is \nwhat President Obama was talking about. He did not say: I will not \nraise your taxes more for some people than I will cut them for someone \nelse. He was saying he would not raise taxes, and that this bill would \nnot be allowed to be used as a vehicle to do so.\n  Let's get back to the main argument that was made against my motion \nbefore; that is, it would gut the bill. Well, that cannot be true \nanymore. The bill was signed into law by the President today, so it is \nlaw today. And now I think it is time for this Congress to simply fix \nthe problem. All we have to do with my motion--when I am allowed to \nhave an opportunity to propose it--is to commit this bill to the \ncommittee and have the committee take out all the taxes that apply to \nindividuals who make less than 200,000 and families who make less than \n$250,000.\n  It is very straightforward. You can argue that there are not such \ntaxes in the bill, and if there are not, then my motion will not do a \nthing to the bill. But the reality is, the vast majority of the taxes \nin this bill are going to be paid by the middle class. By the Joint Tax \nCommittee's analysis, 73 million households in America are going to be \npaying these taxes, and all this motion does is say let's get back to \nthe President's pledge and do what the President said. Let's take out \nof the bill the taxes that are going to be slamming the middle class in \nAmerica as this bill becomes law.\n  With that, Mr. President, I would be glad to yield to any of my \ncolleagues here on the floor who would like to make comments on this \nissue. Senator Risch, my colleague from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I rise in support of my distinguished colleague from Idaho. He has \nbrought to the floor the language that the President of the United \nStates gave to the American people in order to convince them to vote \nfor him for President of the United States. It was a serious promise. \nIt was a serious commitment. He said: I will not increase the taxes on \nindividuals making less than $200,000 a year or families making less \nthan $250,000 a year. My good friend from Idaho points out there are \nnumerous provisions in this bill that break that promise.\n  I am disappointed the President has done this. I am disappointed he \nwill not take responsibility for it. I am disappointed he did not point \nit out when he signed the bill. He talked only about the good things it \ndid. The President should--he really should--keep the commitment he \nmade to the American people. If we are going to have a country where \npeople have faith in their government, particularly in its Chief \nExecutive, they have to believe what he said.\n  My good friend from Idaho has indicated he is going to bring a motion \nto\n\n[[Page S1839]]\n\ncommit the bill to get all of these out of there. I want to talk about \none that is very focused. I am only going to talk about one of these \ntaxes the President of the United States is raising on people who make \nless than $200,000 a year. The reason I bring this one to the floor is \nthis is a direct assault on some of the most vulnerable people in this \ncountry.\n  This particular increase in taxes is on 14.7 million people who earn \nless than $200,000 a year and who have had substantial medical bills \nduring the year. How this bill does it, it simply changes the \npercentage which you can deduct on your income tax return if you incur \nmedical expenses. It is not a slight amount. It is $15 billion that \nthis tax takes from some of the most vulnerable people in America.\n  The President of the United States promised he would not raise taxes \non people who made less than $200,000 a year. He made that promise, and \nthis provision in the bill--in the bill that has been signed into law \nby the President--breaks that promise, and it breaks the promise not \njust on people who make $200,000 or less a year, but it breaks the \npromise as to the most vulnerable people in America.\n  The provision in this bill the President signed into law this morning \naffects 14.7 million people. Today, 14.8 million people take this \ndeduction. They are people who have been injured, people who have been \nsick, people who suffer from diseases, and they take this deduction \nbecause the Congress of the United States has deemed it appropriate \nthat when you expend this kind of money, and you are in this vulnerable \na position, you should be entitled to deduct it from your taxes. This \nbill changes that.\n  When the President of the United States put the pen to that bill this \nmorning, it was in direct violation of his pledge not to increase taxes \non people who make less than $200,000 a year.\n  So what do we have here? We have a bill that is reaching into the \npockets of 14.7 million Americans and taking directly out of their \npocket $15 billion, in direct contravention of the promise the \nPresident of the United States made to the American people when he \nstood up and asked them to elect him. Not only does it do that, it \nhurts the most vulnerable people in America.\n  My fellow Senators, I urge that you vote for this motion when it \ncomes up for a vote. And it will come up for a vote. It will help \nconstituents in every single State in America. It will put that $15 \nbillion back in the pockets of some of the most vulnerable people in \nAmerica. It will restore the promise the President of the United States \nmade to these 14.7 million people--many of whom voted for the \nPresident, and voted for the President believing he would take care of \nthem and see that their taxes did not increase. We can help the \nPresident keep his promise that he broke this morning when he signed \nthat bill.\n  I yield to my good friend, Senator Brownback.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I thank the Senator.\n  I rise to support my colleague from Idaho on this motion. I think \nthis makes sense. The Senator from Idaho is helping the President \nfulfill a campaign promise. It made sense to everybody across the \ncountry. I have looked at it, and I do not think we should raise taxes, \nperiod. I think it is taking money out of the economy. But he said: I \nwant to raise some taxes on people making over $200,000. Everybody \nheard it and thought: OK, that is not me, so I will vote for that. I \nlike that idea.\n  I want to take a particularly narrow piece of this that is in the \nbill that we have wrestled with in this body for some period of time, \nand that is the issue of the alternative minimum tax. That was passed \nyears ago. It was supposed to be a tax on wealthy people who were \navoiding paying income tax. So we put it in place and said: Well, \npeople who are wealthy should not be able to plan their way out of \npaying income tax, so we are going to put this alternative minimum tax \nin, and it is going to be on a set amount of money.\n  It was not indexed for inflation over time. So now, 10 years later, \nall of a sudden, there are a number of people--because of inflation \nhappening over a period of time--who get brought in under the \nalternative minimum tax, to where we then fight about it in this body \nas to how we are going to do the AMT fix. That is an annual debate we \nhave here.\n  Well, this tax on Medicare plans, or on the health care reform plans, \nwhere, OK, it is not supposed to tax people who make below $200,000--\nwhich I agree with, even though there are pieces in here that do--with \ninflation, over a period of time, you are going to see a large number \nof people, in 2009 dollars, making $200,000 or below who get taxed \nbecause of inflation and its value. We are looking at a situation in \nthe country now, with the monetary policy--lots of money out in the \nmoney supply, with the Federal Government's excessive spending, huge \namounts: $1.5 trillion in deficit spending--that the likelihood of \ninflation coming along is pretty high. Maybe it does not come this \nyear, but it does next year.\n  We normally run somewhere around a 3-percent inflation rate anyway. \nYou get that stoking up. Here is a chart the Joint Economic Committee \nstaff has done about what happens over a period of time when you do not \nindex for inflation, and this bill is not indexed for inflation.\n  So all of a sudden you end up having the middle class, and even \npeople currently determined as poor, actually paying the wealthy tax, \nand it is because of the lack of indexing for inflation over time. So \nyou end up over a period of time having people currently classified as \npoor paying a wealthy tax--unless you adopt something such as the Crapo \nmotion that says if you are making below this figure, you do not get \ntaxed, you are not going to get taxed.\n  This actually ends up being pretty substantial and hitting a large \nnumber of people over time, to the point where you are going to have a \nlarge group--again, this is from the Joint Economic Committee: For \nevery low to middle-income family with a tax cut, three low to middle-\nincome families have a tax increase.\n  The President said: That is not what I am going to do. I am not going \nto raise taxes on people who are low or middle income. Unless you adopt \nthe Crapo motion, you are going to have this taking place. So I think \nthis makes sense overall to fix the bill. It certainly does not kill \nthe bill. The bill is signed into law, as Senator Crapo pointed out. \nYou cannot kill the bill now. I think it should be repealed, but I \ncertainly think we should not be having people taxed who are making \nbelow $200,000. We should not be having them taxed now. We should not \nbe having them taxed into the future, even though that is actually now \nbuilt into the bill and part of its pay-for provision.\n  But let's be sincere with the American public. Let's fulfill this \npiece. Unless you adopt the Crapo motion, we are not going to be able \nto guarantee that to the American public.\n  I think this is a very commonsense amendment. I think this is one \nthat helps deal with the problems in the underlying bill. I think it is \none that is honest with the American public, and it is certainly one I \nhope we can pass.\n  I would ask my good friend from Idaho to address this issue from, as \nyou put this forward, has the administration said: Yes, we agree with \nyou because this is what we said on the campaign trail and this only \nfulfills the promise. Maybe they have offered you an Executive order, \nthat you could get this by Executive order.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Well, I would say to my colleague from Kansas that I have \nnot had any direct response from the White House, although when I made \nthese speeches and when I made the motion when we debated the original \nbill, there were some responses on the Web that indicated that, in \nfact, I was not correct in my facts. The argument was made at that time \nthat, in fact, the bill we were debating did not have--was not a tax \nincrease bill, it was a tax cut bill. You probably heard my response to \nthat argument earlier.\n  The way the defenders of this bill claim it is a tax cut is, they \ntake all the subsidies that are being provided for this new entitlement \nthat is created in the bill, administer those through the IRS, and then \nclaim that those are tax cuts and that they outweigh the tax increases \nthat are included in the bill and that, therefore, the bill is a net \ntax cut. As I said earlier, first of all, the President was not talking \nin net terms. He didn't say: We\n\n[[Page S1840]]\n\nwill raise taxes for this group more than we will cut taxes for this \ngroup.\n  Leaving that aside, the fact is, I don't think most Americans fall \nfor that. Most Americans don't think that the subsidy which is scored \nas spending is a tax cut.\n  Mr. BAUCUS addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Might I ask my friend if he wishes to have the pending \namendment set aside so his motion can be made in order?\n\n\n                            Motion to Commit\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, if that would be allowed, I ask unanimous \nconsent to set aside the pending amendment to offer a motion to commit \nwith instructions that I have here and which I submit to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I have no objection. I ask unanimous \nconsent that if the time is consumed, the motion be set aside at that \npoint.\n  Mr. GREGG. Reserving the right to object, I do not believe any time \nhas been consumed on this motion.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think that is correct. When the time is consumed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the motion.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Idaho [Mr Crapo] moves to commit the bill \n     H.R. 4872, to the Committee on Finance with instructions to \n     report the same back to the Senate within 3 days with changes \n     that provide that the combined effect of this Act, and the \n     Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, shall not result \n     in an increase in Federal tax liability for any individual \n     with adjusted gross income of less than $200,000 or any \n     married couple with adjusted gross income of less than \n     $250,000.\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, could I ask how much time remains on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 hour, equally divided, on the \nmotion.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe we were functioning under an \nagreement where the Republican side had one-half hour and the \nDemocratic side had one-half hour. How much time is available under \nthat agreement to our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 9 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would ask, at this time, if my colleague \nfrom Tennessee or any of our other colleagues have anything further to \nsay at this point on the motion.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I do. If we are going to grow the \neconomy of the United States, we need to provide some sort of tax \ncertainty. We have learned over our history that when we deal with \ntaxes, people don't react if they think things are up in the air--if \nthey look at it and they say: I don't know, my taxes may go up or down, \nI will sit on the sideline.\n  One of the things the Crapo amendment does that provides some \ncertainty to it is to say: OK, if you are in this category, this is \nwhat your taxes are going to be. It isn't going to go up on you. When \npeople can provide a level of certainty on tax policy, typically, then \npeople are more willing to act. Because they say: Yes, maybe I will go \nout and I can invest and I will do this as a small business. This will \nhelp investment. We have a climate right now where people are not \nwilling to invest because they don't know what the rules are. They \ndon't know what their tax rates are going to be, so they are sitting \nback. This will help provide that level of certainty. So I hope we will \ndo this as a way to help the economy, as a way to fulfill the \nPresident's promise, as a way to help fix the bill and do what the \nPresident said he wanted to see done and to help grow the economy and \ngive some certainty on our tax policy.\n  With that, I yield back to my colleague from Idaho.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Kansas. I wish to \ngo back and summarize now as we conclude, unless the Senator from New \nHampshire has any comments to make at this point.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wish to congratulate the Senator from Idaho for bringing \nthis forward because there has been a lot of representation as to what \nthis bill does, and much of it has been, regrettably, inaccurate. \nCertainly, one of the most inaccurate representations is that people \nover $250,000 are the only people who are going to pay for this.\n  The Senator from Idaho is absolutely right. This is going to be paid \nfor by people who have incomes well under $200,000. There is going to \nbe a significant tax increase for a lot of Americans. Equally \nimportant, premiums are going to go up for a lot of Americans, which is \nthe equivalent of a tax increase.\n  I can't understand how anybody could vote against his motion, which \nessentially says: Let's hold the administration to its language, which \nsays if you have income under $200,000 for an individual and $250,000 \nas a couple, you will not be required to pay taxes under this bill.\n  They have represented that is their position. They should have no \nproblem at all with supporting the Senator's motion, and it makes it \nlegally binding. I congratulate the Senator for his motion.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I believe the way we are proceeding is we \nproceed on our side.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, I would conclude in the last 7 minutes. If \nany of my colleagues wish to jump in, please let me know.\n  I wish to go back to where we started. As I indicated, when I brought \nthis very same motion to commit during the debate on the health care \nlegislation in December in the Senate, the response was not that these \ntaxes aren't in the bill but that to take these taxes out of the bill \nwould kill the bill. Why would those taxes being taken out of the bill \nkill the bill? Because it would expose the cost of the bill, because \nthe argument that the bill is not a deficit--that it actually reduces \nthe deficit--would evaporate if you take out the massive taxes that are \nincluded in the bill. That is why it was considered to be such a \ndangerous amendment then.\n  I personally believe that for us to adopt legislation the President \nhas signed into law that grows the Federal Government by $2.6 trillion, \ndramatically increases the role and control of the Federal Government \nover our health care economy, cuts Medicare by $500-plus billion, and \nthen engages in gimmicks of trying to adjust the numbers in the budget \nin order to make it appear that there is no deficit increase is the \nwrong way to approach this legislation, regardless of one's opinion of \nthe merits otherwise of the substance of the bill.\n  The bottom line is, this is a massive growth of the Federal \nGovernment, massive increase in control by the Federal Government, \nfinanced by hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of taxes that \nare going to be paid by the middle class in America as defined by the \nPresident: those who make less than $250,000 as a family or $200,000 as \nan individual. Again, all this motion would do is to say: Let's take \nout those taxes. If they don't exist, then it would not do anything to \nthe bill. If they do exist--and, as I said, they do--then they would be \ntaken out of the bill and we would not be putting the massive cost of \nthis phenomenally large growth of the Federal Government on the backs \nof the middle class in America. Again, the argument that was made in \nDecember cannot fly today because today the bill is law. It cannot be \nargued that to support this motion would kill the bill.\n  The bill has passed the Senate, passed the House, and has been signed \ninto law by the President. What we need to do now is to make sure the \nbill does not violate the President's pledge that nobody in America \nwill see their taxes go up.\n  I wish to again read that pledge: The President's own words were:\n\n       I can make a firm pledge . . . No family making less than \n     $50,000 will see their taxes increase . . . Not your income \n     taxes, not your payroll taxes, not your capital gains taxes, \n     not any of your taxes . . . You will not see any of your \n     taxes increase one single dime.\n\n  Well, that is simply not the case, and it is not the case to the tune \nof hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars that this \nclass of people--the middle class as defined by the President--are \ngoing to be called upon to pay.\n  That is only during the first 10 years of this bill. If you start \nlooking further\n\n[[Page S1841]]\n\nout, as we get into the second 10 years of this bill, the amount of \ntaxes the American people will pay rises exponentially into the \ntrillions and trillions of dollars as you get further out. Yet we are \nexpecting them to carry the burden of this bill, when they were \npromised--and I am sure many voted in the last election on the basis of \nthis--they would not see their taxes go up.\n  Again, it is a very simple motion. The motion simply says: Let's take \nthe bill back to committee and take out any of the taxes that apply to \nindividuals making less than $200,000 and families making less than \n$250,000. I urge all my colleagues to support this motion.\n  If there is any time left for any of my other colleagues who wish to \nmake a statement----\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, how much time does the minority have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. RISCH. Very briefly, I wish to speak about one of these tax \nincreases for 73 million people. This morning when the President signed \nthe bill, he bragged about how they were going to give subsidies to 13 \nmillion people so they can buy insurance. He is absolutely right. But \nas frequently happens, we didn't get the whole story. The whole story \nis there are 163 million Americans who are not going to get that \nsubsidy and whose taxes are going to go up. How many of those make \nunder $200,000 a year? There are 73 million Americans who make under \n$200,000, from that little sleight of hand, who will see a tax \nincrease.\n  Thank you.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, in the spirit of back and forth, I ask \nunanimous consent that the next hour be equally divided, one-half hour \non each side, and the first half hour to be allocated to the majority \nside and the next half hour to the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield myself 3 minutes to speak on the \nmotion.\n  I wish to make clear that this bill reduces taxes in the amount of \nabout $460 billion for Americans who will get tax credits for buying \nhealth insurance. That is a huge, big tax reduction: about $460 billion \nin tax credits to people buying insurance. I don't think I have heard \nmuch about that from the other side of the aisle, but it is a fact.\n  In addition, small business gets very large tax credits for offering \nhealth insurance--large, very large incentives. It is up to 35 percent, \nif I recall correctly, the first couple years, and then it moves up to \na 50-percent tax credit for the employers' half of the health insurance \nthat the employer will be providing. Those are huge, big tax cuts.\n  One other point that I think is very important to make. It is true, \nin certain cases, taxes will go up for some Americans who may be making \nless than $200,000. But why? Because they have more money in their \npocket. When you earn more money, your taxes go up, and you can earn \nmore money because health insurance is going to be less expensive. \nCompanies are going to compensate you with health insurance that is \nless expensive and reward you with more wages. That is what CBO says. \nDon't take my word for it. That is what the Congressional Budget Office \nsays. So when wages go up, guess what. Sometimes taxes go up when wages \ngo up. On a net basis, Americans are going to be better off. They are \ngoing to be wealthier. Their health insurance is going to be less \nexpensive. For those, we are finding that because health insurance is \nless expensive, their employers want to compensate the employees, so \nthey compensate them with higher wages, and higher wages will mean some \nincrease in income taxes. So I wish to be very clear, that is what is \nhappening.\n  Also, I wish to make a third point, basically that gets lost \nesoterically, but the reconciliation bill lowers the high-premium \nexcise tax in the underlying bill. By doing so, that means those wages \nwill not increase as much as they otherwise might but, rather, it is \noffset with an increase under an income but only for Americans earning \nabove $200,000 individually and families above $250,000. I wish to make \nit clear this is a big tax cut for Americans.\n  CBO has also said--not directly on point--but CBO also said there \nwill be a big reduction in deficits and debts this decade and the next \ndecade.\n  The other side likes to make it sound as if it is a big tax increase. \nIt is not. It is a tax cut. It is a tax increase for some Americans, \nbut those Americans in the main earn more than $200,000.\n  I yield 15 minutes to the Senator from Vermont from the time on the \nbill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, this is the dawn of a new day of hope for \ntens of millions of Americans who have fallen through the cracks--or \nwho worry with good reason that they may fall through the cracks--of \nour broken health insurance system.\n  The signing into law of comprehensive health insurance reform by \nPresident Barack Obama is a defining moment in our history, ranking \nwith the creation of Social Security and Medicare.\n  Reforming the health insurance system has been talked about for \ndecades. This has been an arduous process, but it has proven that \nchange is possible, even with the pitched opposition of entrenched and \npowerful special interests. America again has risen to meet one of its \nforemost challenges and to renew its promises.\n  America has some of the best health care in the world, if you can \nafford it. Millions of families in Vermont and across the Nation worry \nthat they are just one paycheck away from medical and financial \ndisaster. This is a new dawn for them.\n  Wherever I travel in Vermont, I am often stopped in the grocery \nstore, at church, on the street or at the gas station to listen to \npersonal, wrenching stories, like the woman from Winhall who needs to \nspend $500 a month on prescriptions but who would be uninsured if not \nfor her husband's job. She is working two jobs just to make ends meet \nand to afford their health care costs. Or the small business owner who \nworks 6 and 7 days a week but still can't afford the blood tests her \ndoctor recommended. If she becomes sick she will lose her business and \nher home. Or the man from central Vermont who told me of his sister-in-\nlaw who lost parts of both her feet because she did not have health \ninsurance. When she needed medical attention, she waited, hoping things \nwould get better. By the time her family was able to step in, she had \nto be rushed to the emergency room for amputations. This is a new dawn \nfor them.\n  I grew up in my family's small business in Montpelier. I know that \nbusiness owners want to attract and keep good workers and many want to \nbe able to offer health insurance options. Spiraling insurance costs \nare rapidly taking that option away. Some of the most immediate and \nfar-reaching reforms in this new law are the tax credits that will help \nsmall businesses continue to offer insurance to their employees. This \nis a new dawn for small business owners and for those who are self-\nemployed.\n  This week the Senate is already working on improvements to this \nlegislation. These include closing the Medicare donut hole in the next \nseveral years, making coverage more affordable, and creating a more \nequitable distribution of Medicaid reimbursements to States like \nVermont that have acted early on reform.\n  Health insurance reform has prevailed through the grueling gauntlet \nof obstructionism erected by defenders of the status quo. One remaining \ngauntlet remains in the Senate, where partisan opposition has prompted \nan effort to derail these further improvements to this law--\nimprovements that many of these opponents say they support. Opponents \nof reform already have wasted much of the public's time over the last \nyear by provoking arguments over their distortions about what health \nreform really means. Last summer the American people endured myths \nabout ``death panels'' and other falsehoods about what reform would \nmean for families across the country.\n  It is no wonder that while Americans vastly support the individual \ncomponents of these bills they remain skeptical when asked about the \nhazy concept of ``comprehensive reform.''\n  The building blocks of health reform are more popular than the sum of \nthe plan's parts. Polls show public unease\n\n[[Page S1842]]\n\nabout the hazy concept of ``comprehensive health reform'' but solid \nsupport for what is in the plan.\n  This paradox recently was put to a real life test, with a vote on a \nreform I proposed to repeal health insurance companies' antiquated \nexemption from the antitrust laws. These are the pro-competition rules \nthat apply to virtually all other businesses, to help promote vibrant \nmarkets and consumer choice. Competition and choice help lower costs, \nexpand access and improve quality.\n  I launched this effort last fall, built a hearing record to examine \nits merits and worked to build bipartisan support. House leaders late \nlast year added it to their plan. And last month it became the first \nstand-alone part of the health reform package to pass on its own, in a \nstrong bipartisan vote of 406 to 19. To me this is the latest proof \nthat, appearances aside, there is much common ground in the health \nreform plan--more than partisan opponents or the insurance industry \nwould have the public believe.\n  Insurance companies, of course, will continue to lobby like crazy to \nkeep from being covered by the antitrust laws. No surprise there. The \nrules they have operated under have been stacked in their favor.\n  Some have argued that doing nothing is the ``safe,'' option, but it \nis anything but safe. Health policy experts and economists across the \npolitical spectrum agree that the rapidly increases in health costs \nwill hurt everyone--costing us more, driving up Medicare's budget, \ncutting back coverage, and preventing businesses from being able to \nafford offering insurance to their workers. Without reform, in the next \ndecade half of all nonelderly adults at some point will find themselves \nwithout coverage. If we do nothing, the same insurance coverage a \nfamily had in 2008 will nearly double to $24,291 by 2016, soaking up a \nwhopping 45 percent of median family incomes.\n  We have seen all too well what would have happened if we had not \nacted to pass comprehensive reform. Just last month, insurance \ncompanies planned a series of premium hikes as large as 39 percent in \none State. Last year the five largest for-profit insurance companies \nbooked $12.2 billion in profits, and they raised the average family \npremium three times faster than wages. One company alone, WellPoint, is \nhiking rates by double digits in 11 States, while their profits are up \n91 percent. Meanwhile, even with soaring profits, insurers continue to \ndrop sick people from their rolls, spend less on care, and avoid \ncompetition.\n\n  Vermont, a State that has led the way on many health insurance \nreforms, is not immune from the rising costs of health insurance. On \nTown Meeting Day a few weeks ago in Vermont, town officials in Hartford \nreported that the community's health insurance rates last year jumped \nby a third, forcing them to lay off town workers.\n  Despite dire warnings of ``government takeovers'' and other charged \nrhetoric, this bill in reality is a solidly American solution to our \nhealth insurance crisis. The new law largely builds upon our current \nsystem and reforms parts that are not working well, while maintaining \nmuch of what Americans like.\n  Now that this bill is law, annual caps on coverage are eliminated. \nInsurance companies are now barred from dropping people from their \nplans, even if they have paid their premiums, simply because they have \ngotten sick. Denying children health insurance coverage because of \npreexisting conditions is now illegal, and parents are now allowed to \nkeep their children on their health insurance policy until a child's \n26th birthday. And now that comprehensive reform has become law, a down \npayment has been made toward completely closing the so-called donut \nhole for seniors on Medicare, by providing a $250 rebate for those in \nthe Medicare Part D coverage gap.\n  In addition to the immediate improvements to our health insurance \nsystem, over time this bill will make further improvements and also \nwill eventually insure 95 percent of our population, while making a \nsubstantial investment in our economic vitality in the years ahead. In \naddition to ending the discriminatory insurance company practices of \ndenying coverage because of preexisting conditions and canceling \ncoverage when beneficiaries get sick, the new law will lower costs for \nsmall businesses and will help prevent medical bankruptcies by removing \nany arbitrary limit on annual or lifetime ``caps'' on medical expenses. \nThis bill also is the largest deficit reduction measure many in \nCongress have ever cast votes on. The Congressional Budget Office \nestimates that comprehensive reform will reduce the federal deficit by \n$143 billion through 2019, and by more than $1 trillion in the decades \nto come.\n  These comprehensive reforms also will test ways to reduce health care \ncosts while improving quality. The bill contains pilot initiatives for \nefforts like Vermont's Blueprint for Health, under which patient care \nis coordinated to reduce unnecessary hospital visits and to keep \npatients healthy. Other programs will test various ways to pay doctors \nand hospitals that could be more efficient than the current fee-or-\nservice structure. A greater emphasis on prevention--long championed by \nthe late Senator Edward Kennedy and Senator Tom Harkin on the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee--will reduce preventable \ndeaths and hospitalizations.\n  I am also proud that the bill explicitly prohibits discrimination on \nthe basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability or age in \nany health program or activity receiving Federal funds. These \nprotections were necessary to remedy the shameful history of invidious \ndiscrimination and the stark disparities in outcomes in our health care \nsystem based on traditionally protected factors such as race and \ngender. The nondiscrimination provision makes clear that the \nenforcement mechanisms from other statutes prohibiting discrimination \nin federally funded programs, such as title VI of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964 and title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, apply with \nequal force to federally funded health programs and activities. I \nworked closely with Majority Leader Reid to include these protections \nin the Senate bill to ensure that all Americans are able to reap the \nbenefits of health insurance reform equally, without discrimination.\n  The bill the President signed into law and that I supported is not \nwithout its problems. But it succeeds in adhering to the core \nprinciples I sought at the beginning of this debate. It gives Americans \naffordable access to health care coverage, it reduces costs for \nfamilies, businesses and government, and it protects consumers' ability \nto choose doctors, hospitals and insurance plans. Many other \nsubstantial social policy reforms such as Medicare and Social Security \nwere improved through actual experience after they were first enacted. \nFor instance, Social Security as passed did not contain disability \ninsurance--a significant oversight, which was rightly remedied later. \nWhile this plan might not make every reform we think necessary, we have \nthe ability to modify and improve it in the months and years ahead.\n  In fact, the reconciliation bill now before the Senate includes a \nseries of improvements to comprehensive reform that I strongly support. \nThe bill will fully close the prescription donut hole that forces \nthousands of seniors across the country and in Vermont to pay out of \npocket for necessary prescriptions until their expenditures reach a \ncatastrophic level. Immediately, Medicare beneficiaries who fall within \nthe hole will receive a $250 rebate in 2010. By 2020 the donut hole \nwill be closed completely, and beneficiaries will receive 75 percent \ndiscounts on brandname and generic drugs. The reconciliation package \neases the cost-sharing for individuals purchasing insurance on the \nexchange, and it offers more generous tax credits for those with the \nlowest incomes who still have trouble affording health insurance. The \nlargest employers will be fined more heavily for the failure to offer \ninsurance to their workers.\n  The reconciliation package furthers the strong antifraud provisions \nSenator Kaufman and I worked to incorporate into the Senate-passed \nbill. Among other steps, it increases our investment in fighting health \ncare fraud by providing $250 million over the next decade to \ninvestigate and prosecute the people who drain our health care system \nof billions of dollars each year, driving up costs and risking patient \nlives. It also streamlines procedures to review Medicare payments \nbefore they\n\n[[Page S1843]]\n\nare made to ensure that we identify and stop fraud as quickly as \npossible. These antifraud initiatives build on the impressive steps the \nObama administration has already taken to improve health care fraud \nprevention and enforcement, and on the real progress represented by the \nantifraud provisions adopted by the Finance and HELP Committees. I was \npleased to be able to contribute to all of these efforts.\n  Like many sweeping reforms of our history, this legislation will \nlikely be improved in the coming years as these reforms are \nimplemented. For example, I will continue to push for a public option \nand for repeal of the health insurance industry's antitrust exemption, \nin order to promote competition, choice and lower prices.\n  The people of Vermont have given me the honor of representing them in \nthe Senate for 35 years. I have joined in many debates that were \ncontentious, yet ultimately productive. As we leaf through the pages of \nhistory, we can read of the many times when Congress has shown its \nremarkable ability to rise up to reflect the conscience of the Nation.\n  As many here have noted, our dear friend Senator Ted Kennedy would \nhave been remarkably proud of the President and this Congress for \npassing reform that was unachievable for so many before us. Ted \nreminded all of us in a letter written to President Obama what the \nstakes are in this debate. He wrote, ``What we face is above all a \nmoral issue; that at stake are not just the details of policy, but \nfundamental principles of social justice and the character of our \ncountry.''\n  When the dust settles and emotions are calmed, I believe this effort \nwill be viewed as a credit to this good and great Nation and its \npeople. This President and this Congress have responded to a pressing \nnational issue and have proven once again our ability rise above \npartisanship and act with the purpose of advancing a pressing national \ninterest.\n  I am proud of this latest proof that change is possible in this great \ncountry when a pressing national interest is at stake. And I am proud \nto have had the honor that Vermonters have given me to represent and \nadvance their interests in this effort.\n  This really is a new day of hope for tens of millions of Americans \nwho have fallen through the cracks or who worry they may fall through \nthe cracks of our broken health insurance system.\n  When President Barack Obama signed the comprehensive health insurance \nreform bill this morning, I could not help but think as I sat there \nthat this ranks with the creation of Social Security and Medicare. We \nhave talked about reforming health insurance for decades, but it has \nnot been done. Of course, it has been an arduous process, but it has \nproven that change is possible even when you have had the pitched \nopposition of entrenched and powerful and, I might say, very wealthy \nspecial interests. America rose to meet one of its foremost challenges \nand to renew its promises.\n  America has some of the best health care in the world if you can \nafford it. Millions of families in America and in Vermont worry that \nthey are just one paycheck away from medical and financial disaster. \nThis is a new day for them.\n  I ask all those Members of Congress who fought so hard against this \nhealth care and voted against it, are they willing to give up the great \nhealth care system they have as Members of Congress, that they can buy \nas Members of Congress, and trade places with the millions of Americans \nwho cannot buy the great health care system Members of Congress have? I \nhave not heard a single one of them who voted against giving help to \nthese millions of Americans say they would give up their own.\n  Whenever I travel in Vermont, whether it is at the grocery store, \nchurch, on the street, or at a gas station, I often stop to listen to \npersonal and wrenching stories, such as the woman from Winhall, VT, who \nneeds to spend $500 a month on prescriptions but who would be uninsured \nif not for her husband's job. She is working two jobs to make ends meet \nand to afford the health care costs, or the small business owner who \nworks 6 and 7 days a week but she still cannot afford the blood tests \nher doctor recommended--if she becomes sick, she will lose her business \nand her home--or the man from central Vermont who told me of his \nsister-in-law who lost parts of both of her feet because she could not \nafford the simple care that would have saved her feet because she did \nnot have health insurance. When she needed medical attention, she \nwaited, hoping things would get better, knowing she could not afford to \ngo to the doctor. By the time her family was able to step in, she had \nto be rushed to the emergency room, not for a cure but for amputations. \nThis is America. I do not hear a single Member of Congress saying they \nare ready to give up their insurance they are able to buy through the \nSenate or the House of Representatives and trade places with this \nwoman.\n  I grew up in my family's small business in Montpelier, a printing \nbusiness. I know small businesses want to try to keep good workers, and \nmany want to offer health insurance options, as my parents did, but \nspiraling insurance costs are taking that option away. Some of the most \nimmediate and far-reaching reforms in this new law are tax credits that \nwill help small businesses continue to offer insurance to their \nemployees.\n  Health insurance has prevailed through the grueling gauntlet of \nobstructionism erected by the defenders of the status quo--worse than \nanything I have seen in my years in the Senate. One gauntlet remains in \nthe Senate, where partisan opposition has prompted efforts to derail \nthese further improvements to this law. It is no wonder that while \nAmericans vastly support the individual components of these bills, they \nhave been skeptical when asked about the hazy concept of comprehensive \nreform.\n  Some have argued that doing nothing is a safe option. Last month, \ninsurance companies planned a series of premium hikes, as large as 39 \npercent in one State. Last year, the five largest for-profit insurance \ncompanies booked $12.2 billion in profits and they raised the average \nfamily premium three times faster than wages. One company alone, \nWellPoint, is hiking rates by double digits in 11 States, while their \nprofits are up 91 percent. Meanwhile, even with soaring profits, \ninsurers continue to drop sick people from their rolls, spend less on \ncare, and because they have an exemption in antitrust laws they avoid \ncompetition.\n  Now that this bill is law, annual caps on coverage are eliminated. \nInsurance companies are now barred from dropping people from their \nplans, even if they paid their premiums, simply because, gosh, they got \nsick--the reason for which they bought health insurance. Denying \nchildren health insurance coverage because of preexisting conditions is \nillegal. Parents can keep their children on their health insurance \npolicies until they are 26 years old.\n  I think of the people who worked so hard on this legislation. I see \nChairman Baucus and Chairman Dodd on the floor. We would not be here \nwithout the two of them. I think we must continue and we must be able \nto make this final step.\n  The people of Vermont have given me the honor of representing them in \nthe Senate for 35 years. I have joined in many debates that were \ncontentious yet ultimately productive. As we leaf through the pages of \nhistory, we can read the many times when Congress has shown its \nremarkable ability to rise up and reflect the conscience of the Nation. \nThis body especially should reflect the conscience of our Nation.\n  As many here have noted, our dear friend Senator Ted Kennedy would \nhave been remarkably proud of the President and this Congress for \npassing reform that was unachievable for so many years before. He \nreminded all of us in a letter written to President Obama what the \nstakes are in this debate. He wrote:\n\n       What we face is above all a moral issue; that at stake are \n     not just the details of policy, but fundamental principles of \n     social justice and the character of our country.\n\n  When emotions are calmed, I believe this effort will be viewed as a \ncredit to this good and great Nation and its good people. The President \nand the Congress have responded to a pressing national issue. They have \nshown we can rise to the challenge before them.\n  I am proud to have had the honor Vermonters have given me to \nrepresent and advance their interests in this effort. I am glad to say \nto my fellow Vermonters: Now the day comes when\n\n[[Page S1844]]\n\nyou have the opportunity to have the kind of insurance we Members of \nCongress have. I am sorry some have voted to deny that to you. This \nSenator votes to give it to you.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 15 minutes to the chairman of the \nBanking Committee, also the de facto chairman of the HELP Committee, \nthe great Senator from Connecticut, who has devoted countless time and \ncreativity in helping shape the HELP Committee version of health care \nreform. Along with the Finance Committee, we have the HELP Committee. \nChairman Dodd has been terrific.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that what time I \ndid not use be yielded back to the chairman.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, let me first of all thank my great friend \nfrom Montana, Senator Baucus. We arrived in the Congress of the United \nStates together on the same day, back about 35 years ago. We have been \nfriends for 35 years. We arrived in the Senate at different times. He \ngot here a little before me. We have been in this institution for 30 \nyears. I cannot describe in the limited time I have what a difference \nhe has made--the fact we are here debating, finally, the last piece of \nthis legislative effort to give the Americans what they have sought for \nmore than a century, and that is the basic right to health care.\n  I always found it somewhat ironic in a way that we in this country \nprovide for those accused of criminal offenses the right to a lawyer, \nthe right to an attorney. I believe in that. I think it is correct. But \nisn't it somewhat ironic that the same country that would provide you \nwith a right to a lawyer if you are charged with a criminal defense \ncannot provide you with a doctor if your child is sick? There is \nsomething fundamentally wrong with that, in my view.\n  For the first time, we are on a track that will correct that error. \nHenceforth, in the years to come, they can mark the calendar date of \nMarch 23, 2010, when for the first time in American history an American \nPresident signed into law a bill that will provide Americans the \nopportunity to live free from the fear that they or their loved ones \nwill be faced with a health care crisis and they will not have the \ncapacity, without bankrupting themselves or watching a loved one lose \ntheir life or become chronically or permanently ill or sick because \nthey could not afford it, to see a doctor.\n\n  I rise today on this very historic day to thank my friend from \nMontana, to thank the terrific staff of the Finance Committee, to thank \nthe members of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, \nchaired by my great pal and friend Ted Kennedy for so many years. I was \nasked to take over last summer and to work through the efforts of that \ncommittee to participate and contribute to our part of this bill. On \nJuly 16 last summer, we completed our work.\n  I see my friend Mike Enzi here. We worked together on issues over the \nyears. Lamar Alexander, my friend from Tennessee, as well is part of \nthat committee. While we did not come together on final passage of that \nbill, I wish to express my gratitude to them and their staffs as well \nfor the contributions they made to this product. Even though they might \nnot be anxious to acknowledge the contributions, they made \ncontributions. I am grateful to them and, of course, my staff as well--\nTamar Magarik Haro and Jeremy Sharp, as well, who is with me on the \nfloor today, along with many others who did a fabulous job in providing \nus with support and assistance.\n  We heard the word ``historic'' with regard to this legislation. \nSometimes those words are thrown around a little too lightly, in a \nlittle too cavalier fashion to describe other events. Today truly is \nhistoric. I have been here 30 years, and I cannot think of another day \nquite like it in the annals of our Nation to provide, at long last, the \nability to have a national health care plan. For tens of millions of \nordinary citizens, the passage of this bill means more than just a page \nin history, of course. It means real security for older Americans who \nrely on Medicare and still need help paying for prescriptions. It means \nrelief for small business owners who are forced to choose between \ncutting off benefits and laying off the workers they need so much in \ntheir operations. It means an end, more than anything else, to the \nsleepless nights when fathers and mothers worry about how to pay for a \ncancer treatment or a child's checkup.\n  My colleagues know I am a late bloomer in the father business. I have \na 5-year-old and an 8-year-old. I started a little late in this \nbusiness of parenthood.\n  Two weeks ago, my little 5-year-old was pretty sick. She got a \nstomach virus. She was throwing up quite a bit, about every 20 minutes \nor so. We called our family doctor. He said I should get her up to \nChildren's Hospital emergency room, about 7 o'clock on a Saturday \nnight. She was terribly dehydrated--not uncommon when this happens. She \nspent the next 18 hours in the hospital getting hydrated.\n  I wanted to share with my colleagues what that emergency room was \nlike that evening. Again, I have a health plan. All of us do--8 million \nFederal workers. We have pretty good coverage. I am grateful for that. \nI walked in, put that card on the table, and things began to move. My \ndaughter was going to get the kind of treatment she needed.\n  But that room was filled with a lot of people that night, people with \nno health care, people showing up well beyond a point you would want to \nsee a physician because they did not have the resources to do it. That \ngoes on every single night and day all across our country. If anybody \nhas doubts about it, I urge you, in the break coming up, the 2 weeks, \nif you have a chance, to go by late in the evening to an emergency room \nin a hospital in your area. You will encounter what I did a few \nSaturday nights ago when I took my young daughter to receive the kind \nof help she needed.\n  I kept on thinking that night that my daughter was not unique in \ngetting a stomach virus and getting dehydrated. How many other children \nin this city or across America that night had parents sitting around, \nsleepless, wondering whether that child was going to get better, \nknowing they were getting more dehydrated and putting them at great \nrisk of spiraling down, putting them at greater and greater risks, not \nknowing what to do, not having the resources to do it, not having that \nkind of health care, not having the money and insurance to pay for it, \nand wondering when they were going to show up in the emergency room to \ntake care of that child. That goes on every single day in America, in \nthe United States of America, in the 21th century.\n  This bill does not solve all of those problems, but the idea that we \ncan lift the burden of fear from those families, those people who work \nhard--remember, a majority of all the bankruptcies last year occurred \nbecause of a health care crisis in that family, and a majority of those \npeople who went bankrupt because of a health care crisis had health \ninsurance. These were not people without insurance; it is just the \ncopays were so high, the deductible so high that they were going to get \nin financial trouble before the insurance would even kick in. We are \nnot just talking about the uninsured. Even people with some insurance \nfind themselves in that situation. So my daughter is fine today and \ndoing well because I didn't have to worry about the cost of her care. I \nhave a good health care plan. But for other families across this \ncountry who don't have that security, that sense of confidence that if \ntheir loved ones end up ill or need attention or care, that unless they \nhave the kind of coverage and the ability to pay for it, their child \nmight not have had the same outcome that mine did. That shouldn't \nhappen in this country.\n\n  So for us in Congress, the passing of this legislation represents \nmore than just the culmination of a century-long movement for reform. \nIt began with Teddy Roosevelt. I regret today that President Obama \ndidn't mention Richard Nixon. He mentioned Roosevelt and Truman and \nBill Clinton, but Richard Nixon tried as well to get national health \ncare. He is not recognized often for it. People only talk about him in \na negative sense. But Richard Nixon tried this. It was Democrats and \nRepublicans who tried to get this done.\n  What this effort represents is proof that while progress is not easy, \nneither\n\n[[Page S1845]]\n\nis it impossible, and that, maybe more than anything else, is important \nabout what we saw today.\n  As President Obama said, we didn't come here to the Senate, to the \nCongress of the United States to fear the future; we came here to try \nto shape it. And despite the complexity of the problems, the political \npower of those stubbornly defending the status quo, and even the \nrefusal of many in this community to acknowledge the urgency of reform, \nthat is exactly what we have done.\n  A broken health care system is not the last challenge we are going to \nface now as a nation or as a Congress. Far from it. Today, our Union \nbecame a little more perfect, but is still far from it. There is still \nmuch to do to help American families build better lives for themselves. \nBut, Mr. President, I hope when we again find ourselves at moments of \ngreat national import--and we will and we are--we can look back not at \nthe polls or the petty partisan fights that too often contaminate our \ndebates and that always seem to stand in the way of progress, but \nrather at the fact we rose above them and we acted--and we acted, Mr. \nPresident.\n  We have a chance again to act this evening or tomorrow, as soon as \nthis process comes to an end, by voting up or down on the legislation \ndesigned to make this good law even a better one. If you strip away the \noverheated rhetoric, the false claims that have become commonplace \nduring this debate, this bill is nothing more than a set of commonsense \nfixes. Let me quickly remind my colleagues and others what they are.\n  The commonsense fixes will extend the solvency of Medicare. The bill \nwill fill the so-called prescription drug doughnut hole and lower \npremiums for seniors. Another commonsense fix will extend to all \ninsurance plans the consumer protections in the newly passed health \ncare reform law. It will end the lifetime caps on benefits to people. \nIt will also provide the guarantees that your coverage would not be \ntaken away if you get sick and includes a prohibition on excessive \nwaiting periods, and the extension of coverage to adult children up to \nthe age of 26. It will ban discrimination against people with \npreexisting conditions. These commonsense fixes will increase the tax \ncredits that help low- and middle-income families pay for insurance, \nboost funding for community health centers, strengthen provisions for \ncracking down on waste and fraud in the Medicare and Medicaid systems.\n  Mr. President, these commonsense fixes will improve the shared \nresponsibility of policies, ensuring that employers and individuals do \ntheir part to keep the country healthy, both physically and \neconomically. It includes valuable protections as well for hospitals \nand physicians, and more fairly distributes Federal funding among the \nStates so that State governments aren't overburdened at a time when it \nis already rather difficult to balance those budgets. It revises \nrevenue provisions in the law to take some of the burden off middle-\nclass families and put it on the pharmaceutical industry, which can \nafford to bear those burdens.\n  On top of all these commonsense fixes, it includes a badly needed, \nfully-paid-for investment in Pell grants enabling more Americans to go \nto college and get the education they need to compete in the 21st-\ncentury world in which these children will face. The bill increases \nPell grants, I know my colleagues know, up to $6,000 by 2017. Hardly \nenough, in many cases, to pay for the ever-growing cost of education, \nbut it can make a difference. It links scholarship amounts to the cost \nof living so they never again have to fall behind, and all of us know \nhow valuable that can be. Because the legislation switches to the far \nless expensive direct loan program, it will also reduce our deficit by \nmore than $10 billion over 10 years.\n  Now, that is what is in this bill. Those are the commonsense fixes. \nIf you don't like the health care bill, fine; but don't tell me what we \nare doing is a bad idea. I think it takes a good law and makes it a \nbetter law, and I hope we can get broad-based support for these \nprovisions.\n  I know some of our friends have made plans to spend the rest of the \nweek delaying passage of this bill. I would hope they not engage in \nthat. I don't think it serves our interests. Vote against it, if you \nwant, and let us get on with the other business we have before us. To \ngo through some marathon voting for the sake of delaying the process I \ndon't think does a great service to this great institution. That is not \nwhat we are sent here to do.\n  That is all you are going to witness, unfortunately, Mr. President, \nif this goes on for a protracted basis over the next couple of days--\none cute little amendment after the other to see if it can embarrass \ncolleagues to vote on something that may cause people to worry about \ntheir sense of sanity in all of this. Yet all it is designed to do, and \nnothing else, is but one thing: to delay voting for the provisions \nincluded in this commonsense fix.\n  Mr. President, I hope, again, that we can move on to other business; \nthat the large issues in front of us require us all to work together. \nAs the chairman of the Banking Committee, I have the responsibility of \ntrying to bring to this floor some reforms in financial services. I am \nblessed with wonderful members on my committee--Democrats and \nRepublicans. There is a growing desire in our committee, I think, to do \njust that. My intention is to try to do just that in the coming weeks, \nworking with my friends on the Republican side as well as my colleagues \non the Democratic side of the aisle. It is a big set of important \nissues, and that is what we ought to be doing.\n  That is what we did on this bill. Unfortunately, we were forced to do \nit as one party, not as a Senate acting together, and I am saddened by \nthat fact. But my sadness is overwhelmed by the sense of joy that I \nhave that this Congress, this President, was able to sign into law one \nof the most historic pieces of legislation ever adopted by any Congress \nin the 200-plus-year history of our Nation. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this reconciliation bill.\n  With that, I yield back any time I may have to Senator Baucus for \nsome later consideration that he may need.\n  I see the chairman has arrived back out here, and I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 3\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I would like to speak a few minutes on the \namendment offered by the Senator from Arizona with respect to the \ndeclaration of a public health emergency.\n  Under the 1980 Superfund law, an administration has the authority to \nissue a public health emergency whenever it determines based on science \nthat there is a certain part of the country for which that declaration \nmakes sense. It applies to anyplace in the country. An earlier \nadministrator, Christine Todd Whitman, was about to declare a public \nhealth emergency in Libby, MT, because the conditions were so dire. \nFrankly, I read the e-mail traffic between her office--HHS--and the \nBush administration in the White House.\n  The White House put the kibosh on that declaration. The EPA, based on \nthe science, was going to make that declaration. Administrator Jackson \nhas now made that declaration based on the science.\n  There is more asbestos contamination in Libby, MT, on a per capita \nbasis than any other place in the country. It is appalling. People are \ndying of asbestos-related diseases and mesothelioma. Tremolite is the \nform of asbestos that is present. It is so sad. It is a small town, a \npoor town. The company, W.R. Grace, has left them high and dry. There \nwas a criminal trial against its officers for intentionally \ncontaminating Libby. Frankly, that did not result in a successful \ncriminal prosecution but, in my judgment, having read lots of \ntranscripts of hearings, it is clear a declaration of a public health \nemergency is not only valid, but this is a company, frankly, that \nshould have been brought to justice. In fact, they moved assets off the \nbooks so they would be judgment proof. W.R. Grace is a very bad \ncompany, in my judgment.\n  Anyway, this law applies to all States in the Nation--all States--\nwhere, based on the science, the EPA Administrator thinks a public \nhealth emergency should be declared at a certain site that is then \nrequired by the law. Screenings are then allowed and medical treatment \nis allowed to people who would otherwise not get any, or get very \nlittle because the company has cut back on any health care benefits \nthey had.\n\n[[Page S1846]]\n\n  So this is, in a sense, health care reform. These are people who \ndon't get health care. They have been left without health care. There \nis no coverage, frankly. They have this so-called preexisting condition \nbecause they have asbestos-related disease. I think it is only proper \nthese people in Libby finally get their due.\n  My time has probably expired, but I could go on and on and on about \nthis sad situation and how much these people deserve to have at least \nsome health care that they would otherwise not receive.\n  Mr. President, I believe now the time is to be allocated to the \nRepublican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority time has expired.\n  The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I am going to rise to offer an amendment in \na while to protect American workers from the punishing job-killing \ntaxes in this reconciliation bill. My amendment would send this flawed \nbill to the Finance Committee with instructions to report back a bill \nwithout an employer mandate and with an offset.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. May I inquire of my good friend if he has a copy of his \namendment so we could see it. Before I make a request to set the \ncurrent pending amendment aside, I would like to see the amendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thought a copy had been delivered to you.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Maybe it has. Let's just check to be sure we have it.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the Senator proceed with his argument on his \namendment.\n  Mr. ENZI. That is all I was going to do for the moment, is present \nthe argument and then offer the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. OK.\n  Mr. ENZI. Of course, this process we are going through seems like \nGroundhog Day to me. I worked on health care with Senator Kennedy for 3 \nyears. We came up with some principles that translated into what is on \nmy Web site: 10 steps that would actually solve health care and do what \nthe President promised.\n  I am the ranking member on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions \nCommittee, so I went through the markup on that. As far as any \npredesign or drafting prior to the markup, I had no opportunity to do \nthat. We were given a bill and told: Here it is. If you want, you can \ndo amendments. Well, it was put together pretty fast, so there were \ntypos in it. We thought maybe we ought to help solve those, and as a \nresult there were 150 amendments that were accepted, but none of \nsubstance except a couple.\n  One of those amendments accepted was one that Senator Harkin and I \nboth cosponsored. It became a part of the bill, and that was the \nSafeway plan that would have provided some prevention. It would have \ngiven companies the ability to provide incentives to their employees to \ndo prevention.\n  Like I say, it wound up in the bill. But when it was printed on \nSeptember 17, it was not in the bill anymore and we never had a vote on \nit. I don't understand how that can happen, and that is why I say this \nfeels a little like Groundhog Day because we keep trying to get things \nin there.\n  I was part of the group of six, and one of the things I asked for was \nthe Gregg amendment that we had earlier, which said Medicare money \nought to just go to Medicare. And I keep seeing these side deals made, \nwhich is the amendment Senator McCain did.\n  Each time we have been presented with the bill and they said: Here it \nis, take it or leave it. We tried to do amendments. The amendments \ndon't wind up in it. The way it gets passed is by having side deals \nmade. I am not familiar with that kind of legislating. It is foreign to \nme and I don't think it is the right thing to do.\n  I also went to the White House summit. Again, the President said: \nTell us your ideas. And we did. Every time a Republican presented ideas \nthey were rebutted immediately. My idea of a listening session is the \nperson putting it on does a little preamble and explains the format \nthey are going to do and then they actually listen. At the end after a \nlistening period, when people have had a chance to voice their \nopinions, the leader, which in this case would have been the President, \nsays: Here is what I learned today or: Here is what I didn't learn \ntoday. Instead, what we got was a pitch for why we ought to accept the \nbill the way it was and that is exactly the way it has progressed every \nstep of the way.\n  Here we are again, another Groundhog Day, trying to do some \namendments that will make this a better bill. In fact, it will make it \na bill that will work; a bill that will be sustainable. Right now I am \ntrying to save business in America, particularly small business, at a \ntime when our Nation's unemployment rate is 9.7 percent. Millions of \nAmericans have lost their jobs and millions more go to work every day, \nworried about keeping the job they have. Many States are seeing double-\ndigit jobless rates which are weighing heavily on their local \neconomies. Businesses of all sizes are struggling to keep their doors \nopen and are finding it harder and harder to make payroll.\n  When our Nation's businesses struggle, workers and their families \nstruggle just as much if not more. American workers depend on a strong \neconomy to create jobs that help them feed their families and build \ntheir dreams. Unfortunately, the employer mandate in the reconciliation \nbill will only make it more difficult for America's businesses to hire \nand pay their workers.\n  This reconciliation bill being pushed through the Senate contains $52 \nbillion of new taxes--that used to be big money--$52 billion of new \ntaxes on business, businesses that cannot afford to provide health \ninsurance, especially at the higher rate being required. The bill has \nin it a Federal minimum standard that is better than 50 percent of the \ninsurance that Americans already have. If you don't think your rate is \ngoing to go up, if you have something that is below that Federal \nminimum standard and you like it, too bad. We are going to force \nbusinesses to buy better insurance than what they already have, and if \nthey do not, they get to pay $52 billion in new taxes. Most employers \ndo provide insurance for their employees, but there are some that \ncannot afford to.\n  What does health care reform mean to those businesses that cannot \nafford health insurance? Unfortunately, health care reform for them \nwill mean higher taxes. These are the same businesses that are barely \nmaking it today, they are the same businesses that are currently laying \noff workers in order to keep the company afloat. They are the same \nbusinesses that are cutting shifts to prevent further layoffs and \ncutting wages to keep their employees on the payroll--and much of that \nis with the agreement of the employees. They understand. They are with \na small business. It is more like a family. They understand what the \nconsequences are of new taxes and new requirements and new regulations \nand it scares them. They make concessions so they can continue to work. \nThey are working fewer hours than they used to work. Productivity is up \nbut there are less hours.\n  The problem we have is that Congress doesn't understand business, \nespecially small business. I go and visit Wyoming most weekends. I \ntravel a different part of the State and one thing I like to do is get \ninto some businesses and find out about them. I found out most \nbusinesses look pretty simple until you scratch the surface a little. \nWe get a completely different opinion here because we print our own \nmoney, but that doesn't happen out there in the business world. They \nhave a lot to take into consideration. They have to figure what it \ncosts them to be in business and they have to make sure they bring in a \nlittle more revenue than it costs them if they are going to stay in \nbusiness.\n  An example of that is, if you take a six-pack of soda, the store \ncharges you $2. They didn't make the soda and it didn't appear \nmagically out of thin air. The store had to buy it from a distributor. \nThat costs money. The distributor had to buy it from a bottler and the \nbottler had to buy the water, the sugar, and the flavoring to make the \nsoda. You add up all those purchases plus the costs of renting and \nheating space, paying people and paying taxes, and you get the price. \nThey have to come up with that kind of price in order to stay in \nbusiness.\n  Nobody sells it for cost, not for very long. They can't. If they sell \na product at the price that is the same as it costs them to buy the \nproduct, rent the space, pay the employees, and pay the taxes, they \ndon't make any money. They go out of business.\n\n[[Page S1847]]\n\n  One of the things we hear about around here is all the greedy \nbusinessmen there are. That is not how you get to set your price. There \nis competition out there that forces you into the lowest price you can \ncharge and stay in business. If that were not the case, if greed were \nthe answer, why doesn't a loaf of bread cost $10 or $50? The simple \nanswer is no one would pay that price. You have to be able to sell the \nproduct in order to stay in business and it has to come in at a cost \nthat you can afford.\n  One of the things we are doing here with this employer mandate is \npiling more costs on the businesses. Economists have told us repeatedly \nthat the new job-killing taxes in the reconciliation bill will be paid \non the backs of workers. The Congressional Budget Office has repeatedly \nsaid that workers will bear the brunt of an employer mandate. In fact, \nCBO has said that the $52 billion in new job-killing taxes will result \nin a corresponding reduction in wages, and if the worker doesn't make \nenough money to cover the new taxes, that worker will be at risk of \nlosing his or her job.\n  Low-income workers have been particularly hard hit by the current \neconomic conditions. Low-income workers are typically employed by small \nbusinesses and see the demand for their services fluctuate wildly with \nthe ups and downs of the economy. These low-income workers typically \nhave less formal education and have an even harder time trying to find \nany job. In fact, workers without a high school diploma have a 50-\npercent higher unemployment rate than workers with higher education \nlevels.\n  The current economic situation for young, relatively unskilled \nworkers is dire. They are facing an increasingly difficult job market \nthat is flooded with older, more qualified workers. Unfortunately, the \njob-killing taxes in the reconciliation bill will actually make their \nsituation worse.\n  The bill creates incentives against hiring low-income workers and \nunskilled workers. In fact, we have a problem in this country right now \nwith businesses being concerned about what kind of additional \nregulations are going to come out of this body and the one at the other \nend of the building. So they are not hiring people. They are waiting to \nsee what it is going to cost them. If the cost is too high, they will \nnot hire people so we will not be able to absorb those people who are \nalready without jobs.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, employer mandates such \nas those included in the reconciliation bill would ``reduce the hiring \nof low-wage workers.'' Harvard Professor Kate Baicker reported that as \na result of an employer mandate, ``workers who would lose their jobs \nare disproportionately likely to be high school dropouts, minority and \nwomen.''\n  So with the unemployment rate highest among high school dropouts and \nminorities, this bill would actually make their situation worse. The \njob-killing taxes in this bill fall disproportionately upon the people \nwho are struggling the most, putting their jobs at risk and making it \neven more difficult to find a new one. At a time when Americans across \nthis country are looking for signs of an economic recovery, the Senate \nshould be debating a bill that helps the situation, not makes it worse.\n  I offer this amendment to protect American workers from new job-\nkilling taxes that will lower wages and cut jobs. Senators can make a \nstatement right now and support American workers who are facing the \ntoughest job market since the Great Depression. I urge my colleagues to \nvote in favor of my amendment.\n  My motion is at the desk. I ask to call it up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I ask once \nthe time on the Enzi motion has expired, the motion be set aside until \na time to be determined by the leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                            Motion To Commit\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the motion.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Enzi] moves to commit the \n     bill H.R. 4872 to the Committee on Finance with \n     instructions to report the same back to the Senate within \n     1 day with changes that strike the employer mandate that \n     will lower wages and increase unemployment and add an \n     offset.\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I am proud to take the floor to support the \nmotion from my good friend, the Senator from Wyoming. I can understand \nhis frustration, having been through what he described in the process \nin the committee where this bill allegedly was marked up--although it \nis unrecognizable. The things that he was able to get in and thought \nwere in disappeared. He also has another committee on which I join him \nand that is the Small Business Committee. So there is no one better \nthan an accountant from Wyoming who has small business experience and \nwho has served on the HELP committee in drafting this legislation to \noutline the problems with this bill.\n  We have not even heard him speak at great length about his background \nin accounting, but this bill, filled with gimmicks, 10-year taxes and \n6-year spending, is overwhelming. But he is correct when he says that \nthe cost, according to CBO, will fall on the backs of the workers, the \ncosts of the employer mandate, and they will fall disproportionately on \nyoung workers, teenage workers, particularly minority teenage workers \nwho have a very high unemployment rate now. He said, and I would have \nto agree with him, it appears that Congress doesn't understand how \nsmall business works. Clearly the administration doesn't.\n  When you look at how this bill was done on Sunday, House Democrats \naccomplished what we thought was unimaginable--they successfully passed \nthe health care boondoggle that the Democrats passed here on Christmas \nEve where they stuffed our stockings with a partisan 2700-page bill \nchock-full of political payoffs, kickbacks, and sweetheart deals, some \nof which my friend from Arizona mentioned.\n  But this Sunday the House Democrats ignored the will of the American \npeople and on a party-line vote passed this $2 trillion bill that will \nincrease health care costs, raise taxes, and cut Medicare for seniors. \nDespite the story Democrats are now trying to sell to the American \npeople, this $2 trillion bill is one the President has now signed into \nlaw containing the ``Louisiana purchase,'' a sweetheart deal for \nConnecticut hospital, and several more deals on the side, in exchange \nfor votes and so on. It is one that the American people do not want. \nThey say no to this government takeover.\n  I stand with the American people who say repeal the bill and replace \nit with the things we need. We need to repeal the bill and enact real \nhealth care reform that will lower health care costs and not break the \nbanks of taxpayers or take Medicare from seniors. That is exactly what \nwe propose to do. I joined several colleagues in cosponsoring a bill \nthat would repeal this monstrosity because we need to get back to \nbusiness, to give the American people the health care reform they \ndeserve--not the bill they don't want.\n  This Christmas Eve health care bill is not the only legislation to \nwhich the American people have said no. They also do not want the so-\ncalled reconciliation bill which is going to force the American people \nto reconcile themselves to even higher taxes, even more cuts in \nMedicare. This is the kind of thing that will not fix the problems of \nthe American people, it will make them worse. If you thought cuts to \nseniors in the previous bill were bad enough, this reconciliation will \ncut services even more and taxes will go up. But as my colleague from \nWyoming said, right now we need jobs. That is what the American people \nare telling me they want. They cannot be any clearer. One in ten \nAmericans is unemployed. A fellow Missourian, Harry Truman, once said, \nfor those people it's not a recession but a depression.\n  With these kinds of dismal unemployment numbers it is no surprise \nthat polls keep telling us that they want jobs created, not the \ngovernment to take over health care.\n  It is not just the people in Missouri who have been stopping me on \nthe street. I get e-mails, phone calls, and\n\n[[Page S1848]]\n\nletters to my office. But they stop me wherever I go, from a grocery \nstore to the post office to restaurants. They do not want this job-\nkilling bill. They want a job-creating effort.\n  They do not want this monstrosity of a health care bill. \nUnfortunately, the majority in this body and the other body have \nignored their demands. This bill undermines the employer's ability to \ncreate jobs and by extension it extends the recession and all of the \nmisery associated with it.\n  Most people, I would hope, would recognize that small business is the \nengine that creates the jobs in the United States. People who are \ninformed, as we would hope Members of this body are, know that most \nsmall businesses are taxed as individuals, as proprietorships, \npartnerships, or sub-S corporations. That is why the small business tax \nrelief in 2003 cut taxes and led to the creation of 8 million new jobs.\n  Despite what some of my colleagues on the other side believe, it is \nnot the government, not a massive government stimulus bill that creates \njobs in the private sector. In fact, the massive stimulus bill \ndiscouraged it, and the reconciliation bill will be even a bigger blow \nto job creation.\n  And the timing, when unemployment is still too high, is a perfect \nstorm because the 2003 tax cuts are expiring. So these small businesses \nare already facing one boost in their taxes, and now they are going to \nget several more. Pair these two and the effect is that Congress is \npiling an overwhelming burden on small business.\n  The tax on health insurance will result in increased premiums. \nHowever, these who are self-insured, like big businesses and not-for-\nprofits, like labor unions, are exempt from this tax. It is not going \nto hurt them. This means those who are forced into the fully insured \nmarket, such as small businesses, will bear the burden of the premium \nincreases.\n  The President and the majority may tell you they are giving tax \ncredits to help small business. Well, they are not going to be fooled \nby that. The tax credit expires after only 5 years. If you have 11 \nemployees and hire another one, it starts phasing it out, so you cannot \nhave your business grow. If you raise the salaries, you lose the \nbenefits.\n  The reconciliation bill makes things worse. It increases the penalty \nunder the employer mandates from $750 to $2,000 per employee, on top of \nall of the other taxes. If you are already offering your employees \ninsurance in this high-cost market and the government decides it is not \ngood enough, they hit you again, if it is too expensive. If that was \nnot bad enough, both full-time and part-time employees will be counted. \nThe majority wants the American people to think they are not really \nhurting business with this reconciliation bill. They like to talk about \nsticking it to or raising the taxes on the wealthy.\n  They want the American people to believe--and I believe the American \npeople are too smart and know--that these new taxes are going to just \nhit the CEOs of Fortune 500 companies or professional athletes or \nentertainers, wealthy lawyers, Hollywood moguls, and international \nfinance speculators. That is what they charge.\n  But what my colleagues on the other side of the aisle will not tell \nyou is the collateral damage will destroy small businesses. Who are the \n``rich'' the Democrats want to target? As high as 79 percent, some \nfigures say, of those paying taxes at the highest rate have a large \npart or at least a small part of their income from small business. \nSmall business is the backbone of the country and represents 99.7 \npercent of all employer firms; over half of all private sector \nemployees are in small business; 44 percent of the total U.S. private \npayroll; and small business generated over 64 percent of the net new \njobs over the past 15 years.\n  Despite this importance of small business, we are facing a new \nemployer mandate which the Enzi-Bond amendment would strike. I urge my \ncolleagues to have a heart. Understand that the people they are hurting \nare not just small businesses, it is the people who work for small \nbusinesses or who would work for small businesses who will be denied \nthe chance to get a job in small business because of the increasing \ncosts this bill puts on them.\n  This bill takes away incentives for small businesses to keep the \nworkers they have, to hire and expand. Some of these small business \nowners who think now is not a good time to expand their business or \nhire more people cite the political climate as the second most cited \nreason they are not doing it, after poor sales.\n  The government is literally prohibiting economic growth. Small \nbusinesses are struggling. They are struggling in this economy to be \nable to offer affordable health insurance. I have worked for years with \npeople such as Senator Enzi and other colleagues to get small \nbusinesses permission to go together in nationwide purchasing pools and \nbuy their insurance in the national market like the big employers and \nthe unions do so they can get better rates, get the administrative \nsavings.\n  Well, we cannot get it through. This would be the time to do that. It \nwould not cost the taxpayers anything. It would save taxpayers money. \nAllow people to purchase health care across State lines. You can see \nauto insurance advertised, and they cut through competition to get you \nthe best deal. Would not my folks in Missouri who are having trouble \naffording health care like to look for a national health plan? They \nwould love it.\n  If you care about the jobs in this country and the future of the \neconomy, you cannot vote for this reconciliation bill which would \nfurther devastate one of our most important job-creating sectors. It is \nnot only a bad bill, it will make the struggling market worse.\n  Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 6 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BOND. I want to add one other thought. In the 20 years I have \nbeen in the Senate, I have traveled around the world. I have seen \nremarkable changes that have come from countries throughout the world, \nparticularly after the fall of the Soviet Union. With the fall of \nsocialism and communism, countries around the world immediately began \nto look to the United States as the economic model.\n  They saw our progress. They saw what we were doing because of the \nsystem we had. Our free enterprise system demonstrated that successful \nbusinesses, successful entrepreneurs can provide opportunities. This is \na classic case of a rising tide lifting all boats. That is why \ncountries from some of the least developed to the reasonably well \ndeveloped want to mimic our system. They are not looking to Denmark or \nSweden with their very high tax rates as a model; they see the \ndifference between a government-controlled economy and a free economy \nwith appropriate government regulation.\n  They know in the free economy, the free marketplace, entrepreneurs \ncan go forward and come up with an idea, take a risk, risk their \nfortune, risk their ideas, and go out and make money that will allow \nthem to hire more people and provide benefits for the community.\n  Unfortunately, when our President says health care should be the \nmodel for the role of the government in the economy, I am afraid he is \ntalking about the European Socialist model which has demonstrated that \nthe economy does not grow as quickly as the U.S. economy. They have \nhigh levels of unemployment.\n  What does government-created high unemployment do? It generates more \nsocial welfare and transfer payments. These transfer payments put \npressure on governments to raise taxes even higher, make more people \ndependent on the largesse of the Federal Government, and further \ndepress the incentive for entrepreneurs, men and women with good ideas \nwho want to build a job and want to hire people.\n  Last year's stimulus program did a tremendous job of putting more \npeople on government payrolls; that is, the Federal, State, and local \nlevel. But did not do much to create jobs in the private sector. I \nbelieve the private sector in America has historically been vibrant. It \nwill create jobs despite increasing government taxation, deficits, and \nregulations. They may do that for a while, but I can tell you that the \nnumber of jobs will necessarily be far less than what the free market \nsystem could create if it were not inflicted with this increasing \ngovernment burden on businesses.\n\n  Using history as our guide, health care and the reconciliation bill \nand the other proposals the majority has\n\n[[Page S1849]]\n\nplanned are likely to lead to a longer recession, continued high \nunemployment, and a lower standard of living for all Americans than \nwould otherwise be possible. That is the source of the anger among the \npublic.\n  No one is against health care reform. You can tell that from the \nangry people. I have met the clerks in a store, in a hardware store, \nwho say: Do not take away my health care. I want some reforms, but I do \nnot want to lose my health care. That person, I told her, she would \nlose her health care. She would not be able to use the same plan. I \nsaid: I agree with you. I want to stop this bill. I want to get \ncommonsense reforms that will really help more people get insured, get \nbetter deals, and do it without raising costs, and cutting Medicare.\n  Americans understand what this type of health care reform will do to \nthe good health care system we have now, what it will do to our \neconomy. There is a real danger. The people understand. That is why \nthey are angry. I will tell you, they are angry. They are angry at me. \nThey call my office and they are yelling at me.\n  I said: I am on your side.\n  They said: I know, but we are angry. We do not want to see it go \nthrough.\n  They are concerned and we are concerned about our families, about the \neconomic prospects for our children and grandchildren because they are \ngoing to be carrying the burden on their backs of the heavy spending we \ndo today.\n  I see my colleague from Wyoming rising. I will end my remarks here.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank the Senator from Missouri for his passionate \nremarks. He was the former chairman of the Small Business Committee \nbefore he moved to the chairman of the Intelligence Committee. You can \nsee the passion and his understanding, former Governor, and one of \nJaycee's ``10 outstanding young men.'' I appreciate him raising the \nissue of small business health plans. We have exchanges, we have the \nShop Act, we have some other things, co-ops, in the bill. But we should \nhave put in more opportunities for competition. Increased competition \nbrings prices down. So I thank the Senator for mentioning that.\n  I believe our time has expired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next hour \nof debate be equally divided, as we have been doing, back and forth, \nwith the first half under the control of the majority, the second half \nunder the control of the Republican side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nIllinois from the time on the Enzi amendment.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the chairman of the Finance Committee for his \nleadership on this issue and I thank my colleagues for joining in this \ndebate. We are now starting the end of the fourth hour, into the fifth \nhour of this debate.\n  I have listened to many of the speeches that have been given. They \nare not only good, they are familiar. They are familiar because most of \nthe speeches which we have heard on the floor are critical of the \nHealth Care Reform Act which passed the House of Representatives on \nSunday night and was signed into law by the President this morning.\n  Now, I can understand why some on the other side of the aisle did not \nlike that. They did not vote for it. But the fact is, to come before us \nin this Chamber and to attack that now law of the land is to ignore why \nwe are supposed to be here. We are here with a reconciliation bill that \nis basically designed to reduce the budget deficit.\n  We have several provisions in this reconciliation bill which have not \nbeen addressed by most of the speakers on the other side. For example, \ndid the Republicans oppose the reconciliation provision that makes \nhealth insurance premiums more affordable for those in lower income \ncategories? That is what is in the reconciliation bill. If they oppose \nthat, then they should come out and say just that.\n  Do they oppose the expansion of community health clinics across \nAmerica, more than doubling the number of community health clinics so \nthere is more primary care so every family has a family doctor? Do the \nRepublicans oppose that? Do they oppose family doctors for every \nfamily? If they do, step up and say so.\n  Do they oppose the efforts in this bill to close the doughnut hole; \nin other words, to make sure that seniors under Medicare have help in \npaying for prescription drugs they do not have today? I have yet to \nhear the first Republican say he opposes it. Yet that is what the bill \nis before us.\n  So the news flash to the Senate Chamber is, this morning the \nPresident of the United States of America signed into law the health \ncare reform bill. To come before us and renew this debate is to ignore \nthe measure that we are supposed to be considering, the reconciliation \nbill.\n  I haven't heard all the speeches on the floor, but I want to know if \nthe Republicans oppose the provision in the reconciliation bill that \nends a $60 to $80 billion subsidy for banks across America on student \nloans. Do you think that subsidy for banks is good? If it is, stand and \nsay so. I think it is bad. It adds to the cost of loans. It adds to the \ndebt of young people. We eliminate it. If they think banks should enjoy \nthis subsidy, let's hear it. Stand and address the provisions in this \nbill. But they haven't done it.\n  Instead, what they have done is to file, at latest count, some 22 or \n24 amendments. Remember, this is a reconciliation bill about reducing \nthe budget deficit. I leave it to those following this debate to decide \nwhether these Republican amendments are serious efforts to address the \nbudget deficit or something else. Here is one we have seen so many \ntimes before by one of the Republican Senators, attacking the ACORN \norganization. Unfortunately, this Senator's newspapers have not been \narriving on a timely basis because if they had, he would know this \norganization is going bankrupt. But he wants us to stop on this health \ncare debate, stop on this budget deficit debate, and go back and flog \nACORN again, as they languish in bankruptcy court. Common sense tells \nus that doesn't have a thing to do with health care reform or budget \ndeficit reduction. It is a political amendment.\n  Here is an amendment by a Republican Senator to prohibit prescription \ncoverage of Viagra for child molesters and rapists. I am not making \nthis up. There is a fertile mind somewhere on the staff of the other \nside of the aisle dreaming up gotcha amendments. Here is one, Viagra \nfor child molesters. Let's see if they will vote against that. Common \nsense tells us that doesn't have anything to do with health care reform \nor reducing the budget deficit. It is a political amendment. It is \nunfortunate.\n  Here is one Members should be held accountable for, but the question \nis, Why would you debate it on this bill? An amendment to require all \nMembers of Congress to read a bill before voting on the bill. I have \nbeen asked repeatedly: Did you read the health care reform bill? The \nanswer is yes. I think our constituents should ask us that question. \nBut are we going to make it the law of the land? Who is going to \nmonitor the reading of these amendments and bills to make sure every \npage is read by every Member of Congress? Is this a commonsense \namendment or is this a political amendment?\n  Here is an amendment by a Republican Senator. You tell me what this \nhas to do with health care reform or budget deficit reduction: to call \nfor a referendum in the District of Columbia on gay marriage. What does \nthat have to do with health care reform? The answer is nothing.\n  What we are going to face in the next few hours or days, whatever it \nhappens to be, are more and more amendments such as this that are not \nserious amendments. They don't deal with health care reform. They don't \ndeal with the budget deficit. They deal with somebody's idea of a \npolitical gotcha, to offer an amendment to try to trap Members.\n  I don't think we are going to fall for that. I think Members on this \nside of the aisle realize what is at stake. We need to pass this \nreconciliation bill so we can help pay for health insurance premiums \nfor those in lower income categories, extend the reach of community \nhealth clinics, close the doughnut hole, make sure we are helping \nStates pay for the new Medicaid burden they will face. I thought the \nRepublicans were in support of that. Obviously, they are not.\n\n[[Page S1850]]\n\n  There is one point I would like to add. I have heard so many speeches \nby Republican leaders, including the Republican minority leader, that \nthe reason why this whole effort is wrong is because the American \npeople oppose health care reform. Another news flash: I wish to share \nwith the Members of the other side of the aisle a poll announced today. \nWhen people were asked, after passage of the health care bill in the \nHouse of Representatives, whether they believe it is a good thing or \nbad thing that Congress passed the bill, good thing, 49, bad thing 40. \nBy a 9-percentage margin, the American people say it was a good thing \nto do. America's emotional reaction on the bill, 50 percent \nenthusiastic or pleased, 42 percent angry or disappointed. I wonder if \nmy Republican colleagues are now going to amend the premise that we \nshould follow the opinion polls of America, now that the bill is passed \nand the American people, a majority, support this. Are they now going \nto change their position on whether opinion polls should drive our \nvotes? I thought that was a pretty simplistic analysis to start with.\n  Here is what it come down to. Many of us went to the White House \ntoday to watch the President sign a bill that will be historic in \nnature. Similar to Social Security and Medicare, it extends the reach \nof health care protection and peace of mind to millions of Americans \nwho don't have it. It was a hard-fought battle; I will concede that \npoint. The fact is, at the end of the day, we won that battle. The \nPresident signed that bill, and it is the law of the land. The so-\ncalled Republican repealers, the ones who are going to run down in the \nnext election to repeal it, better come and explain to small businesses \nacross America, almost 4 million that are going to qualify for tax \ncredits to help pay for health insurance. I heard all the comments from \nthe previous speaker from Missouri, the Senator talking about be \nsensitive to small business. By opposing that bill, he opposed tax \ncredits for almost 4 million small businesses. That bill will also \nextend health insurance to 30 million Americans who don't have it, \nAmericans who, when they get sick and get treated, pass their bills \nalong to other people. Those 30 million will have health insurance. \nThat means less of a burden on those of us with health insurance to \npick up their cost.\n  I say to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle: The political \namendments don't make sense. Most of the American people have had \nenough of them, amendments about ACORN and gay marriage on a bill on \nhealth care. It doesn't fit. Common sense tells us we should not be \ndelaying the Senate's final decision on a critically important bill. If \nthe Republican side of the aisle was waiting for American public \nopinion to express itself, the American people have spoken. They think \nwe did the right thing in passing this bill on health care reform, and \nthe President did the right thing signing it into law this morning. \nThey don't want to repeal this help. They want all the help they can \nget for affordable health insurance for quality care.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes off the bill to the \nSenator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, with whom I am honored to serve, and colleagues who have \nbeen working very hard on this initiative, as all our colleagues have. \nI wish to talk first about what is in front of us because it is true \nthat today is a historic day. The President signed a very important \nbill, passed by the House and the Senate, that lays the groundwork for \nwhat we all believe should happen in terms of making sure every family \nhas a family doctor and that we tackle the costs that are crippling \nbusinesses and the country. What we have in front of us now is a bill \nto make a good bill better. That is what we are doing. We are making a \ngood bill better with what we are doing right now. It is tackling the \nissue of cost.\n  We are saving money in this bill we will be voting on, saving money \nfor middle-class families by making health care more affordable, saving \nmoney for seniors by making their prescription drugs more affordable, \nand saving money for our children and grandchildren because this is the \nlargest deficit-reduction effort we have seen in many years--in fact, \nsince President Clinton brought us into balance when the Democrats were \nlast in charge.\n  We know from the Congressional Budget Office and we now have 43 \nleading health economists who all agree that health care reform will \nreduce the deficit, about $143 billion in the first 10 years and over \n$1.2 trillion in the next 10 years. This is important, as we go forward \nand get our House in order, to bring down the deficit and focus on \njobs and other parts of the economy that are so important.\n\n  What are we talking about, as our colleagues talk about the broader \nbill that has already been signed into law? What does that bill mean \nfor families and businesses? First, starting right now, today, I was \nvery pleased to author a provision to make the small business tax cut \nimmediate. So as of today, for this year, small businesses are going to \nreceive up to a 35-percent tax cut to help them afford health \ninsurance. In my State, health care is very much about saving jobs. \nHealth care costs are costing us jobs. We have too many small \nbusinesses getting a 20- or 30- or 40-percent premium increase notice. \nThey are deciding: Do I keep people employed and cut the health \ninsurance or do I pay the health insurance increase and lay people off?\n  That is what is happening all across America. Our bill this year now \nbegins a 35-percent tax cut for businesses that have 10 or fewer \nemployees and a tax cut for those up to 25 employees. Four years from \nnow, that tax cut goes up to 50 percent. So it starts at 35 percent and \ngoes up to 50 percent of the cost for small businesses to help them pay \nfor health insurance.\n  Right now we are going to begin to see the largest effort to provide \ncommunity health centers that our country has seen. Approximately \n10,000 neighborhoods, communities across the country will have the \nopportunity and funding to create a community health center so people \nwho have lost jobs don't lose their health insurance, so people who \ndon't today have health insurance will have a place to go to take their \nchildren to see a family doctor rather than to an emergency room. It is \nestimated we will be able to serve 25 million people by this effort \nthat is starting today.\n  Starting today, seniors are going to receive immediate help for their \nprescription drugs, if they are caught in that gap in coverage that has \nbeen called the doughnut hole. We are going to be closing that doughnut \nhole over time.\n  What happens next? We are going to see lower costs for early \nretirees. This is a very important matter in the State of Michigan and \nother places where we have people being required or forced to retire at \n55 because of losing their job or because of cost-cutting efforts. I \nwas proud to join with Senator Kerry in an effort to create a way to \nlower the cost for employers that have early retirees on their health \ninsurance or for early retirees themselves, between 55 and 65. We will \nbe bringing down the cost of health insurance for people. That is very \nimportant.\n  No preexisting conditions for children. Insurance companies will not \nbe able to block parents from getting insurance for their children. \nThat is pretty important. Young people are going to be able to stay on \ntheir parents' insurance until age 26. I wish that one was a little bit \nhigher. I kind of missed that one myself. But the reality is, for a lot \nof young people and a lot of parents, this is a very big deal. It is \nvery important. I am surprised colleagues would want to repeal \nsomething that would take that away.\n  We have, starting this year, a set of insurance reforms that will say \nthe insurance companies can't cancel your insurance if you get sick. I \nhave so many people who have said to me: I have insurance, but then all \nof a sudden somebody gets sick, and they find out a technicality. They \nget dropped. We are going to hold insurance companies accountable in a \nway that has not happened before in this country. We are going to \neliminate lifetime limits on coverage. It is not your fault if you have \ncancer and you need treatments for a long period or you have some other \nkind of disease. There should not be artificial caps and lifetime \nlimits.\n  What this is about for us is that it is time to stand for middle-\nclass families\n\n[[Page S1851]]\n\nand small businesses. That is what we are doing. That is what we are \ndoing by lowering costs, by saving money for families, saving money for \nseniors, saving money for future generations, for our children by \nlowering the deficit, by focusing on small businesses, where most of \nthe people who don't have insurance are working. They are working in a \nsmall business that can't find affordable insurance.\n  In the short run, we will help them with tax cuts and, 4 years from \nnow, a larger insurance pool so they can buy from the private sector in \na larger pool, such as big business does. That will bring down costs. \nThis is about standing for middle-class families, standing for small \nbusinesses.\n  What we are seeing, unfortunately, on the other side of the aisle, as \nthe distinguished assistant majority leader informed us, are all kinds \nof amendments. First, they have nothing to do with health care, nothing \nto do with this bill. They are all about games. I say to colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle: Don't play games with Americans' health \ncare. Do not play games with the lives of Americans who are counting on \nus to finish the job--to pass the bill in front of us, to make a good \nbill better, to be able to save money for Americans, and to be able to \nget this job done.\n\n  We do not need more political games. I think the American people have \nseen enough. Frankly, I do not blame them for being frustrated about \nwhat happened and all that we have gone through in the last year. I \nshare that frustration. They expect us to get things done. Frankly, \nthey are not caring what configuration gets that done in terms of the \nvote. They want us to get things done.\n  So I would ask colleagues to drop the games. We are going to get a \nlot of different kinds of amendments that are designed to embarrass, \ndesigned to hold things up. I would ask colleagues to please stop the \ngames. Do not play games with Americans' health care.\n  In conclusion, I would simply say again, health insurance reform is \nabout a family doctor for every family. Isn't that what we want--the \nability to know that when you tuck the kids in tonight, if one of them \ngets sick, you are going to be able to call the doctor, you are going \nto be able to care for your children, you are going to be able to get \ninsurance for them, and you are going to be able to know that your \nchildren are going to get the care they need because you have a family \ndoctor?\n  That is what this is about, fundamentally. It is about a set of \nvalues that starts from the premise that everybody in America, every \nfamily, should have a family doctor. This bill in front of us completes \nthat task and sets us on the road to fulfill that vision. I urge \ncolleagues to vote for this bill, put aside the games, and let us get \non with the business of our country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nCalifornia, Mrs. Boxer, off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  In 1912, a Republican President named Teddy Roosevelt ran for the \nPresidency on a platform that promised national health care reform. \nToday, I had the privilege of watching President Barack Obama sign into \nlaw a landmark bill that is being perfected today in the legislation \nnow before the Senate. It was quite a moment. The Senate health care \nreform bill the President signed today gives small businesses tax \ncredits to help them purchase insurance for themselves and their \nemployees. In my State of California, that is 400,000 businesses that \nwill have access to tax credits.\n  The new law is very important to early retirees because it will \nensure lower insurance rates, and we will see a high-risk pool so that \nin my State, and all States, adults who cannot get insurance because of \na preexisting condition will be able to do so.\n  The bill the President signed prohibits preexisting condition \nexclusions for children. So if you have insurance, but your child has \nasthma or diabetes or something else, and they cannot get covered, that \ndiscrimination is over. It ended today. The new law will cover \npreventive services such as mammograms and vaccinations at little or no \ncost.\n  This bill is so important--I should say this law because it is now \nthe law--is so important for our people. It will create new community \nhealth care centers throughout our States, and we will see primary care \ndoctors serving in those community health care centers, and nurses. It \nwill require 80 percent of premium income to be spent on our health \ncare--not on outrageous bonuses for the CEOs. They cannot say that \noverall they have spent 50 percent on us, the policyholders, and 50 \npercent on themselves. That is called medical loss ratio, and we have \nfixed it in this law.\n  Seniors on Medicare will get free preventive care, and we have a new, \nvoluntary, long-term care insurance program that people can buy into \nstarting in 2011.\n  In 2014, even more things are added to this extremely important list \nof benefits. Health insurance exchanges will open so that there is a \nmarketplace for businesses, families and individuals to go. It is going \nto help us make better choices and have more choices. It provides tax \ncredits to help individuals and families with incomes below $88,000 to \npurchase insurance through the exchange. So this has a lot of benefits \nfor our working families and our middle-class families. We go up to \n$88,000 for a family of four. It expands Medicaid to cover families \nearning less than $29,000. Now it is a much lower level. So these are \nvery good things.\n  The bill before the Senate now--this is our unfinished business. We \nneed to make a good bill better, and that is what we are doing today. \nHow do we do it? The bill before us entirely closes the gap in Medicare \ndrug coverage. It starts with a $250 rebate to those senior citizens \nwho are in that doughnut hole, that payment gap. In my State, it is \nabout 800,000 senior citizens. Imagine, 800,000 senior citizens in my \nState, when we pass the bill, will get $250--each one of them, if they \nhave fallen into the coverage gap.\n  It allows young people to stay on their parents' insurance until they \nare 26. That happens this year. How many stories have we heard about \nyoung people who may have--I use asthma as an example--who get kicked \noff their parents' health care? They have to. An insurance company \nsays: We are not going to insure you, and they are in deep trouble. The \nbill before us today says to an insurance company: No more rescissions. \nThat is a cancellation of a policy when you get sick. You can not do \nthat anymore. And no more lifetime limits on your plans. Because a lot \nof times when people get sick--they did not read the fine print--they \nfind out they are up against a limit. If they have a serious condition \nsuch as cancer, they may reach that limit. What happens is, they have \nto, in many cases, sell their home, sell their possessions, and they \ndeclare bankruptcy. No more. Insurance companies cannot do that--once \nwe pass this bill tonight, and once it is signed.\n  So there are many good things in the bill the President signed \ntoday--things that are very important to our families and very good \nthings to make that bill better in the bill before us.\n  I hope we are not going to see the kind of tactics that some on the \nother side have said they are going to use, by offering amendments that \nhave nothing to do with anything except killing this very important \nbill.\n  I want to say, there are so many improvements in this bill. For \nexample, Medicaid. My State will be able to put millions of people on \nto Medicaid--1.7 million people, to be exact. And my State, as all \nother States, will get 100 percent reimbursement for that in the years \n2014, 2015, and 2016.\n  We are going to see 32 million more people in our Nation have access \nto health insurance. The Medicare trust fund will be extended by 9 \nyears. My State benefits greatly. There are many ways I have already \ndiscussed. But I want to lay this out. By 2014, up to 7 million \nCalifornians will finally have access to health insurance, and it will \nreverse a horrible trend, year after year people not able to get it.\n  I want to spend a moment to address Republican concerns that the \nprocess was partisan. I think it is important to note over and over \nagain that the bill that was signed by the President today, that is \ngoing to help so many of our people, contains 147 Republican \namendments. Let me repeat that. The\n\n[[Page S1852]]\n\nbill the President signed today contains 147 Republican amendments.\n  For example, there is an amendment by a Republican colleague that all \nMembers of Congress and their staff have to enroll in the exchanges. \nThat is in the law. There is an amendment by another Republican Senator \nto allow premium rates to vary by tobacco use. That was accepted and is \nnow law. There is an amendment to ensure that the voluntary long-term \ninsurance program, the CLASS Act, remains solvent over 75 years. We \nhave taken those amendments. They are now law.\n  Now my Republican friends are saying they want to repeal the bill. \nThis is going out all across the airways. They want to repeal the bill. \nAnd they say if a lot of us lose, and they can get more votes here, \nthey are going to repeal the bill. So I want to ask a few rhetorical \nquestions.\n\n  Which of the protections in the bill do they want to repeal? Do they \nwant to repeal the end of gender rating, where women have had to pay \nmuch more than men? Do they want to repeal the protections for our \nchildren, who will now have coverage even if they have a preexisting \ncondition? Do they want to repeal free prevention services, such as \nvaccinations or mammograms? Do they want to repeal the prohibition on \nlifetime caps on insurance policies? Or maybe they want to repeal the \n$250 rebate for prescription drug costs to seniors.\n  Well, do they want to repeal other things? There is a law now that \nsays you cannot get kicked out of your insurance plan when you get \nsick. That is the one I described before: no rescissions. Do they want \nto repeal that? Or maybe they want to repeal generous tax credits for \nsmall businesses.\n  I guess they want to repeal all of these things because they said \nthey want to repeal the entire law. But I would urge them to stand up \nand tell their constituents exactly which of these provisions they want \nto repeal. I want to put it on the Record that I look forward to that \nbattle because I can tell you the letters to my office are saying: \nPlease, please protect us. We feel vulnerable.\n  I wish to state at this time that this bill reduces the deficit in \naddition to doing all these other things. In closing--and I would ask \nhow much time I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Thirty seconds.\n  Mrs. BOXER. OK. I would say, in closing, that a lot of fear has been \ninjected into this debate. And you are going to get a barrel of it \ncoming up. There is one thing to fear, and that is doing nothing. It is \nunsustainable. Mr. President, 14,000 people lose their health insurance \nevery day; 1,400 in my State. Sixty-six percent of bankruptcies are \nlinked to a health care crisis. Mr. President, 45,000 Americans die \nevery year because they have no health insurance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. BOXER. So let's do something. Let's do this. Let's finish the \njob.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent to \nproceed in a colloquy with a number of my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Against which block of time will this be \ncharged?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The next 30 minutes for the Republicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Off the bill?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I come to discuss an amendment that has to do with the fact that--as \nI read this bill, as I talk to my colleagues who are physicians, as I \ntalk to Senators--I believe this bill that was signed into law, as well \nas the reconciliation bill that is before this body right now, is going \nto significantly increase the cost of health insurance premiums paid by \nAmerican citizens.\n  I am bringing up an amendment tonight that says if the Department of \nHealth and Human Services certifies that premiums will rise faster \nunder this Democratic health care bill signed into law, and the \nreconciliation bill, than they would under current law, then the \nprovisions of the bill will sunset. Because we have been promised--the \nAmerican people have been promised--that by passing this law, what \nwould happen is that the cost of their own health insurance premiums \nwould go down. The President of the United States promised it. The \nPresident of the United States, while campaigning, talked about that, \nmade that promise, and then early in his term said he would actually \nlower the premiums for families by an average of $2,500 per family for \nthe cost of their health care insurance. That is what the President \nsaid.\n\n  So then the bill is written behind closed doors. People had very \nlittle input. That bill came out, and then Senator Richard Durbin, the \nDemocrat from Illinois, the majority whip, comes to the floor on March \n10 and says: Anyone who would stand before you and say, Well, if we \npass health care reform, next year's health care premiums are going \ndown--which is what the President has said--anyone who says that I \ndon't think is telling the truth. He went on to say: I think it is \nlikely they would go up--they would go up. What we are trying to do, he \nsaid, is slow the rate of increase.\n  Well, only 2 days before Senator Durbin said that on this floor, the \nPresident was in Glenside, PA, and he said: Our cost cutting measures \nmirror most of the proposals in the current Senate bill which reduces--\nhe said--reduces most people's premiums.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, may I ask my colleague whether he recalls \nwhen at Blair House our colleague from Tennessee began the discussion \nwith the President and our Democratic colleagues, and he said at that \ntime that the Congressional Budget Office said premiums would increase \nfrom 10 percent to 13 percent for individuals purchasing health \ninsurance? That comes out to $2,100 more for a typical family. The \nPresident challenged that, as you may recall, and said: Well, we are \ngoing to settle this before the end of this--what later turned out to \nbe 7 hours of fun.\n  So what was the answer to that, I ask Dr. Barrasso. What was the \nanswer? Was Senator Alexander correct when he quoted the Congressional \nBudget Office that premiums would increase by 10 percent to 13 percent \nfor individuals purchasing health insurance or was the President \ncorrect by saying that was not true?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Well, Senator Enzi, who has joined us on the floor, was \nalso sitting with us that day at Blair House, and my recollection and \nfrom doing the research afterward and the press reported that Senator \nAlexander was correct. Individuals buying health insurance in the \nindividual market would see their health insurance premiums go up by 10 \npercent to 13 percent if this bill becomes law, and the President \nsigned it into law today.\n  So the American public needs to know that their insurance premiums \nare going to go up as a result of what the President signed today, and \nI am bringing up an amendment opposed to that.\n  Mr. ENZI. That is exactly what was concluded in that Blair House \nmeeting. It was supposed to be a listening session, but nothing appears \nto have been listened to. Nothing was included from any of the multiple \nsuggestions the Republicans made there.\n  About the 10 percent to 13 percent that premiums are going to \nincrease, there is a very important addition to that. It is 10 percent \nto 13 percent more than if we did nothing. The President keeps talking \nabout how we need to do this bill because health care costs are \nescalating dramatically. And they are. But they are going to escalate \neven faster--10 percent to 13 percent more--than if we did nothing.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Could I ask Senator Enzi, then, what was the President \nreferring to? In fairness to the President, what was he referring to \nwhen he challenged the assertion of the Senator from Tennessee that \nindividual premiums would go up by some 10 percent to 13 percent?\n  Mr. ENZI. I am not exactly sure what he was referring to. He has used \nthat in the numbers speeches, just as they keep using the number that \nthis bill will reduce the deficit by $138 billion. Again, you have to \nread the rest of the sentence and find out that is if we don't take \ncare of all of the things we normally take care of, such as the doc \nfix, which is going to cost $300 billion, which more than uses up that \nmoney.\n\n[[Page S1853]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. So it seems to me pretty legitimate to hold the President \nand the sponsors of this legislation to their word; that is, if it \ndoesn't increase the premiums, then they are true to their word, but if \nit does increase premiums, then the American people have not been told \nthe truth. Therefore, this legislation should be scrapped and we should \nstart all over.\n  By the way, may I add one point? I have grown a little weary--a lot \nweary--about when they say to do nothing will do X, Y, and Z. We are \nnot talking about doing nothing. We are talking about medical \nmalpractice reform. How does anybody excuse the fact that there is not \nmedical malpractice reform in this legislation? There is only one \nanswer. It is that the trial lawyers control this legislation, and that \nis disgraceful.\n  Mr. GREGG. If the Senator will yield, I think it is important to \nunderstand why the premiums go up so that the argument that they don't \ngo up can be pointed out as being really transparently inaccurate. The \nreason the premiums go up is because under this bill, Americans who \nhave health insurance will be forced to buy more expensive health \ninsurance. They are going to be forced to buy health insurance which is \nat a much higher level of coverage for a lot of things which many \nAmericans simply don't need and therefore don't buy it today. They are \ngoing to be required to buy that higher cost health insurance, and that \nis going to force up the premiums.\n  This is a classic, top-down you do what the government says relative \nto what type of health insurance plan you are going to be able to buy \nplan, which we should expect from this administration. But we should \nnot deny that it has an immediate impact on the cost of that health \ninsurance and that CBO has said--as both Senators from Wyoming have so \naccurately pointed out, CBO has scored this as increasing the premiums \nfor individuals because of that; is that not correct?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. That is absolutely correct. The nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office says it is going to go up. The Joint \nCommittee on Taxation says people are going to have to end up paying \nmore in health care premiums than if there was no bill at all. The \nChief Actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said \nthe same, as did eight additional private sector studies. They all \nconfirm that the health care reform bill signed into law today will \ndrive insurance costs up greater than if there was no bill at all \nsigned into law.\n  There are mandates we are putting on young people who are going to be \nforced, many of whom are going to be forced to buy insurance, forced by \nthis law--all of them are going to be forced to buy insurance that many \nof them don't need, many of them don't want, and many of them can't \nafford, because they are going to have to buy levels that are far in \nexcess of what they might want. It is going to be very expensive, as \nmany of them are going to be subsidizing others because of what is \ncalled the community rating and the way this whole program has been set \nup.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the Senator from New Hampshire--just a personal \npoint. Suppose we had decided to do away with the tax benefit for \nemployer-provided health insurance and given every American family a \n$5,000 refundable tax credit. Would we have then been able to provide \nthe ability to acquire insurance to some 30 million Americans?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes, I think the Senator is right, and the type of \ninsurance they would have gotten would have been the type of insurance \nthey wanted. If you are a young person today and you are not buying \nhealth insurance, it is probably in many instances not because you \ncan't afford it. In fact, it is estimated that of the uninsured \npopulation, of the 47 million uninsured, approximately 20 million have \nincomes over $70,000, and they can afford insurance. They just simply \ndecided they are not going to buy it.\n  If you gave them this refundable tax credit, what they could buy is a \ncatastrophic plan so they could assure themselves of coverage in the \ncase of that accident or that catastrophic disease that might wipe them \nout financially, and it would probably be more tailored to what they \nwant as opposed to what some bureaucrat here in Washington wants or \nwhat the President of the United States wants or what somebody here on \nthe other side of the aisle decided they should have.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. If my colleague will yield, this is really a bait-and-\nswitch. During the campaign, President Obama said this is about \nlowering the cost of health insurance. We know the cost of health \ninsurance has gone up 130 percent in the past 10 years. The debate was: \nDon't you want your health insurance to be lower? And the American \npeople said: Sure, yes. Of course they did. The switch is what this is \nall about, which is putting more people into Medicaid. It will put 15 \nmillion more people into a program that is failing; a program where \nWalgreens in Washington State is no longer taking Medicaid; a program \nwhere doctors are no longer taking Medicaid. It is not health care \nreform if the doctor is not in. But for the rest of Americans, the 159 \nmillion people who have health insurance, their costs aren't going to \ngo down. In fact, their costs are going to go up.\n  I ask my friend, the Senator from Arizona, who comes from a State \nwhere there is a population just like Florida with a lot of seniors, \nwhat do we say to our seniors, our seniors who are now going to have a \ncut in Medicare of $500 billion-plus to finance this big expansion in \nMedicaid? How do we justify that to them?\n  Mr. McCAIN. And the program, I am sure Dr. Barrasso and Senator Enzi \nwould agree, that is going to be cut the most is a program called \nMedicare Advantage where seniors do have some relative choice as to \nwhat type of care they wish to receive. Fortunately, the 800,000 \nenrollee carve-out has been removed because of the national attention \nit got.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. There is an advantage to Medicare Advantage. That is \nwhy people signed up for it, as 11 million Americans have. The \nadvantage works with coordinating care, prevention of illness and \ndisease. That is why people want to be in that program. But now the \nPresident is eliminating it.\n  My colleague from Florida talked about the 15 million people dumped \nonto Medicaid, and the New York Times reports that as Medicaid payments \nshrink, patients and doctors drop out. The President is not only \ndumping on 15 million through the health care bill, with the bill we \nare discussing right now, the reconciliation bill, it also adds another \nmillion people to those rolls dumped into Medicaid.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So perhaps the worst fraud being perpetrated in this \nentire legislation is the doc fix. No one who is an expert on health \ncare believes we are going to cut physicians' payments for treatment of \nMedicare enrollees by 21 percent. No one. Yet that is calculated in so \nthere can be this phony actual reduction in the deficit.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. And for the ginned-up numbers we have been presented by \nthe Democrats to work where they say we have actually helped lower the \ndeficit, for it to work, in the next couple of months they would have \nto cut doctors' fees for all of the Medicare patients they take care of \nby 21 percent and then keep those fees frozen at that low level for the \nnext 10 years. Now, is that going to happen? But if it doesn't happen--\nand I ask the accountant from Wyoming as opposed to the surgeon from \nWyoming--from an accounting standpoint, can you do that?\n  Mr. ENZI. The Senator from Wyoming not only is correct that we are \ngoing to have a huge problem, but something that is new in the \nreconciliation bill besides this 21 percent that, of course, we are \ngoing to have to fix and that is going to cost us $300 billion--and all \nof the proposals so far have not paid for that proposal--they slipped \nin a little cliff in there for Medicaid this time, too, and in 2 years \nwe are going to drop off a cliff with Medicaid just the same way as \nMedicare. Does anybody believe we won't fix that? That is going to \ndrive up the deficits too.\n  Wasn't everybody promised catastrophic care as one of the \nPresidential promises? It kind of fascinates me that Medicare doesn't \nhave catastrophic care unless you buy Medicare Advantage, and then you \ncan have the catastrophic care. But we are trying to get rid of \nMedicare Advantage now and force all of those people into a different \nkind of insurance.\n  I appreciate the Senator from New Hampshire mentioning mandates. Yes,\n\n[[Page S1854]]\n\nthey are going to require you to have a lot more different kinds of \ninsurance than you might want to have. We are going to say: The Federal \nGovernment knows best, and this is the minimum insurance you can have, \nand you are going to have to buy it or we are going to put a mandate on \nyou--another mandate.\n  This is the mandate for what you have to get in health care, but \nthere is also going to be a mandate that says every single person has \nto buy insurance. There are a lot of people right now who make a good \nliving, who are healthy, who don't think they need insurance and won't \nbuy it. They will pay the penalty up until the time they have a \npreexisting condition, and then they will jump into the market and that \nwill drive up the price for everybody else.\n  So there is a whole lot of accounting finagling that is going on to \nmake different statements possible. But it is going to drive up the \npremiums, it is going to cause people to get more insurance than they \nwant to get, and it is going to cause everybody to have to get \ninsurance whether they want to or not.\n  In the history of the United States, we have never had the Federal \nGovernment tell anybody they had to buy something. We have set up \nsafety measures in their purchasing to protect them, but we haven't \nsaid you have to buy it. In this case, we are going to say you have to \nbuy it, and there are a whole bunch of people who say that is \nunconstitutional.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. If the Senator will yield on a point made by my friend \nfrom Wyoming, isn't it amazing that the Federal Government is going to \npenalize--send an IRS agent to tax you if you don't buy health \ninsurance, if you fail to take it out. Has the Federal Government ever, \nin the history of our country, penalized a person for failing to \nact? That is why we have these folks around the country who are experts \nin the Constitution, folks such as my attorney general in Florida, Bill \nMcCollum, who is going to bring a lawsuit against this bill because the \ncommerce clause has never been interpreted to say your failure to do \nsomething is in the realm of Congress. Imagine this, if you can say to \nsomebody: Your failure to purchase health insurance is within the role \nof the Federal Government. Why can't the Federal Government say you \nhave to go to the gym or you have to eat your broccoli? What can the \nFederal Government not do if it can do this? It is beyond the Framers' \nintention. It is beyond any of the Supreme Court law.\n\n  When you think about our relationship to our government, we are \nsupposed to have the rights. Our Declaration of Independence says we \nhave the rights and we give them up to the government. The government \nis with the consent of the governed. But in this situation, it seems \nthe Democrats believe the government knows best.\n  I wish to make one other point about this cost issue. In the last 10 \nyears, health insurance has gone up 130 percent. The reason why this \nbill will not control the cost of health care is because it takes the \nconsumer out and keeps the consumer out of the equation. The consumer \nhas no motivation to reduce the cost of health care.\n  We did not do the tax credit idea that the Senator from Wyoming \nmentioned, which would put the consumer back in the game, make the \nconsumer conscious of prices, and make a competitive environment that \nwould actually reduce health care costs.\n  I wonder if my colleague and friend from Wyoming might speak to that \npoint because I know he was very much involved as author of this idea \nof giving us tax breaks.\n  Mr. ENZI. I appreciate the Senator from Arizona bringing that up \nbecause when he mentioned tax credits in his campaign, he was chastised \nby now-President Obama, saying that cannot happen, that is terrible. \nYou will find that slipped into the bill anyway. So far, it just \ncatches the top insurance people. They are going to be taxed--no, they \nare not going to be taxed because it is shoved in as a hidden tax, so \nit does not expose they are actually doing what the Senator from \nArizona was suggesting. It is going to be a hidden tax the company is \ngoing to have to pay, but the company is going to take it out on the \nemployee. It is another way they are going to tax and tax, raise prices \nor lower benefits.\n  The price on insurance is going to go up because right now the \ninsurance companies are trying to protect themselves. On the one hand, \nthey have been protected a lot in this bill. We are accused of helping \nout the insurance companies, but take a look at some of the stuff that \nhelps out the insurance companies with the individual mandates, the \nemployer mandates and those things. At the same time, they are being \nthreatened that they are going to be price fixing.\n  I was in the shoe business with my wife. When we first went into the \nshoe business, Nixon was talking about fixing prices. In response, the \ncompanies immediately raised the price of shoes 50 percent, and then \nevery time they were allowed to raise the price again, they did. Within \n1 year, shoes cost twice as much as before. That is what happens when \ngovernment interferes. This is government interference. It is going to \ncause premiums to go up and prices to go up.\n  The other side says: Don't worry about it, there are subsidies. From \nwhere are the subsidies coming? Oh, yes, we are going to take $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion from Medicare and put it in new programs which are subsidies, \nand besides that, we are going to come up with $\\1/2\\ trillion in taxes \nand that is going to go for the new subsidies. Does anybody in America \nbelieve you can put in new programs at a cost of $1 trillion and it is \nnot going to cost any of us a dime? Of course not. The seniors know it \nand the people who will be paying the premiums are going to know it and \nthe companies are all going to know it.\n  Whom are they going to be mad at? They are not going to be mad at \nRepublicans because not a one of us voted for it. On this \nreconciliation bill, I don't think they are going to be mad at us on it \neither. They can see what is happening. Premiums are going to go up, \njust as the other Senator from Wyoming mentioned.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3582\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. If I may interject, that is why I have an amendment at \nthe desk that deals with this specific aspect in the bill that is going \nto cause premiums to go up higher, in my opinion, than if nothing were \ndone at all. If that actually happens because the President and the \nDemocrats have promised something different, then we ought to sunset \nthe entire bill. With that, I call up the amendment that is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that once the time on the \nBarrasso amendment expires----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana does not have the \nfloor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Can the Senator from Montana ask unanimous consent for \nthe floor?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming has the floor. There \nis a unanimous consent request pending to offer an amendment. Is there \nobjection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Reserving the right to object, will the Senator agree to \nmodify as follows: that once the time on his amendment expires, the \namendment be set aside until a time to be determined by the leaders.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator so modify his request?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. No objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Wyoming [Mr. Barrasso] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3582.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To ensure that Americans can keep the coverage they have by \n                      keeping premiums affordable)\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title II, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 2__. AFFORDABLE PREMIUMS AND COVERAGE.\n\n       The implementation of the Patient Protection and Affordable \n     Care Act (and the amendments made by such Act) shall be \n     conditioned on the Secretary of Health and\n\n[[Page S1855]]\n\n     Human Services certifying to Congress that the implementation \n     of such Act (and amendments) would not increase premiums more \n     than the premium increases projected prior to the date of \n     enactment of such Act.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 7\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, we have a number of colleagues on the \nfloor, and we believe absolutely this amendment is critical because it \ngoes specifically to the heart of the promises that have been made to \nthe people of our home States and the people of the country.\n  The promise made to the 85 percent of Americans who have coverage \nthey like is that their costs would actually go down. But yet as I \ntravel around my State and around the country, I see people are very \nworried that this bill that cuts Medicare for our seniors, raises taxes \non all is loaded with sweetheart deals, is going to cause their health \ninsurance premiums to go up at a time when they believe the quality of \ntheir care will go down.\n  Mr. GREGG. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Yes.\n  Mr. GREGG. I wish to make one point I hope is obvious to everyone. \nThis amendment simply says that if the premiums rise faster than what \nthey would under current law, then the bill will not go into effect. \nIsn't that what it says?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. That is exactly what it says.\n  Mr. GREGG. It is basically reinforcing what the other side of the \naisle claims and what the President claims. Why should there be any \nopposition to something that basically puts into place the language \nwhich enforces what the President has claimed he is doing and what the \nother side of the aisle is claiming they are doing? Can the Senator \nfrom Wyoming think of why there would be opposition to this amendment?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It should be unanimously accepted, with all sides \nagreeing because that is what the promise was to the American people \nwhen this bill was brought forth and when the President first addressed \nthe Nation, that he wants to get the cost curve down, the cost of \ninsurance down to $2,500 per American family. We just want to hold \nfolks to the promises that have been made to the American people.\n  The American people have spoken overwhelmingly and loudly in \nopposition to the bill that has come out from behind closed doors for \nthem to finally see and try to understand all the machinations and \nmaneuvers. They ultimately looked at it and in overwhelming numbers \nsaid: We don't want this for ourselves, for our families, for our \nneighbors or for our country. Yet it was crammed down the throats of \nthe American people.\n  I bring up this amendment tonight to say that I wish to hold those \nwho voted for this bill to the promises they made to the American \npeople. If, in fact, insurance premiums go up faster because this bill \nhas become law than they would have gone up without this bill, then the \nlaw is no longer in effect.\n  As I look to colleagues from other States, I imagine this is what you \nhear in Florida when you head home for the weekend: What have we been \npromised? What are we going to get? How are we going to hold people to \nthe promises made?\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I thank my good friend and doctor for bringing up that \npoint. My constituents in Florida say we care about the rising cost of \nhealth insurance, so I think the Senator's amendment is exactly on \npoint.\n  If this bill makes the situation worse, it should not go into effect. \nWhy would any of the 100 of us not support the Senator's amendment if \nwe are not going to control the cost of health insurance? That is what \nwe are supposed to be about. That was supposed to be the No. 1 goal.\n  It is a great amendment. I certainly will support it. I hope all our \ncolleagues do. I think the challenge to our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle is I know they do not want to take any of our \namendments. I know they just want to cram this through and get it done \nso it does not have to go back to the House of Representatives. But the \nduty of our friends on the other side of the aisle is as always, as it \nis our duty, to enact good laws and make things better.\n  If there is an amendment such as this one that is good for the \nAmerican people, it is their duty, I respectfully suggest, to vote in \nfavor of it, even if it has to be sent back to the House of \nRepresentatives. Because when we go home to our constituents, they are \ngoing to ask us: Did you lower the cost of health insurance?\n  I am going to have to go home to more than 3 million Floridians on \nMedicare who continue to question me and say: Why are they taking $\\1/\n2\\ trillion out of our Medicare? Why is there now $200 billion coming \nout of the Medicare Advantage? Over the next 12, 24, 36 months, I am \nnot going to enjoy the conversations with my constituents, even after \nmy time in the Senate is through, who come to me and say: Why can't I \ngo to Medicare Advantage anymore? Why did they shut down that program? \nWhy can't I keep the health insurance the President told me I could \nkeep? Why did my employer drop me?\n  The estimate is that 33 percent of folks on Medicare Advantage by \n2015--this is Rick Foster saying this--are going to lose it. We have \nmore than 1 million people on Medicare Advantage in Florida--more than \n1 million. These are going to be tough questions to answer.\n  I applaud my colleague, the good doctor, for bringing this forward. \nIt is exactly the right thing to do. I hope our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle will have the courage to accept these amendments that \nare in the best interests of the people of the country.\n  Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, we continue tonight to bring forth to \nthe American people our concerns about a bill that I believe from my \nyears of practice in medicine, taking care of families in Wyoming, and \nnow as a Senator for the last several years, is going to be bad for \npatients, it is going to be bad for providers, the nurses and the \nphysicians who take care of those patients, and it is going to be bad \nfor payers, people who pay for their health insurance, people who pay \ntaxes in this country, the taxpayers of this country as a bill \ncontinues down the road which is going to contribute to the debt, \ncontribute to the deficit and, as I hear, week after week at home in \ntelephone and townhall meetings, the debt is the threat.\n  Our spending at this point is unsustainable. It is irreversible. It \nis irresponsible. I bring this up to say we cannot pass bills in the \nSenate and have them signed into law which promise one thing and do \nsomething very different--promises to help people and ends up hurting \nour Nation, hurting our economy, hurting our jobs, hurting the \nopportunity to hire more people with mandates, hurt young people who \nare trying to buy insurance because their rates are going to go up.\n  This is a bill that is going to cost all of America in ways in the \ndecades to come that, from a financial standpoint as well as a health \nstandpoint, are going to be detrimental to our Nation.\n  I say with my colleagues on the floor, please, take a very serious \nand close look at this amendment because the American people should not \nbe promised one thing during a campaign and during a bill being written \nand then when it comes into law, they are going to see something very \ndifferent, which is going to be detrimental to them, much more \nexpensive for them, for their families, and impact on the kind of care \nthey want for themselves and their families. That is why when I have \ntownhall meetings in Wyoming and other States and people raise their \nhand, they think the cost of their own care is going to go up and the \nquality of the care is going to go down.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we have an \nadditional hour available, one-half hour each side, as has been the \npractice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Washington, Mrs. \nMurray, off the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, throughout this debate, I have come to\n\n[[Page S1856]]\n\nthe floor to share the stories of families and small business owners \nfrom my home State of Washington who were suffering under our broken \nhealth care system.\n  I talked about Washington State small business owners, from Kitsap \nand Kennewick--good people who wanted to cover their employees but who \ncould not afford to continue to pay the skyrocketing premiums. I spoke \nabout mothers and fathers in Seattle and Spokane, grandmothers and \ngrandfathers east of the Cascades and the west--men and women from \nevery part of my State, some barely holding on to their health \ninsurance and some with no coverage at all.\n  I told the stories of so many people from so many different \nbackgrounds, but each one of them shared a common thread: the health \ncare system we have today didn't work for them. It failed our families \none way or another over and over again.\n  I have received well over 10,000 letters from Washington State \nresidents, and too many of them share that theme: stories of coverage \ndropped when they needed it most, premiums going up at rates of 20 or \n30 or 40 percent, seniors struggling after falling into the doughnut \nhole. Terrible stories--stories of loved ones who were lost, of \nchildren and patients, brothers and sisters, stories about what they \nhad to go through before they passed away--battling insurance \ncompanies, losing their coverage, fighting for their care, never giving \nup but fighting against powers too great for them to bear.\n  That is why I have fought so hard to reform our broken health \ninsurance system--to fight for our families who need help, to level the \nplaying field for people who just need a little support--for families \nwith real struggles and real problems that we can work together to \nhelp. And that is why I am so proud to stand here today and say to \nthose families, and so many others, that although we have not fixed \neverything that is wrong with our health care system overnight, we have \ntaken a real step forward for people across my home State of Washington \nand across America.\n  Today, when President Obama signed health insurance into law, a \nnumber of significant improvements kicked in, and some of the worst \npractices of those insurance companies were tossed into the dustbin of \nhistory. Great changes went into effect immediately for families and \nsmall business owners, for children and seniors in Washington State and \nacross the country.\n  Now that this bill is signed into law, if you ever worried about \nlosing your coverage when you or a family member got sick, you don't \nhave to worry anymore. It is no longer allowed. Now that this bill is \nsigned into law, no family ever has to worry about the unreasonable and \nunfair lifetime caps on coverage that we have seen from insurance \ncompanies in the past. Now that this bill has been signed into law, \nnever again will families have to fight for the preventive services \nthey paid for and they deserve--families such as the Labrums, from Port \nOrchard, WA. Joseph Labrum sent a letter to me about his wife who went \nto her doctor complaining of pain in her breast. A mammogram failed to \nshow anything, but she personally wasn't convinced. She knew something \nwasn't right and she knew there was a history of breast cancer in her \nfamily. So she asked for an MRI, but her doctor told her that her \ninsurance company wouldn't pay for it, and she just couldn't pay for it \non her own. After 3 years of fighting with her insurance company, 3 \nyears of pain and uncertainty, she was finally able to convince them to \ntake that test. By that time, her cancer had grown to 8 centimeters and \nrequired a full mastectomy, chemotherapy, and 8 weeks of radiation.\n  Joseph told me that he is convinced if his wife's care had been up to \nher doctor and not her insurance company she would have been cured with \na minor lumpectomy and wouldn't have had to go through so much pain and \nsuffering.\n  The bill President Obama signed into law today makes sure that \nstarting today insurance companies will be required to cover preventive \nservices with little or no cost on the part of Washington State \npatients. Starting today, Washington State families will have access to \nnew streamlined assistance to help them appeal services that have been \ndenied or not covered adequately by their insurance companies. This is \ngoing to help anyone who has ever felt buried under a blizzard of forms \nand denials, and it will start helping our families right away.\n  For small business owners, starting today, the health insurance \nmarket will begin working better for them. Starting today, people such \nas Mark Peters, the owner of a small technology company in Port \nTownsend, WA, will be able to better afford care for his employees. \nMonths ago, Mark wrote to tell me that he offers insurance to his \nemployees. He does the right thing. But last year, he got a letter from \nhis insurance company raising rates by 25 percent. Mark told me his \nsmall business can't sustain increases like that. No business today \ncan.\n  In our current health insurance system, small businesses are often at \nthe mercy of the insurance company. They lack the leverage, they lack \nthe negotiating power of larger firms, and they can't afford to hire a \nhuman resource department to spends days fighting and haggling for \nbetter rates. But those days are coming to an end. Starting today, \nthanks to the bill President Obama signed, small business owners such \nas Mark will immediately qualify for the first phase of a tax credit \nprogram to help them purchase insurance for their families and for \ntheir employees. That credit that will kick in immediately is up to 35 \npercent of the employer's contribution to coverage, which is going to \nmake a huge difference for almost 100,000 small business owners in my \nState of Washington right away.\n  Starting today, if you are a young person or a senior citizen, you \nwill also be helped immediately. Over 159,000 Washington State seniors \nwho fall into that doughnut hole are going to have their brand-name \nprescription drug costs cut in half starting right away. The law that \npassed begins to close this destructive coverage gap, and the bill we \nare discussing today finishes the job and closes that doughnut hole \nonce and for all.\n  Starting today, insurance companies are going to be required to \npermit young people to stay on family policies until the age of 26, \nwhich is especially important, I must say, now that so many young \npeople are having trouble finding that first job. Again, real help for \nreal people right away. That is why I supported this law, and that is \nwhy I fought so hard to get it.\n  We have been talking about reforming the health insurance system for \na long time. Many leaders in this country have tried to fix this broken \nsystem. Each of them has failed. But today, thanks to the bill \nPresident Obama signed, we begin the move toward real reform--reform \nthat will help families such as the Labrums and small business owners \nsuch as Mark Peters, and seniors and young people in Washington State \nand across the entire country; reform that will help people \nimmediately, starting today, and that will move our families one step \ncloser to lower premiums, more choices, and, at long last, the health \ncare security and stability Americans deserve.\n  Starting today, things are looking brighter for millions of Americans \nwho have waited far too long for the help they need and deserve.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from New \nJersey, Mr. Menendez.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe Finance Committee for his work on this bill and the bill the \nPresident signed earlier today.\n  Mr. President, the time has come--historic health care has passed \nthis Congress, the President has signed it into law, and the American \npeople will live healthier, safer, more secure lives because of it. Now \nwe come to the floor again, called upon once more, to finalize this \nhistoric legislation and make it even better. Once again I ask my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle to take their place on the \nright side of history and end the obstructionism, stop the fear \nmongering, the apocalyptic predictions, and think about what they are \nabout to do through the long lens of history.\n\n[[Page S1857]]\n\n  Think of the legacy you want to leave. Think of your grandchildren. \nThink of all those who will look back a generation from now, maybe two \ngenerations, as we did with Social Security and Medicare, the Civil \nRights Act, the Voting Rights Act, and ask: How did you vote? Think of \nwhat you will say then, and think of what you will tell your children \nand your grandchildren.\n  Will you look them in the eye and say you stood up for our families \nagainst the big insurance companies and voted for one of the greatest \npieces of reform legislation in history? That is exactly what this bill \nwill do. It will change the lives of millions of Americans, just as \nSocial Security and Medicare changed the lives of Americans, and thank \nGod they did. Those two pieces of legislation defined who we are as a \npeople and the strength of the American community, each of us working \nfor the betterment of all of us. It is our obligation, it is our duty, \nit is our call to history to leave a legacy of hope and health security \nfor every American family.\n\n  Now, there are those who stood steadfast against Social Security at a \ntime when millions of seniors were facing ruin in this country--when \nold women were selling apples on street corners, and seniors who had \nplayed by the rules and worked hard all their lives found themselves \nwith nothing and no health care at a time in life when they needed it \nthe most. The concept of Social Security and Medicare, as we know, was \na long time coming, but it was the right thing to do. It was a \nDemocratic proposal derided by those who used the same arguments then \nthat they are using today against this legislation: Beware, a \ngovernment takeover, socialism; the insurers will do the right thing.\n  Well, they have not. The difference between us then and now is that \nour friends on the other side of the aisle believe the business of \ngovernment is to protect big insurance companies. But we believe the \nbusiness of government is about our people--their lives, their hopes, \ntheir dreams for a better, safer, healthier, more secure life for \nthemselves and their families. This is the debate on the floor today, \njust as it was when we debated Social Security, Medicare, and every \nother major piece of historic legislation that benefitted people over \nbig business.\n  The health care needs of our families must prevail over what we see \non the floor still today--the delay, the obstructionism, the almost \nirrational fervor to stand in the way of change that is being driven by \ntalk shows and tea partiers in unacceptable outbursts of demeaning \nlanguage and behavior such as we saw on the steps of the Capitol this \npast weekend against an American hero such as John Lewis, which will be \njudged harshly by history.\n  Let us be clear: Republicans have said no for a century, and once \nagain we hear a resounding no to changing a broken system. I want to \nsay yes. I want to say yes to the people of New Jersey, and let that be \nour legacy to those we represent. I want to tell the 1.5 million people \nof New Jersey who are uninsured and the 326,000 who have individual \nmarket insurance that they will now have access to affordable health \ncare coverage.\n  I want to say to the 854,000 New Jerseyans that they will now qualify \nfor tax credits to purchase the health coverage they need and deserve.\n  I want to say yes to preventive services for 1.3 million seniors in \nNew Jersey who don't have those services today. I want to say yes to \nthe 227,000 seniors in my State who will finally have their drug costs \nunder the Medicare Part D doughnut hole covered over time.\n  I want to say yes to the tax credits for 107,000 New Jersey small \nbusinesses that will be eligible for tax credits to offset their \npremium costs.\n  I want to say yes to $14 billion in tax credits and cost-sharing tax \ncredits for New Jerseyans to purchase private health insurance, many \nfor the first time.\n  I want to say yes to an estimated $9 billion more for Medicaid that \nNew Jersey would receive in this reconciliation bill, which is $580 \nmillion more than the original Senate-passed version.\n  I want to stand and say yes to basic commonsense protections that \nstop insurance companies from making health care about the bottom line \nand not the lives of people.\n  I want to say yes to stopping insurers from denying coverage for \npreexisting conditions--something that you have no control over, \nsomething that happened to you in your health and now stops you from \ngetting health insurance.\n  I want to say yes to stopping companies from canceling policies when \npeople get sick.\n  I want to say yes to ending lifetime limits on coverage.\n  I want to say yes to all of that and leave a legacy of hope to all \nthe families who would benefit from this legislation. Yet it seems the \nonly answer we get from those who have been against this legislation \nfrom the beginning is, let's start over. But we are not starting over. \nIt is the law of the land now.\n  Not only do they want to say no to it, well, they want to repeal it. \nThey want to repeal all of those things. They want to take away those \nrights that now exist for all Americans as a result of the President's \nsignature. They want to take that away from you. The fact is, hard as \nit may be for some to realize or accept, Americans voted for change in \ntheir lives, change so that they would not have all of these obstacles \nto the health care of their families and themselves, and that is the \nchange that is being delivered.\n  Affordable, accessible health care is now the law of the land, and \nthis reconciliation bill makes it even fairer and more affordable for \nmiddle-class families. It helps seniors, protects consumers, it \neliminates waste and fraud, and it further reduces our national \ndeficit. This bill will eliminate special deals no matter how many \ntimes we hear bumper sticker slogans shouted from those who see health \ncare reform in terms of their own political future rather than what is \nright for America. It makes health care insurance accessible to low- \nand moderate-income families who never thought they would be able to \nafford health care for themselves and their children.\n  It extends the prohibition on dropping people when they get sick and \nthey need it the most and the requirement to provide coverage for \nnondependent children up to their 26th birthday, starting 6 months \nafter enactment.\n  It attacks waste and fraud in Medicare and Medicaid by cracking down \non abusive billing practices for hospitalization services, and it \nstrengthens Medicare prepayment reviews to reduce abuses in the system \nand therefore help build the system.\n  The time has come once again to be counted. The time has come to take \na historic vote once again, to take our place before the lens of \nhistory as our predecessors did on Social Security and Medicare and \nthink of what we will tell our grandchildren. History will judge whose \nside you were on and the legacy we will leave. Voting yes gives young \npeople, such as 24-year-old Christopher Joyce of Old Bridge, NJ, who \nhad no insurance from work and suffered a massive stroke in January \nthat left him paralyzed, barely able to speak, an opportunity to be on \ntheir family's policy instead of leaving the family on the verge of \nlosing their home.\n  Vote yes and never again will a mother and father in America awaken \nin the middle of the night with a sick child and look at each other \nknowing they cannot afford the medical care their child needs.\n  Vote yes and never again will a man, woman or child in America be \ndiscriminated against because they are sick or once had something an \ninsurance executive decided was a disqualifying preexisting condition.\n  Vote yes and never again will an insurance executive be able to make \nmedical decisions instead of a doctor to manage risk for shareholders \nand hold the bottom line above the lives of people.\n  Vote yes and Christopher Joyce would have the health insurance he \nneeded to save his family's home.\n  Vote yes and we will change things for the better for every American \nfamily. That is what this bill is all about. It is about a legacy of \nhope and opportunity and health care security and that is why I will be \ncasting a ``yes'' vote on reconciliation.\n  I yield the remainder of any time I have and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown of Ohio). The senior Senator from \nMontana is recognized.\n\n[[Page S1858]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Maryland off the \nbill.\n  Mr. CARDIN. I thank the Senator for his incredible leadership in our \nsuccessful completion of health insurance and health care reform. This \nwas a special day, to be with the President of the of the United States \nwhen he signed into law the law with which the United States will \nfinally join every other industrialized nation in the world in \nproviding universal health insurance coverage, universal access to \nhealth care.\n  The best news is, we can improve it. We can improve that legislation \nwith the bill that is currently before us. With this bill and the bill \nthe President signed, 32 million Americans who currently do not have \nhealth insurance will be insured; 95 percent of Americans under the age \nof 65 will have health insurance. The good news is, we do this by \nreducing the Federal budget deficit which we need to do. We all know we \nneed to do that--$100 billion over the next 10 years, over $1 trillion \nover the next 20 years.\n  It provides immediate help to small businesses and individuals so \npeople can get insured immediately. For small businesses, if you are \nunder 25 employees, you can get help; 10 or under you can get a tax \ncredit this year, up to 35 percent of the premiums for covering your \nemployees. Then, when the health exchanges come into effect, small \ncompanies can get credits up to 50 percent of the premiums they pay.\n  It provides immediate help for our seniors. I can't tell you how many \nseniors have talked to me about the dilemma of filling their \nprescriptions or paying their food bills or cutting pills in half. This \nyear, with the bill the President signed, with the improvements we make \nto the underlying bill today, seniors will receive a $250 check to help \ncover the prescription drug costs if they fall within the doughnut \nhole. Under the bills, we completely eliminate, over time, the so-\ncalled doughnut hole seniors fall into and have to pay 100 percent of \ntheir prescription drug costs. That will be gone.\n  Under this legislation, there will be immediate help for individuals \nwho have preexisting conditions to go into a community-based risk pool \nso they can get affordable health care now as a result of the passage \nof these bills. Under this legislation, we take on the abusive \npractices of private insurance companies. Effective within 6 months of \nenactment, no further discrimination against children with preexisting \nconditions; extending coverage for young people up to the age of their \n26th birthday; ending the rescission of a health insurance policy \nbecause a person gets sick; banning lifetime limits on your insurance \nprotection and starting down the path of restricting eliminating annual \nlimits that are unreasonable. All that is included in the legislation \nwe are talking about, providing immediate help to American families to \nfind affordable health care.\n  Then we add also access to emergency care. I am particularly pleased \nwith these provisions because these were additions, amendments I \noffered to extend this to emergency care, so insurance companies cannot \ndeny you coverage for going to an emergency room if you had the \nsymptoms where a prudent layperson should go to the emergency room, \nwhere you can pick your own primary care physician, where you can take \nan independent appeal from a decision of an insurance company that is \ncontrary to what you believe is right.\n  Then, starting in 2011, we start telling insurance companies there is \na limit as to how much they can take from your insurance premiums and \nuse for their bureaucratic administrative costs or profits, that they \nhave to put the money back into benefits for you, between 80 and 85 \npercent. If they do not, you get a refund, a rebate from your insurance \ncompany because they have taken too much in premiums from you. That is \nall in this legislation.\n  We build upon the community health centers. I particularly wish to \nthank Senator Sanders for his leadership. Community health centers are \ncritical to access to care. That is in this bill and it takes effect \nimmediately. These are important changes.\n  I am also very pleased about the provisions added to this bill in an \namendment I offered for minority health that will set up in the \nDepartment of Health and NIH a division of minority health so we can \nstart to deal with the disparity in health care in America in a more \naggressive way, in a more continuous way, so we can truly provide equal \naccess to health care for all Americans.\n  The bill the President signed was great. This bill improves upon \nthat. I urge my colleagues, let's take pride in what we were able to do \ncollectively, let's improve it with the bill that is before us. It will \nhelp our seniors with prescription drugs, it will reduce the deficit \nfurther, make health insurance more affordable, and it will help our \nStates in payment of Medicaid. I urge my colleagues to support the \nlegislation and with that I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired. The \nsenior Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. CARPER. How much time do we have on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 6 minutes 5 seconds.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I would like to take a few minutes, before \nour Republican colleagues return to the floor, to talk about some \nprovisions in the legislation the President signed today that are not \nvery well understood but I think could be of real help in reining in \nthe growth of health care costs. I have said all along--a number of my \ncolleagues have heard me say this before--it is all well and good we \nwant to extend coverage to people who don't have it. There are way too \nmany people who do not have it. But if all we do is extend coverage \nwithout reining in the growth of costs, we will not do it for very \nlong.\n  Among the provisions that I think are especially noteworthy--one, if \na person turns 65 next month and they become eligible for Medicare, \nthey are offered, under current law, at least before today's signing of \nthe bill, the opportunity to get a once-in-a-lifetime deal, an annual \nphysical. Under the law of the land until today, that was it. Under \nMedicare, if they live to be 105, they would not get another physical \npaid for by Medicare.\n  I have been getting annual physicals as a naval flight officer, and \nnaval midshipman before that, for 27 years in all. I have had a lot of \nannual physicals. I think one of the reasons I am a fairly healthy guy \nis because of that and the feedback from annual physicals. We have a \nlot of people who never got an annual physical and one of the reasons \nwhy is it is not covered under your health insurance coverage. Under \nthe legislation the President signed today, if a person turns 65 and \nbecomes part of Medicare, they get an annual physical; in the next \nyear, another one; in the year after that, if they live to 75 or 85 or \n95 or, God bless them, 105, they will get a lot of annual physicals. I \nthink that has the potential for addressing one of the real \nshortcomings in our health care system in this country. We don't do a \nvery good job in primary care and part of primary care is, frankly, \nphysicals from time to time. We are going to address that.\n  Another provision in the legislation that has not gotten a whole lot \nof attention--some but not a lot--is what can we do to incentivize \npeople to take better care of themselves. It is all well and good that \nwe want doctors to get more and nurses and hospitals, and so forth, and \ngo after insurance companies, but what are we doing to incentivize \npeople to take better care of themselves? If you look at a lot of \ncountries where people have better health care than we do, one of the \nreasons is they take better care of themselves.\n  Something that has always fascinated me is, how do we figure out how \nto harness market forces for the delivery of health care? How do we \nharness market forces and incentives to drive good public policy \nbehavior? We know it is not good for people to be overweight. How can \nwe encourage them to lose weight? One of the things in the underlying \nbill is a provision that says, I think starting next year, we are going \nto have a provision requiring menu labeling. What do you mean by menu \nlabeling? If you happen to be a restaurant company with 20 or more \nrestaurants around--if you have a restaurant company and have \nrestaurants in 20 or more sites around the country, you have to start, \nnext year, putting on the menu board in the restaurant how many \ncalories are in the items they serve. If they have a menu, you have to \nput it on the menu, how\n\n[[Page S1859]]\n\nmany calories they serve. It doesn't mean people will not go in and \norder 3 or 4,000 calories to consume, but people are going to start \nthinking about it. It will be a reminder.\n  Another provision in the legislation that I think is especially \nnoteworthy is to build on something already in the current law but to \nmake it, I think, stronger. We all know people who needed to lose \nweight and they go on a diet and join a gym or something. They stop. \nThey start. They stop. They exercise for a while, go on a diet and then \nfall off the wagon and go back to their old habits. You know people \nstop smoking and they do it for a while and then they start stealing \ncigarettes from people and eventually they go back full time. What we \nare trying to do with our legislation is to say: Look, if companies \nhave employees, they know they are overweight, they want to encourage \nthem to lose weight, let them offer a premium discount.\n  In the legislation, the President said today employers can offer \npremium discounts of as much as 30 percent for their employees for whom \nthey are providing health insurance. If they are overweight, if they \nare losing weight and keep it off, if they are smoking and stop smoking \nand continue to stop smoking, if they have high cholesterol or high \nblood pressure and they can control those and continue to control \nthose, they can get premium discounts of as much as 30 percent. \nEverybody in this Chamber today, we all know people who have tried to \nlose weight, lose it for a while and then go back the other way. We \nknow people who try to stop smoking, they do it for a while and then \nthey go back. What our legislation does is say we want to put more \nmoney back in the pockets of people who do what is the right thing for \nthem to do for their own personal health, and by doing that, they \nactually bring down the health care costs of their group, the place \nwherever they are working. I think those are ideas that make pretty \ngood sense.\n  Let me ask the Presiding Officer how much time is left on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware has 50 seconds.\n  Mr. CARPER. Fifty seconds? The last thing I want to mention is our \nPresiding Officer is from Ohio. He has been to Cleveland many times. I \nspent some time in Ohio as well. One of my return visits to Ohio last \nyear was to go back to the Cleveland Clinic to see how they are able to \nprovide better health care for less money than a whole lot of other \nhealth care delivery systems. It is because they and the Mayo Clinic \nand Geisinger and others focus on the same kind of model, better focus \non primary care, focus on prevention. All those patients have \nelectronic health records. All the docs are salaried employees. They \ndon't get more money if they do more tests or more MRIs or more this or \nthat. It is a better model. What we do in our legislation signed by the \nPresident today is we incentivize a lot of other folks providing health \ncare to use the same models.\n  With that, my time has expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator from Delaware has \nexpired. The senior Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask the pending amendment be set \naside, if that is necessary.\n  Mr. CARPER. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. CARPER. We just request to see a copy.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I will discuss the amendment while that is going on.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 3564\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. First of all, if the amendment can be called up, it is \n3564. I would like to have Senator Roberts added as a cosponsor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I worked for years to pass what is \ncalled the Congressional Accountability Act, which was signed into law \nby President Clinton in 1995. I worked so hard to get that bill passed \nbecause I strongly believe that Congress should live under the same \nlaws it passes for the rest of the country.\n  If you remember, prior to 1995 Congress had exempted itself from 12 \ndifferent pieces of legislation, starting with the Fair Labor Standards \nAct of 1938. Now, of course, we in Congress, as employers, have to live \nby the same laws as the ABC Company of Des Moines, IA, as an example. \nSo the same principle applies to some parts of this bill.\n  That is why I offered an amendment during Finance Committee markup to \nrequire that Members of Congress and congressional staff get their \nemployer-based health insurance through the same exchanges as our \nconstituents. Part of that original amendment that I got adopted back \nthen is in the bill the President signed today. And that amendment was \nadopted without objection, let me say, so it had consensus support. I \nam hoping the majority will support a similar amendment for the \nPresident, the Vice President, senior White House staff, political \nappointees from the Cabinet and sub-Cabinet, but, of course, not civil \nservants within the executive branch of government.\n  Also, my amendment would close a loophole that was added behind \nclosed doors--meaning the closed doors of the majority leader's office, \nSenator Reid, during the time that he was merging the Finance and HELP \nCommittee bills. That loophole would exempt staff from committee and \nleadership offices from being required to use the exchanges even though \nindividual offices of individual Senators and their staffs and the \nSenators would still be covered.\n  Now, you know, it takes a lot of chutzpa behind closed doors to say: \nWell, you know, it is okay for the Members' offices and the Members' \nstaff and the individual Senator, but it is not okay for committee \nstaff, it is not okay for leadership staff. Somehow, they are a heck of \na lot better than the rest of us. So it would also bring that back to a \nlevel playing field for everybody here on Capitol Hill because most of \nour constituents would find it pretty unbelievable that the President, \nhis closest advisers, and some staff remain untouched by the reforms \nthey pushed for the rest of the country.\n  To put it simply, President Obama's health care reform will not apply \nto President Obama or other people, political appointees, within the \nexecutive branch. The message the White House, then, is sending to the \ngrassroots of America is that it is good enough for everybody else but \nnot for political appointees in the executive branch of government. So \nis it really any wonder, then, why most Americans oppose this effort?\n  Last December, I tried to correct the inequity that I talked about of \nleadership staff and committee staff, but the effort to apply any new \nlaw to the administration was objected to by the Senate majority leader \nat that particular time. In other words, I didn't get a chance to get a \nvote on it. But there is no justification for such a double standard. \nThat is blatantly wrong. It is only fair and logical that top \nadministration officials who fought so hard for passage of this \noverhaul of America's health care system experience it themselves. If \nit is as good as promised, they will know firsthand. If there are \nproblems, they will be able to really understand those problems, as \nthey should, just as the Congressional Accountability Act teaches each \nof us Senators, who have to live under the same laws as the rest of the \ncountry, that somehow we have to experience them, and then we know what \nit takes for small businesses to live by the civil rights laws, the \nwage and hour laws--I can't remember all 12 laws that we exempted \nourselves from that we are not now exempted from.\n  We need to understand grassroots America. What is wrong with \nWashington is it is an island surrounded by reality, and we have to \nbring some of the common sense of the rest of the country inside here \nwhere we work all the time because the only business in Washington is \ngovernment, and everybody in government is in the way. Everybody \noutside of Washington is pulling that way. And we have to make sure \nthat the people in the wagon at least understand the problems of those \npulling the wagon, and I think this will be one way to do it.\n  I ask unanimous consent request that the pending amendment be set \naside so that can I offer amendment No. 3564, the amendment I just \ntalked about.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n\n[[Page S1860]]\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Reserving the right to object, would the Senator modify \nhis unanimous consent request to provide that once all time has been \nused on the Grassley amendment, the amendment be set aside until a time \ndesignated by the leader?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator from Iowa so modify his \nrequest?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am fine with that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Iowa [Mr. Grassley], for himself and Mr. \n     Roberts, proposes an amendment numbered 3564.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To make sure the President, Cabinet Members, all White House \n   Senior staff and Congressional Committee and Leadership Staff are \n  purchasing health insurance through the health insurance exchanges \n     established by the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act)\n\n       At the end of subtitle A of title I, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 1006. PARTICIPATION OF PRESIDENT, VICE PRESIDENT, \n                   MEMBERS OF CONGRESS, POLITICAL APPOINTEES, AND \n                   CONGRESSIONAL STAFF IN THE EXCHANGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1312(d)(3)(D) of the Patient \n     Protection and Affordable Care Act is amended to read as \n     follows:\n       ``(D) President, vice president, members of congress, \n     political appointees, and congressional staff in the \n     exchange.--\n       ``(i) In general.--Notwithstanding chapter 89 of title 5, \n     United States Code, or any provision of this title--\n\n       ``(I) the President, Vice President, each Member of \n     Congress, each political appointee, and each Congressional \n     employee shall be treated as a qualified individual entitled \n     to the right under this paragraph to enroll in a qualified \n     health plan in the individual market offered through an \n     Exchange in the State in which the individual resides; and\n       ``(II) any employer contribution under such chapter on \n     behalf of the President, Vice President, any Member of \n     Congress, any political appointee, and any Congressional \n     employee may be paid only to the issuer of a qualified health \n     plan in which the individual enrolled in through such \n     Exchange and not to the issuer of a plan offered through the \n     Federal employees health benefit program under such chapter.\n\n       ``(ii) Payments by federal government.--The Secretary, in \n     consultation with the Director of the Office of Personnel \n     Management, shall establish procedures under which--\n\n       ``(I) the employer contributions under such chapter on \n     behalf of the President, Vice President, and each political \n     appointee are determined and actuarially adjusted for age; \n     and\n       ``(II) the employer contributions may be made directly to \n     an Exchange for payment to an issuer.\n\n       ``(iii) Political appointee.--In this subparagraph, the \n     term `political appointee' means any individual who--\n\n       ``(I) is employed in a position described under sections \n     5312 through 5316 of title 5, United States Code, (relating \n     to the Executive Schedule);\n       ``(II) is a limited term appointee, limited emergency \n     appointee, or noncareer appointee in the Senior Executive \n     Service, as defined under paragraphs (5), (6), and (7), \n     respectively, of section 3132(a) of title 5, United States \n     Code; or\n       ``(III) is employed in a position in the executive branch \n     of the Government of a confidential or policy-determining \n     character under schedule C of subpart C of part 213 of title \n     5 of the Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n       ``(iv) Congressional employee.--In this subparagraph, the \n     term `Congressional employee' means an employee whose pay is \n     disbursed by the Secretary of the Senate or the Clerk of the \n     House of Representatives.''.\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendment made by this section \n     shall take effect as if included in the Patient Protection \n     and Affordable Care Act.\n\n  Mr. CARPER. Would the Senator yield for 30 seconds? One of the things \nSenator Grassley and I have endeavored to do in working on this \nlegislation in the Finance Committee is to try to figure out what works \nto rein in the growth of health care costs and improve outcomes.\n  Where we agree is on one of the best ideas that is in our bill--the \nidea of large purchasing pools that we modeled after the Federal \nEmployees Health Benefits Plan. We know that we as Members and our \nstaff have to be part of the exchange. The idea is to create large \npurchasing pools in all of our States and even regional purchasing \npools as well.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Without a doubt.\n  Mr. CARPER. I am glad that provision has survived so far, and I hope \nit will go on. I wish we could implement it sooner.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I rise this evening in support of the Grassley \namendment, and I appreciate that my colleague has brought this forward. \nWe had an opportunity to discuss this months ago in the HELP Committee.\n  The fact is, the health care bill that is now law creates these State \nexchanges where all non-Medicaid and Medicare individuals will go to \npurchase their health insurance. And included in the exchanges are \nMembers of Congress and their personal staff, who are required to join \nthese exchanges in order to obtain their health care benefit.\n  But as the Senator from Iowa has mentioned, the rules that apply \nhere--the rule that came to my mind when we were discussing this is \nthis rule we were all taught as young children: Do unto others as you \nwould do unto yourself. Unfortunately, I think what we see with this \nnew health care law is that it fails to adhere to this rule.\n  So what you are going to have under this new law is every American \nwill have to be part of this new health care exchange. But who is going \nto be left out? Who is going to be excluded? Well, the law itself here \nis pretty clear in terms of the definitions. It says Members of \nCongress, congressional staff. Congressional staff means all full-time \nand part-time employees employed by the official office of a Member of \nCongress, whether in Washington, DC, or outside of Washington.\n  But let's think of whom it does not include. It does not include the \nPresident, it does not include Cabinet members, it does not include \nmembers of the White House senior staff, it does not include committee \nstaff that we may have. As the ranking member on the Energy Committee, \nI have committee staff for that. As the vice chair of the conference, I \nhave leadership staff. But neither my committee staff nor my leadership \nstaff would be covered under this new law. In other words, many of the \nchief architects of this health care law were apparently, very \nconveniently, omitted from any requirement of being within the health \nexchange.\n  So, again, whether it is the Cabinet members, the White House senior \nstaff, the committee members, the leadership staff, you have to ask the \nquestion, Why have they been left out of this? Why is there a double \nstandard? And if you are not asking that question, is it just a glaring \nomission or is there something else? Is this yet further evidence of \nwhat we are seeing that was done in the back rooms, the outcome of the \nlate nights, the backroom deals that certain staffers who might perhaps \nwork for the majority leader or certain staffers who work for the White \nHouse get to be treated differently than every other American out \nthere? I do not think that is what we intended here.\n  As I mentioned, during the HELP Committee markup, I supported an \namendment that was offered by Senator Coburn that most Democrats on the \ncommittee did not support. But it would require Members of Congress and \ntheir staffs to be included in the health care exchange. And the \nconversation that was had at the committee at that point in time, \ncertainly by Members on the Republican side, was: Hey, if it is good \nenough for my constituents, if it is good enough for the people of the \nState of Alaska, then it ought to be good enough for me, it ought to be \ngood enough for the President. But what we see is the President and the \nHouse and the Senate leadership offices who have pulled this bill \ntogether have conveniently left themselves out from being subjected to \nthis provision.\n  So I appreciate Senator Grassley bringing up this issue, pointing it \nout, pointing out that there are omissions. There are perhaps \nconvenient omissions. I am not one to say whether it has been \nconvenient or not, but it does raise the question, So what else has \nbeen left out? What else is contained within this bill that might be \nviewed by others as a special deal?\n  Earlier on the floor, Senator McCain came and, along with many of our \ncolleagues, kind of outlined some of those special deals about which I \nknow people in Alaska are quite concerned.\n\n[[Page S1861]]\n\nThey are like, wait a minute, if you are going to move health care \nreform in the manner you have, make sure it is even, make sure it is \nequal, make sure people are treated fairly and in a manner that we \nthink and we recognize is consistent.\n  So I think we need to ask ourselves certain questions about what is \nin and what is out. We know there is certainly more spending--more \nspending in terms of the proposal. We know we have gone from $200 \nbillion in spending to now $2.6 trillion in spending. We know there are \nmore entitlements, we see that repeated and repeated, $115 billion in \nnew entitlement spending, bringing the combined new spending in the \nproposal to $1.2 trillion. We know there are more taxes. We know there \nare more Medicare cuts. We know there are more gimmicks. You know, \nthese are why the folks back home are saying: Wait a minute, these are \nthe types of things you have promised us, and now you are telling us \nthere are some good provisions in this bill, you are going to like this \nbill once you get to know it.\n  Some of my colleagues will tell you Medicare patients will now see \nfree preventive services. I admit that sounds great. I am all for \nmaking sure we have screenings, whether they be mammograms or \npreventive services. But I have to ask the question, in a State such as \nAlaska where we face such an incredible crisis when it comes to access \nto care, to primary providers, knowing that we now have this bill \nbefore us, this new law of the land, how many of the few primary care \ndoctors in my State are going to be accepting those new Medicare \npatients to provide them these wonderful preventive services, these \nfree preventive services?\n  According to experts, not only in Alaska but in many parts of rural \nAmerica, Medicare patients are not going to have a provider who will be \nwilling to take them on. We have a think tank in the State, the \nInstitute of Socioeconomic Research, that has said that seniors in low-\npayment Medicare States are going to be forced to wait in line. They \nhave said: Independent of the doc fix, in Alaska, seniors are at risk \nfor long lines to see a primary care doctor and overflowing to \ncommunity health centers and hospital emergency rooms where existing \ncapacity is highly likely to be quickly overwhelmed and long wait times \nbecome increasingly common. They go on to say that additional insured \npatients are going to hurt the existing Medicare beneficiaries, again, \nbecause of the access issue.\n  What we will have done is, we will have been able to issue that card, \nwe will be able to say, yes, this is now available to you. But if you \nstill can't get in to see the provider, then what have we provided for \nthese seniors other than the card? That is not access. My mom used to \ntell us: If it sounds too good to be true, it is probably too good to \nbe true. We are going to be spending a fair amount of time in these \nnext few days and in the next many hours going through so many aspects \nof this reconciliation bill, trying to understand what is in it, what \nis not in it, who it applies to, and how it applies.\n  I am hopeful tomorrow I will have an opportunity to talk a little bit \nmore about not necessarily the health care side of this reconciliation \nbill but one way in which the health care reforms are going to be paid \nfor, and that is on the backs of students; students who have taken out \nloans, who, as we eliminate the Federal Family Education Loan program, \nthe FEL program, essentially we are going to be helping to pay these \nyoung people. These some 19 million young people who take out student \nloans are going to be paying for the cost of the health care provisions \ncontained within this bill. Is that right? Is that fair?\n  There is so much that needs to be discussed, that needs to be \nuncovered. Because what we have before us within this reconciliation \nbill is more of the same in terms of the bad provision that passed this \nSenate on December 24--more taxes, more cuts to Medicare, more hits to \nour seniors and our small business people. It was not good in the \nSenate bill. It is made worse in the reconciliation provision. Our job \ntonight and in the intervening hours is to make sure that the American \npublic fully understands that.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Please tell me how much time remains on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa has 15 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I know many folks look at this week's debate as the \nend of the process. I know some people look at the conclusion of this \nweek with relief. I look at it with regret, regret for the opportunity \nsquandered and regret for problems that we must now address. Our health \ncare system is in need of reform. Our health care system spends too \nmuch, leaves too many people without coverage, and doesn't provide \nquality care that it should. We had an opportunity to do something \nabout it the right way. We could have passed a bill with broad support \nin Congress and among the American people. That opportunity was lost. \nThis process started in a bipartisan fashion. In 2008, the Finance \nCommittee held a health care summit. The committee brought in experts \nfrom all over the country and all over the health care spectrum. We \nheld numerous hearings. In 2009, the Finance Committee put together \nbipartisan roundtables and walk-throughs of the critical issues in \ncreating this health care legislation.\n  Throughout the summer of 2009, six of us worked together in a \nbipartisan fashion to try to reach an agreement that could achieve \nbroad-based support, because we felt that is traditional of social \nchange in America, to be bipartisan. This was a restructuring of one-\nsixth of the economy. Doing that ought to be done not on a partisan \nbasis, not on a slight bipartisan basis, but on the basis of a broad \nconsensus. Somewhere along the line, though, getting it done quickly \nbecame more important than getting it done right. Was it when the HELP \nCommittee produced a partisan draft that would have cost more than $2 \ntrillion? Was it when the House slammed bills that were outright \ngovernment takeovers through committee? Every year I hold 99 townhall \nmeetings, one for each county in Iowa. When I went home last July and \nAugust, I found anger back home in my State. People were mad. People \nwere fearful. They saw a government that took over General Motors, took \nover banks, spent us into mind-boggling debt. My people were worried \nabout the direction of this country. Nothing has happened since August \nthat has improved that situation.\n  While Americans get up every morning worried that the struggling \neconomy may cost them their jobs, Congress has been hyperfocused on \nhealth care reform. This hyperfocus has led Congress to abandon \nbipartisanship and make some very questionable deals in the name of \njust getting it done. Congress had an opportunity to enact something \nthe American people could support, but congressional Democrats and the \nWhite House seemed so focused on making history, they stopped actually \nlistening to the American people. All the backroom deals, the budget \ngimmicks, and broken promises made it clear they are willing to go to \nany length to pass any bill, just any bill.\n  Health care reform will raise taxes by a half a trillion dollars. It \nwill cut Medicare by more than a half a trillion dollars and not \nstrengthen Medicare, but doing it solely to create a new and \nunsustainable entitlement program. Of course, it will cause health \ninsurance premiums to go up even more than they are already going up. \nRather than bringing the country together around some commonsense \nreform, it has driven the country farther apart at the very time we \nneed to come together, especially for economic recovery efforts and the \ncreation of jobs.\n  Health care reform legislation should have been done with broad-based \nsupport. Now, of course, this excessive bill is law. An opportunity has \nbeen lost. This legislation will raise taxes by a trillion dollars.\n  This is not the end, not by a long shot. Now the process of cleaning \nup the mess begins. Hopefully we can get some of these changes started \nthis week in this very bill before the Senate. Because Congress will be \nback to fix challenges created by this bill. The Medicare physician \npayment problem, for one, is still out there. It will cost more than \n$300 billion to fix. Neither the bill the House passed Sunday nor this \nreconciliation bill addresses that very major problem. Congress will \nhave to come back and fix it.\n\n[[Page S1862]]\n\n  Another problem: Medicare is still going bankrupt. Hundreds of \nbillions of dollars were taken out of the Medicare Program and were not \nused to improve the solvency of that program. Even the President has \nnow acknowledged that you can't count the savings to pay for the new \nentitlement and to improve Medicare solvency, something I tried to tell \nthis body many a time. Now the President says it. I hope people who \navoided this last time are listening to the President. Congress will \nhave to come back and fix it.\n  There are billions of dollars of cuts to Medicare providers in the \nhealth care reform bill that are totally unsustainable. Providers will \nnot be able to survive if these cuts go into effect. A cynical person \nmight suggest some providers supported the bill knowing there would be \nan influx of dollars to pay for new coverage, knowing that they would \nhave years to stave off the corresponding payment cuts. So as I have \nsaid before, Congress will have to come back to this 2,700-page law the \nPresident just signed and fix it.\n  The bill gets half of the new coverage through the Medicaid Program. \nEverybody knows that Medicaid is threadbare to begin with. Adding 16 \nmillion people to Medicaid with tens of billions of dollars of unfunded \nliability for States is not going to improve that program. The \nreconciliation bill has a farcical 2-year payment increase for \nphysicians in Medicaid that ends with a 50-percent cliff. No one has \nyet explained to me how that is supposed to improve the program. \nCongress will have to come back and fix it.\n  The bill prohibits health plans from denying coverage of preexisting \nconditions for kids under 19, starting 6 months after enactment. Sounds \nvery positive; right? But in the rush to get things done, the majority \nfailed to notice that prohibiting preexisting condition exclusions but \nallowing insurance companies to still deny kids entirely will end up in \nmore kids being denied coverage.\n  Finally, the health care reform bill included a long-term care \nentitlement called by the acronym the CLASS Act. The CLASS Act is a \nfiscal disaster waiting to happen. When it starts to run out of money, \nwhen the insurance death spiral hits the program, the taxpayers will be \non the hook to fix it. Congress will have to come back and fix it. \nCongress will have hundreds and hundreds of billions of dollars of \nproblems to come back and fix.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 3567, As Modified\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. I ask unanimous consent to call up and modify my amendment \nwhich is pending at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is so \nmodified.\n  The amendment (No. 3567), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title I, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. PREVENTING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW ENTITLEMENTS \n                   THAT WOULD RAID MEDICARE.\n\n       (a) Ban on New Spending Taking Effect.--\n       (1) In general.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Service are prohibited from implementing any \n     spending increase or revenue reduction provision in either \n     the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act or this Act \n     (referred to in this section as the ``Health Care Acts'') \n     unless the Chief Actuary of the Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services Office of the Actuary (referred to in this \n     section as ``CMS OACT'') certifies that all of the projected \n     Federal spending increases and revenue reductions resulting \n     from the Health Care Acts will be offset by projected gross \n     savings from the Health Care Acts.\n       (2) Calculations.--For purposes of this section, projected \n     gross savings shall--\n       (A) include gross reductions in Federal spending and gross \n     increases in revenues made by the Health Care Acts; and\n       (B) exclude any projected gross savings or other offsets \n     directly resulting from changes to Medicare made by the \n     Health Care Acts.\n       (b) Limit on Future Spending.--For the purpose of carrying \n     out this section and upon the enactment of this Act, CMS OACT \n     shall--\n       (1) certify whether all of the projected Federal spending \n     increases and revenue reductions resulting from the Health \n     Care Acts, starting with fiscal year 2014 and for the \n     following 9 fiscal years, are fully offset by projected gross \n     savings resulting from the Health Care Acts (as calculated \n     under subsection (a)(2)); and\n       (2) provide detailed estimates of such spending increases, \n     revenue reductions, and gross savings, year by year, program \n     by program and provision by provision.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. I express my appreciation to the Senator from Montana for \nallowing me to do this at this time.\n  I understand we will have some agreement; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 12 minutes off the bill to the \nSenator from Minnesota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Minnesota is recognized.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, today we took a historic step forward \ntoward a healthier America. I am proud that the Senate is debating the \nreconciliation bill this evening, fulfilling our pledge to make some \ncrucial adjustments to the Senate bill we passed in December. The \nreconciliation bill before us will make the newly minted reform bill \neven better. It will provide stronger subsidies for low- and middle-\nincome working families so they can afford insurance. That means fewer \npeople getting primary care in emergency rooms. It will limit the \nnumber of families affected by the excise tax on high-cost plans and \naddress geographic disparities in Medicare. It will finally close the \nMedicare prescription drug doughnut hole so that so many of our seniors \nno longer will have to choose between eating or taking medicine.\n\n  But let's be honest, even with these changes, it still is not \nperfect. We will continue to improve it because there are always things \nwe cannot foresee. Look, we are still making adjustments to Medicare 40 \nyears later. When Medicare passed, there was also ample opposition, not \ndissimilar to what we are hearing about this bill. Opponents said \nMedicare would be a government takeover of health care. But today you \nwill not find a single senior in Minnesota who wants to give up his or \nher Medicare.\n  In fact, just in these past few months, I am so pleased that so many \nof my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have spoken out in \nfavor of Medicare and of strong benefits for seniors. I am confident, \nsimilar to Medicare, support for health care reform--which is already \nstrong--will continue to grow with time as people understand how \nhelpful it will be to working families.\n  Unfortunately, many people have been scared by the misinformation \nthat has been used to try to defeat reform. For example, there is an \nimportant point that has been lost in the overblown and apocalyptic \nrhetoric these past few months: This bill is not a government takeover \nof health care. In fact, it is an expansion of private coverage, with \nmillions more Americans covered by private insurance companies.\n  Let me say this again. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \nexpands private insurance. Since we are giving these companies a huge \ninflux of new business, we have to hold them accountable. We do that by \nimproving regulation of these companies by making sure they keep \npatients as their highest priority. Our bill ends preexisting condition \nexclusions, no more lifetime and annual caps. Mental health services \nwill be covered, and companies will not be able to kick people off \ntheir plans when they get sick.\n  The truth is, in my State, there are a lot of good things happening \nin health care already. But even in Minnesota we need help. We have \npeople who cannot afford their coverage, rising costs, and a huge State \nbudget deficit.\n  I support this bill because it helps Minnesota in all the ways we \nneed right now--incentives to advance State innovation and instant \nrelief to cover low-income Minnesotans in Medicaid. This is helpful at \na time when the State legislature is struggling to make ends meet. For \nMinnesota small business owners who are stretched but want to cover \ntheir workers will have access to tax credits this year, in 2010. I am \nalso very pleased that this bill will begin to fix one of the most \nflawed elements of our current system: Medicare reimbursements.\n  Our system punishes--punishes--high-quality Minnesota providers, such \nas the Mayo Clinic, by paying them less because they provide efficient, \nlow-cost care. The Senate bill includes provisions that I fought for \nwith my colleagues, Senators Cantwell and Klobuchar, to reward value \nnot volume in Medicare.\n\n[[Page S1863]]\n\n  Thanks to my colleague, Representative McCollum of Minnesota, we have \na commitment from Secretary Sebelius to continue to expand these \nefforts to hospitals and nursing homes.\n  I am proud to represent Minnesota at this historic time and to have \ncontributed to improving the health of this country for future \ngenerations. Our new law, improved by the reconciliation bill, will be \na major victory for Minnesota families.\n  But if this reconciliation bill passes, we will also be scoring a \ndouble victory for working families. In addition to expanding access to \nhealth care, this bill will make it less expensive for working families \nto send their kids to college. By cutting out the middleman from the \nstudent lending system, we are able to increase funding for Pell grants \nand make it easier for college graduates to repay their loans. Not only \nare these measures fully paid for, they will also reduce the deficit.\n  Under the current Federal Family Education Loan Program, or FFEL, the \nFederal Government pays lenders enormous subsidies to entice them to \nlend to students. Then, on top of that, the government guarantees the \nloans so there is virtually no risk to the banks--just taxpayer-\nsubsidized profits. This is not a private enterprise program, as the \nbanks would like you to believe. It is corporate welfare, masquerading \nas private enterprise.\n  The good news is that there is a better way to run the government \nloan program than keeping banks on the dole. It is called direct \nlending, and it slashes $61 billion in costs by cutting out the \nmiddleman and lending to students directly.\n  This idea is hardly new. In the early 1990s, Senator David \nDurenberger of Minnesota, a Republican, joined with Senator Paul Simon \nof Illinois, a Democrat, in a bipartisan effort to end the wasteful \npractices of the bank lending program. They were able to give colleges \nthe option of switching to direct lending, but the bank lobbyists \nthwarted their efforts to eliminate the bank subsidy program \naltogether.\n  Today, I am proud to be continuing Senator Durenberger's fight to \neliminate wasteful bank subsidies. I am also proud that the University \nof Minnesota is leading the way. The U of M was one of the first \nuniversities in the Nation to switch to direct lending. I recently met \nwith students and administrators at several U of M campuses, and they \ntold me that the direct lending program is working very well. Not only \ndoes it provide students with the same benefits as the bank subsidy \nprogram at a lower cost, but it also reduces the administrative \nheadaches of financial aid officers by decreasing the number of \nentities they have to deal with.\n  To be blunt, our choice is simple. We can continue to waste billions \nto line the pockets of banks or we can use that money to help low-\nincome and middle-class kids go to college. I certainly do not want to \ngo home to Minnesota next week and explain to my constituents that the \nSenate decided to keep forking over their hard-earned tax dollars to \nbanks rather than help their kids go to college.\n  For many families, it is the opportunity to send their kids to \ncollege that is at stake. Most of the money that would be saved from \nswitching to direct lending would be used to strengthen the Pell grant. \nPell grants give over 8 million low-income and middle-class students \nthe opportunity to realize the dream of attaining a college education.\n  Pell grants hold a special place in my heart because of the \nopportunity they gave my wife and her family. When Franni was 17 months \nold, her father died in a car accident, leaving Franni's mom widowed at \nage 29 with five kids. My brother-in-law Neil went into the Coast Guard \nand became an electrical engineer. But all four girls went to college, \nand they were able to do it with a combination of scholarships and Pell \ngrants.\n  Unfortunately, since then, the purchasing power of the Pell grant has \ndeclined dramatically. Thirty years ago, the maximum Pell grant covered \n77 percent--77 percent--of the cost of attending the average 4-year \npublic college. These days, it only covers 35 percent.\n  This economy has made a bad situation worse. Many of the students and \nfamilies I have met in Minnesota are struggling with high tuition and a \ntough economy. The average Minnesota student graduates from college \nwith over $25,000 of debt. Job losses and cutbacks have left many \nmiddle-class families barely hanging on. That means more students who \ndepend on Pell grants have to spend more hours at work and away from \ntheir studies to help pay for their education.\n  Unfortunately, the economic crisis has also increased the demand for \nPell grants, as more families have fallen on tough times. The increase \nin demand has left us with a $19 billion shortfall in the Pell grant \nprogram. If we do not fix this shortfall, nearly 600,000 students could \nlose their Pell grants entirely. Another 8 million students could have \ntheir grants cut by almost 60 percent. This would be catastrophic for \nthose students and their families.\n  In this economy, it would be an unforgivable failure for Congress to \nallow Pell grants to be cut in half. It would also be shortsighted, \nsince we know that within a decade 75 percent of all new jobs will \nrequire a college education. A national switch to direct lending is \nsimply the right thing to do for our students, for our families, and \nfor our economy.\n  So I wish to urge my colleagues to stand for what is right and \nsupport this reconciliation package that further improves our health \ncare system, puts kids in front of banks, and reduces the deficit.\n  I thank the Chair. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Baucus, I yield \nmyself up to 20 minutes and that Senator Brown be recognized for up to \n10 minutes and that the time be charged against the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, on this historic day, I rise to speak, \nas I have many times before, about our historic opportunity to turn \naway from the path of fiscal crisis and toward the difficult and vital \nwork of bringing down the costs of health care.\n  After the wild and unsustainable borrowing of the Bush era, we now \nface an era of limited resources, in which every last dollar is needed \nto spur economic recovery, create jobs, and restore economic security \nfor all. Economists agree with virtual unanimity that the needless and \nexcessive cost of health care is the heaviest weight dragging down \nAmerica's economic growth.\n  In 1955, the year I was born, the Nation spent $12 billion annually \non health care. Last year, we spent $2.5 trillion--$134 billion more \nthan the previous year, the largest year-to-year increase in history, \nand 200 times what we spent the year I was born. That spending \nconstitutes a stunning 17.3 percent of our Nation's entire gross \ndomestic product--also the highest level in our history.\n  The cost of our Republican colleagues' desire to do nothing would \nhave been impossibly high. In my home State of Rhode Island, a family \nof four would have faced more than $26,000 in premiums for family \nhealth insurance in 2016. Last year, premiums for Medicare Advantage \nnationally jumped an average of 14.2 percent--just in 1 year. Indeed, \nthis escalation is unsustainable, but it is not inevitable.\n  A great deal of health care cost is nothing more than waste--waste \nresulting from a status quo that is irrational, disorganized, and often \ndownright greedy and mean. The only good news about all this waste and \nexcess cost is that we know where to look for savings. In the reform \nbill signed by President Obama today, we deploy every tool at our \ndisposal to reap those savings.\n  This health care debate has been enveloped in--indeed, sometimes \nblinded by--a blizzard of numbers: CBO reports, actuarial analyses, \nprojections upon estimates upon projections. Too often, my colleagues \non the other side pluck out only those figures that serve their \npurpose--their purpose to delay and ultimately defeat this bill for \ntheir insurance company friends.\n  However, I believe that a fair view of the evidence demonstrates that \nthis reform bill will do more to lower health care costs, reduce the \ndeficit, and free up precious resources in the private sector than any \nreform has ever done before.\n\n[[Page S1864]]\n\n  Let me start with the budget deficit. In its most recent report, CBO \nprojects that the bill, combined with the package of improvements that \nis now before the Senate, will reduce the deficit by $138 billion over \nthe next decade. Economists in the Commonwealth Fund have estimated \nthat the bill will reduce the deficit even more dramatically by $409 \nbillion over the next 10 years. In the second decade, CBO projects that \nthe combined bills will reduce the deficit by a broad range around one-\nhalf percent of GDP. One-half percent of GDP is $1.3 trillion over 10 \nyears, a significant achievement in deficit reduction.\n  Let's look at another number the critics too frequently ignore: \nsavings in Medicare and Medicaid spending from innovative reforms in \nthe delivery of health services, particularly increased efficiencies, \nimproved quality, and the elimination of wasteful spending. Both CBO \nand the CMS Actuary estimate those savings at roughly $490 billion, \nnearly $\\1/2\\ trillion over the next 10 years. The economists at the \nCommonwealth Fund peg that number over half a trillion dollars, at $576 \nbillion. Examples of this are found in CBO's forecast that an \nindependent, nonpartisan commission of experts with authority to \ndetermine payment rates under Medicare will save the Treasury $13.3 \nbillion over a 10-year period. CBO also credits Medicare payment \nreforms that seek to limit hospital readmissions and hospital-acquired \ninfections with $7.1 billion in savings, and incentives that encourage \nphysicians to group together in cost-saving organizations with $4.9 \nbillion in savings. We know these things work because places such as \nthe Mayo Clinic in Minnesota are out there doing that right now.\n  Not only does this bill protect the Medicare trust fund and preserve \nMedicare benefits, it also reduces spending growth in the outyears. The \nsavings I have been talking about are not just a one-off proposition \nand then back on the spending growth ratchet; this bill reshapes the \ndelivery system so that Federal health care costs should never grow at \nthis outrageous rate again. CBO and Commonwealth Fund economists find \nthat the bill reduces the Medicare rate of growth by 2 percent. \nPresident Obama's Council of Economic Advisers estimates that the bill \nwill:\n\n       Reduce the annual growth rate of Federal spending by a \n     percentage point in the upcoming decade and by an even \n     greater amount in the subsequent decade--\n\nwhich would increase national savings and improve the long-run \nperformance of the U.S. economy, in their words.\n  Widening the focus from public programs to the economy as a whole, \nthe challenge posed by wasteful health care costs expands. The \nPresident's Council of Economic Advisers recently released an updated \nreport in which they concluded that: Annual waste and inefficiency in \nthe health care status quo approaches 5 percent of GDP, $700 billion--\nbillion with a ``b''--$700 billion every year in waste and \ninefficiency. Set aside for a moment duplicative tests, lost medical \nrecords, unnecessary treatments, and uncoordinated care for chronic \npatients and look just at the administrative overhead of the private \ninsurance market. As we know, the administrative costs for Medicare run \nabout 3 percent to 5 percent. Overhead for private insurers is an \nastounding 20 percent to 27 percent. A Commonwealth Fund report \nindicates that private insurer administrative costs increased 109 \npercent from 2000 to 2006, more than double in 6 years, and my \ncolleagues can just imagine the mischievous purposes to which all that \nbureaucracy is being put.\n  The McKinsey Global Institute estimates that Americans spend roughly \n$128 billion annually on excess administrative overhead of private \ninsurance companies--$128 billion every year. Then, of course, there \nare those duplicative tests: lost medical records, unnecessary \ntreatments, and uncoordinated care for patients. Because of all of this \nwaste in the system, the Council of Economic Advisers concludes that:\n\n     [i]t should be possible to cut total health expenditures \n     about 30 percent without worsening outcomes . . . which would \n     again suggest that savings on the order of 5 percent of GDP \n     could be feasible.\n\n  Remember, again, that 5 percent of our Nation's gross domestic \nproduct is $700 billion a year.\n  They are not alone. Other experts agree. The New England Health Care \nInstitute reports that as much as $850 billion in annual excess costs: \n``can be eliminated without reducing the quality of care.'' Former \nTreasury Secretary O'Neill has written recently that the excess cost is \n$1 trillion a year. And the Lewin Group, which is often cited by my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle here, finds that we burn up \nover $1 trillion a year through excess cost and waste in our broken \nhealth care delivery system.\n  Whether it is $700 billion a year or $1 trillion a year, it is a big \nsavings target--bigger than anything discussed by CBO--and the tools to \nachieve these potential savings are in this bill. Analysts of all \nstripes agree that this bill does more than any previous measure to \nrelieve the economy of this dead weight of waste and excess health care \ncosts.\n  The Commonwealth Fund has projected that our bill will reduce the \nannual growth of national health expenditures--that is the amount that \nthe private and public sector spend on health care every year--by 0.6 \npercentage points annually--$683 billion over the next 10 years. The \nCouncil of Economic Advisers writes that ``total slowing of private \nsector cost growth'' will be approximately 1 percentage point per year.\n  Why does this happen? This happens because the bill begins to \nrestructure, streamline, and modernize our disorganized and illogical \nmedical delivery system. It changes outmoded payment systems that you \nwill pay for good health care outcomes, not just more procedures. It \nfunds comparative effectiveness research so you will know whether \nsomething works before you pay for it. It creates financial incentives \nfor low-quality but high-cost providers to improve their performance, \nand for transparency so you will know who they are and you can avoid \nthem. It makes investments in wellness and prevention to reduce costs \nby keeping you healthy in the first place. It improves the coordination \nof care for chronic care and multiple diagnosis patients. Anyone with a \nfamily member in that situation knows how difficult trying to organize \ntheir care is. It starts demonstration and pilot projects in Medicare \nto create quality-based efficiencies in health care delivery that will \nspread out to the private sector.\n  Such investments in quality of care pay proven dividends. For \nexample, I often talk about the Keystone Project in Michigan which \nreduced infections, respiratory complications, and other medical errors \nin Michigan's intensive care units. It didn't even go to all of the \nintensive care units. Just in the participating ones, it saved more \nthan 1,800 lives, over 140,000 days that patients would have spent in \nthe hospital--140,000 saved patient days--and, of course, over 271 \nmillion health care dollars, saving lives and saving dollars.\n  In my home State, the Rhode Island Quality Institute has taken this \nmodel statewide with every one of our hospitals participating, and we \nare already seeing hospital-acquired infections and costs declining: a \n16.5 percent decrease in mortality and a statewide mortality rate \nalmost 21 percent lower than the national average, saving the State's \nhealth care system $6 million overall so far.\n  Analysts agree that there is a big savings opportunity, and many \nagree that we are taking the right approach to tackling it. But they \nalso agree that the amount of savings we can achieve is uncertain. Why? \nWhy is it uncertain if the tools are in the bill to achieve the \nsavings? It is uncertain because administering and applying these tools \neffectively will be essential. Remember: We have never before taken aim \nat this target. We have never launched such a battery of innovative \nreforms, even though experts have been advocating them in some cases \nfor decades. Success will depend on the quality of executive \nmanagement, how dynamic we are in bringing these innovative tools to \nbear on a problem. The quality of executive management with innovative \ntools is simply not something that CBO knows how to score. It is not \nsomething they can do.\n  CBO Director Doug Elmendorf has conceded in a letter to Budget \nCommittee Chairman Kent Conrad:\n\n       Changes in government policy have the potential to yield \n     large reductions in both national health care expenditures \n     and Federal\n\n[[Page S1865]]\n\n     health care spending without harming health.\n       Many experts agree on some general directions in which the \n     government's health care policy should move. Many of the \n     specific changes that might ultimately prove most important \n     cannot be foreseen today and could be developed only over \n     time through experimentation and learning.\n\n  That is Doug Elmendorf: experimentation and learning.\n  That sounds an awful lot like the example used by Dr. Atul Gawande, \none of our most thoughtful commentators on this subject, who analogized \nhealth care to the agricultural sector. He wrote about the agricultural \nsector:\n\n       That [it] was strangling the country at the beginning of \n     the 20th century . . . The government never took over \n     agriculture, but the government didn't leave it alone either. \n     It shaped a feedback loop of experiments and learning and \n     encouragement for farmers across the country.\n\n  Experiments and learning. How did that work out? To continue with Dr. \nGawande:\n\n       The results were beyond what anyone could have imagined. \n     Productivity went way up. Prices fell by half. Today, food is \n     produced on no more land than was devoted to it a century ago \n     and with far greater variety and abundance than ever before \n     in history.\n       The strategy works because United States agencies were \n     allowed to proceed by trial and error, continually adjusting \n     policies over time, in response not to ideology but to hard \n     measurement of the results against social goals . . . Pick up \n     the Senate health care bill--yes, all 2,074 pages--and leaf \n     through it. Almost half of it is devoted to programs that \n     would test various ways to curb costs and increase quality . \n     . . The bill is a hodgepodge. And it should be.\n\n  Here is how he wraps things up. He says this:\n\n       We crave sweeping transformations. However, all the current \n     bill offers is those pilot programs, a battery of small-scale \n     experiments. The strategy seems hopelessly inadequate to \n     solve a problem of this magnitude. And, yet--history suggests \n     otherwise.\n\n  David Cutler is a widely respected Harvard health care economist. He \nwrote in the Wall Street Journal recently that:\n\n     [o]ver the past year of debate, 10 broad ideas have been \n     offered for bending the health care cost curve. The \n     Democrats' proposed legislation incorporates virtually every \n     one of them.\n\n  Professor Cutler gives the bill ``full credit'' on six of the cost \ncontrol ideas and ``partial credit'' on three, including ideas \nregularly championed by my colleagues on the other side, such as \ncombating fraud and abuse in the Medicare system and reform in the \nmedical malpractice liability system.\n  The only area in which Cutler gives the bill zero credit is in its \nfailure to include a public option. It is hard for our colleagues on \nthe other size to criticize us for that since it is the thing they \nfought the hardest against. As codrafter with the distinguished \nPresiding Officer, Senator Brown of Ohio, I deeply regret that \nprovision was excluded. Perhaps on another occasion we will have the \nchance to revisit that issue. But 9 of the 10 cost control mechanisms \nare in this bill, and the 10th was a public option our colleagues \nopposed.\n  David Cutler concludes that ``[w]hat is on the table is the most \nsignificant action on medical spending ever proposed in the United \nStates.'' In spite of the uncertainty described by CBO Director \nElmendorf, Cutler estimates that the reforms will save ``nearly $600 \nbillion over the next decade and even more in the subsequent one.''\n  Nobel laureate Paul Krugman agrees that ``there's good reason to \nbelieve that [CBO's] estimates are too pessimistic. There are many \ncost-saving efforts in the proposed reform, but nobody knows how well \nany one of these efforts will work. And as a result, official estimates \ndon't give the plan much credit for any of them. . . . Realistically, \nhealth reform is likely to do much better at controlling costs than any \nof the official projections suggest.''\n  Recently, three more respected health economists--Len Nichols of \nGeorge Mason, Ken Thorpe of Emory, and Alan Garber of Stanford--\ndescribed the bill's cost controls as vital, a significant improvement \non the status quo. As Professor Thorpe neatly described it:\n\n       Under the do-nothing scenario, everything gets worse.\n\n  And MIT professor Jonathan Gruber, one of our leading health \neconomists, said this of the bill's cost control measures:\n\n       I can't think of a thing to try they didn't try.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent for an additional minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Professor Gruber said:\n\n       I can't think of a thing to try that they didn't try. They \n     really make the best effort anyone has ever made. Everything \n     is in here. . . . You couldn't have done better than they are \n     doing.\n\n  When the do-nothing crowd on the other side argues that this bill is \na cost disaster, that it has no master plan, I urge that American \ningenuity, through experimentation and learning, can overcome the \ntoughest challenges, not through command and control but through a \nflexible, dynamic, and persistent exercise--experimentation, learning, \nand encouragement.\n  I will close by urging President Obama to specify a savings target \nfor his administration to achieve. I have before recommended setting \nthe target at $200 billion in annual savings by 2014. That should be \nconservative and easy to achieve. But a clear and specific goal will \nwheel the vast apparatus of Federal bureaucracy more rapidly toward the \ncomprehensive change we need.\n  When President Kennedy announced in September of 1962 that America \nwould strive to put a man on the Moon, he set a specific target. He did \nnot say he was going to bend the curve of space exploration; he said he \nwould put a man on the Moon. What he said about that is this:\n\n       We choose to do such things not because they are easy, but \n     because they are hard, because that goal will serve to \n     organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, \n     because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, \n     one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to \n     win. . . .\n\n  Health care cost is a challenge we are indeed willing to accept, it \nis one we cannot afford to postpone, and it is one which we can and \nmust and will win.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his courtesy. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Whitehouse). The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I thank you for the work you did on \nthis bill that the President signed today to bring costs under control \nin our health care system, to do what we need to do to insure 32 \nmillion people, to provide consumer protections this bill offers, and \nto give these tax breaks immediately to America's small businesses.\n  One of the most important components of that is the work you and \nothers in this Chamber did to bring costs down in this health care \nsystem, the costs that afflict taxpayers, the costs that afflict small \nbusinesses, the costs that afflict, in effect, our ability to compete \naround the world, and the costs that come directly out of people's \npockets, those who have health insurance and those who do not, and the \nhuge burdens of costs. We are finally on a track to do the right thing. \nI thank the Presiding Officer, the Senator from Rhode Island, Mr. \nWhitehouse.\n  I will speak for just a few minutes. I have come to this floor since \nJuly, as we voted the health care bill initially out of the Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions Committee, night after night mostly for \nthe last 7 or 8 months, to share letters from Ohioans with my \ncolleagues. There are a couple of things these letters have in common.\n  In most cases, these letters are written by people who have had \nsignificant problems, generally have lost their insurance or are paying \nso much it is hardly insurance. These letters typically come from \npeople who a year or two ago would have told you they were satisfied \nwith their insurance; they thought it covered what they needed. Then \nsomething happened. They either lost their job or lost their insurance \nor had a child born with a preexisting condition and could not get \ninsurance for her or him or they got very sick and their care was very \nexpensive and the insurance company cut them off or the insurance \ncompany realized they were going to be expensive--they perhaps had a \npreexisting condition and they were getting more expensive--or they \nwere getting older and the insurance company found a way by charging \nthem so much. They could not cancel the insurance, so they thought \nperhaps they could force the letter writer--the insurer--to cancel the \ninsurance.\n\n[[Page S1866]]\n\n  The other thing they had in common so often was so many of the letter \nwriters were 60, 61, 62 years old and said: I can't wait until I get on \nMedicare because I can trust Medicare; I know Medicare is stable; it \nwill be there for me. It is a strong government program, not socialism. \nGovernment is simply the insurer. The government has made such a \ndifference in the lives of so many senior citizens because the Medicare \nProgram worked.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows--just a little history of this \ninstitution and this bill--the same arguments that were used this year \nagainst this health care bill were used against Medicare in 1965: \nsocialism, government takeover. Back then, it was the John Birch \nSociety. Today, it is the tea parties. They said: A government \nbureaucrat will get between my doctor and me. It was not true about \nMedicare; it is not true now.\n  The public clearly sees through this. That is why this Congress \npassed this bill, and that is why the President today--and one of the \nmost important things professionally in my lifetime by a long shot, \nmaybe the most important thing as I watched the President of the United \nStates today sign this legislation.\n  Let me share three or four letters from Ohioans to give you an idea \nwhat this bill means to people whom it affects. We on this floor hear \nthe debate and the partisanship and see the obstructionism from the \nother side, and who is going to win, Republicans or Democrats. The \nreason we are doing this bill is these letters. That is why it matters. \nYou will see this.\n  David from northern Ohio:\n\n       My best friend's husband is a hemophiliac. He has had a \n     pretty scary life and could be just one bleed away from death \n     or financial ruin. They are about to hit their cap for their \n     employer-provided insurance and have very few choices to seek \n     out other insurance because of his preexisting condition. \n     They have done everything that people should do--they have \n     worked hard, put money aside for retirement, and only used \n     their insurance when it was absolutely necessary. I can't \n     imagine--\n\n  She writes about her friend--\n\n     the fear they must constantly feel. Please stand firm and \n     remember those whose voices are small individually, but are \n     strong standing together.\n\n  Health reform will help families such as David's friend's family \nbecause it will get rid of lifetime limits and arbitrary annual caps on \nbenefits. In this case of the man who has hemophilia and his wife, they \nknow if their health care gets too expensive, under the present system \nor at least the system before today, before the President signed the \nbill, they know they can lose their insurance if it gets too expensive. \nThey will not have any coverage then. Under this bill, insurance \ncompanies simply can no longer do that.\n\n  Diane from Cuyahoga County writes:\n\n       We have a small business that has been in the family for \n     many years. But after doing well, our situation is precarious \n     because of the high cost of health insurance.\n\n  In the last few years, we have continually downgraded our health \ninsurance coverage. We are struggling to pay our health care bills and, \nof course, have no dental or eye coverage.\n\n       Putting children through college, paying health insurance, \n     and trying to keep the business afloat makes life difficult.\n\n  That is what has happened with so many small businesses. They \nstruggle to insure themselves and their employees. In one small \nbusiness, the small business has 10 employees, and if one person gets \nreally sick and it is very expensive--cancer or something else--that \ncompany so often has to cancel their insurance simply because they \ncannot afford it, and their employees, even though they were not very \nsick, lose out.\n  In so many cases, as Diane points out, the insurance people do have \nhas more and more holes in it. She said: We continually downgraded our \nhealth insurance.\n  This bill, starting tomorrow--the President signed it today--will \nhelp by offering small businesses tax credits so employers can offer \ncoverage to their employees. This is the first major impact this bill \nwill have.\n  This bill will take a while because we want to implement it correctly \nand quickly enough to help people but not so quickly that we will make \nsignificant mistakes.\n  The first thing this bill does is provide tax incentives to small \nbusinesses, such as Diane's, so they can actually write good insurance \npolicies for themselves if they are self-employed and for themselves if \nthey have a business, and with their employees.\n  The last letter I will share is from Cynthia from Hocking County, \nLogan, OH, southeast of Columbus:\n\n       My son-in-law is 40 years old with a serious medical \n     condition that makes it extremely difficult to get around. My \n     daughter is 42 years old and on disability. . . .\n       Neither of them can work and make supplemental income. They \n     have to spend so much on medication that they are not able to \n     pay their house payments and may have to file for bankruptcy. \n     They also have a 16-year-old son to support. Who doesn't want \n     to send their child to college and help him have a better \n     life? But where will that money come from if they can't pay \n     the bills now?\n       Please continue to fight for the middle and lower middle \n     class families who insist that we be treated fairly and with \n     dignity. We just want good insurance like lawmakers in \n     Washington have.\n\n  This plan with the insurance exchange was based on the Federal \nemployee plan that most Senators and Congressmen have, that most \nFederal employees have. This bill will provide for those who are lower \nincome than we are, significantly lower income than we are, for people \nwho are making $10,000, $20,000, or $30,000, or $50,000 a year, even a \nlittle more than that. It will provide them with subsidies so they can \nafford health insurance. We want everybody to be insured.\n  We know right now that every American who has insurance pays about \n$1,000 extra--a tax for all intents and purposes--pays $1,000 extra to \npay for the care of people who don't have insurance and go to the \nhospital. Somebody has to pay for that. It is being spread around to \neverybody who has insurance. That extra $1,000 will no longer happen to \nany significant degree because as everybody in this country or almost \neverybody gets insurance, people will be paying for themselves. They \nwill get subsidies with their low income. If they have a little more \nmoney than that, they will pay everything themselves. That is why this \nlegislation makes so much sense.\n  Today, we saw the President of the United States move this country \nforward--tax breaks for small businesses, no more preexisting \nconditions for a child, no more exclusions to keep a family from \ngetting insurance. If your 22-year-old son or daughter comes home from \ncollege and cannot get a job with insurance, that daughter or son can \nstay on the insurance plan of their parents until they are 26.\n  There are a whole lot of important things. Senior citizens, starting \nnext year, will be able to get a physical every year without a copay, \nmaking sure our senior population stays healthier longer. We begin to \nclose the doughnut hole so seniors, with the bill that was passed a few \nyears ago that gave the drug companies a whole lot more money than it \nhelped seniors--at least we are fixing that bill so seniors will see \nthat doughnut hole closed. All of those things are part of the \nlegislation in the next year or so as it takes effect.\n  This is the right thing for our country. It is an honor and a \nprivilege to represent Ohio and to have an opportunity to vote for this \nlegislation and to push it to work for public health.\n  If we look back, President Truman, when he spoke to the Congress in \n1946, spoke about the importance of health care. Now 65 years later and \n10 Presidents later, it has happened. It is a good day for our country, \nand we celebrate that. Most importantly, it gives people such as \nCynthia from Hocking County, Diane, the business owner in Cleveland, \nand David in northern Ohio the opportunity to get on with their lives \nin a much more workable, practical, happier way.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the allocations of a committee or committees, \naggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits in the resolution, \nand make adjustments to the pay-as-you-go scorecard, for legislation \nthat is deficit-neutral over 11 years, reduces excess cost growth in \nhealth care spending, is fiscally responsible over the long term, and \nfulfills at least one of eight other conditions listed in the reserve \nfund.\n  I find that H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct, which\n\n[[Page S1867]]\n\nCongress cleared on March 21, 2010, fulfills the conditions of the \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to transform and modernize America's \nhealth care system.

Mr. President, I would like to thank my colleagues \nfor their work on the Reagan National perimeter rule issue.\n  Last week, I sat down with several interested colleagues in an effort \nto try and find a path forward on this issue. As a result, we have the \nmodified Ensign amendment before us.\n  I would like to say a few words about the intent of that amendment. I \nam one who is sympathetic to the concerns of from my friend from \nVirginia, Senator Warner, who also serves as a member of the Senate \nCommerce Committee. While in a somewhat different position, in the \npast, I have had similar issues raised concerning my home State of \nTexas, and I recognize well that the impacts of dealing with a decision \nto change the status quo are enormously difficult.\n  With that in mind, I believe we have come up with a compromise \nproposal that meets the concerns of my Western State colleagues and \nothers and tries to address, to the extent possible, my friend from \nVirginia's concerns.\n  The modified Ensign amendment is a simple solution to a complex \nproblem. The amendment would allow any air carrier with existing \n``inside'' the perimeter large hub airport slots into Reagan National \nthe ability to ``convert'' those slots to any community ``outside'' the \nperimeter, with each air carrier being capped at 15 round trip \noperations eligible for conversion.\n  By utilizing the idea of ``conversions,'' we don't add any new \nflights to the airport, but we do give the air carriers the opportunity \nto better utilize their networks. I am hopeful we can take that concept \nand message to the House in the next round of the legislative process \non this bill.\n  I thank Senators Ensign and Kyl, as well as Senators DeMint, Boxer, \nMcCain, Rockefeller, Dorgan, and Warner for their work on this very \nimportant issue. I remain hopeful that the final version of this FAA \nreauthorization bill will include a consensus agreement on this issue, \nand allow the opportunity for direct service to our Nation's Capitol \nfor a number of communities that are eager for such service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/23/senate-section/article/S1868-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S1868-S1870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AIG SEVERANCE PAYMENTS\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I recently asked Secretary Geithner why \nthe Treasury Department is allowing AIG to pay millions of dollars of \nseverance pay to executives given the billions of dollars of taxpayer \nassistance AIG has received.\n  At one point I even said that AIG has the American taxpayer over a \nbarrel and that AIG has outmaneuvered the administration.\n  Mr. Kenneth Feinberg, the Treasury Special Master for executive \ncompensation, insisted he was not outmaneuvered by AIG. As it turns \nout, he was not outmaneuvered by AIG. Instead, he was outmaneuvered by \nSecretary Geithner. Let me explain what I mean.\n  In February, 2009, we enacted the Recovery Act. The law required \nSecretary Geithner to take control of the runaway executive \ncompensation at companies that the American taxpayer bailed out.\n  Congress provided Mr. Geithner with several tools to accomplish this \ncritical job.\n  By far the most important and most flexible tool Congress gave Mr. \nGeithner was a general mandate to require bailed-out companies like AIG \nto meet ``appropriate standards'' for executive compensation.\n  This rule was applicable to compensation already in place, \ncompensation in the future, and compensation for all executives, not \njust a handful of the most senior executives.\n  What happened to this tool?\n  Well, even before the law was passed the bonuses, retention awards, \nand incentive compensation were ``grandfathered.''\n  That means that while one part of the statute banned them for a \nhandful of senior executives, another part said they had to be paid if \nthe payments were based on a contract that existed in February 2009.\n  We all remember the outrage when people learned that this provision \nwas quietly added by the Senate drafters on the other side of the aisle \nbecause it required AIG to pay massive bonuses in March 2009 and again \nearlier this year.\n  Secretary Geithner was quoted in the press at the time saying that \n``Treasury staff'' worked with the Senate drafters on the grandfather \ncarve-out. Well, the damage was done.\n  The grandfather loophole was law. You might say the American taxpayer \nwas outmaneuvered by Treasury staff too.\n  The President instructed Secretary Geithner to ``pursue every single \nlegal avenue to block these bonuses and make the American taxpayers \nwhole.''\n  The next step required Treasury to implement the law and use the \ntools Congress gave Mr. Geithner to put the brakes on runaway executive \ncompensation at firms where taxpayers are footing the bill.\n  What did Treasury do?\n  One thing Treasury apparently did was hire a Wall Street executive \ncompensation lawyer from a firm that specializes in helping highly paid \nexecutives maximize their pay, but more about that later.\n  Despite the public outcry over the loophole, which permitted AIG \nemployees and others to walk away with millions, Treasury wrote a \nregulation that actually expands the loophole even further.\n  That's right, in the face of overwhelming public outrage, Treasury \nquietly worked to expand the loophole! Let me explain how they did \nthat.\n  The grandfather provision in the law that Congress enacted protected \nthree things: bonuses, retention awards, and incentive compensation. It \ndid not protect severance. Let me repeat: it did not protect severance.\n  But in what appears to be an effort to protect severance agreements \ndespite the statutory language, the regulations Treasury drafted \nexpanded the term ``bonus'' beyond its normal meaning.\n  Unlike bonuses, severance payments are intended to ease someone out \nthe door, not reward them for doing a great job. Severance is basically \nthe opposite of a retention bonus.\n  But, after Treasury drafted the regulation, suddenly, severance \npayments were also protected by the grandfather loophole, just like \nbonuses. Treasury must have known exactly what it was doing.\n  AIG had an executive severance plan that dated back to March 2008. It \nwas just the sort of contract the grandfather provision would protect \nif Treasury expanded the loophole.\n  And what was the impact of the Treasury regulation on the bottom \nline? What did American taxpayers have to pay?\n  Because of this regulation, AIG recently paid two of its executives \n$1 million and $3.9 million in severance pay. We don't yet know how \nmany others have received severance or may receive it in the future.\n  As the law was passed, these payments would not have been protected \nby the grandfather provision because they were not a bonus, retention, \nor incentive payment.\n  But Treasury officials took care of that. Rather than setting \nappropriate standards for executive severance payments generally, as \nthe law passed by Congress required, the regulation leaves AIG free to \npay excessive severance payments to many of its executives. Then, the \nAmerican taxpayer gets the bill.\n  The Recovery Act told Mr. Geithner that he ``shall'' require each \nbailed-out company to meet appropriate standards for executive \ncompensation. This command covers all types of executive compensation \nfor all executives, not just bonuses for the most senior executives.\n  It is a command, not a suggestion. And the grandfather provision that \nprotects certain bonuses does not apply to this more general provision.\n  But the Treasury regulation almost completely ignores this mandate. \nIt does address one form of executive compensation. The regulation bars \ntax gross-up payments for senior executives.\n  That is the practice of allowing the company to pay the executive's \nincome taxes for him. Now don't get me wrong--tax gross-up payments \nshould be banned for companies that were bailed out, and I am glad to \nsee that this was done.\n  But Congress gave Mr. Geithner a powerful tool that should have been\n\n[[Page S1869]]\n\nused to curb other types of inappropriate executive compensation as \nwell.\n  That includes tax gross-ups, extravagant severance payments, and \nother goodies to which Wall Street thinks it is entitled.\n  Secretary Geithner should have used the tool as it was intended. It \nis like using a big tractor to plow a little flower garden.\n  There is nothing wrong with banning tax gross-ups or planting flower \ngardens, but you could have done so much more with the tool you had.\n  If Secretary Geithner had done what he was directed to do in the law, \nwe would not be witnessing this spectacle.\n  AIG is paying multimillion-dollar severance payments at taxpayer \nexpense to executives who chose to resign rather than work for the \nmaximum salary of $500,000 per year set by the Special Master.\n  This is a scandal as far as I am concerned. The American taxpayer, as \nwell as Mr. Feinberg, was outmaneuvered by Secretary Geithner and his \nstaff. And it all happened before the Special Master's first day on the \njob.\n  There is another troubling matter that I must address. I mentioned \nearlier that the Treasury Department hired at least one Wall Street \nexecutive compensation lawyer from a firm that specializes in helping \nwealthy executives maximize their pay.\n  There is nothing wrong, as a general matter, with hiring talented \npeople with expertise in technical legal subjects to draft regulations \nand administer the law.\n  But there are some red flags here that need a little sunshine. We \nneed to be sure that the people working on these issues at Treasury \nhave dealt with any potential conflicts of interest carefully and \nopenly.\n  Recently I learned that at least one Treasury official previously \nworked for Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen and Katz, a top Wall Street law \nfirm. Wachtell, Lipton has represented at least two former AIG \nexecutives.\n  The firm's job was to look out for the interests of the executives, \nnot the shareholders. They were paid to make sure the compensation \ncontracts, including severance provisions, were as generous as possible \nfor their clients.\n  Wachtell, Lipton also represented Bank of America on its \ncontroversial Merrill, Lynch acquisition in 2008. A Wachtell attorney \nwho worked on that deal joined Treasury in the spring of 2009.\n  He said that he then worked on the Treasury executive compensation \nregulations. These are the regulations I have been describing: the \nregulations that were to govern AIG, Bank of America and all of the \nother bailed-out companies.\n  This situation raises a host of questions, for example:\n  How many other Treasury officials have similar potential conflict \nissues?\n  Why wasn't the attorney recused from participating in the drafting of \na regulation that was going to have a direct effect on Bank of America, \nhis former client, and AIG executives, his firm's former clients?\n  Did the attorney comply with the revolving door provision of the \nPresident's Executive order, which prevents appointees from working on \nmatters that relate to their former clients?\n  The President has committed to publicly disclosing all the waivers \nissued to exempt appointees from his ethics executive order. If this \nattorney recused himself, as he should have, why was that recusal not \nalso disclosed so that the public would know about the potential \nconflict?\n  At a minimum there is the potential for an appearance of impropriety \nhere.\n  What we know so far raises serious questions and red flags. But there \nalso are facts we do not know.\n  Therefore, I am asking that the special inspector general for TARP \ninvestigate these issues and report his findings to Congress and the \npublic as soon as possible.\n  Specifically, I am asking the inspector general to examine why \nTreasury did not set appropriate compensation standards pursuant to \nsection 111(B)(2) of the Recovery Act sufficient to prevent severance \npayments like those AIG recently paid to its former general counsel and \nchief compliance officer.\n  I am also asking him to determine whether Treasury officials working \non executive compensation matters have fully complied with the \nrevolving door provision of the President's Ethics Executive order.\n  In the meantime, there are still numerous documents that I have \nrequested that have not been provided to me despite assurance that I \nwas going to get them.\n  There are many questions I have asked that remain unanswered, and I \nwill continue to seek information on these issues.\n  I call on Secretary Geithner to stop stonewalling. Oversight is \nimportant. Oversight is necessary to protect the American taxpayer. I \ntake that duty seriously, and I am not going away. American taxpayers \ndeserve to know where their money is going.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my letter to \nspecial inspector general Barofsky be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 23, 2010.\n     Hon. Neil M. Barofsky,\n     Special Inspector General, Office of the Special Inspector \n         General, Troubled Asset Relief Program, United States \n         Department of the Treasury, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Special Inspector General Barofsky: I have \n     communicated on several occasions during the last few months \n     with the Secretary of the Treasury and the Special Master for \n     TARP executive compensation to try to get to the bottom of \n     why AIG was allowed to pay excessive severance awards to AIG \n     executives after the passage of the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act of 2009 (Recovery Act). Answers have not \n     been forthcoming and therefore I am writing to ask that you \n     investigate these matters and report your findings to me as \n     soon as possible. I am particularly troubled by a chronology \n     of events that seems to suggest a deliberate decision on the \n     part of Treasury to improperly protect executive severance \n     pay and tie the hands of the Special Master.\n       The Recovery Act required the Treasury Secretary to set \n     standards for appropriate levels of executive compensation at \n     TARP recipients generally. It specifically prohibited the \n     payment of bonuses, retention awards and incentive \n     compensation to the top 25 executives at bailed-out companies \n     like AIG, but then protected many such payments by the \n     controversial ``grandfather'' provision added late in the \n     drafting process. Consequently, bonus payments, retention \n     awards and incentive compensation based on a contract in \n     existence on or before February 11, 2009, were required to be \n     paid. But the provision did not cover severance pay because \n     severance is not generally understood to be within the \n     meaning of incentive or retention bonuses. That is why I was \n     surprised to learn earlier this year that AIG reportedly paid \n     its former General Counsel $3.9 million and its former Chief \n     Compliance and Regulatory Officer $1 million in severance.\n       Treasury published regulations on June 15, 2009, \n     implementing the Recovery Act's executive compensation \n     provisions. Treasury also named Mr. Kenneth Feinberg as the \n     Special Master. It appears that, despite the earlier public \n     outcry over the retention bonus grandfather loophole, \n     Treasury's regulation added severance pay to the list of \n     executive compensation items covered by the grandfather. \n     Worse still, Treasury virtually ignored the requirement in \n     section 111(b)(2) of the Recovery Act that the Secretary \n     ``shall require each TARP recipient to meet appropriate \n     standards for executive compensation.'' Section 111(b) (2) is \n     a general provision and is not limited by the more \n     specific restrictions in 111(b) (3) related to the top 25 \n     executives and the grandfather provision. Nevertheless, \n     this mandated authority was not used to regulate severance \n     pay for executives like the former AIG General Counsel. \n     Therefore, I am asking you, among other things, to \n     evaluate why Treasury did not effectively implement the \n     Congressional mandate in section 111(b) (2) to prevent \n     inappropriate executive compensation, such as excessive \n     severance payments, more broadly.\n       There is another troubling matter that I am asking you to \n     review. The current Deputy Special Master joined Treasury in \n     May 2009. He told us he participated in drafting the Treasury \n     regulations. Of course, those regulations governed executive \n     compensation at TARP recipients like AIG and Bank of America. \n     The problem is that this attorney worked for the Wall Street \n     law firm Wachtell, Lipton, Rosen & Katz prior to joining \n     Treasury. While at Wachtell, it is my understanding that this \n     attorney represented Bank of America during its acquisition \n     of Merrill, Lynch in the fall of 2008. Also, the Wachtell \n     firm represents the former CEO and former CFO of AIG on \n     executive compensation matters, including severance. In fact, \n     I understand that those executives may still be planning to \n     make claims against AIG for millions of dollars of severance \n     pay.\n       At a minimum this presents the appearance of serious \n     impropriety. There are several red flags and questions \n     stemming from this information including, for example, why \n     was this Treasury official permitted to work on a regulation \n     that would directly affect his former client and a client of \n     his former law firm? Did he fully comply with the revolving\n\n[[Page S1870]]\n\n     door provisions of the President's Ethics Executive Order, \n     prohibiting appointees from participating in matters \n     involving their former clients? If he was recused, when did \n     the recusal occur and why was it not publicly disclosed? How \n     many other Treasury officials working on executive \n     compensation matters have similarly undisclosed potential \n     conflicts for which recusals have been necessary to ensure \n     compliance with the President's executive order? What are the \n     details of the other potential conflicts, if any?

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the \nextraordinary life and service of Donald Russell, a longtime columnist \nfor the Advocate newspaper in Stamford, CT. Don was a true American \npatriot and a valued public intellectual in the Stamford community. \nBeloved for his brilliant mind and big heart, Don Russell will be \nmissed deeply.\n  I knew Don Russell for many years, and I am grateful for all of the \nwisdom he has offered me personally. Mostly though, I treasure the \nexample he set in his career of devoted service. During the Second \nWorld War, Don served this country with courage and distinction as a \nnavigator with the U.S. Army Air Corps. He went on to help pioneer the \nfield of television news, beginning with the DuMont Television Network, \none of the first ever commercial television networks in the world.\n  With insight, wit, and passion, Don Russell captured some of the most \nimportant moments of the 20th century as a journalist. Over a half a \ncentury ago, Don anchored the first coast-to-coast television broadcast \nof a Presidential inauguration when President Dwight Eisenhower took \noffice and later won an award for his credible and well-balanced \ncommentary during the controversial Army-McCarthy hearings in 1954. \nAlthough Don Russell was quickly recognized for his journalistic skill \non the national stage--working closely with stars like Jackie Gleason \nand Merv Griffin--his heart remained with the hometown that I am proud \nto share with him: Stamford, CT.\n  For decades, Don Russell illuminated the hearts and minds on the \nradio and in his weekly columns for the Advocate. Don never hesitated \nto ask tough questions or take a contrarian stance on an issue. For \nthis, he was respected and trusted by countless readers; many of whom \nhe knew personally and others who admired him from afar. Don wrote \nabout many of the most important issues facing our country and our \nworld but also uniquely brought to life the challenges and \nopportunities facing Stamford, a city he understood and cherished like \nfew others.\n  Don Russell never missed a deadline and continued writing until the \nend of his long and extraordinary life. We, his readers, were blessed \nwith the opportunity to have learned from Don Russell, and I believe \nmore broadly that our state and this nation are blessed to have people \nlike Don Russell who truly enrich our communities. Don Russell's \nbrilliant mind, generous spirit, and warm smile will never fade from \nour memory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/23/senate-section/article/S1870-2", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO LEADER DAN McKAY\n\n Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, today I honor Dan McKay, a \ngreat Missourian, who has devoted much of his life to advocating for \nworkers' rights.\n  Dan was born in St. Louis, MO, on February 21, 1946, to the late \nHarry and Marie McKay. His upbringing taught him the core Missouri \nvalues of hard work, respect, honor, and discipline. Dan started his \ncareer as a truckdriver, working for several companies in the freight \nindustry including Yellow Transit, Time DC, Commercial Motor Freight, \nand many more.\n  Recognizing the labor movement's unwavering commitment to working \nfamilies, Dan joined the movement in order to advocate on behalf of his \nfellow workers. He served as business representative, recording \nsecretary, and ultimately, president of Teamsters Local 600. He also \nserved as president of Teamsters Joint Council 13, representing 10 \nTeamster locals and more than 25,000 Teamster families in the State of \nMissouri. In those leadership roles, Dan has advocated for collective \nbargaining rights, fair wages, adequate and secure pensions, and better \nworking conditions.\n  His work with the Teamsters often pulled him away from his wonderful \nfamily, as he spent countless hours in contract negotiations and \nmeetings around the State and the country. Even with his work, Dan and \nhis wife Sharron raised two beautiful boys, Daniel Patrick and Mark \nTimothy McKay, and are the proud grandparents of Jesse Danielle, Dana \nElaine, and Daniel Joseph McKay. His diligent and honorable tenure \nserves as a shining example to his children and grandchildren.\n  Dan and I have known each other for more years than I care to \ndisclose. We have worked together in efforts to better the lives of \nthousands of our fellow Missourians. This year, Dan will be retiring \nafter 44 years of service with the Teamsters, 14 of which were spent as \nthe president of Teamsters Local 600. On behalf of so many Missourians, \nI thank Dan for his tireless work and wish him a wonderful, well-\nearned, and relaxing retirement. While he will no longer hold his \nnumerous titles, I know that he will never stop fighting the good fight \non behalf of all working families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/23/senate-section/article/S1870-3", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:17 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 4667.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to reauthorize \nand extend the Fetal Alcohol Syndrome prevention and services program, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, \nand Pensions.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I join Senators Inouye, Landrieu, \nand Murkowski in introducing the Advancing FASD Research, Prevention, \nand Services Act. I thank them for joining in this important effort to \nimprove the surveillance, identification, and prevention of Fetal \nAlcohol Syndrome Disorders, or FASD.\n  I have great concern about the impact of FASD in South Dakota and \nacross the country. This disease is entirely preventable, and yet as \nmany as 40,000 infants each year are estimated to be born with an FASD. \nResearchers estimate that 1 percent of our population lives with an \nFASD, which is more than 3 million Americans. In my home State of South \nDakota, over 7,800 individuals are suspected of living with an FASD.\n  The tragedy of FASD must be addressed at the source, by increasing \nawareness that any amount of alcohol during pregnancy can have \nheartbreaking, lifelong effects. We must increase efforts to reach out \nto all women of child-bearing age and connect those most at risk to \ntreatment and counseling services. This bill will make available grants \nto federally qualified health centers to implement and evaluate \nprograms to increase awareness and identification of FASD in those \nsettings. Participating health centers will be able to provide training \nto health care providers on identifying and educating women who are at \nrisk for alcohol consumption during pregnancy and on screening children \nfor FASD.\n  Another provision in this bill will create public awareness and \neducation campaigns in at-risk areas to further the prevention of this \ndisease. This bill will authorize the development and broadcast of \nnational public service announcements to raise public awareness of the \nrisks associated with alcohol consumption during pregnancy.\n  We must also move past the stigma of this devastating disease to \ntruly help those and their families who are affected by FASD get the \nhealth, education, counseling and support services they need and \ndeserve. This bill focuses provision of services in areas where FASD-\naffected individuals are already receiving help. In South Dakota, more \nthan 60 percent of people diagnosed with an FASD lived within a foster \ncare home for some part of their lives. With that in mind, our bill \nworks to train foster care workers and foster parents on how to best \ncommunicate with and serve children living with FASD.\n  Furthermore, it is estimated that 60 percent of individuals with FASD \nwill spend some time in a correctional institution or mental health \nfacility during their lives. Most individuals with FASD will commit \ntheir first crime between the ages of 9 and 14. To that end, our bill \nwill provide health care and judicial system workers with the resources \nthey need to work with and understand FASD-affected individuals when \nthey encounter them in health care settings or the court system.\n  The costs of this completely preventable condition to our country are \nstaggering, in dollars and in loss of human potential. According to a \n2003 study by the Lewin Group, an FAS birth carries lifetime health \ncosts of $860,000 to $4.2 million. The annual cost of FASD to South \nDakota, including medical treatment, special education services, and \nhome and residential care, is estimated to be $18 million. Nationally, \nthe cost for these services will approach $6 billion this year alone, \nbut neither of these estimates include the economic costs of lost \nproductivity.\n  In my home state of South Dakota, we have had great successes in \nworking on this issue. With the leadership of the health professionals \nat our esteemed universities, parents, and teachers, among countless \nothers, we have made some important progress in addressing FASD. This \nlegislation will bolster the efforts of these dedicated South Dakotans \nand many others across the country who are working hard to prevent FASD \nand support the children and families living with its consequences.\n  This bill will also provide much needed support in the area of \nresearch by requiring the National Institutes of Health to develop a \nresearch agenda focusing on the most promising avenues in diagnosis, \nintervention, and prevention, as well as factors that may mitigate the \neffects of fetal alcohol exposure.\n  I have long-supported efforts to put an end to this entirely \npreventable and destructive disease. I am pleased to be reintroducing \nthis bill with my colleagues and encourage all of our colleagues to \nconsider supporting this bill. I would also like to take a moment to \nthank former Senator Tom Daschle for his leadership on FASD. His \ncommitment to combating this illness continues in South Dakota and in \nthe lives of those who battle FASD every day.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. GILLIBRAND (for herself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 3155. A bill to require reporting on certain information and \ncommunications technologies of foreign countries, to develop action \nplans to improve the capacity of certain countries to combat \ncybercrime, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the International \nCybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act with Senator Kirsten \nGillibrand, which if enacted, will establish a framework for global \ncooperation on the fight against cybercrime. As the U.S. continues to \nwork on combating cybercrime here at home, we must simultaneously \ndirect our attention to the international arena. With bipartisan \nsupport and valued input from affected industry, we have worked \ntogether on drafting a bill that encompasses reporting measures, action \nplans, and multilateral efforts in support of government cooperation to \ndismantle this global threat.\n  This bill increases the U.S. Government's focus on combating \ncybercrime internationally by requiring the President to annually \nreport to Congress with respect to the information and communications \ntechnologies, ICT, capabilities of foreign countries, and the \nmultilateral efforts that are undertaken. In this digital age of global \nconnectivity, businesses and governments must always be mindful of a \npotential cyberattack. Cyberspace remains borderless, with no single \nproprietor. Accordingly, the U.S. must take the lead on maintaining the \nopenness of the Internet, while securing accountability.\n  The White House cybersecurity coordinator, Howard Schmidt, recently \ncommented about the cyberattacks on Google and referenced that the best \nthing to handle cyber conflicts and attacks abroad is to work with \ncountries involved, ``making sure they are doing a full-blown \ninvestigation and conferring with our law enforcement.'' This is one of \nthe objectives that I have sought to accomplish in this bill. If a \ncountry is a haven for cybercrime, or simply has demonstrated a pattern \nof uncooperative behavior with efforts to combat cybercrime, that \nnation must be held accountable. The government of each country must \nconduct criminal investigations and prosecute criminals when there is \ncredible evidence of\n\n[[Page S1876]]\n\ncybercrime incidents against the U.S. Government, our private entities \nor our people.\n  In this bill, the President would submit to Congress an annual report \nassessing the extent of use of the Internet in critical infrastructure, \ntelecommunications and the financial industry for each member state of \nthe United Nations. The report would assess the effectiveness of each \ncountry's legal and law enforcement systems in addressing cybercrime, \nand the measures taken by each country to ensure free flow of commerce \nand the protection of Internet consumers. The annual report would also \ndescribe U.S. actions to promote multilateral efforts, as well as other \nmultilateral efforts to prevent and investigate cybercrime, and develop \nbest practices to combat cybercrime. The report will also identify and \nprioritize countries that are at risk of becoming cybercrime havens due \nto their lack of technology and enforcement resources. We must be able \nto utilize our foreign assistance programs to help countries with low \nICT development, and ensure they are ready to stand on their own to \ncombat cybercrime, even long after the foreign assistance has ended.\n  Obviously, to be effective in our fight against cybercrime, the \nglobal community must work together to keep all countries accountable \nfor their actions. Toward that end, one year after submitting the first \nreport, the International Cybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act \nwould direct the President to create an action plan for each country of \ncyber concern, to assist the government of that country and create \nbenchmarks. If the country of cyber concern has not taken any of the \nrecommended actions to curtail or prevent cybercrime, various \nenforcement actions against the country may be taken, including \nprohibiting the approval of financing from the Overseas Private \nInvestment Corporation or the Export-Import Bank. With so many U.S. \ncompanies doing business overseas, we must do our part to safeguard \ntheir employees, their jobs, and their clients from cyberattacks. Our \nobjective is simple: We need international cooperation to increase \nassistance and prevention efforts of cybercrime from those countries \ndeemed to be of cyber concern. Without international cooperation, our \neconomy, security, and people will continue to be under threat.\n  To ensure that the most comprehensive information is considered, this \nbill encourages the President to reach out to industry, civil society \nand other interested parties in crafting the annual report. Senator \nGillibrand and I took the time to listen to many stakeholders and \ncreate a bill that addresses real concerns. To provide an outlet to \nbring together the input of affected and interested parties, we have \nworked with the Department of State to designate not only a senior \nofficial in Washington to coordinate and focus on cybercrime as a \nforeign policy issue, but the assignment of employees with primary \nresponsibility of cybercrime policy in each country or region that is a \nkey player in the fight to combat cybercrime globally. These government \nemployees assigned overseas will ensure that companies doing business \nabroad will have an additional channel to report and discuss \ncybercrime. I am pleased to say that this bill has gained vast support \nfrom all areas of the financial and high-tech sectors.\n  Cybercrime is a tangible threat to the security of the global \neconomy, which is why we need to coordinate our fight worldwide. Until \ncountries begin to take the necessary steps to fight criminals within \ntheir borders, cybercrime havens will continue to flourish. We do not \nhave the luxury to sit back and do nothing, and the International \nCybercrime Reporting and Cooperation Act will not only function as a \ndeterrent of cybercrime, but will prove to be an essential tool \nnecessary to keep the Internet open for business. Countries that \nknowingly permit cybercriminals to attack within their borders will now \nknow that the U.S. is watching, the global community is watching, and \nthere will be consequences for not acting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/23/senate-section/article/S1876-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 465--TO PERMIT THE SENATE TO AVOID UNNECESSARY DELAY \n         AND VOTE ON MATTERS FOR WHICH FLOOR DEBATE HAS CEASED\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG submitted the following resolution; which was referred \nto the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

Res. 466\n\n       Whereas United Nations Resolution 47/193, adopted by the \n     General Assembly on December 22, 1992, designates March 22 of \n     each year as World Day for Water;\n       Whereas a person needs a minimum of 20 liters of water per \n     day to live;\n       Whereas a person can live weeks without food, but only days \n     without water;\n       Whereas diseases related to inadequate water, sanitation, \n     and hygiene trigger 4,000,000,000 cases of diarrhea and \n     2,000,000,000 infections by parasitic intestinal worms \n     annually;\n       Whereas 50 percent of childhood malnutrition in the world \n     is caused by water- and sanitation-related diseases;\n       Whereas a child dies from a water-borne disease every 15 \n     seconds;\n       Whereas water- and sanitation-related diseases are the \n     leading cause of death for children under 5 years of age;\n       Whereas millions of women and children spend several hours \n     a day collecting water from distant, often polluted sources;\n       Whereas women and children bear disproportionate economic \n     and educational costs associated with unsafe drinking water \n     and poor sanitation;\n       Whereas every dollar spent on water and sanitation saves an \n     average of $8 in costs averted and productivity gained;\n       Whereas water- and sanitation-related diseases account for \n     80 percent of the sicknesses in developing countries;\n       Whereas 884,000,000 people lack access to an improved water \n     supply;\n       Whereas 2,500,000,000 people in the world lack access to \n     improved sanitation;\n       Whereas the 263 transboundary lake and river basins in the \n     world include territory in 145 countries and cover nearly \\1/\n     2\\ of the Earth's land surface;\n       Whereas climate change may cause more extreme floods and \n     droughts, increasing tension and potential clashes over \n     transboundary freshwater resources;\n       Whereas the global celebration of World Water Day is an \n     initiative that grew out of the 1992 United Nations \n     Conference on Environment and Development in Rio de Janeiro \n     to draw attention to the global water, sanitation, and \n     hygiene crisis;\n       Whereas the Plan of Implementation of the World Summit on \n     Sustainable Development, adopted by the 2002 Johannesburg \n     summit participants, including the United States, sets forth \n     the goal to reduce by \\1/2\\, between 1990 and 2015, ``the \n     proportion of people who are unable to reach or to afford \n     safe drinking water'' and ``the proportion of people who do \n     not have access to basic sanitation''; and\n       Whereas the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act of \n     2005 (Public Law 109-121) required the Secretary of State to \n     develop a strategy to ``elevate the role of water and \n     sanitation policy in the development of U.S. foreign policy \n     and improve the effectiveness of U.S. official programs \n     undertaken in support of the strategy'':\n       Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) supports the goals and ideals of World Water Day, which \n     will be observed on March 22;\n       (2) urges the Department of State, the United States Agency \n     for International Development, and all relevant Federal \n     departments and agencies to increase the efforts and \n     resources dedicated to--\n       (A) providing sustainable and equitable access to safe \n     drinking water and sanitation; and\n\n[[Page S1877]]\n\n       (B) improving the capacity for water resource management \n     for the poor and the very poor; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     the day with appropriate activities that promote awareness of \n     the importance of--\n       (A) access to clean water and adequate sanitation; and\n       (B) stakeholder cooperation on transboundary water \n     management.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, yesterday, countries around the world \ncelebrated World Water Day. This is a day to celebrate the progress we \nhave made protecting this most important resource and to reflect on the \nmany challenges we still face in providing clean, safe water to the \nworld's poor.\n  I was heartened to see that Secretary of State Clinton spoke at the \nNational Geographic World Water Day event on Monday. She and others at \nthe Department of State and USAID are doing a great job stepping up \nU.S. leadership on issues of clean water and sanitation.\n  Last year alone, American development assistance helped more than 4 \nmillion people access an improved water source for the first time. \nWhile we are proud of this help, we recognize that much more needs to \nbe done.\n  Today, nearly 1 billion people still lack access to safe drinking \nwater, and more than 2 billion still lack basic sanitation. Lack of \naccess to stable supplies of water is reaching critical proportions, \nparticularly for agricultural purposes. The problem will only worsen \nwith rapid urbanization worldwide. Experts suggest that another 1.2 \nbillion people will lack access to clean water and sanitation within 20 \nyears.\n  The overall economic loss in Africa alone due to lack of access to \nsafe water and basic sanitation is estimated at $28.4 billion a year. \nIn many poor nations, women and girls walk 2 or 3 hours or more each \nway, every day, to collect water that is often dirty and unsafe. The \nU.N. estimates that women and girls in sub-Saharan Africa spend a total \nof 40 billion working hours each year collecting water. That is \nequivalent to all of the hours worked in France in a year. Clearly, the \nworld needs to do more to help with such a basic human need.\n  That is why Senator Corker and I introduced the Paul Simon Water for \nthe World Act--a bill that would strengthen America's ability to \nprovide clean water and sanitation to 100 million of the world's poor \nover the next 6 years.\n  I am pleased that the bill is on the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee agenda and thank Senators Kerry, Lugar, Corker and so many \nothers for their support on this effort. I look forward to the bill's \nconsideration from the Foreign Relations Committee and urge my \ncolleagues to support passage of the bill once it has been reported.\n  The Paul Simon water for the world bill would put the United States \nin the forefront of providing poor people around the world with a most \nfundamental need--water. This is not an effort to create vast new \nprograms, but to focus our foreign assistance efforts on a \ncomprehensive, strategic series of investments related to water and \nsanitation. These are simple, commonsense steps that will make a real \ndifference in people's lives.\n  Our legislation would make the U.S. a leader in meeting key \nmillennium development goals for drinking water and sanitation, which \nis to reduce by half the proportion of people without safe water and \nsanitation by 2015. The bill targets aid to areas with the greatest \nneed. It helps build the capacity of poor nations to meet their own \nwater and sanitation challenges.\n\n  The Water for the World Act also supports research on clean water \ntechnologies and regional partnerships to find solutions to shared \nwater challenges. The bill provides technical assistance--best \npractices, credit authorities, and training--to help countries expand \naccess to clean water and sanitation. Our development experts will \ndesign the assistance based on local needs.\n  The bill would also strengthen the capacity of USAID and the State \nDepartment to implement development assistance efforts related to water \nand ramp up U.S. developmental and diplomatic leadership.\n  I know that these steps do make a difference. On a recent trip to \neast Africa, I saw American development assistance in Tanzania, the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, and Sudan and had an \nopportunity to look at a number of global health programs including \nclean water and sanitation.\n  One program in Ethiopia was provided by a nongovernmental \norganization called AMREF in the Kechene slum area of the capital of \nAddis Ababa. The 380 people living in the Kechene area have basically \nhad to carry in water for years because there was no running water. But \nbecause of an AMREF project, they were able to build 22 water kiosks in \nthe country and one in this slum area. It seems like something so \nsimple, but it has changed their lives. They now have a source of safe \ndrinking water.\n  Very near the small lean-tos they live in, they have two showers, \ntoilet facilities, and a source of clean drinking water--none of which \nthey had before. The small fee that is charged by the residents who \nmaintain it helps keep it clean and functional.\n  The residents couldn't help but beam with pride as we took a look at \na most basic yet critical source of community pride. Disease is down, \nthreats to women who otherwise would have to walk great distances to \nobtain water are down, and the community even has a small source of \nincome and employment. These are the kinds of simple self-sustaining \nprojects the U.S.should be supporting for the world's poor.\n  Water scarcity can also be a source of conflict and economic \ncalamity. Last year millions in the horn of Africa suffered from famine \nbecause of droughts. Without reliable supplies of water, farmers \nstruggle to grow crops, and areas once abundant with water are slowly \nbecoming barren.\n  I was reminded of these challenges talking to a government minister \nin Sudan. When I asked about the impact of climate change in his \ncountry, he immediately/wanted to take me to the Nile to show how the \nriver had shrunk in volume. Can you imagine the Nile River, which \nsustains a land where historic civilizations emerged, is now shrinking?\n  Helping other nations is in our national interest. Some say that now \nis not the time to invest in poor nations half a world away when our \neconomy is in crisis and so many Americans are hurting. That view is \nunderstandable. Recovering from this recession and rebuilding our \neconomy for the long-term must be, and is, our government's top \npriority. But investing in clean water for the world is a smart \nstrategy that will make our foreign assistance dollars achieve more--\nsomething we need in these hard economic times.\n  We know what the solutions are and we know they are cost effective. \nFor every dollar invested in water and sanitation, $8 are returned in \nincreased productivity and decreased health care costs. Just imagine \nhow bringing such a basic need to the world's poor will impact \nAmerica's image--particularly at a time when we are in a battle of \nideas in many parts of the world.\n  The Water for the World Act builds on the similarly named landmark \nlegislation--the Senator Paul Simon Water for the Poor Act--that at \nlong last made safe drinking water and sanitation a priority of U.S. \nforeign development assistance.\n  I owe my passion on water to my predecessor and long time mentor the \nlate Senator Paul Simon. Paul Simon was a prolific author and \nvisionary. He wrote books on a variety of compelling issues, and \nsolving the global water crisis was his last great campaign. He knew \nthe United States had the ability to be a leader on this issue.\n  Two years after Paul Simon died the Senator Paul Simon Water for the \nPoor Act was signed into law in December 2005. The act has made a big \ndifference to the world's poor, but we can do more. I can think of no \nbetter way to honor a man who did so much for so many, than to commit \nourselves to achieving this vision and the ideals of the Senator Paul \nSimon Water for the Poor Act.\n  Water is one of the defining challenges of the 21st century. No other \nissue is more important to human health, peace and security than access \nto sustainable supplies of water. As we celebrate World Water Day this \nweek, let us renew our commitment to making sure the world's poor have \naccess to this most basic human need.\n\n[[Page S1878]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/03/23/senate-section/article/S1878-1", "month": "03", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S1878]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 467--TO AUTHORIZE REPRESENTATION BY THE SENATE LEGAL \n             COUNSEL IN THE CASE OF SOLLARS V.

DISADVANTAGED BUSINESS ENTERPRISE PROGRAM \n                   ADJUSTMENTS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--It is the purpose of the airport \n     disadvantaged business enterprise program (49 U.S.C. 47107(e) \n     and 47113) to ensure that minority- and women-owned \n     businesses do not face barriers because of their race or \n     gender and so that they have a fair opportunity to compete in \n     Federally assisted airport contracts and concessions.\n       (b) Findings.--The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) While significant progress has occurred due to the \n     enactment of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise \n     program (49 U.S.C. 47107(e) and 47113), discrimination \n     continues to be a barrier for minority- and women-owned \n     businesses seeking to do business in airport-related markets. \n     This continuing barrier merits the continuation of the \n     airport disadvantaged business enterprise program.\n       (2) The Congress has received recent evidence of \n     discrimination from numerous sources, including congressional \n     hearings and roundtables, scientific reports, reports issued \n     by public and private agencies, news stories, reports of \n     discrimination by organizations and individuals, and \n     discrimination lawsuits. This evidence also shows that race- \n     and gender-neutral efforts alone are insufficient to address \n     the problem.\n       (3) This evidence demonstrates that discrimination across \n     the nation poses a barrier to full and fair participation in \n     airport related businesses of women business owners and \n     minority business owners in the racial groups detailed in \n     parts 23 and 26 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, and \n     has impacted firm development and many aspects of airport \n     related business in the public and private markets.\n       (4) This evidence provides a strong basis for the \n     continuation of the airport disadvantaged business enterprise \n     program and the airport concessions disadvantaged business \n     enterprise program.\n       (c) In General.--Section 47107(e) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraph (8) as paragraph (9); and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (7) the following:\n       ``(8) Mandatory training program for airport concessions.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Not later than one year after the date \n     of enactment of the FAA Air Transportation Modernization and \n     Safety Improvement Act, the Secretary shall establish a \n     mandatory training program for persons described in \n     subparagraph (C) on the certification of whether a small \n     business concern in airport concessions qualifies as a small \n     business concern owned and controlled by a socially and \n     economically disadvantaged individual for purposes of \n     paragraph (1).\n       ``(B) Implementation.--The training program may be \n     implemented by one or more private entities approved by the \n     Secretary.\n       ``(C) Participants.--A person referred to in paragraph (1) \n     is an official or agent of an airport owner or operator who \n     is required to provide a written assurance under paragraph \n     (1) that the airport owner or operator will meet the \n     percentage goal of paragraph (1) or who is responsible for \n     determining whether or not a small business concern in \n     airport concessions qualifies as a small business concern \n     owned and controlled by a socially and economically \n     disadvantaged individual for purposes of paragraph (1).\n\n[[Page S1917]]\n\n       ``(D) Authorization of appropriations.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated to the Secretary such sums as \n     may be necessary to carry out this paragraph.''.\n       (d) Report.--Not later than 24 months after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary shall submit a report to \n     the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation, the House of Representatives Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure, and other appropriate \n     committees of Congress on the results of the training program \n     conducted under section 47107(e)(8) of title 49, United \n     States Code, as added by subsection (a).\n       (e) Disadvantaged Business Enterprise Personal Net Worth \n     Cap;
