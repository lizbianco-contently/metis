Pursuant to the order of the Senate \non January 24, 1901, the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Burris, having been \nappointed by the Vice President, will now read Washington's Farewell \nAddress, as follows:\n  Mr. BURRIS, at the rostrum, read the Farewell Address, as follows:\n  To the President of the Senate and to the people of the United \nStates:\n  To the people of the United States:\n  Friends and Fellow Citizens: The period for a new election of a \ncitizen to administer the executive government of the United States \nbeing not far distant, and the time actually arrived when your thoughts \nmust be employed in designating the person who is to be clothed with \nthat important trust, it appears to me proper, especially as it may \nconduce to a more distinct expression of the public voice, that I \nshould now apprise you of the resolution I have formed, to decline \nbeing considered among the number of those out of whom a choice is to \nbe made.\n  I beg you at the same time to do me the justice to be assured, that \nthis resolution has not been taken without strict regard to all the \nconsiderations appertaining to the relation which binds a dutiful \ncitizen to his country--and that, in withdrawing the tender of service \nwhich silence in my situation might imply, I am influenced by no \ndiminution of zeal for your future interest, no deficiency of grateful \nrespect for your past kindness, but am supported by a full conviction \nthat the step is compatible with both.\n  The acceptance of, and continuance hitherto in the office to which \nyour suffrages have twice called me have been a uniform sacrifice of \ninclination to the opinion of duty, and to a deference for what \nappeared to be your desire. I constantly hoped that it would have been \nmuch earlier in my power, consistently with motives which I was not at \nliberty to disregard, to return to that retirement from which I had \nbeen reluctantly drawn. The strength of my inclination to do this, \nprevious to the last election, had even led to the preparation of an \naddress to declare it to you; but mature reflection on the then \nperplexed and critical posture of our affairs with foreign nations, and \nthe unanimous advice of persons entitled to my confidence, impelled me \nto abandon the idea.\n  I rejoice that the state of your concerns external as well as \ninternal, no longer renders the pursuit of inclination incompatible \nwith the sentiment of duty or propriety; and am persuaded, whatever \npartiality may be retained for my services, that in the present \ncircumstances of our country you will not disapprove my determination \nto retire.\n  The impressions with which I first undertook the arduous trust were \nexplained on the proper occasion. In the discharge of this trust, I \nwill only say that I have, with good intentions, contributed towards \nthe organization and administration of the government the best \nexertions of which a very fallible judgment was capable. Not \nunconscious in the outset of the inferiority of my qualifications, \nexperience, in my own eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, \nhas strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself; and, every day, \nthe increasing weight of years admonishes me more and more that the \nshade of retirement is as necessary to me as it will be welcome. \nSatisfied that if any circumstances have given peculiar value to my \nservices, they were temporary, I have the consolation to believe that, \nwhile choice and prudence\n\n[[Page S596]]\n\ninvite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it.\n  In looking forward to the moment which is intended to terminate the \ncareer of my political life, my feelings do not permit me to suspend \nthe deep acknowledgment of that debt of gratitude which I owe to my \nbeloved country for the many honors it has conferred upon me, still \nmore for the steadfast confidence with which it has supported me and \nfor the opportunities I have thence enjoyed of manifesting my \ninviolable attachment by services faithful and persevering, though in \nusefulness unequal to my zeal. If benefits have resulted to our country \nfrom these services, let it always be remembered to your praise and as \nan instructive example in our annals, that, under circumstances in \nwhich the passions agitated in every direction were liable to mislead, \namidst appearances sometimes dubious, vicissitudes of fortune often \ndiscouraging, in situations in which not unfrequently, want of success \nhas countenanced the spirit of criticism, the constancy of your support \nwas the essential prop of the efforts and a guarantee of the plans by \nwhich they were effected. Profoundly penetrated with this idea, I shall \ncarry it with me to my grave as a strong incitement to unceasing vows \nthat Heaven may continue to you the choicest tokens of its beneficence; \nthat your union and brotherly affection may be perpetual; that the free \nconstitution, which is the work of your hands, may be sacredly \nmaintained; that its administration in every department may be stamped \nwith wisdom and virtue; that, in fine, the happiness of the people of \nthese states, under the auspices of liberty, may be made complete by so \ncareful a preservation and so prudent a use of this blessing as will \nacquire to them the glory of recommending it to the applause, the \naffection, and adoption of every nation which is yet a stranger to it.\n  Here, perhaps, I ought to stop. But a solicitude for your welfare, \nwhich cannot end but with my life, and the apprehension of danger \nnatural to that solicitude, urge me on an occasion like the present to \noffer to your solemn contemplation, and to recommend to your frequent \nreview, some sentiments which are the result of much reflection, of no \ninconsiderable observation, and which appear to me all important to the \npermanency of your felicity as a people. These will be offered to you \nwith the more freedom as you can only see in them the disinterested \nwarnings of a parting friend, who can possibly have no personal motive \nto bias his counsel. Nor can I forget, as an encouragement to it, your \nindulgent reception of my sentiments on a former and not dissimilar \noccasion.\n  Interwoven as is the love of liberty with every ligament of your \nhearts, no recommendation of mine is necessary to fortify or confirm \nthe attachment.\n  The unity of government which constitutes you one people is also now \ndear to you. It is justly so; for it is a main pillar in the edifice of \nyour real independence, the support of your tranquility at home, your \npeace abroad, of your safety, of your prosperity, of that very liberty \nwhich you so highly prize. But as it is easy to foresee that, from \ndifferent causes and from different quarters, much pains will be taken, \nmany artifices employed, to weaken in your minds the conviction of this \ntruth; as this is the point in your political fortress against which \nthe batteries of internal and external enemies will be most constantly \nand actively (though often covertly and insidiously) directed, it is of \ninfinite movement that you should properly estimate the immense value \nof your national Union to your collective and individual happiness; \nthat you should cherish a cordial, habitual, and immovable attachment \nto it; accustoming yourselves to think and speak of it as of the \npalladium of your political safety and prosperity; watching for its \npreservation with jealous anxiety; discountenancing whatever may \nsuggest even a suspicion that it can, in any event, be abandoned; and \nindignantly frowning upon the first dawning of every attempt to \nalienate any portion of our country from the rest, or to enfeeble the \nsacred ties which now link together the various parts.\n  For this you have every inducement of sympathy and interest. Citizens \nby birth or choice of a common country, that country has a right to \nconcentrate your affections. The name of American, which belongs to you \nin your national capacity, must always exalt the just pride of \npatriotism more than any appellation derived from local \ndiscriminations. With slight shades of difference, you have the same \nreligion, manners, habits, and political principles. You have in a \ncommon cause fought and triumphed together. The independence and \nliberty you possess, are the work of joint councils and joint efforts--\nof common dangers, sufferings and successes.\n  But these considerations, however powerfully they address themselves \nto your sensibility, are greatly outweighed by those which apply more \nimmediately to your interest. Here every portion of our country finds \nthe most commanding motives for carefully guarding and preserving the \nUnion of the whole.\n  The North, in an unrestrained intercourse with the South, protected \nby the equal laws of a common government, finds in the productions of \nthe latter, great additional resources of maritime and commercial \nenterprise, and precious materials of manufacturing industry. The \nSouth, in the same intercourse, benefiting by the same agency of the \nNorth, sees its agriculture grow and its commerce expand. Turning \npartly into its own channels the seamen of the North, it finds its \nparticular navigation invigorated; and while it contributes, in \ndifferent ways, to nourish and increase the general mass of the \nnational navigation, it looks forward to the protection of a maritime \nstrength to which itself is unequally adapted. The East, in a like \nintercourse with the West, already finds, and in the progressive \nimprovement of interior communications by land and water will more and \nmore find a valuable vent for the commodities which it brings from \nabroad or manufactures at home. The West derives from the East supplies \nrequisite to its growth and comfort--and what is perhaps of still \ngreater consequence, it must of necessity owe the secure enjoyment of \nindispensable outlets for its own productions to the weight, influence, \nand the future maritime strength of the Atlantic side of the Union, \ndirected by an indissoluble community of interest as one nation. Any \nother tenure by which the West can hold this essential advantage, \nwhether derived from its own separate strength or from an apostate and \nunnatural connection with any foreign power, must be intrinsically \nprecarious.\n  While then every part of our country thus feels an immediate and \nparticular interest in union, all the parts combined cannot fail to \nfind in the united mass of means and efforts greater strength, greater \nresource, proportionably greater security from external danger, a less \nfrequent interruption of their peace by foreign nations; and, what is \nof inestimable value! they must derive from union an exemption from \nthose broils and wars between themselves which so frequently afflict \nneighboring countries not tied together by the same government, which \ntheir own rivalships alone would be sufficient to produce, but which \nopposite foreign alliances, attachments, and intrigues would stimulate \nand embitter. Hence likewise, they will avoid the necessity of those \novergrown military establishments, which under any form of government \nare inauspicious to liberty, and which are to be regarded as \nparticularly hostile to republican liberty. In this sense it is, that \nyour Union ought to be considered as a main prop of your liberty, and \nthat the love of the one ought to endear to you the preservation of the \nother.\n  These considerations speak a persuasive language to every reflecting \nand virtuous mind, and exhibit the continuance of the Union as a \nprimary object of patriotic desire. Is there a doubt whether a common \ngovernment can embrace so large a sphere? Let experience solve it. To \nlisten to mere speculation in such a case were criminal. We are \nauthorized to hope that a proper organization of the whole, with the \nauxiliary agency of governments for the respective subdivisions, will \nafford a happy issue to the experiment. It is well worth a fair and \nfull experiment. With such powerful and obvious motives to union, \naffecting all parts of our country, while experience shall not have \ndemonstrated its impracticability, there will always be reason to \ndistrust the patriotism of those who\n\n[[Page S597]]\n\nin any quarter may endeavor to weaken its bands.\n  In contemplating the causes which may disturb our Union, it occurs as \nmatter of serious concern, that any ground should have been furnished \nfor characterizing parties by geographical discriminations--northern \nand southern--Atlantic and western; whence designing men may endeavor \nto excite a belief that there is a real difference of local interests \nand views. One of the expedients of party to acquire influence within \nparticular districts, is to misrepresent the opinions and aims of other \ndistricts. You cannot shield yourself too much against the jealousies \nand heart burnings which spring from these misrepresentations. They \ntend to render alien to each other those who ought to be bound together \nby fraternal affection. The inhabitants of our western country have \nlately had a useful lesson on this head. They have seen, in the \nnegotiation by the executive--and in the unanimous ratification by the \nSenate--of the treaty with Spain, and in the universal satisfaction at \nthat event throughout the United States, a decisive proof how unfounded \nwere the suspicions propagated among them of a policy in the general \ngovernment and in the Atlantic states, unfriendly to their interests in \nregard to the Mississippi. They have been witnesses to the formation of \ntwo treaties, that with Great Britain and that with Spain, which secure \nto them everything they could desire, in respect to our foreign \nrelations, towards confirming their prosperity. Will it not be their \nwisdom to rely for the preservation of these advantages on the Union by \nwhich they were procured? Will they not henceforth be deaf to those \nadvisers, if such they are, who would sever them from their brethren \nand connect them with aliens?\n  To the efficacy and permanency of your Union, a government for the \nwhole is indispensable. No alliances, however strict, between the parts \ncan be an adequate substitute. They must inevitably experience the \ninfractions and interruptions which all alliances, in all times, have \nexperienced. Sensible of this momentous truth, you have improved upon \nyour first essay, by the adoption of a Constitution of government, \nbetter calculated than your former, for an intimate Union and for the \nefficacious management of your common concerns. This government, the \noffspring of our own choice, uninfluenced and unawed, adopted upon full \ninvestigation and mature deliberation, completely free in its \nprinciples, in the distribution of its powers, uniting security with \nenergy, and containing within itself a provision for its own amendment, \nhas a just claim to your confidence and your support. Respect for its \nauthority, compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures, are \nduties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true liberty. The basis of \nour political systems is the right of the people to make and to alter \ntheir constitutions of government.--But the Constitution which at any \ntime exists, until changed by an explicit and authentic act of the \nwhole people, is sacredly obligatory upon all. The very idea of the \npower, and the right of the people to establish government, presupposes \nthe duty of every individual to obey the established government.\n  All obstructions to the execution of the laws, all combinations and \nassociations under whatever plausible character, with the real design \nto direct, control, counteract, or awe the regular deliberation and \naction of the constituted authorities, are destructive of this \nfundamental principle, and of fatal tendency. They serve to organize \nfaction; to give it an artificial and extraordinary force; to put in \nthe place of the delegated will of the nation the will of a party, \noften a small but artful and enterprising minority of the community; \nand, according to the alternate triumphs of different parties, to make \nthe public administration the mirror of the ill concerted and \nincongruous projects of faction, rather than the organ of consistent \nand wholesome plans digested by common councils, and modified by mutual \ninterests. However combinations or associations of the above \ndescription may now and then answer popular ends, they are likely, in \nthe course of time and things, to become potent engines, by which \ncunning, ambitious, and unprincipled men will be enabled to subvert the \npower of the people, and to usurp for themselves the reins of \ngovernment; destroying afterwards the very engines which have lifted \nthem to unjust dominion.\n  Towards the preservation of your government and the permanency of \nyour present happy state, it is requisite, not only that you steadily \ndiscountenance irregular opposition to its acknowledged authority but \nalso that you resist with care the spirit of innovation upon its \nprinciples, however specious the pretext. One method of assault may be \nto effect, in the forms of the Constitution, alterations which will \nimpair the energy of the system and thus to undermine what cannot be \ndirectly overthrown. In all the changes to which you may be invited, \nremember that time and habit are at least as necessary to fix the true \ncharacter of governments as of other human institutions, that \nexperience is the surest standard by which to test the real tendency of \nthe existing constitution of a country, that facility in changes upon \nthe credit of mere hypotheses and opinion exposes to perpetual change \nfrom the endless variety of hypotheses and opinion; and remember, \nespecially, that for the efficient management of your common interests \nin a country so extensive as ours, a government of as much vigor as is \nconsistent with the perfect security of liberty is indispensable; \nliberty itself will find in such a government, with powers properly \ndistributed and adjusted, its surest guardian. It is indeed little else \nthan a name, where the government is too feeble to withstand the \nenterprises of fraction, to confine each member of the society within \nthe limits prescribed by the laws, and to maintain all in the secure \nand tranquil enjoyment of the rights of person and property.\n  I have already intimated to you the danger of parties in the state, \nwith particular reference to the founding of them on geographical \ndiscriminations. Let me now take a more comprehensive view and warn you \nin the most solemn manner against the baneful effects of the spirit of \nparty, generally.\n  This spirit, unfortunately, is inseparable from our nature, having \nits root in the strongest passions of the human mind. It exists under \ndifferent shapes in all governments, more or less stifled, controlled, \nor repressed; but in those of the popular form it is seen in its \ngreatest rankness, and is truly their worst enemy.\n  The alternate domination of one faction over another, sharpened by \nthe spirit of revenge natural to party dissension, which in different \nages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities, is \nitself a frightful despotism. But this leads at length to a more formal \nand permanent despotism. The disorders and miseries which result \ngradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the \nabsolute power of an individual; and, sooner or later, the chief of \nsome prevailing faction, more able or more fortunate than his \ncompetitors, turns this disposition to the purpose of his own elevation \non the ruins of public liberty.\n  Without looking forward to an extremity of this kind, (which \nnevertheless ought not to be entirely out of sight) the common and \ncontinual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make it in \nthe interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain it.\n  It serves always to distract the public councils, and enfeeble the \npublic administration. It agitates the community with ill founded \njealousies and false alarms, kindles the animosity of one part against \nanother, forments occasional riot and insurrection. It opens the door \nto foreign influence and corruption, which finds a facilitated access \nto the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus \nthe policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and \nwill of another.\n  There is an opinion that parties in free countries are useful checks \nupon the administration of the government, and serve to keep alive the \nspirit of liberty. This within certain limits is probably true--and in \ngovernments of a monarchial cast, patriotism may look with indulgence, \nif not with favor, upon the spirit of party. But in those of the \npopular character, in governments purely elective, it is a spirit not \nto be encouraged. From their natural tendency, it is certain there will \nalways be enough of that spirit for every salutary\n\n[[Page S598]]\n\npurpose. And there being constant danger of excess, the effort ought to \nbe by force of public opinion to mitigate and assuage it. A fire not to \nbe quenched, it demands a uniform vigilance to prevent it bursting into \na flame, lest instead of warming, it should consume.\n  It is important likewise, that the habits of thinking in a free \ncountry should inspire caution in those entrusted with its \nadministration to confine themselves within their respective \nconstitutional spheres, avoiding in the exercise of the powers of one \ndepartment to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends \nto consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to \ncreate, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A just \nestimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which \npredominates in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the \ntruth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the \nexercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into \ndifferent depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the \npublic weal against invasions of the others, has been evinced by \nexperiments ancient and modern, some of them in our country and under \nour own eyes. To preserve them must be as necessary as to institute \nthem. If, in the opinion of the people, the distribution or \nmodification of the constitutional powers be in any particular wrong, \nlet it be corrected by an amendment in the way which the Constitution \ndesignates. But let there be no change by usurpation; for though this, \nin one instance, may be the instrument of good, it is the customary \nweapon by which free governments are destroyed. The precedent must \nalways greatly overbalance in permanent evil any partial or transient \nbenefit which the use can at any time yield.\n  Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political \nprosperity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain \nwould that man claim the tribute of patriotism, who should labor to \nsubvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest props of \nthe duties of men and citizens. The mere politician, equally with the \npious man, ought to respect and to cherish them. A volume could not \ntrace all their connections with private and public felicity. Let it \nsimply be asked where is the security for property, for reputation, for \nlife, if the sense of religious obligation desert the oaths, which are \nthe instruments of investigation in courts of justice? And let us with \ncaution indulge the supposition that morality can be maintained without \nreligion. Whatever may be conceded to the influence of refined \neducation on minds of peculiar structure, reason and experience both \nforbid us to expect that national morality can prevail in exclusion of \nreligious principle.\n  It is substantially true, that virtue or morality is a necessary \nspring of popular government. The rule, indeed, extends with more or \nless force to every species of free government. Who that is a sincere \nfriend to it can look with indifference upon attempts to shake the \nfoundation of the fabric?\n  Promote, then, as an object of primary importance, institutions for \nthe general diffusion of knowledge. In proportion as the structure of a \ngovernment gives force to public opinion, it is essential that the \npublic opinion should be enlightened.\n  As a very important source of strength and security, cherish public \ncredit. One method of preserving it is to use it as sparingly as \npossible, avoiding occasions of expense by cultivating peace, but \nremembering, also, that timely disbursements, to prepare for danger, \nfrequently prevent much greater disbursements to repel it; avoiding \nlikewise the accumulation of debt, not only by shunning occasions of \nexpense, but by vigorous exertions in time of peace to discharge the \ndebts which unavoidable wars may have occasioned, not ungenerously \nthrowing upon posterity the burden which we ourselves ought to bear. \nThe execution of these maxims belongs to your representatives, but it \nis necessary that public opinion should cooperate. To facilitate to \nthem the performance of their duty, it is essential that you should \npractically bear in mind that towards the payment of debts there must \nbe revenue; that to have revenue there must be taxes; that no taxes can \nbe devised which are not more or less inconvenient and unpleasant; that \nthe intrinsic embarrassment inseparable from the selection of the \nproper objects (which is always a choice of difficulties) ought to be a \ndecisive motive for a candid construction of the conduct of the \ngovernment in making it, and for a spirit of acquiescence in the \nmeasures for obtaining revenue, which the public exigencies may at any \ntime dictate.\n  Observe good faith and justice towards all nations; cultivate peace \nand harmony with all; religion and morality enjoin this conduct, and \ncan it be that good policy does not equally enjoin it? It will be \nworthy of a free, enlightened, and, at no distant period, a great \nnation, to give to mankind the magnanimous and too novel example of a \npeople always guided by an exalted justice and benevolence. Who can \ndoubt but, in the course of time and things the fruits of such a plan \nwould richly repay any temporary advantages which might be lost by a \nsteady adherence to it? Can it be that Providence has not connected the \npermanent felicity of a nation with its virtue? The experiment, at \nleast, is recommended by every sentiment which ennobles human nature. \nAlas! is it rendered impossible by its vices?\n  In the execution of such a plan nothing is more essential than that \npermanent, inveterate antipathies against particular nations and \npassionate attachment for others should be excluded and that in place \nof them just and amicable feelings towards all should be cultivated. \nThe nation which indulges towards another an habitual hatred, or an \nhabitual fondness, is in some degree a slave. It is a slave to its \nanimosity, or to its affection, either of which is sufficient to lead \nit astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy in one nation \nagainst another disposes each more readily to offer insult and injury, \nto lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be haughty and \nintractable when accidental or trifling occasions of dispute occur. \nHence frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed, and bloody contests. \nThe nation, prompted by ill will and resentment, sometimes impels to \nwar the government, contrary to the best calculations of policy. The \ngovernment sometimes participates in the national propensity and adopts \nthrough passion what reason would reject; at other times, it makes the \nanimosity of the nation's subservient to projects of hostility, \ninstigated by pride, ambition and other sinister and pernicious \nmotives. The peace often, sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations, has \nbeen the victim.\n  So likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation for another \nproduces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation, \nfacilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest in cases \nwhere no real common interest exists and infusing into one the enmities \nof the other, betrays the former into a participation in the quarrels \nand wars of the latter, without adequate inducements or justifications. \nIt leads also to concessions, to the favorite nation of privileges \ndenied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation making the \nconcessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought to have been \nretained and by exciting jealously, ill will, and a disposition to \nretaliate in the parties from whom equal privileges are withheld. And \nit gives to ambitious, corrupted or deluded citizens (who devote \nthemselves to the favorite nation) facility to betray or sacrifice the \ninterests of their own country, without odium, sometimes even with \npopularity gilding with the appearances of virtuous sense of \nobligation, a commendable deference for public opinion, or a laudable \nzeal for public good, the base or foolish compliances of ambition, \ncorruption, or infatuation.\n  As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attachments \nare particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and independent \npatriot. How many opportunities do they afford to tamper with domestic \nfactions, to practice the arts of seduction, to mislead public opinion, \nto influence or awe the public councils! Such an attachment of a small \nor weak towards a great and powerful nation, dooms the former to be the \nsatellite of the latter.\n  Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to \nbelieve me, fellow citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to be \nconstantly awake, since history and experience prove, that foreign \ninfluence is one of the most baneful foes of republican government. But \nthat jealously to be useful\n\n[[Page S599]]\n\nmust be impartial; else it becomes the instrument of the very influence \nto be avoided, instead of a defense against it. Excessive partiality \nfor one foreign nation and excessive dislike for another cause those \nwhom they actuate to see danger only on one side, and serve to veil and \neven second the arts of influence on the other. Real patriots, who may \nresist the intrigues of the favorite, are liable to become suspected \nand odious, while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence \nof the people to surrender their interests.\n  The great rule of conduct for us in regard to foreign nations is, in \nextending our commercial relations, to have with them as little \npolitical connection as possible. So far as we have already formed \nengagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here let us \nstop.\n  Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none or a \nvery remote relation. Hence, she must be engaged in frequent \ncontroversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our \nconcerns. Hence therefore it must be unwise in us to implicate \nourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her \npolitics or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friendships \nor enmities.\n  Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to pursue a \ndifferent course. If we remain one people, under an efficient \ngovernment, the period is not far off when we may defy material injury \nfrom external annoyance; when we may take such an attitude as will \ncause the neutrality we may at any time resolve upon to be scrupulously \nrespected; when belligerent nations, under the impossibility of making \nacquisitions upon us, will not lightly hazard the giving us \nprovocation, when we may choose peace or war, as our interest guided by \njustice shall counsel.\n  Why forgo the advantages of so peculiar a situation? Why quit our own \nto stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweaving our destiny with \nthat of any part of Europe, entangle our peace and prosperity in the \ntoils of European ambition, rivalship, interest, humor, or caprice?\n  It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any \nportion of the foreign world--so far, I mean, as we are now at liberty \nto do it, for let me not be understood as capable of patronizing \ninfidelity to existing engagements. (I hold the maxim no less \napplicable to public than private affairs, that honesty is always the \nbest policy)--I repeat it, therefore, let those engagements be observed \nin their genuine sense. But in my opinion, it is unnecessary, and would \nbe unwise to extend them.\n  Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establishments, on \na respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to temporary \nalliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n  Harmony, liberal intercourse with all nations, are recommended by \npolicy, humanity, and interest. But even our commercial policy should \nhold an equal and impartial hand: neither seeking nor granting \nexclusive favors or preferences; consulting the natural course of \nthings; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of \ncommerce but forcing nothing; establishing with powers so disposed, in \norder to give trade a stable course--in order to give to trade a stable \ncourse, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the \ngovernment to support them, conventional rules of intercourse, the best \nthat present circumstances and mutual opinion will permit, but \ntemporary, and liable to be from time to time abandoned or varied as \nexperience and circumstances shall dictate; constantly keeping in view, \nthat it is folly in one nation to look for disinterested favors from \nanother--that is must pay with a portion of its independence for \nwhatever it may accept under that character--that by such acceptance, \nit may place itself in the condition of having given equivalents for \nnominal favors and yet of being reproached with ingratitude for not \ngiving more. There can be no greater error than to expect or calculate \nupon real favors from nation to nation. It is an illusion which \nexperience must cure, which a just pride ought to discard.\n  In offering to you, my countrymen, these counsels of an old and \naffectionate friend, I dare not hope they will make the strong and \nlasting impression I could wish--that they will control the usual \ncurrent of the passions or prevent our nation from running the course \nwhich has hitherto marked the destiny of nations. But if I may even \nflatter myself that they may be productive of some partial benefit, \nsome occasional good, that they may now and then recur to moderate the \nfury of party spirit, to warn against the mischiefs of foreign \nintrigue, to guard against the impostures of pretended patriotism--this \nhope will be a full recompense for the solicitude for your welfare by \nwhich they have been dictated.\n  How far in the discharge of my official duties, I have been guided by \nthe principles which have been delineated, the public records and other \nevidences of my conduct must witness to you and to the world. To \nmyself, the assurance of my own conscience is, that I have, at least, \nbelieved myself to be guided by them.\n  In relation to the still subsisting war in Europe, my proclamation of \nthe 22d of April 1793 is the index to my plan. Sanctioned by your \napproving voice and by that of your representatives in both houses of \nCongress, the spirit of that measure has continually governed me, \nuninfluenced by any attempts to deter or divert me from it.\n  After deliberate examination with the aid of the best lights I could \nobtain, I was well satisfied that our country, under all the \ncircumstances of the case, had a right to take, and was bound in duty \nand interest to take--a neutral position. Having taken it, I \ndetermined, as far as should depend upon me, to maintain it with \nmoderation, perseverance and firmness.\n  The considerations which respect the right to hold this conduct it is \nnot necessary on this occasion to detail. I will only observe that, \naccording to my understanding of the matter, that right, so far from \nbeing denied by any of the belligerent powers, has been virtually \nadmitted by all.\n  The duty of holding a neutral conduct may be inferred, without \nanything more, from the obligation which justice and humanity impose on \nevery nation, in cases in which it is free to act, to maintain \ninviolate the relations of peace and amity towards other nations.\n  The inducements of interest for observing that conduct will best be \nreferred to your own reflections and experience. With me, a predominant \nmotive has been to endeavor to gain time to our country to settle and \nmature its yet recent institutions and to progress, without \ninterruption to that degree of strength and consistency which is \nnecessary to give it, humanly speaking, the command of its own \nfortunes.\n  Though in reviewing the incidents of my administration I am \nunconscious of intentional error, I am nevertheless too sensible of my \ndefects not to think it probable that I may have committed many errors. \nWhatever they may be, I fervently beseech the Almighty to avert or \nmitigate the evils to which they may tend. I shall also carry with me \nthe hope that my country will never cease to view them with indulgence \nand that, after forty-five years of my life dedicated to its service \nwith an upright zeal, the faults of incompetent abilities will be \nconsigned to oblivion, as myself must soon be to the mansions of rest.\n  Relying on its kindness in this as in other things, and actuated by \nthat fervent love towards it which is so natural to a man who views in \nit the native soil of himself and his progenitors for several \ngenerations, I anticipate with pleasing expectation that retreat, in \nwhich I promise myself to realize without alloy the sweet enjoyment of \npartaking in the midst of my fellow citizens the benign influence of \ngood laws under a free government--the ever favorite object of my \nheart, and the happy reward, as I trust, of our mutual cares, labors \nand dangers.\n                                                       Geo. Washington.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S600]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/22/senate-section/article/S600-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S600-S604]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n COMMERCE, JUSTICE, SCIENCE, AND RELATED AGENCIES APPROPRIATIONS ACT, \n                                  2010\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for as much time as I may consume.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, later this afternoon, the Senate will \nconsider a piece of legislation to try to create some jobs. I \nunderstand that the Federal Government, by passing legislation, doesn't \nautomatically create jobs, although it can in some circumstances. For \nexample, a summer youth program can put some kids to work in the summer \nif the Federal Government or State government sponsors it. By and \nlarge, the private sector creates jobs.\n  This piece of legislation this afternoon is a payroll tax exemption--\ntrying to encourage small- and medium-sized businesses that are ready \nto expand and capable to expand--giving them extra incentive to hire \npeople and put them back to work. Section 179, business expensing, is \nanother incentive to business. The highway trust fund extension--we \nknow building highways puts people to work almost instantly. We have \nplenty of backlog in highway and bridge repair.\n  This is a piece of legislation that will put people back to work and \ncreate the incentives for companies--whether it is highway contractors \nor small- and medium-sized businesses--to hire those employees. Why is \nthat important? Because we have probably somewhere around 25 million \npeople today who wake up without a job. The hard-core unemployment, as \nknown in the statistics, is about 17 million people. But 20 million to \n26 million people are effectively unemployed in this country. They woke \nup this morning wanting a job and looking for a job but cannot find a \njob.\n  I recognize that one of the prevailing moods in the Congress is to do \nnothing. Those are the two words that best describe what we have seen, \nparticularly from the minority recently, ``do nothing.'' It is a pretty \neasy position to take, but it is so wrong. Generally, it has always \nbeen wrong on the significant issues of the day. If this country \ndoesn't believe that having 20 million, 25 or 26 million people out of \nwork--and they don't believe that is something that is significantly \nwrong, something that weakens our country, then there is something \nwrong with their thinking.\n  This is a serious and urgent priority the Congress must address.\n  The do-nothing approach to public policy is something we have seen \nbefore. It goes all the way back to the basic rights of people--women's \nrights, civil rights, workers' rights. I have spoken on the floor \npreviously, talking about the struggles to improve in those areas. \nThose struggles were against those who said let's do nothing. Women \ndidn't have the right to vote for over the first half of this country's \nexistence. They weren't allowed to vote. It took the beating in \nOccoquan Prison in 1917, when Lucy Burns, at night, was manacled and a \nchain between her wrists, hung over a cell door, with blood running \ndown her arms all night long; and Alice Paul, a tube forced down her \nthroat, force-feeding, to where she nearly drowned in her own vomit. \nShe and 33 other women were arrested and chained to the White House \ngate. That is how women got the right to vote in this country. It is \nnot because we had people who said let's do nothing, it is fine that \nwomen cannot vote. People pushed back and said what is going on is \nwrong.\n  Workers' rights. I wrote a book about the struggle to get workers' \nrights in this country. I said James Fyler died of lead poisoning. \nJames Fyler was shot 54 times. Why? He felt people who went underground \nto mine for coal ought to be paid a fair wage. Think of the struggle \nfor workers' rights and civil rights. I served in the Congress with \nJohn Lewis in the House of Representatives, who was beaten in \nMontgomery, AL. He was beaten because he believed one ought to be able \nto sit at a lunch counter as an African American. In some areas, it was \nagainst the law to drink from certain water fountains and ride in the \nfront of the bus. It was against the law to sit at the lunch counter at \nWoolworth's.\n  Workers rights, civil rights, women's rights--all these things were \nstruggles. There were those all along the way who said let's do \nnothing. Today, they say let's do nothing about the fact that 25 \nmillion or 26 million Americans are out of work.\n  By the way, here is a new report that shows that not everybody is out \nof work. We know that. A lot of people are working. In fact, there is \nfull employment, according to the Northeastern Center for Labor \nStudies, among those who earn more than $150,000 a year. Their \nunemployment is 3 percent, but that is called full employment. Not \neverybody is having trouble. The more affluent Americans have full \nemployment. It is a lot of folks at the bottom who are struggling and \ngetting laid off and are out looking for work. So change is very hard.\n  The question is, Is this Congress going to do something about it? \nDoes it care about it? In every case, you can go back a century, and \nthe wailing and the whining of those who have opposed everything for \nthe first time and said it can't be done, it will not work, it will \nruin our country--they are the ones who dug in their heels and said \nlet's do nothing.\n  What about today? What is our responsibility today? Well, it seems to \nme, in this economic crisis--a crisis, by the way, that is not some \nnatural disaster; this wasn't some massive storm that enveloped \nAmerica, some tornado or cyclone or some massive natural event that \noccurred. This was an economic wreck that was caused by unbelievable \navarice and greed in some of our Nation's largest institutions. There \nwas nearly criminal negligence on the part of regulators who wouldn't \nregulate. There was shameful, greedy behavior by people at the top of \nthe financial food chain, whose business philosophy was to maximize \nprofits at any cost, it doesn't matter.\n  Now we find ourselves in a desperate position. Yes, I think we have a \nfoundation where we have found the bottom and are going to try to build \nfrom this point on. The question is, How do we move this process along \nto give hope to people who, at this point, get up this morning and \ndon't have a job? Some say let's work on the faucet--that is what this \nbill is today, and I will support it. Let's work on the faucet that \nwill put more jobs in this tank. I say also let's work on the drain \nbecause you can turn the faucet on, if the drain is wide open you are \nnot going to make much headway. I will talk about the drain, but first \nI will talk about the faucet.\n  There is no social program as important as a good job that pays well. \nThat is why this needs to be a priority with us. It is why we should \npass this piece of legislation this afternoon. No, it is not going to \nfix every issue. I understand that. I mentioned we have full employment \nwith the people on the top. What about the people who shower after \nwork--the people who work hard all day and have to take a shower after \nwork to get rid of the evidence of that work? Well, let's talk about \nthem for a moment. I met with a group of people who were losing their \njobs just before Christmas this year--500 people who worked for a \ncompany that made one of America's best products. They were told their \nplant was going to close down--500 of them. Can you imagine the \nChristmas they spent with their families, because there were no other \njobs in that area. Yet 500 jobs is a reasonably small amount of the \ntotal number of jobs we have been losing.\n\n[[Page S601]]\n\nThat describes the drain on this economy of ours with respect to jobs. \nLet me talk a bit about that.\n\n  I am talking about particularly jobs in which Americans make \nsomething, produce something. Our manufacturing sector is rapidly \nlosing steam. We have lost 5\\1/2\\ million manufacturing jobs since \n2000. We now have 11.7 million manufacturing jobs left. That is the \nfewest number of manufacturing jobs since the early 1940s. Since 2001, \nwe have seen the closing of 42,000 factories in America. One-third of \nall the factories that employ over 1,000 people have closed since 2001 \nin this country. They are gone. Some people blame the workers because \nthey want a living wage. They say: If you cannot compete with 50 cents \nan hour in China, tough luck, you don't deserve to compete. It is an \ninternational economic system and if you cannot compete, that is too \nbad. That is a pretty ignorant way to look at it. This is a global \neconomy, but who decided, after spending a century lifting standards, \nrequiring safe workplaces, better labor standards, better wages and \nbenefits, that all that should be washed away because we can't compete \nwith somebody who worked for 50 cents an hour, somebody who works in a \nfactory where they live in cinder block, little rooms, with 12 in a \nroom at night, and they work 7 days a week, 12 to 14 hours a day--who \ndecided that ought to be the standard with which we have to compete? \nThat doesn't make sense to me.\n  I guess there are people who believe that ``made in the USA'' doesn't \nmatter anymore. We don't have to be a country that manufactures. If we \ndon't have a strong manufacturing base, we will not long remain a world \neconomic power. That is a fact. This manufacturing base of ours is \nbeing sequentially and systematically destroyed.\n  We have, essentially, lost the area of producing machine tools in \nthis country. We have lost electronics. We have lost automobile parts. \nWe have lost furniture manufacturing. We have lost telecom. We have \nlost appliances. I am talking about the manufacture of these things. In \n1960, 30 percent of our GDP in this country was manufacturing. Now it \nis 11 percent. There are 1.2 billion cell phones sold on this planet \nevery year. Not one is made in America--1.2 billion and not one is made \nin America. We have lost 60 percent of the furniture manufacturing. You \ndon't need to know all the stories, but I have spoken about the one we \nlost in Pennsylvania. Pennsylvania House Furniture, which was an \nupscale fine furniture company. Governor Rendell did everything he \ncould to stop it from moving to China. They used a special Pennsylvania \nwood to make this furniture. What they did is closed the plant and \nshipped the wood to China, made the furniture there and shipped it back \nand called it American production. The last piece of furniture that \ncame down off the line--for a company that lasted 100 years, making \ntop-of-the-line furniture--the very last piece of furniture, those \nworkmen in that plant turned it over and all the people who worked in \nthe plant signed their names because they said there would not be \nfurniture such as this made again. Their jobs were gone in an instant, \nand 60 percent of furniture manufacturing is gone.\n  The list goes on and on and on. Eighty-four percent of the circuit \nboards, which used to be ours--we developed circuit boards--are now \nmade in Asia. We defend, as all of us understand, our military security \naggressively. Do we care about our economic security--that we are \nhollowing out the manufacturing base of our country? Apparently not.\n  In this economic recovery bill that was passed, I included on the \nSenate side something called ``Buy American.'' One would have thought I \nwas exploding all of the relationships that existed around the globe. \nPeople here even had apoplectic seizures: What are you doing? Are you \ntrying to start a trade war? No, I was not. ``Buy American'' is \nperfectly permitted in the WTO trade rules. In fact, Mr. Pascal Lamy, \nthe WTO chief, says ``Buy American meets world trade rules.'' If we had \nnot put a ``Buy American'' provision in so State and local governments \nand the Federal Government, when contracting to buy steel and to buy \nproducts with which to make highways and other items we are investing \nin, had we not done that, we would be spending our taxpayers' money to \npurchase from China, to import the steel from China. I thought we were \ndoing that to put Americans back to work. So I put in a ``Buy \nAmerican'' provision. If you read the New York Times and the Washington \nPost, you just thought they were having seizures about it. \nUnbelievable, they say. No, it is not unbelievable to me. If you are \ngoing to try to get economic recovery in this country, you do not do \nthat by incentivizing production in China and Japan. By the way, in \ntheir programs in China and Japan, they have their own provisions to \npurchase at home.\n  Here is the trade deficit we have with the world. This is why I say I \nsupport trying to do something with the faucet about jobs, to put more \njobs in this economy. I am going to vote this afternoon on the proposal \ncoming before the Senate. But here is the drain. Even as we do that, \nmore and more jobs are leaving this country. Anybody who talks about \nfiscal policy deficits and is really worried that these fiscal policy \ndeficits are going to sink this country, you can make a case--I used to \nteach a little economics in college--you can make a case that the \nfiscal policy deficit is money we owe to ourselves. You cannot make a \ncase that this amount of red--these red lines go down, down, down, $800 \nbillion a year for the last 3 years in a row. That is money we owe to \nother countries. That is money that will be repaid by a lower standard \nof living in the United States.\n  I say to all of those who care about fiscal policy deficits--and I \ndo--you better care about this as well because this is a description of \nmoving American jobs overseas in addition to indebting ourselves deep \nin debt to especially China, as this chart shows. This chart shows the \nred lines. This is only China, a country with which we have a $260 \nbillion trade deficit and growing every single year.\n  By the way, we have with the country of China a reasonably ignorant \nbilateral which says to China--I am taking one piece of it now--it \nsays: You are ramping up a very large automobile export industry, and \nwe will very soon see Chinese cars on the streets of America. When they \ncome to America under our agreement with you, you have a very large \ndeficit with us, China, so when you ship us your cars--and they are \ncoming--we will impose a 2.5-percent tariff on automobiles from China \ninto the United States. We agree that if we ship cars made in the \nUnited States to China, you may impose a 25-percent tariff. A country \nwith which we have a $260 billion trade deficit, we agreed to give them \na 10-to-1 advantage on tariffs on bilateral automobile trading. I don't \nknow how other people define ignorance, but I believe that is ignorant \nof our country's economic interest.\n  That is the reason I indicated in the economic recovery--what is \ncalled the stimulus program--that if we are going to spend money to try \nto restart this economy, to try to get this engine restarted and put \npeople back to work, we at least ought to have some understanding that \nthe products we are purchasing with that are not purchased from China \nand Japan, with which we have these very large budget deficits.\n  Since repetition is so very important here--I received a letter the \nother day from someone who said: Mr. Senator, if you are, at the end of \nyour third term in the Senate this year, going to leave the Senate, who \nis going to speak for Huffy bicycles?\n  I said: I don't know who is going to speak for Huffy bicycles, but I \nam going to continue to do so until the end of the year because it is a \nperfect description of what is wrong in this country with respect to \nthis so-called bathtub which should hold jobs but has a wide open \ndrain.\n  Huffy was an Ohio company. Not anymore. They all got fired, all of \nthem, because all these bicycles are produced in China. Why? Because \nthe folks in Ohio were making $11 an hour and that is way too much \nmoney to pay an American worker. I know where they are made now. They \nare made in China for 50 cents an hour by people who work 7 days a \nweek, 12 to 14 hours a day.\n  The poignant story about Huffy bicycles is when the last factory \nclosed and the last Huffy bicycle was made in America, all the workers, \nas they drove out of the parking lot, left a pair of empty shoes in the \nspace where their car once parked. It was the only way they could send \na message to the company: You can ship our jobs to China,\n\n[[Page S602]]\n\nbut you are never really going to fill this space of ours. So no more \nHuffy bicycles.\n  The list is endless. Huffy bicycles and Radio Flyer, the little red \nwagon every child has ridden in, are examples of what we do not make \nhere anymore. Radio Flyer was made in Illinois for 110 years. The \nlittle red wagon was made by an immigrant who came to this country who \nnot only loved airplanes--and so he named a red wagon ``Radio Flyer''--\nbut was a very good businessman. Every American child sat in those \nlittle red wagons and played in those little red wagons for 110 years, \nmade in America. Not anymore. They are all made in China.\n  My point is this: I am going to vote for this bill this afternoon. It \nis the right thing to do. We will have people come here and spread the \nmantra again today as they have for so many weeks and months: Do \nnothing. Do nothing. Things will be fine.\n  Things are not fine. It is our responsibility to do something to \naddress these issues. I want us to do something to try to create new \njobs.\n  I chaired a hearing of the policy committee not too long ago. We had \nthree small to medium-size businesses come testify. All of them were \nready to expand and ready to hire new people. All of them were \nprofitable businesses, all of them were ready to expand, and none of \nthem could expand because none of them could find credit from the \nbanks. Think of this: The biggest banks in America are now making \nrecord profits. I am talking about the biggest banks on Wall Street. \nThey are making record profits and are prepared to pay record bonuses \nat a time when small and medium-size businesses that create the jobs in \nthis country cannot find credit to expand even when they are \nprofitable.\n  There is something wrong with this system. This system is not \nworking. There are a lot of reasons for us to care a lot about what has \nhappened in this country. I regret that there has never been the kinds \nof hearings with subpoena power that develops the master narrative of \nwhat has happened in the last 6 or 8 years that caused this economic \nwreck. The American people need to know. I understand there is now a \ncommission, but that is not a substitute for what the Congress has a \nresponsibility to do.\n  In 200 years in this country, we have gone from times when the \nproductive sector--those who produce and manufacture--had the upper \nhand to other times when the financing sector had the upper hand. More \nrecently, the financing sector has had the upper hand in this country. \nManufacturing is an afterthought, and we are losing, losing, losing our \nmanufacturing base.\n  The financing side, as all of us know, has become much larger. In \nfact, just about 15, 18 months ago, then-Treasury Secretary Paulson and \nthe Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board came to the Congress and \nsaid: Look, we are facing near imminent collapse of this entire \neconomy. At that time, one of the things they said was that we have too \nmuch concentration in the biggest financial firms in the country. Yes, \nthat was true, except, you know what, the concentration is even much \ngreater now, engineered by some of the same people who said there is \ntoo much already.\n  This is not rocket science. Too big to fail meant no-fault \ncapitalism. The biggest financial firms in the country got bailed out. \nWhy? Because it was feared they were too big to fail. I think too big \nto fail is just too big. This is not rocket science. If you are too big \nto fail, you are too big. Yet the very institutions that are too big to \nfail are getting bigger, not smaller, imposing more risk.\n\n  By the way, the biggest ones that are showing significant record \nprofits and ready to pay record bonuses--we are told somewhere around \n$140 billion to $160 billion--the biggest firms are engaged in the same \nkind of activity that steered the country into the ditch. We still have \nthe credit default swaps and derivatives out there that represent very \nsubstantial risks.\n  If anybody really wants to understand how this relates, just go to \nLas Vegas or a casino someplace. Look up and understand what a \nsynthetic derivative means. It means you are buying a credit default \nswap to insure a bond, except this transition does not relate to \nanything that is real. It is just a wager. That is exactly what has \ngone on in this country, unimpeded by regulators who did not look, who \nwere woefully blind, and who boasted about it for some years. Who pays \nthe price for all of that? The 25 or 26 million people who got up this \nmorning and could not find a job. In some cases, they got up on a \nmorning a month ago, a morning a year ago, in some cases 2 years ago, \nand still could not find work. They are the victims. And the very folks \nat the top who steered this country into the ditch are reporting record \nprofits. The folks at the top, as I just described with the new study \nfrom Northeastern University, have full employment.\n  It seems to me there is something wrong with this picture. How does \none come to the floor of the Senate this evening and say: Let's do \nnothing. I have an idea: let's keep doing nothing, they say.\n  We have watched that inaction, and that does not work. The American \npeople deserve better than that. I hope this afternoon we will have \nmost Members of the Senate coming to the floor to say: Let's do \nsomething. Let's care today not about the people at the top of the \nfinancial food chain who are now making record profits and preparing to \npay record bonuses, but let's do something for the folks at the bottom \nwho have lost their jobs--5.5 million manufacturing workers just in the \nlast decade. Let's do something to see if we can find a way to put them \nback to work. If we do that, maybe we will get a strong vote today for \npeople saying we care about jobs.\n  We would like to work together--Republicans and Democrats--to get the \nbest ideas both have to offer rather than the worst of each and see if \nwe can advance the economic interests of this country once again.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time from \n5 p.m. to 5:30 p.m. today be equally divided and controlled between the \nleaders or their designees, with the majority leader controlling the \nfinal 15 minutes prior to the 5:30 p.m. cloture vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, jobs. We are here today to help create \njobs. Everyone is thinking about jobs and ways to create more of them.\n  Business owners, workers, community leaders across the country, \nespecially in my home State of Montana, are asking what Congress is \ndoing to create jobs. I might say when I was home last week, Mr. \nPresident, I had some job forums. At one of them, we had lots of \ndifferent ways to create jobs and a lot of ideas.\n  At the end, I said: OK, everybody. What does this all boil down to? \nGive me one or two or three things that we can do to create more jobs. \nThere was a big chorus of: more jobs, more jobs, better-paying jobs. So \nit is there, and it should be there because unemployment is so high and \nthere is a huge need.\n  In his State of the Union Address, President Obama said: ``Jobs must \nbe our No. 1 focus in 2010.'' Here in the Senate, a group of us have \nbeen working on finding the best way to create new jobs. I am pleased \nto have worked together across the aisle with a thoughtful bipartisan \ngroup of Senators to craft legislation to create tax incentives for job \ncreation. I applaud my colleagues, Senators Schumer and Hatch, for \nworking together to bring good ideas to the table. I thank my very good \nfriend, Chuck Grassley, for\n\n[[Page S603]]\n\nworking with us once again, and I appreciate the tremendous help from \nSenators Dorgan, Casey, and Durbin who have been spearheading the \nbroader jobs effort.\n  Some of the provisions on which these Senators have worked are before \nus today. The provisions before us today would address the immediate \nneeds of businesses on many different levels. For example, it would \nallow smaller businesses faster depreciation of equipment purchases. \nThis provision helps create jobs, clearly. As the demand for services \nand products increase, so does the demand for workers.\n  But the amendment before us would do more. The amendment would go to \nthe heart of the matter to provide simple and immediate tax incentives \nfor businesses to employ new workers. The amendment answers the \nchallenge of doing something that would make a difference for the \nunemployed right now. Let me explain the tax incentive for hiring in \nthe amendment.\n  This year any business that hires someone who has been out of work \nfor 60 days or more would qualify for the credit. The business would \nnot have to pay its share of Social Security payroll taxes on that \nemployee for the remainder of the year. It is that simple.\n  This incentive would be available for every new worker hired no \nmatter the size of the business. Moreover, if that business retains the \nnew employee for a full year, then the business would be able to take \nan additional $1,000 income tax credit against next year's taxes.\n  So, for example, the mom-and-pop grocery store owner in Billings, MT, \nthat employs a previously unemployed store clerk and pays him $25,000 \nfor the rest of the year would save $1,550 on payroll taxes. The \nmedium-sized trucking company that can employ 10 new workers at $35,000 \neach for the rest of the year would save $21,700 on payroll taxes.\n  The large manufacturer that employs 100 new assembly-line workers at \n$45,000 each for the rest of the year would save almost $300,000 in \npayroll taxes. All of these businesses would get another $1,000 for \neach new employee they retained for a full year.\n  Let me explain why this is a good package. First of all, the \nincentive is simple. We want all businesses to be able to take the \nincentive, not just those that can afford an attorney to explain it or \nan accountant to prepare the necessary paperwork. All private \nbusinesses that create jobs and employ the currently unemployed would \nbe entitled to a payroll tax holiday; and because it is simple to \nunderstand, we hope the program will enjoy broad news coverage. That \nway more employers would hear about the incentive and opt in.\n  Second, the amendment would provide an immediate benefit. Employers \nneed help now, and we want to create jobs now. As soon as a business \nhires a new employee, the business would receive the benefit as a \npayroll tax holiday on that new employee. The business would get the \nbenefit of every payroll tax deposit it would make. The business would \nnot have to wait until it filed its tax return next year, and the cash \nthat the business would save from the payroll tax cut could be used to \nhelp pay the wages of the new employee or the cash could be invested in \nthe business. That is right now. The amendment would not hurt the \nSocial Security trust fund. The government would make the trust fund \nwhole in the full amount of the payroll tax holiday.\n  The third reason this is a good provision is the amendment would \nencourage faster hiring. An employee with a salary of $50,000 hired on \nJuly 1 would save the business about $1,500 in taxes. But the same \nworker hired earlier, say, on March 1, would save the business about \n$2,600 in taxes. The faster a business hires, the more benefit the \nbusiness would receive. The incentive would boost the economy today, \nand it would create an additional demand for workers sooner.\n  What is the fourth reason this is a good idea? Just this one \nprovision I have been talking about--and that is the payroll tax \nholiday. The amendment would encourage jobs that pay good wages. The \nhigher the wage, the higher the credit. That is because the incentive \nis directly tied to the wages subject to the Social Security payroll \ntax.\n  Fifth, the amendment targets the unemployed. The incentive would \nreward businesses that hire those who are currently out of work. It \nwould reward those businesses that create employment, not those that \nshift workers from another job. Yet it would not require the employee \nbe collecting unemployment insurance benefits. For all sorts of \nreasons, not all persons take unemployment benefits. The incentive \nwould be as broad as possible. It would help all those currently not \nworking who want to be.\n  What is the sixth reason for this payroll tax holiday provision? It \nis fair. The incentive sets no limits on the size of the business that \ncan utilize it. Job creation happens with all sizes and types of \nbusinesses--from the sole proprietor seeking to expand, to the largest \nmanufacturer recovering from downsizing. Because the credit would be on \npayroll taxes rather than income taxes, the incentive would also help \ntax-exempt organizations and businesses currently operating at a loss. \nThose businesses have no income tax to offset with an income tax \ncredit.\n  Seventh, the amendment would provide ease of hiring. The employer \nwould only have to get a signed affidavit from a new employee that the \nemployee had been out of work for the previous 60 days. That is pretty \nsimple--no lengthy certification process through State agencies, as \nsome current wage credits require.\n  Eighth, the amendment would encourage employee retention. Employers \nthat retain their new employees for a year would get an added bonus.\n  Ninth, and most importantly, the amendment would increase employment. \nThe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office studied a number of options \nfor job creation in the year 2010. After receiving many ideas, CBO \nstated that the payroll tax deduction for firms that increase their \npayroll is the most cost-effective policy for creating jobs. Economists \nsuggest the same thing. While all thoughtful observers are careful to \npoint out no company would hire unneeded workers just for a tax credit, \nmany economists believe that a hiring incentive may be the push that \nmany companies waiting on the sidelines need to hire those extra \npeople.\n  Business owners have flexibility in hiring. They can work longer \nhours themselves, substitute machines for labor, or pay overtime to \ncurrent employees. But those employers on the fence may believe this \npackage of tax cuts and hiring incentives are enough of a boost for \nthem to hire new employees now.\n  The National Federation of Independent Businesses indicated in \nDecember that there are many companies starting and growing businesses \nduring this recession. In the past, the NFIB has supported a fixed-\nlength payroll tax holiday. Economist Mark Zandi reported that \n``various business surveys suggest firms are more open to expanding \ntheir payrolls.''\n  He added:\n\n       A tax break for hiring could be particularly effective this \n     summer. By then, businesses will have had more time to come \n     to terms with the Great Recession, and banks should be \n     extending credit somewhat more freely by then.\n\n  Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich has suggested a new jobs tax \ncredit for every new job created by small businesses this year. \nAlthough he thinks that a job credit does not do much under normal \ncircumstances, he says that these are not normal circumstances, and \nbusinesses need a boost.\n  David Greenlaw and Ted Wieseman of Morgan Stanley Research have said \nthat a new job credit, designed correctly, could represent an important \nsource of effective stimulus.\n  And Ted Gayer of the nonpartisan Brookings Institution said that \ntiming of an employment tax credit matters. He warned:\n\n       The more you dither, then people will wait on the sidelines \n     and not hire now. You want it to be immediate and you want it \n     to go a set length.\n\n  Let us not delay. Let us answer the call from Americans to help and \nlet us enact this package to get more people to work.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S604]]\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, first, I want to welcome everybody \nback. I don't think there is any snow in the forecast, so hopefully we \ncan get some work done around here. Having spent the past week in \nKentucky, I can assure you that my constituents are concerned, first \nand foremost, about jobs and the economy. And another thing they are \nconcerned about is lawmakers in Washington making matters worse.\n  Americans are worried about the growing national debt. That is why \nRepublicans hope to offer amendments to the jobs bill that we will be \nvoting on today that would lower it. Those ideas should be considered.\n  Millions of Americans want to get back to work. That is why \nRepublicans will offer ideas that will make it easier for businesses to \nhire new workers. Those ideas should be considered too.\n  Small business owners want greater certainty about the future. That \nis why Republicans will propose ideas that will keep their taxes from \ngoing up and make it easier for them to invest in their businesses. \nThose and other ideas from both sides of the aisle should be \nconsidered.\n  Later this week, we will have the health care summit at the White \nHouse. Americans want the administration to scrap its massive \ngovernment scheme in favor of an incremental approach to health care \nreform. Unfortunately, the White House still seems unwilling to do the \none thing Americans want most. It is still clinging to a massive bill \nthat Americans have overwhelmingly rejected again and again for months.\n  The tragedy of this approach is that the longer Washington sticks \nwith its failed approach to health care, the longer Americans will have \nto wait for the real, step-by-step reforms that will actually lower \ncosts and lead to a better system. That is the kind of real reform \nAmericans have wanted all along. That is what they have been asking for \nand that is what Republicans in Congress will continue to fight for.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we all went home over this recess--most of \nus did--and we heard very clear messages. At least I can tell you I \ndid. The messages are: Address the problems that face us and reach out \na hand across the aisle and do it together. Pretty simple.\n  Today we have a chance to do that. Today we have a very clear chance \nto do that and to lift the spirits of the American people. The bill we \nwill be voting on--actually we are voting to take it up, in essence; we \nneed 60 votes to do that, unfortunately, because there is a filibuster \nagain on this--is a very simple, straightforward jobs bill.\n  It has four parts. Two relate to tax breaks for business for doing \ngood things. One is buying new equipment and getting a break on the \nexpensing. The other is hiring people who have been unemployed for 60 \ndays or more. The other two pieces involve the extension of the highway \ntrust fund and the Build America Bond program, and that relates to \nbuilding our infrastructure. In the case of the highway trust fund, of \ncourse, it does fund transportation of all kinds: transit systems as \nwell as highways, bridges, roads. Very important.\n  Build America Bonds is a way to help the States issue bonds that they \nhave voter approval to do, and helps them with the interest rate. In \nCalifornia, that program--Build America Bonds--resulted in billions of \ndollars of bonding to build roads and schools and all kinds of \nimportant necessities for my people back home.\n  So we have four things before us in one package: two tax breaks very \nimportant to businesses and two very important infrastructure measures.\n  I want to have printed in the Record--and I ask unanimous consent to \ndo so--a very important letter sent to us by the American Association \nof State Highway and Transportation Officials, the American Road and \nTransportation Builders Association, the Associated General Contractors \nof America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Laborers International \nUnion, and the International Union of Operating Engineers.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         The American Association of State Highway and \n           Transportation Officials, The American Road and \n           Transportation Builders Association, The Associated \n           General Contractors of America, The U.S. Chamber of \n           Commerce, The Laborers International Union, \n           International Union of Operating Engineers.\n     Hon. Richard Durbin,\n     Majority Whip,\n     Hon. Barbara Boxer,\n     Chairman, The Environment and Public Works Committee,\n     Hon. Max Baucus,\n     Chairman, Finance Committee,\n     Hon. James Inhofe,\n     Ranking Member, Environment and Public Works Committee.\n       Dear Senators: We are writing on behalf of the undersigned \n     organizations to express our strong support for prompt Senate \n     passage of an extension of the highway and transit programs \n     in the SAFETEA-LU legislation and inclusion of a transfer of \n     General Funds into the Highway Trust Fund in an amount \n     sufficient to support the appropriated FY10 funding levels \n     consistent with at least a nine month period and should the \n     Senate decide a one year extension period.\n       Passage of legislation that includes an extension and the \n     funds transfer will provide much needed certainty and \n     stability within the states, local transportation authorities \n     and transit agencies to make long-term capital commitments \n     and plan for a full season of work. All 50 states continue \n     their highway construction season through September and into \n     October, at least 45 states continue highway work into \n     November and one-third of the states are still working in \n     December. Without an extension that also stabilizes the \n     Highway Trust Fund, the transportation construction industry \n     will continue to decline and much needed transportation \n     investments cannot be made.\n       We continue to support Congressional efforts to enact a \n     well-funded, long-term surface transportation bill. That work \n     can go on in Congress while the program continues to fund \n     needed transportation assets. Swift passage of a multiyear \n     bill will have an impact in the out years but shoring up the \n     trust fund now will allow the maximum job creation during the \n     2010 construction season. We face a shortfall in the trust \n     fund at this time that makes an extension and funds transfer \n     essential to creating much needed jobs in the construction \n     industry this year and to continuing to improve this nation's \n     transportation infrastructure. The nation needs these \n     investments now and we urge the Senate to act to move this \n     critical legislation.\n       It is critically important given the urgency of the \n     investment and jobs issues that these provisions be included \n     in the Senate jobs bill to be introduced next week.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. I have to say I have worked with these organizations over \nthe break to talk to them about what will happen if we vote this \nmeasure down and we do not continue our funding through the highway \ntrust fund. They are very clear, and I am going to give you the \ninformation they told me about job losses that will happen if we do not \nact today.\n  As I read this list, I hope, Mr. President, you realize these \norganizations are Republican organizations, Democratic organizations, \nbipartisan organizations. They have Independents, Republicans, and \nDemocrats. The Chamber of Commerce, we all know they\n\n[[Page S605]]\n\ntend to go with the Republican side most of the time. They want a \n``yes'' vote. The general contractors, they generally go--generally \ngo--with the Republicans. They want a ``yes'' vote. Then you look at \nthe unions, the workers, they generally go with the Democrats. They \nwant a ``yes'' vote.\n  And why? Because they are fearing if we do not act, we are going to \nhurt business and we are going to hurt the working people of this \ncountry. They say:\n\n       Passage of [this] legislation . . . will provide much \n     needed certainty and stability within the States, local \n     transportation authorities and transit agencies to make long-\n     term capital commitments and plan for a full season of work. \n     . . . Without an extension that . . . stabilizes the Highway \n     Trust Fund--\n\n  Which, by the way, this does--\n\n     the transportation construction industry will continue to \n     decline and much needed transportation investments cannot be \n     made.\n\n  I want to repeat that. This is not a quote from a Senator, Republican \nor Democratic or Independent. This is a quote from the Republicans and \nthe Democrats and the Independents who are represented by the American \nAssociation of State Highway and Transportation Officials, the American \nRoad and Transportation Builders Association, the Associated General \nContractors of America, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the Laborers \nInternational Union, and the International Union of Operating \nEngineers. They are telling us this is critical. They say: ``The Nation \nneeds these investments now.'' They put the word ``now'' in bold \nletters. Not tomorrow, not next week but now.\n\n  We urge the Senate to act to move this critical legislation. It is \ncritically important, given the urgency of the investment in jobs \nissues that these provisions be included in the Senate jobs bill and \nthey are.\n  Today, we have a chance to have a fresh start by voting for cloture--\nin other words, ending a filibuster--on this package of four bills, two \ntax breaks for businesses and two very important investments in our \ninfrastructure.\n  I wish to give the numbers that were given to us by the American \nAssociation of State Highway Officials.\n  We have asked the State highway officials in our States--and I see \nSenator Casey here; in his State--we have asked them all to give us an \nidea of the jobs we would lose if we do not make that $20 billion \ntransfer into the highway trust fund that is included in the Reid jobs \nbill. In Arizona, it is estimated we would see 6,800 jobs lost; in \nCalifornia, 31,000; in Florida, 17,000--I am rounding these off--in \nIllinois, 11,000; Iowa, 4,000; Maine, 1,400; Massachusetts, 5,300; \nMichigan, 9,300; Missouri, 7,800; Nevada, 2,590, to be exact; Ohio, \n12,000 jobs--let me repeat, 12,000 jobs would be lost in Ohio--in South \nCarolina, 5,000; Texas, 29,000-plus jobs would be lost if we don't get \nmoving on this bill; in Utah, 2,600; and in Wisconsin, 6,500.\n  I just picked these States out for purposes of explanation.\n  If we fail to pass an extension, period, we would lose 1 million jobs \nin this great Nation.\n  So there are two scenarios. One is if we fail to extend the program, \nthis is what will happen. The States will lose jobs immediately. If we \ndon't authorize this program, we will lose 1 million jobs. Without the \ntransfer, this highway trust fund will not have any funds by the \nsummer. Some people say June. Some people say August. I ask my \ncolleagues who may be watching this debate: Please consider what it \nwill be like when you have your contractors come and tell you they have \nhad to stop a project in midstream--a highway, a bike path, a freeway, \nfixing a bridge that is perhaps in danger of collapsing.\n  So I will tell my colleagues I don't think we have a choice.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the estimated \njob loss if there is no extension whatsoever of the highway trust fund.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Estimated job\n                                                           loss under no\n                          State                                CR or\n                                                             extension\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nArizona.................................................          15,558\nCalifornia..............................................          70,111\nFlorida.................................................          39,244\nIllinois................................................          25,831\nIowa....................................................           8,794\nMaine...................................................           3,219\nMassachusetts...........................................          12,121\nMichigan................................................          21,294\nMissouri................................................          17,921\nNevada..................................................           5,903\nOhio....................................................          26,934\nSouth Carolina..........................................          12,683\nTexas...................................................          66,434\nUtah....................................................           5,964\nWisconsin...............................................          14,894\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, this is a pretty straightforward vote for \nus today. In essence, everything in this jobs bill is bipartisan. \nEverything in it is bipartisan. I can tell my colleagues right now that \nmy Republican colleagues tell me they want to reauthorize this highway \ntrust fund through the end of the year. They want to make sure the \ntrust fund has the dollars it needs. Well, then, what is the reason why \none might not vote to end the filibuster?\n  Some say we didn't get everything we wanted in this bill. Well, \nneither did I. There are many things I would like to see in a jobs \nbill, believe me. I didn't get them in this bill because Senator Reid \nsaid we have to go slowly. We are going to have these smaller packages. \nThey are more understandable. I think he has a point. But each of us \ncould write our own jobs bill. Senator McConnell could write his. I \ncould write mine. The fact is, what Senator Reid has done is to take \nfour provisions that are bipartisan in nature and put them in this jobs \npackage.\n  Frankly, I don't know how anyone could face their constituents in a \ntime of unemployment that we are seeing now. Even though we have \ncertainly gone from bleeding--600,000 jobs a month, 700,000 jobs a \nmonth--to very few in comparison, we have a long way to go. Building \nthe infrastructure of this Nation is done by the private sector. We \nhear the Republicans on the other side say: Well, we want this to be \nbuilt by the private sector. That is how this program works.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record at this time a \nnotice that went out from the Missouri Department of Transportation, if \nI may.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Missouri Department\n\n\n                                            of Transportation,\n\n                            Jefferson City, MO, February 19, 2010.\n\n               Special Notice to Contractors: Bid Opening\n\n       All bidders--PLEASE TAKE NOTE!--Unless the federal \n     government takes the necessary steps to ensure the \n     availability of federal funds for the remaining fiscal year \n     prior to 12:00 p.m. on February 25, 2010, the scheduled \n     February 26, 2010 bid opening will be Postponed/Withdrawn \n     until further notice.\n       If necessary, the final Notice to Postpone/Withdraw the \n     scheduled February 26, 2010 bid opening will be posted at \n     12:00 p.m. on February 25, 2010.\n       As many of you are aware, the Surface Transportation Act, \n     titled SAFETEA-LU, which provides $42 billion per year \n     nationally in federal funding for highway and bridge projects \n     to cities, counties and states, expired on September 30, \n     2009. The U.S. Congress provided for an extension of SAFETEA-\n     LU, but funded it at $30 billion per year. MoDOT, like other \n     State Departments of Transportation, developed its highway \n     program with the assumption that Congress would fully fund \n     the federal program at, or above, the SAFETEA-LU level. This \n     action by Congress has not happened.\n       Congress has until February 28, 2010 to correct the \n     shortfall in transportation funding. If Congress takes no \n     action by February 28 to correct the federal funding \n     shortfall, MoDOT and other State DOTs will have to make \n     adjustments to their existing highway programs. The impact to \n     MoDOT, cities and counties will be a reduction of $250 \n     million in federal funds for the remainder of this fiscal \n     year. This lack of action directly affects the scheduled-\n     highway bid openings at MoDOT through the May 21, 2010 bid \n     opening. Because the February 26, 2010 bid opening is prior \n     to the February 28 deadline for Congress to address the \n     federal funding shortfall, MoDOT believes it is prudent to \n     postpone or withdraw the February 26, 2010 bid opening until \n     Congress has acted on the federal level for highway and \n     bridge funding.\n       If you have any questions related to MoDOT's bid opening \n     schedules, please feel free to contact Dave Nichols, director \n     of program delivery, at 573-751-4586 or email at: \n     david.nichols@modot.mo.gov.\n       Link to the projects scheduled in the February 26, 2010 bid \n     opening: http://www.modot.org/eBidLettingPublicWeb/\nviewStream.do?documentType=general_ info=1198.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I wish my colleagues to hear this because \nit is very shocking, and it could happen in Delaware, California, \nPennsylvania, any of our States. It is a special notice to contractors, \ndated February 19:\n\n\n[[Page S606]]\n\n\n       All bidders take note. Unless the Federal Government takes \n     the necessary steps to ensure the availability of Federal \n     funds for the remaining fiscal year prior to 12 p.m. on \n     February 25, the scheduled February 26 bid opening will be \n     postponed or withdrawn until further notice.\n\n  This is real. This is real. I know this is a political season. I know \nfirsthand it is a political season. But there comes a time when we have \nto put politics aside for 5 minutes--I would say 15 minutes--when we \nvote, put it aside for 15 minutes and let's not have a circumstance \nwhere we hear from the Missouri Department of Transportation that they \nare about to shut down their bidding process.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a letter \nfrom the American Highway Users Alliance.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  American Highway\n\n\n                                               Users Alliance,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, February 3, 2010.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n      Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard J. Durbin,\n      Majority Whip, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jon Kyl,\n     Minority Whip, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senate Leaders: On behalf of our 270 motoring clubs, \n     non-profit associations and businesses with an interest in \n     safe and efficient highways, the American Highway Users \n     Alliance asks for your support for the highway bill extension \n     and Highway Trust Fund restoration in the initial ``jobs \n     bill'' pending in the Senate.\n       Our members represent millions of motorists, RVers, \n     motorcyclists, as well as hundreds of truck and bus \n     companies. It is critical to us that the Highway Trust Fund \n     remains solvent, that the expired highway bill is extended \n     through the current fiscal year, and that rescissions that \n     took effect on September 30, 2009 are repealed.\n       Compared to last year, the Federal Highway Administration \n     is distributing about $1 billion less per month to the States \n     in budget authority for highways. This cut is devastating all \n     50 state highway programs and will create serious impacts on \n     the safety and efficiency of our Nation's commerce corridors.\n       If the initial job bill is enacted with an extension of the \n     highway bill and a restoration of funds to the Highway Trust \n     Fund, FY10 contract authority will be restored to pre-\n     rescission FY09 levels and the highway program will remain \n     solvent through the summer construction season.\n       We also take this opportunity to urge your support for \n     additional highway funding in future jobs bills to be \n     considered this year. The House has proposed that $27.5 \n     billion be appropriated for highways in their bill. We \n     strongly support this funding level and ask that the Senate \n     concur with the House on this provision. The use of jobs bill \n     funding for highways will not only add immediate construction \n     jobs, but will also create and support hundreds of thousands \n     of supply chain and induced jobs in every part of our \n     country.\n       Thank you for your leadership on highway issues. Please do \n     not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Gregory M. Cohen,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, it is signed by their CEO and President. \nThey are asking us to support this bill. Here is what he says:\n\n       Our members represent millions of motorists, RVers, \n     motorcyclists, as well as hundreds of truck and bus \n     companies. It is critical that the Highway Trust Fund remain \n     solvent, that the expired bill be extended through the \n     current fiscal year, and that the rescissions that took \n     affect in September be repealed.\n\n  They get it. These are our constituents who drive on the highways and \nthe freeways, and they are begging us to act and set aside our \npolitical games for 15 minutes and vote cloture. By the way, I am \nhopeful we can; I am.\n  I also have a letter to the Members of the Senate:\n\n       The current lack of funding certainty in the Federal \n     highway market is having a devastating effect on the \n     transportation construction industry. Our industry is in dire \n     economic shape. We urge the Senate to act promptly on passing \n     the Reid amendment.\n\n  Let me tell my colleagues who signed this letter. The President and \nCEO of American Concrete Pavement Association, the President of the \nNational Asphalt Pavement Association, the President of the National \nReady Mixed Concrete Association, the President and CEO of Portland \nCement, the President and CEO of the National Stone, Sand, and Gravel \nAssociation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have this letter printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                February 19, 2010.\n       To the Members of the United States Senate: As the \n     principal suppliers of materials used to manufacture our \n     nation's roads, highways and bridges, we call on the U.S. \n     Senate to promptly enact the Reid amendment that extends the \n     surface transportation programs and provides $19.5 billion \n     for the Highway Trust Fund.\n       The current lack of funding certainty in the federal \n     highway market is having a devastating effect on the \n     transportation construction industry. Since SAFETEA-LU \n     expired on September 30, 2009, the program has been extended \n     151 days under which state highway funds have been reduced by \n     30 percent. As a result, state transportation departments and \n     contractors cannot plan for a full season of work just as the \n     transportation construction industry is suffering its worst \n     construction cycle since the Great Depression.\n       Our industry is in dire economic shape. Production of \n     asphalt and concrete pavements experienced double digit \n     declines in 2009. Nearly one in four construction workers are \n     unemployed, and more job losses will occur in 2010 due to a \n     lack of contract awards by state transportation departments \n     across the country. While the American Recovery and \n     Reinvestment Act (ARRA) staved off a catastrophic decline in \n     highway construction, uncertainty about longterm federal \n     investment in state and local highway programs, combined with \n     a lingering recession and associated state budget problems, \n     poses a significant threat to the future of transportation \n     builders and suppliers.\n       We urge the Senate to act promptly on passing the Reid \n     amendment. This legislation provides for a full year \n     extension of the Federal Highway Program and funding to shore \n     up the Highway Trust Fund.\n           Sincerely,\n     Gerald F. Voigt,\n       President and CEO, American Concrete Pavement Association.\n     Mike Acott,\n       President, National Asphalt Pavement Association.\n     Robert A. Garbini,\n       President, National Ready Mixed Concrete Association.\n     Jennifer Joy Wilson,\n       President and CEO, National Stone, Sand and Gravel \n     Association.\n     Brian McCarthy,\n       President & CEO, Portland Cement Association.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, these letters are stark in their message \nto us. If we don't listen to this incredible group of people who are \nwriting us these letters--these are Republicans, they are Democrats, \nthey are Independents, they are Americans. They are saying: Set aside \nyour differences and fund the highway trust fund. This vote will send a \nshiver through the spine of our entire business community and our \nworking people if we don't get 60 votes today.\n  So we have an opportunity today to send the clearest of messages that \nwe are ready to come together around a simple premise; that is, the \ntransportation infrastructure of this Nation is not a political \nwhipping boy. There is no time to play politics here--no time. We have \none State already saying: Beware. We are putting off our contracting. \nWhat more do we need to see than that? This is just the beginning of \nwhat is going to happen. We know the Build America Bonds program, which \nwill allow State and local governments to borrow at lower costs, is \ngoing to put people to work. Our treasurer, California treasurer Bill \nLockyer, said Build America Bonds have enabled the State--our State--to \nsell more than $19 billion in general obligation funds to meet voter-\napproved mandates for more than 7,000 vital infrastructure projects, in \nturn creating or sustaining more than 100,000 solid, middle-class, \nprivate sector jobs and businesses, large and small, in California.\n  The Build America Bond program is something our local people want, \nwhether they are in California or anywhere else in the Nation. This \nprogram can cover bonds for school construction, clean energy, and all \nthe rest. It will allow us to put people to work, and the decisions \nwill not be made here but in our cities, our counties, and our States.\n  Clearly, the two infrastructure pieces in the Reid bill are essential \nin both\n\n[[Page S607]]\n\nsaving jobs and creating new jobs. Investments in infrastructure are a \ncrucial component of job creation in our Nation. As we work our way out \nof this recession, the last thing we want to do is create uncertainty \nabout our transportation funding. Too many people are counting on it.\n  I wish to mention, as the chair of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, that what we are doing today will give us the time we need \nto pass a larger authorization, and I am working on that authorization \nwith Republicans and Democrats on our committee. I wish to commend, in \nparticular, Senator Voinovich for reaching out to me in an \nextraordinary way. He is reaching out his hand and he says: Let's get \nstarted. I say to him, through my remarks on the Senate floor: \nAbsolutely. We are going to start working. That bill is going to be \ntransformational. It is going to, I think, be another boon to our \neconomy.\n  There is one thing I can say after spending so much time back home. I \nhave not heard one of my constituents in my State--and I traveled to \nevery part of my State and I met with Democrats, Republicans, \nIndependents, business, labor, nurses, firefighters, everybody--not one \ndisagrees with this point; that is, a great nation must have a great \ninfrastructure. Our infrastructure must be updated. That means our \nroads, our bridges, our highways, our transit systems, our sewer \nsystems, our water systems. We have water systems with arsenic in them. \nWe have water systems that are not healthful for our families. No great \nnation can be a great nation if our people are not at the top of their \ngame. You can't be at the top of your game if your child is getting ill \nbecause they are drinking tainted water. These are the things we have \nto do, and they are done in the private sector. On the transportation \nside, there is a separate fund for that highway trust fund, separate \nfunds that go into that user fee, and that is how we fund our highways \nand transit systems. It is a very sound idea.\n  Again, I say to all colleagues: If we turn our back today on this \nvery straightforward proposal that extends the highway trust fund and \ngives it the funding it needs to spend at the authorized levels, we are \ngoing to see more State departments of transportation, such as this one \nin Missouri:\n\n       Special Notice: Unless the Federal Government takes the \n     necessary steps to ensure the availability of Federal funds \n     for the remaining fiscal year, then the bid opening will be \n     postponed or withdrawn until further notice.\n  That is not a threat; it is real.\n  I yield the floor.\n Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, I oppose invoking cloture on the \nmotion to concur with the House amendment to the Senate amendment to HR \n2847, also known as Senator Reid's Hiring Incentives to Restore \nEmployment Act.\n  Only 2 weeks after President Obama stood in the House of \nRepresentatives to deliver his State of the Union address calling for a \nbipartisan solution to creating job growth, the majority leader has \npulled the rug from underneath both Democrats and Republicans. Senators \nBaucus, Grassley, and others, including myself, had been spearheading \nan effort to put forth a bipartisan jobs bill. However, the majority \nleader inexplicably decided to gut our work product.\n  Let me be clear, there is no doubt in my mind and in the mind of many \nof my colleagues that passing a jobs bill is crucial. We have seen our \nunemployment rate remain stagnant at around 10 percent since last \nSeptember. The American people sent us here to do a job, and it is way \npast time we did it.\n  That is why I worked with Senator Schumer to come up with a payroll \ntax holiday for those companies that hired more employees. Under this \nincentive, the sooner a company hired an unemployed worker the more tax \nincentive the company would receive.\n  Regrettably, because of the majority leader's decision, it looks as \nthough President Obama's hope for a bipartisan solution to job creation \nonly lasted 2 weeks. What a shame.\n  The original package, negotiated by Senate Finance Committee Chairman \nBaucus and Ranking Member Grassley, included an array of tax provisions \naimed at providing the private sector with the ability to hire more \nemployees and invest in more equipment.\n  The extension of these expired tax provisions only support proven \ngrowth of companies that are slowly beginning to see the light at the \nend of the tunnel.\n  The President set the tone at the beginning of the year by calling on \nCongress to put forth a bipartisan solution to creating jobs in this \ncountry. In response, both Democrats and Republicans brought innovative \nideas to the table. Then, in a sudden change of events, many Republican \nideas have been excluded from the jobs bill the majority leader has \nbrought to the floor.\n  And again, the majority leader has maneuvered this legislation to \nprevent any amendments from being offered by our side. If this is not \nan arrogance of power, then I do not know what is. I only hope the \nmajority leader heeds to President Obama's plea for a bipartisan \nsolution.\n  I think it would be a grave injustice to the American people to pass \nthis bill in this way. How is the minority supposed to have faith that \nthe minority will not be excluded from debate of future legislation, \nsuch as health care and energy legislation? It is easy to label the \nRepublicans as the party of no when you completely exclude them from \nthe legislative process. No is the only option that remains.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senate is about to engage in a \ncloture vote on the Senate Democratic leadership's third stimulus bill. \nWhat I find surprising is that what we are about to vote on \nindisputably and absolutely belongs to the majority leader. That is to \nsay we are not going to vote on a bipartisan package that I put \ntogether with Finance Committee Chairman Baucus. I was under the \nimpression that the Senate Democratic leadership was genuine in its \ndesire to work on a bipartisan basis, but clearly I was mistaken. \nAlthough the Senate Democratic leader was highly involved in the \ndevelopment of a bipartisan bill, he arbitrarily decided to replace it \nwith a bill he hopes to jam through the Senate.\n  As much as I was surprised by the Senate Democratic leader's \ndisregard for bipartisanship, I am even more surprised by the \nexplanations given by him and his cohorts.\n  Perhaps the most significant change between the bipartisan package \nChairman Baucus and I helped put together and the package we will be \nvoting to move to is that a package of expired tax provisions has been \nremoved. Normally referred to as extenders, these generally very \npopular and certainly bipartisan provisions have been extended several \ntimes over the past few years.\n  What is surprising is that hyperpartisan members of the majority have \nsuddenly decided that the tax extenders are partisan pork for \nRepublicans. A representative sample comes from one report, which \ndescribes the bipartisan bill as ``an extension of soon-to-expire tax \nbreaks that are highly beneficial to major corporations, known as tax \nextenders, as well as other corporate giveaways that had been designed \nto win GOP support.'' Just today the Washington Post includes this \nattribution to the Senate Democratic Leadership. From the Post:\n\n       ``We're pretty close,'' {the majority leader} said Friday \n     during a television appearance in Nevada, adding that he \n     thought ``fat cats'' would have benefitted too much from the \n     larger Baucus-Grassley bill.\n\n  The portrait being painted by certain members of the majority, echoed \nwithout critical examination in some press reports, is wildly \ninaccurate. For one thing, the tax extenders include provisions such as \nthe deduction for qualified tuition and related expenses and also the \ndeduction for certain expenses of elementary and secondary school \nteachers. If you are going to school or if you are a grade school \nteacher, the Senate Democratic leadership thinks you are a fat cat so \nyou are on your own. If your house was destroyed in a recent natural \ndisaster and you still need any of the temporary disaster relief \nprovisions contained in the extenders package, too bad, because helping \nyou would amount to a corporate giveaway in the eyes of some.\n  The tax extenders have been routinely passed repeatedly because they \nare bipartisan and very popular. Democrats have consistently voted in \nfavor of extending these tax provisions.\n  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi released a very strong statement upon \nHouse passage of tax extenders in December of 2009, saying this was, \n``good\n\n[[Page S608]]\n\nfor businesses, good for homeowners, and good for our communities.'' \nDecember of 2009 was not very long ago. In 2006, the then-Democratic \nleader released a blistering statement: ``After Bush Republicans in the \nSenate blocked passage of critical tax extenders, . . . American \nfamilies and businesses are paying the price because this Do Nothing \nRepublican Congress refuses to extend important tax breaks.'' I ask \nunanimous consent that both of these statements be printed in the \nRecord in their entirety.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Pelosi: Tax Extenders Act Creates New Jobs, Growth, Innovation, and \n                     Opportunity for Every American\n\n       Washington, DC--Speaker Nancy Pelosi released the following \n     statement today after the House passed the Tax Extenders Act \n     of 2009, which will help to create jobs and cut taxes for \n     American middle-class families. The House passed the bill by \n     a vote of 241 to 181.\n       ``Today, Congress took another positive step forward in our \n     drive to create more jobs, strengthen our economy, and lay \n     the foundation for long-term prosperity. By passing the Tax \n     Extenders Act, we are placing our working families at the \n     center of our economic recovery.\n       ``This legislation is good for businesses, good for \n     homeowners, and good for our communities. The bill extends \n     research and development tax credits for American companies, \n     encouraging them to invest in innovation and clean energy, \n     and create the high-tech jobs of the 21st century. It \n     provides property tax relief to 30 million families, ensures \n     our men and women called to serve overseas do not face a pay \n     cut here at home, and offers some security for millions of \n     parents, teachers, and consumers by extending deductions for \n     college tuition, classroom expenses, and state and local \n     sales taxes.\n       ``Maintaining our commitment to fiscal discipline, this \n     legislation will not add to the deficit. The costs of this \n     proposal are fully paid for because we put an end to the \n     preferential tax treatment for hedge fund managers and \n     investment bankers and crack down on offshore tax havens.\n       ``This bill is a down payment on new jobs, growth, \n     innovation, and opportunity for every American.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n          Reid: Republicans Should Stop Blocking Tax Extenders\n\n       Washington, DC--Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid today \n     issued the following statement after Bush Republicans in the \n     Senate blocked passage of critical tax extenders.\n       ``American families and businesses are paying the price \n     because this Do Nothing Republican Congress refuses to extend \n     important tax breaks. Families who just recently took their \n     sons and daughters to college now wonder whether the tuition \n     deduction that Republicans allowed to expire last year will \n     get reinstated. Teachers, forced to reach into their own \n     pockets to provide supplies for their students, now wonder \n     why Republicans refuse to extend the modest tax break they \n     get for doing so. Instead of holding such important tax \n     provisions hostage to ill-fated estate tax giveaways to \n     multi-millionaires, Republicans should join Democrats to pass \n     these measures today. Middle-class Americans deserve a new \n     direction, where they will not be forced to endure a tax \n     increase because of Republican inaction and obstruction.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Recent bipartisan votes in the Senate on extending \nexpiring tax provisions have come in the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act of 2008; the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006, \nwhich passed the Senate by unanimous consent; and the Working Families \nTax Relief Act of 2004, which originally passed the Senate by voice \nvote although the conference report received 92 votes in favor and a \nwhopping 3 against. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research \nService, extension of several of these provisions go back even further, \nincluding the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999, which again passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent but lost one vote on the conference report.\n  Blinded and dazed by the power of their now not-so-super majority, \ncertain Democrats have in the last few weeks turned against the \nextenders. One Democrat said:\n\n       Our side isn't sure that the Republicans are real \n     interested in developing good policy and to move forward \n     together. Instead, they are more inclined to play rope-a-dope \n     again. My own view is, let's test them.\n\n  Another member of this large 59-vote majority exclaimed:\n\n       It looks more like a tax bill than a jobs bill to me. What \n     the Democratic Caucus is going to put on the floor is \n     something that's more focused on job creation than on tax \n     breaks.\n\n  The only explanation for this behavior is that certain Senators have \ndecided that it serves a deeply partisan goal to slander what have been \nfor several years bipartisan and popular tax provisions benefitting \nmany different people.\n  Today's Washington Post article I quoted from earlier includes a \nstatement from a Senate Democratic leadership aide saying:\n\n       No decisions have been made, but anyone expecting us \n     immediately to go back to a bill that includes tax extenders \n     will be sorely disappointed.\n\n  Having put their heads into the sand, this chamber's Democratic \nleaders seem intent on keeping them there. I appeal to all of you to \nvote against the Democratic Leadership's effort today to jam the \nSenate. A vote for the Senate Democratic Leadership's cloture motion is \na vote to foreclose an opportunity to improve the bill. It also is a \nvote to forbid any corrections to mistakes in the bill. And there is a \nsignificant mistake in the Senate Democratic Leadership's bill. The \nbill as currently written would allow employers of illegal workers to \nbenefit from the payroll tax holiday. We should correct that mistake \nwith an amendment.\n  The Senate Democratic Leadership's posture prohibits this correction.\n  Either the Democratic leaders are playing partisan politics with tax \nextenders, or they don't understand the worth of the provisions to the \neconomy, including job retention and creation. The biodiesel industry \nalone says 23,000 jobs are at risk due to the biodiesel tax credit \nbeing allowed to expire. Those workers are not fat cats.\n  And in case anyone thinks biodiesel is something only Iowans worry \nabout, these green jobs are in 44 of the 50 states. There are 24 \nfacilities in Texas. There are 15 facilities in Iowa. There are 6 \nfacilities in Illinois and 6 in Missouri. There are 4 facilities in \nWashington. Ohio has 11 facilities. There are 5 facilities in Indiana. \nThere are 3 facilities each in Mississippi and South Carolina. There \nare 7 facilities in Pennsylvania and 4 in Arkansas. New Jersey has 2 \nfacilities.\n  There is one facility in North Dakota. Only 6 of the 50 States do not \nhave some biodiesel production. They are Alaska, Delaware, Maine, New \nHampshire, Vermont, and Wyoming. The other 44 States have some \nbiodiesel presence. I have an article from the Erie, PA, newspaper, \ndescribing the struggles of a local biodiesel plant.\n  So we need to turn away from talk of fat cats. We need to get back to \nwork on the bipartisan package that was in the works until the Senate \nDemocratic Leadership's dramatic change in direction. Many people who \nare not fat cats or a part of large corporations are counting on these \nprovisions being extended, and they are counting on their elected \nrepresentatives to work together, as we were doing, to get the job \ndone.\n  I ask unanimous consent the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Erie-Based Biodiesel Company Presses for Return of Tax Credit\n\n\n              Hero BX suffers without biodiesel incentive\n\n                            (By Jim Martin)\n\n       A major financial incentive to purchase biodiesel fuel \n     disappeared Jan. 1, and companies such as Erie-based Hero BX \n     are feeling the pain.\n       Hero, which can make up to 45 million gallons a year and \n     ranks as Pennsylvania's largest biodiesel company, ran full \n     steam for most of 2009.\n       But now, the loss of a $1-a-gallon tax credit for buyers \n     who blend biodiesel with petroleum-based fuels has softened \n     demand dramatically, said Mike Noble, Hero BX president.\n       The plant has operated only about 10 days since that credit \n     expired at the end of 2009, he said.\n       ``We are running today and tomorrow. Then we will be done \n     for a few days,'' he said Friday. ``It comes and goes, but \n     there is not a lot of demand.''\n       He's hoping the problem is temporary. So far this year, \n     however, efforts to reintroduce the tax credit, which makes \n     blodiesel prices more competitive, have fallen flat.\n       An extension of the credit was included in a draft of an \n     $85 billion Senate jobs bill.\n       However, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Democrat from \n     Nevada, announced he would trim the tax credit, along with \n     other provisions, to a more modest $15 billion.\n       Now, Reid and other Democrats in the Senate are under \n     pressure to restore the tax credit, not only from Republican \n     senators, but from Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who has \n     called the credit, ``an important credit and support \n     mechanism'' for renewable fuels.\n\n[[Page S609]]\n\n       There seems to be general agreement in Washington that the \n     credit will eventually be extended. The question that remains \n     is, ``When?''\n       The timing matters a great deal to Hero BX, where Noble \n     said biofuel production supports 40 jobs directly and another \n     40 or so office jobs indirectly.\n       So far, none of those employees have been laid off, despite \n     a dramatically reduced production schedule.\n       ``Once we get them trained, it's a very technical job. I \n     really don't want to lay them off,'' Noble said, citing the \n     time and expense of training new employees.\n       Noble said Hero BX has received support from U.S. Sens. \n     Arlen Specter and Bob Casey, both Pennsylvania Democrats.\n       ``Senator Casey thinks we must quickly restore the \n     biodiesel tax credit to preserve jobs in Erie and promote \n     energy independence,'' Stephanie Zarecky, his press \n     secretary, said in a statement. ``Senate leadership has \n     announced their intention to bring an extension to the floor. \n     Senator Casey hopes that it will come to the floor soon and \n     receive bipartisan support.''\n       Kate Kelly, press secretary for Specter, said her boss has \n     been a champion for the industry as a co-sponsor of the \n     Biodiesel Tax Incentive Reform and Extension Act of 2009, \n     which would have extended the tax credit through 2014.\n       She said in a statement that ``Senator Specter's office has \n     been working closely with stakeholders on the matter and is \n     looking for an appropriate legislative vehicle through which \n     to reinstate the tax credit so that companies like Hero BX \n     can get back on their feet.''\n       Both Hero BX and Erie-based American Biodiesel Energy Inc. \n     can look forward to May 1, when a new state mandate takes \n     effect that will require a 2 percent blend of biodiesel in \n     all diesel sold for over-the-road use in Pennsylvania.\n       Noble said that mandate will be good for business but hopes \n     he doesn't have to wait that long to see some relief.\n       ``The longer it takes, the further we go in debt and the \n     harder it will be to get out of the hole,'' he said.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, what is the order before the Senate at this \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time until 5:30 p.m. is under the majority \nleader's control.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if we are going to get the American economy \nback on track, we have to get the American people back to work. We know \nour serious troubles were not created in 1 day and we know they will \nnot be solved overnight. But we have to begin. We have to take that \nfirst step. That is what the bill before us represents: a strong first \nstep in the right direction.\n  This is a jobs plan that will cut businesses' taxes as an incentive \nto hire unemployed workers. It is a plan that includes tax breaks for \nkeeping those workers on the payroll and even more help for small \nbusinesses to write off their investments. In fact, this legislation \nwill allow small businesses to write off up to $250,000 for equipment \nand materials they purchased. That is a good deal. They do not have to \ndepreciate it.\n  It will extend the highway trust fund and expand Build America Bonds. \nI just finished a meeting a few minutes ago with 11 Governors. This is \none of the best programs with which they have ever dealt. We have no \nmore money. It creates jobs immediately. It is oversubscribed. It is a \nwonderful program that will build roads, will build other projects, \nbridges. The highway trust fund, for example, will save 1 million jobs; \nin Nevada, thousands of jobs.\n  I have a letter, if people think this is not a serious issue we are \ndealing with--and I do this because it is the only one I have--from the \nMissouri Department of Transportation:\n\n       All bidders--PLEASE TAKE NOTE!--Unless the federal \n     government takes the necessary steps to ensure the \n     availability of federal funds for the remaining fiscal year \n     prior to 12:00 p.m. on February 25, 2010, the scheduled \n     February 26, 2010 bid opening will be Postponed/Withdrawn \n     until further notice.\n\n  That is how it is. Missouri is not alone.\n  With this bill, we will create the right conditions for the private \nsector to start hiring again, and we are doing so in the right places.\n  These moneys, even though they come from Congress, the taxpayers' \ndollars go to create private jobs. These highways are not built by a \nbunch of Federal employees; they are built by private contractors. For \nevery $1 billion we invest in infrastructure, we create 47,500 high-\npaying jobs and other jobs that spin off from them.\n  With this first bill, we will create the right conditions for the \nprivate sector to start hiring again. I think we are doing it in the \nright places. When we help small businesses thrive, we will create jobs \nthat will let more entrepreneurs innovate and invent. When we invest in \nimproving our roads and bridges, we will create jobs so workers can \nsupport their families but also create infrastructure to support our \ngrowing Nation.\n  This bill is as good for the employees as it is for the employers. \nThis bill is good for the employers who will do the hiring. This is \nsuch a good deal. If a person is out of work for 30 days, a business \ncan hire them. If they hire them for up to 30 hours a week, they do not \nhave to pay their withholding tax, and at the end of the year they get \na $1,000 tax credit.\n  On my trip home, businesses on the verge of hiring people said: This \nis going to allow us to hire people. We can afford to do this. This is \nas good for the employers doing the hiring as it is for the employees \nwho will be getting hired.\n  One thing about this bill. Everybody should hear this. It is fully \npaid for, no deficit spending, which means we are not adding a single \ndime to the deficit, not a penny. We are doing this the responsible \nway, holding ourselves to the same budgeting standards we teach our \nchildren: You can only spend the money you have.\n  Each of these components--what are they? The Build America Bonds \nprovision I talked about; extending the highway bill for a year; the \nprovision Senator Hatch and Senator Schumer came up with that I talked \nabout that allows an employer to hire somebody who has been off work \nfor up to 60 days; and the final provision that allows them to write \noff $250,000 in purchases--is a good deal. That is what is in this \nbill.\n  We are doing this bill in a way that is responsible. You should not \nspend money you do not have, and that is what we are doing here. Each \nof these components--the tax breaks, the support to help small \nbusinesses grow and hire more workers, the new construction projects, \nand the fiscally responsible way we are doing it--is a nonpartisan \nidea. Republicans have supported every part of this bill in the past--\nevery part of this bill--and Democrats have also done the same. There \nis simply no reason it should not receive overwhelming support from \nboth sides of the aisle. But so far, I am sorry to say, this has not \nhappened. I am disappointed that this has been the case.\n  As the Presiding Officer knows, we had to file cloture some 70 times \nlast year--70 times. That is remarkably bad. Let's change that. I have \nspoken some with some of my Republican colleagues this past week and \nsaid: Let's don't do that anymore. Let's work together.\n  Who can complain about this bill? I have told the Republican leader \nand I have told anyone who will listen that we are going to move very \nquickly to a bill that will take about a day--travel promotion--after \nthis. In every State in the Union, No. 1, No. 2, sometimes No. 3, but \nmostly No. 1 and No. 2, the economic driver is tourism. We are the only \nmodern Nation that does not advertise itself. Watch TV and see the \nadvertisements coming from Australia, New Zealand, South American \ncountries, the Caribbean islands, and European countries. We should do \nthe same. The Travel Promotion Act will save $\\1/2\\ billion, and it \nalso pays for itself. There is no deficit spending.\n  As we finish that bill--it should be toward the end of the week--we \nare going to move into the tax extenders, unemployment, COBRA, issues \nsuch as those. I have explained that to the Republican leader.\n  Rather than figuring out how we can up the other politically, let's \nfigure how to put Americans back to work. I am sorry to say my friends \non the other side of the aisle are looking for ways not to vote for \nthis bill. The business community supports this legislation. It is \njobs. Rather than rally around a plan we know will create jobs, I have \nheard excuse after tired excuse. But the American people want us to \nwork together. They are not buying these excuses.\n  Why wouldn't we do this bill? We can create jobs starting in just a \nfew days. If someone could explain to me what is wrong with this bill, \nI would be happy to listen to them. What is wrong with this \nlegislation? Some have questioned the size of the bill. Only in \nWashington\n\n[[Page S610]]\n\nis a $15 billion investment to create and save more than 1 million jobs \nnot enough. I was stunned to hear on the radio this morning--when I \nreceived my press briefing, I was told that the unions and the left--\nwhoever that is--oppose our bill because it is not big enough. Now try \nthat one on, Mr. President. Only in Washington is a $15 billion \ninvestment to create and save more than 1 million jobs not enough.\n  The answer is not to do nothing. It is to do something to create jobs \nand then create more jobs and then create more jobs after that. That is \nwhy this is not the only jobs bill we are going to be dealing with or \nthe last jobs bill we will bring to the floor. We have a jobs agenda, \nnot a jobs bill. We are not going to stop until every American who \nwants a job can get one.\n  Some Senators--one Senator in particular, but there are others; this \nSenator does not stand alone--think that money that was spent on TARP \nshould be returned for the deficit. Other Senators said: I think the \nmoney that has not been spent from the stimulus should be returned to \nemployees. These are all good ideas, and amendments are going to be \nable to be offered when we get to our package later this week. That is \nthe way it should be.\n  We want every person in America who needs a job to get a job, but we \ncannot do it alone. My friends on the other side of the aisle share \nthis responsibility. When I had 60 votes, all the responsibility was \nmine. It is no longer that way. We are down to 59, and 1 of my Senators \nis sick today. I did speak with Senator Lautenberg last night. He is \ndoing fine. He is such a strong man. He said he will be back in a week \nor two. He is doing just fine.\n\n  If Republicans support this bill, as they have all the elements of it \nin the past, and they join us to pass it, we are going to do many more \nbills just like this to create jobs. However, if my friends on the \nother side of the aisle want to put partisanship ahead of people--\npeople who are out of work--if they once again try to distract from the \nissue at hand, they will only confirm their reputation as the party of \nno. They will only confirm the American people's fear that Republicans \nrefuse to do anything to help them.\n  So to my Republican colleagues, I say as seriously and fervently as I \ncan: Work with us. Show us you are serious about legislating. Show our \nconstituents you are serious about leading. Show the skeptics that you \nknow that putting people back to work is far more important than \nputting points up on the political scoreboard. Most important, I ask my \nRepublican colleagues to show those Americans who deserve a job they \ncan go to every morning, a job they can get up and go to, that we are \nwilling to do our job tonight.\n  It is remarkable we have to hold a procedural vote on a bill that \nwill create jobs. It will be regrettable if the minority prevents us \nfrom moving forward, from taking that first step, from giving millions \nof unemployed Americans the hope that tomorrow will be better than \nyesterday.\n  Think what it is for someone to get up in the morning and have no \nplace to go to work. I have met with some people, while I was home, \ndealing with domestic abuse. It has gotten out of hand. Why? Men do not \nhave jobs. Women do not have jobs, either, but women are not abusive, \nmost of the time. Men, when they are out of work, tend to become \nabusive. Our domestic crisis shelters in Nevada are jammed. That is the \nway it is all over the country. Jobs bring dignity, and that is what \nthis legislation is all about.\n  I hope we can pass this legislation and move on during this work \nperiod and work together in doing some good things for this country.\n  We have a couple minutes until 5:30 p.m. It is my understanding the \nvote is to occur at that time. Since there is no one on the floor, I \nask unanimous consent that the vote start early, and we will not cut it \noff early.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Under the previous order, pursuant to rule XXII, the Chair lays \nbefore the Senate the pending cloture motion, which the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n       We, the undersigned Senators, in accordance with the \n     provisions of rule XXII of the Standing Rules of the Senate, \n     hereby move to bring to a close debate on the motion to \n     concur with an amendment to the House amendment to the Senate \n     amendment to H.R. 2847, an act making appropriations for the \n     Departments of Commerce, and Justice and Science, and Related \n     Agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2010, and \n     for other purposes.\n         Harry Reid, Patrick J.

Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn \nhaving voted in the affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Cloture having been invoked on the motion to concur with an \namendment, the motion to refer falls.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I hope this is the beginning of a new day \nin the Senate. Whether this new day was created by the new Senator from \nMassachusetts or some other reason, I am very happy that we were able \nto get this vote. But there are some winners--not any individual \nSenator, not Democrats or Republicans; the winners are small business \npeople throughout this country.\n  On my trip home this past 10 days, people are excited about the fact \nthey may be able to write off $250,000 for things they badly need--not \ndepreciate it, just write it off. The other three\n\n[[Page S611]]\n\nprovisions are wonderful. To extend the highway bill for a year is \ngoing to save thousands of jobs in Nevada and 1 million jobs throughout \nthe country. So the small business communities throughout this country \nare winners, and also workers. This is going to create jobs.\n  I had a long conversation today with the Republican leader, and I \ntold him what the plans are in the Senate. He listened very closely, \nand we had a very good conversation. We are going to move, for a day or \ntwo after we complete this, to travel promotion, another bipartisan \nbill. It will save $\\1/2\\ billion. It will create thousands and \nthousands of jobs. All around the world countries advertise their \ntourism, but we do not. In this great country of ours, we do not see \nanything on TV. All we see is money being spent by other countries \nhaving us go to their countries. We want to do the same in their \ncountries. That is what this is all about. Every State in the Union, \nall 50, the No. 1, 2, and in a few instances the third economic driving \nfactor is tourism. This will help tourism.\n  As soon as we finish that, toward the end of this week, what we will \ndo is move to the Finance Committee matters that they worked on before, \nand they worked very hard. I am glad we have made progress in that \nregard. I told Senator McConnell that will be open to amendment. I will \ntry to work out with him so many amendments on each side. If we cannot \ndo that, we will not do that. I hope we can do that. But if we cannot, \nwe will move forward on the tax extenders, the expiring provisions, and \na few other things.\n  It is really a new day. I look forward to this work period being one \nwhere we can all go home and say: You know, ladies and gentlemen from \nNevada and New Hampshire and Illinois and New Jersey and New York and \nArkansas, we are working together. We are really getting things done \ntogether. That is what legislation should be about. Legislation is the \nart of compromise. It is building consensus and working together.\n  Basically that is what this piece of legislation is all about. This \nis not the jobs bill that we just completed. At least cloture has been \ninvoked, and we will vote on that in another day or so. It is part of \nan agenda. We are going to have, later this month, another jobs bill. I \nhave spoken to a number of Republican Senators. They have specific \nprovisions they want in this bill. It will deal with small business. \nDuring the last 10 years, 96 percent of all jobs in America were \ncreated by small businesses. I am very happy we were able to do this.\n\n  I express my appreciation to Senator Boxer, chairman of the Public \nWorks Committee. She has worked so hard. I love her committee. I was \nchairman on two separate occasions. It is a committee I have fond \nmemories of serving on. Every time I see the enthusiasm of Barbara \nBoxer, I know why the State of California cares so much about her.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, before the majority leader leaves the \nfloor, I want to say to him that today jobs triumphed over politics. \nThat is a great day around here. Jobs triumphed over politics. I want \nto say to Senator Reid, this idea you have to keep these bills very \nstraightforward and very easy to understand, this bill, four parts to \nit, two parts dealt with infrastructure, two parts dealt with tax \nbreaks that were related to making capital investments and hiring \nunemployed workers, is very simple for people to understand. I have to \nsay to my Democratic colleagues, 57 of whom voted for this, thank you. \nAnd to the five Republicans who joined us, thank you so much. It means \nso much to the working families of this country, to the business \ncommunity.\n  I want to say a special word to Senator Lautenberg if he is watching. \nI know how strongly he supports transportation. He is kind of Mr. \nTransportation in New Jersey. We all wish him well. We know he would \nhave been here if there was any way for him to be here. I will not say \nany more than I said before. I want to thank specific people out there \naround the country whom I talked to on several conference calls over \nthis break. They were always there. Night and day we talked. I \nexplained to them how close this vote would be. They explained to me \nthat they understood what the stakes were, a million jobs at stake in \nrelation to the highway trust fund, thousands more at stake in relation \nto the Build America bonds. This is a good day.\n  I thank the American Association of State Highway and Transportation \nOfficials; the American Road and Transportation Builders Association; \nthe Associated General Contractors of America; the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce; the Laborers International Union; the International Union of \nOperating Engineers; the American Highway Users Alliance; Faster, \nBetter, Safer Americans for Transportation Mobility; the AAA, which \nwrote to us. I want to say to all of them, they made this vote work \nbecause they knew what was happening on the ground.\n  In closing, I have one more thank you. This is a strange thing to say \nbut I want to thank the Missouri Department of Transportation for \ntelling the truth. Listen to what they wrote:\n\n       All bidders--PLEASE TAKE NOTE!--Unless the federal \n     government takes the necessary steps to ensure the \n     availability of federal funds for the remaining fiscal year, \n     bid openings will be postponed or withdrawn until further \n     notice.\n\n  In other words, the Department of Transportation in Missouri, being \nthe first State to be hit with this mess--by the way, followed closely \nby North Dakota, they are very close to this place, all of our States \nare--they came forward and told the truth that we had to act today. I \nhope the House will act with us, and we will get this resolved. In \nMarch we will start on the new bill. It is a good day.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Let me thank the Senator from California, Mrs. Boxer, and \ncertainly Senator Reid and others. This vote was very important. The \nquestion for the Senate and the Congress is when 25, 26 million people \nwake up in this country and go looking for a job and can't find it--the \nnumbers I know are 16 to 17 million people, but the real number of \npeople who are unemployed in America is much higher than that. There \nare many who have given up hope. At a time when that many Americans are \nlooking for work and can't find it, they need some hope. This Senate \nhas a choice of doing nothing or doing something. There are too many in \nthis Senate who have always been satisfied to do nothing. Tonight, \nfinally, in a piece of legislation that will put people to work, we \nknow, for example, that the private sector hires people, small and \nmedium-size businesses. But we also know that when you spend money for \nhighways, highway contractors are going to put people on payrolls \nimmediately, because those programs and those projects are already \nengineered, already designed, ready to go. The money doesn't exist for \nthem. When the money is made available, people will be hired \nimmediately.\n  The same is true with respect to the wage tax credits in this piece \nof legislation. I held a hearing in the policy committee. We had three \nsmall to medium-size businesses there, all of which are profitable, all \nwonderful businesses, all ready to expand. But none of them could \nbecause none of them could find capital or they had no access to \ncapital from their banks. Money was not available. These are successful \nbusinesses, profitable businesses, businesses wanting to and ready to \nexpand, wanting to hire more people and can't do it.\n  The fact is, this legislation is another step in the direction of \nsaying to small to medium-size businesses, when you are ready to begin \nhiring again, here is an additional incentive to hire that next worker. \nSlowly but surely we have to find a way to give people confidence, give \nthe American people confidence that this economy is improving, that \nthere will be a job, there will be opportunity and hope in the future.\n  We don't so much spend our days with people who are out of work. Most \npeople serving in the Senate have a pretty wonderful opportunity. They \nput on a suit in the morning. We are the kind of people, we shower in \nthe morning, put on a suit, are dressed up all day, come here. Our jobs \nare not being shipped overseas. In most cases, people in this Chamber \nhave not been so much subject to the deep recession. But a lot of \npeople have. Five-and-a-half million people who used to work in \nmanufacturing making things have lost their jobs in recent years. The\n\n[[Page S612]]\n\nquestion for most of those people who are looking for some hope from \ntheir leaders is: Will somebody do something, or is the government \ngoing to be content to do nothing?\n  The action this evening by which these four pieces of legislation, \nwhich include some incentives for small and medium-size businesses, \nsome bonding authority that will increase economic activity, the \nextension of the highway program that will put people back to work, \nexpensing for small businesses--these are all things that are going to \nactually put people on payrolls. It is not a case where we will hire \nsomebody as a government worker. It is a case of incentivizing highway \ncontractors to hire people to help build roads and bridges and repair \nroads and bridges. It is a case of incentivizing small to medium-size \nbusinesses to say: If you need that extra little incentive to hire that \nnext person, here it is.\n  Finally, and even more important than the incentive, is the signal \nthis sends, the signal that maybe at least, at long last, we will begin \nto see some progress, some cooperation, circumstances in which \nRepublicans and Democrats vote together in sufficient numbers that \nthings can get passed and get done. With as deep a recession as we are \nin, the deepest since the Great Depression, there is an urgency. It \nought to be treated as an urgent situation. This vote this evening may \nwell put us on the road to understanding how urgent it is and how \nimportant it is that we take action rather than delay.\n  I thank the leader and so many others. Senator Durbin and I worked on \na jobs package. These four provisions are in that package. There are \nother pieces we can implement in the future that will also be \nsubstantially important in getting people back to work, putting America \nback to work. I know the Senator from Ohio will speak next. I know he \nhopes that perhaps we will not just put people back to work but perhaps \nwill make products that say ``made in America'' once again. Wouldn't \nthat be a wonderful thing.\n  One additional point. I spoke earlier describing the metaphor of \nfilling the bathtub. We are trying to get the faucet going with \nincentives to put people to work. At the same time you have to plug the \ndrain a little bit. We have a drain of jobs going out of this country. \nThe President, in the State of the Union, said: Let's get rid of that \nunbelievable tax break that we provide people for moving jobs overseas. \nI have been in the Senate working on that for a long time. It is \nunbelievable that we say to somebody: Close up your factory, fire your \nworkers, move the jobs overseas, and you get a big fat tax break. We \nneed to plug the drain, in addition to opening the faucet to try to get \nadditional jobs and work on that in addition to the progress we have \nmade this evening that will give some hope to the American people who \nwant to go to work and need a good job.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I thank Senator Dorgan, who has \nled with Senator Durbin on all kinds of job creation efforts, \nunderstanding that although the private sector creates these jobs, it \nis a partnership with the private and public sector and State and local \nand Federal governments. He had it right. We need to follow his \nsuggestions and those of Senator Durbin as we move forward, including \nwhat was on the floor earlier this evening.\n  There are in my State some 640,000 unemployed people, in a State of \nabout 11 million. There are hundreds of thousands more who are \nunderemployed. There are tens of thousands of small businesses across \nOhio. There are hundreds of thousands of Ohioans who help ensure that \nroads and bridges and transit systems serve the best interests of \nresidents and businesses.\n  The bill we voted on today would help those Ohioans. These Ohioans \ndidn't bring about our Nation's economic crisis. It wasn't people who \nwork every day in Zaynesville and Lima or Findley who brought this on, \nbut they are paying the price for it every day. Too many people are \nlosing health insurance.\n  I was just on public television with the senior Senator from New \nHampshire. I pointed out that 390 Ohioans every day lose their health \ninsurance. This economy has squeezed more and more people, people who \nhave jobs, let alone the anxiety of people who have jobs and are afraid \nthat they will lose those jobs. Small businesses in my State have \neverything it takes to thrive, but they are undermined by this perilous \neconomic climate. Construction workers, manufacturing workers, small \nbusinesses, other hard-working Ohioans who keep our State going are \nlosing jobs, not because they are not good employees, not because they \ndon't show up, not because they aren't working hard, but because the \ndollars aren't there to pay them because employers are laying them off, \nwhether in the private or public sector. Unemployed workers are \nremaining that way not because they don't have the drive or the skills \nto succeed.\n  Majority Leader Reid has introduced a bill based on proposals from \nDemocrats and Republicans alike that would give tax breaks to small \nbusinesses and ensure dollars continue to flow into the highway trust \nfund. It is a bill designed to cut businesses a break. It is a bill \ndesigned to sustain our roads and bridges and transit systems to \nprevent massive job loss among the millions of Americans who work to \nensure the safety and the effectiveness of our transportation \ninfrastructure. If they are working, if people are working \nconstruction, if our bus drivers in the cities who are getting \nparticularly the elderly and low-income people to their doctors' \nappointments or to their workplace, if they are working, if the bus \ndrivers and the transit workers and the construction workers and the \nhighway builders, if they are working, then there is more money in the \neconomy and more people are working.\n  It is a bill, unfortunately, most Republicans in this Chamber, for \nwhatever reason--they always have a reason to be obstructive literally \n100 times in this session, more than 100 times--it is a bill that most \nof my Republican colleagues are determined to kill. I thank Senator \nVoinovich, the senior Republican in my State, for his support. I thank \nthe other four or five Republicans who voted at least to let us debate \nthis bill, something in the past they haven't even been willing to do \non other legislation.\n  So at least we have made progress that way. But if the press is \nright, the Republican leadership and their lobbying friends gathered \ntogether. They have been working 24/7 to convince the public that a \nbill solely focused on small businesses and middle-class jobs is a bad \nbill. You may have seen news reports that 100 lobbyists sat down with \nRepublicans and figured out a strategy to try to kill this jobs bill. \nIt is the same story, it is the same movie we watched last year on \nhealth care. It is the same story again that we have seen, that they \nare doing whatever it takes to kill this legislation. Fortunately for \nthe American people, fortunately for these hundreds of thousands of \nOhioans who are unemployed or underemployed, they did not get away with \nit today, that enough Republicans broke with their leadership and \nsupported efforts to move forward on jobs legislation.\n  Earlier today, I met with 200 to 300 Ohioans to unveil a report on \nhow to get our State's economy back on track. This was a group of \nDemocrats, Republicans, and Independents, and it was a group that had \neveryone from the mayor of Mansfield and the mayor of Marietta, to \nsmall businesses, to large companies, a couple of executives, American \nElectric Power Company, to a whole host of citizen activists who want \nto do whatever it takes. They want to fight for made-in-America \nlegislation that Senator Dorgan mentioned. They want a manufacturing \nindustrial policy in this country. We are the only country in the \ndeveloped world that does not have a real plan on how to do \nmanufacturing, on how to build an industrial economy, on how we begin \nto lead the world not just in the technology, which we have done in \nsolar and wind turbines and biomass and fuel cells--we lead in \ntechnology; we do not lead in industrial development and making those \nproducts. We developed the wind turbine technology in Sandusky, OH, \nabout 30 miles from where I live, but most of the wind turbines, the \ncomponents--a lot of components are made in Ohio, but most of the wind \nturbines are manufactured and assembled overseas. It is the same on \nsolar technology, the same on biomass, the same on fuel cells. Our \nscientists, our engineers, our professors,\n\n[[Page S613]]\n\nand our researchers develop a lot of this technology, but we are not \nmaking it in Ohio and New Hampshire and States around the country.\n  So today, as I said, all couple hundred, 250, 300 Ohioans--Democrats, \nIndependents, Republicans--gathered to figure out how to do this, to \nmove our State forward. As I said, there were a lot of Republicans. But \nRepublicans in Washington look at the world differently. Many of them \nare trying to demonize a bill that provides tax breaks, that saves \njobs. They need to take a step back, the Republicans in this body who I \nbelieve are very out of step with Republicans and everybody else in \nStates such as mine. They need to take a step back and remember for \nwhom they work.\n  Opposition for opposition's sake is not working for the American \npeople. On the Senate floor, we need to work together to save small \nbusinesses, to help these small businesses get credit, to help these \nsmall businesses work with local communities to provide jobs. That is \nwhat they want to do. We can do this if we work together.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, Thalia Marie Sperry Dondero has lived in \nNevada since 1942 when she transferred to Las Vegas for employment. She \nmet and married Harvey Dondero, who worked for the U.S. Department of \nEducation. He became an assistant superintendent of the Clark County \nSchool District. She began her community involvement through the Parent \nTeacher Organization as her five children were growing up. At the same \ntime she was active in the Service League, director of the Las Vegas \nGirl Scouts for 10 years during which time she helped develop both \nScout camps. She was also appointed to the Nevada State Parks \nCommission.\n  Thalia Dondero became the first woman elected to the Clark County \nCommission in 1974 where she promptly made the news by refusing to fill \nthe role of coffee maker and secretary to the other male members of the \nCommission. Mrs. Dondero was a commissioner for the next 20 years \nserving as chairperson three times.\n  Thalia's service mentored other women to run for office. During her \ntenure as commissioner, she was instrumental in the expansion of \nMcCarran Internation Airport, the development of flood control projects \nand chaired the Las Vegas Valley Water District. Her efforts led to the \nexpansion and protection of Clark County's recreational pearls, Red \nRock Canyon, Kyle Canyon and Valley of Fire. In 1996, Thalia Dondero \nwas elected to the Nevada System of Higher Education Board where she \nserved two terms as chair.\n  In the past 50 years, all of Nevada and Southern Nevada specifically \nhave been greatly affected by Thalia Dondero's lifelong dedication to \nthe children of Nevada and their education. She has made significant \ncontributions to the improvement of educational quality. She has \ncontinuously advocated for the Nevada environment. Thalia's single-\nminded civic responsibility and charitable contributions have played a \nmajor role in making Nevada and Las Vegas the destinations they have \nbecome.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/22/senate-section/article/S613-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S613]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRADEMARK LAW TECHNICAL AND CONFORMING AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, on January 28, 2010, I introduced S. \n2968, the Trademark Technical and Conforming Amendment Act of 2010, \nalong with the ranking member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Sessions. I appreciate that the Senate moved quickly to call up \nand pass this legislation by unanimous consent.

Madam President, I wanted to take a moment to discuss the \nDietary Supplement Safety Act of 2010 that Senator Dorgan and I \nintroduced earlier this month. This legislation has been widely \ndiscussed since introduction and many falsehoods and misstatements \nregarding it have been raised. I want to take a moment to clarify what \nthis bill will and will not do if passed into law.\n  We introduced this legislation at the request of the U.S. Anti-Doping \nAgency, Major League Baseball, National Basketball Association, \nNational Football League, National Hockey League, U.S. Olympic \nCommittee, American College of Sports Medicine, American Swimming \nCoaches Association, National Collegiate Athletic Association, PGA \nTour, U.S. Lacrosse, U.S. Tennis Association, U.S.A. Cycling, U.S.A. \nGymnastics, U.S.A. Swimming, U.S.A. Track and Field, and U.S.A. \nTriathlon. Additionally, scores of parents, spouses and high school \nathletic coaches requested action by Congress or the Food and Drug \nAdministration (FDA) to assist them in ensuring the safety of dietary \nsupplements.\n  I am proud that this legislation is so widely supported. However, \nopponents to this bill and their well-paid Washington lobbyists have \nspread false statements and rumors about the legislation, which is \nreally a disservice to consumers, and instead proudly boast that they \nremain largely untouchable by the FDA.\n  This legislation would simply require dietary supplements to list all \ningredients on the packaging, mandate that all dietary manufacturers \nregister with the Food and Drug Administration--FDA--to ensure the FDA \nknows what is being sold and provide the FDA mandatory recall authority \nof any dietary supplement if the FDA finds the supplement to be \nhazardous to one's health.\n  Opponents have stated that the legislation would seek to limit \nconsumers' ability to purchase dietary supplements, vitamins or \nprescription drugs. That is completely false. Opponents also claim the \nbill establishes a new regulatory structure for dietary supplements at \nthe Food and Drug Administration. That is completely false. Opponents \nclaim that this bill was only introduced to rein in a few athletes who \ntook supplements and then tested positive for steroids or other \nsubstances banned by sports leagues. That is completely false.\n  This bill was introduced for the nearly half of all Americans who \ntake a dietary supplement. People have died from taking dietary \nsupplements, including a young mother and wife who lived in my home \nState, and thousands have had to be hospitalized or seen by a doctor \ndue to an adverse reaction from a dietary supplement. It took nearly 10 \nyears--and then a lengthy court battle--for the FDA to ban the \ninclusion of ephedra in dietary supplements after ephedra was linked to \na number of deaths. Such a delay should never happen again.\n  Additionally, the more than 100 million Americans who consume dietary \nsupplements should be able to know the ingredients of any supplement, \nand these supplements need to be required to be listed on the product's \npackaging. If you go to a grocery store and pick up a box of cereal, \nbread, yogurt or any product off the shelf, you can read the\n\n[[Page S614]]\n\nproduct's label to clearly know the ingredients and be sure you aren't \neating something that you find concerning, hazardous or unhealthy. \nThose who take dietary supplements should have the same option. Simply \nput, this legislation is about truth in labeling. This legislation is \nabout giving consumers choice. If you take a vitamin now, this bill \nwill in no way restrict your ability to take that vitamin. But the \nconsumer needs to know the entirety of what is contained in that pill.\n  Additionally, clear labeling could save lives as it did for a Phoenix \nSuns star who took a dietary supplement sleep aid and stopped \nbreathing. Fortunately, his teammates found the supplement bottle that \nlisted the ingredients, and the emergency room doctors were able to use \nthe information to give him an antidote in the emergency room moments \nlater and save his life. The disclosure of ingredients on a dietary \nsupplement can save lives; and therefore, it should be mandatory. With \nthe new ``buzz word'' in Washington being ``transparency,'' I don't \nunderstand how any lawmaker could oppose such a requirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/22/senate-section/article/S614-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S614]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Specialist Marc P. Decoteau\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Madam President, it is with a heavy heart that I rise \ntoday to pay tribute to the life and service of Army SPC Marc P. \nDecoteau of Waterville Valley, NH. Tragically, this young soldier, just \n19 years old, died while serving as part of Operation Enduring Freedom \nin Wardak Province, Afghanistan on January 29, 2010. Specialist \nDecoteau was a member of the 6th Psychological Operations Battalion, \n4th Psychological Operations Group based at Fort Bragg, NC. He had been \ndeployed in Afghanistan less than 1 month at the time of his death.\n  Specialist Decoteau enlisted in the Army shortly after his graduation \nfrom Plymouth Regional High School in 2008. He made this honorable \ndecision without reservation, having long declared his desire to serve. \nMarc followed in the footsteps of his father, an Army veteran and West \nPoint graduate. His decorations include the National Defense Service \nMedal, Afghanistan Campaign Medal with Campaign Star, Army Service \nRibbon, and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. Marc was \nposthumously awarded the Army Commendation Medal, Army Good Conduct \nMedal and NATO Medal.\n  Despite his young age, Specialist Decoteau left an indelible mark on \nthose who knew him. Marc was an upstanding young man with an infectious \nsense of humor and warm smile. His hometown of Waterville Valley is an \nexceptionally tight-knit community of just 340 residents, and he was an \nintegral member of it. While at Plymouth Regional, he was also an \noutstanding student-athlete who played lacrosse and football and was \nknown for his work ethic. He was a member of two State champion \nfootball teams.\n  Each day, the men and women of our Armed Forces offer their service \nso that we might enjoy freedom and security. Specialist Decoteau \nselflessly gave his life to that cause. No words can diminish the pain \nof losing such a young soldier, but I hope Marc's family--and the town \nof Waterville Valley, his extended family--can find solace in knowing \nthat all Americans share a deep appreciation of Marc's service. Daniel \nWebster's words, first spoken during his eulogy for Presidents Adams \nand Jefferson in 1826, are fitting: ``Although no sculptured marble \nshould rise to their memory, nor engraved stone bear record of their \ndeeds, yet will their remembrance be as lasting as the land they \nhonored.'' Specialist Decoteau has earned our country's enduring \ngratitude and recognition.\n  Specialist Decoteau is survived by his parents Nancy and Mark, his \nsister Medora and brother Andrew, as well as grandparents, aunts, \nuncles and cousins. This young patriot will be dearly missed by all; \nhis death while deployed far from home is a true loss for New Hampshire \nand for our nation. I ask my colleagues and all Americans to join me in \nhonoring the life, service and sacrifice of SPC Marc P. Decoteau.\n\n\n                         Captain Daniel Whitten\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I stand before you today with a somber \ntask. I extend my most sincere gratitude to fallen soldier, CAPT Daniel \nWhitten, and his family. Captain Whitten was a decorated officer who \nserved valiantly with Company C, 1st Battalion, 508th Parachute \nInfantry Regiment, 4th Brigade Combat Team, 82nd Airborne Division out \nof Fort Bragg, NC, before he was killed by an improvised explosive \ndevice in the Zabul province, Afghanistan, on February 2, 2010.\n  When people described CAPT Daniel Whitten, comments such as, ``always \ndoing the right thing,'' ``stood by his values,'' ``true to his family \nand himself,'' ``trusted his character'' were common responses. It is a \ntrue testament to the character of Captain Whitten that those who knew \nhim held him in such high regard.\n  Captain Whitten is a graduate of Johnston High School, class of 1999, \nand the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, class of 2004. He was a \nvery motivated individual, always striving to be the best he could be. \nThe men who served under him had only good things to say about him. \nPeople who knew him said that he was the exact type of person they \nwould want defending this country.\n  My deepest sympathies go out to Captain Whitten's wife Starr, his \nmother Jill, his father Dan, and his sister CAPT Sarah Whitten who is \ncurrently serving her country in Afghanistan. It is men like CAPT \nDaniel Whitten who guarantee our Nation's security and our people's \nliberty. We all owe Captain Whitten and his family our profound \ngratitude for their tremendous sacrifice. I ask that they be in your \nthoughts and prayers, as they are in mine.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/22/senate-section/article/S614-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S614-S615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                   REMEMBERING MYRON DONOVAN CROCKER\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Madam President, I ask my colleagues to join me \nin honoring the memory of Judge Myron Donovan ``M.D.'' Crocker. Judge \nCrocker passed away on February 2 at his home in Chowchilla. He was 94 \nyears old.\n  M.D. Crocker was born in Pasadena on September 4, 1915. In 1918, his \nfamily moved to Caruthers in Fresno County and then to the city of \nFresno in 1921. After graduating from Fresno High School, he earned a \ndegree in political science from Fresno State College. In 1940, he \ngraduated from Boalt Hall Law School at University of California, \nBerkeley, and passed the California bar.\n  Instead of beginning his career in the legal field, Judge Crocker \njoined the FBI serving in Albany, NY, where he specialized in \ndeciphering codes during World War II. After a stint in the FBI's Los \nAngeles office, he returned to the San Joaquin Valley in 1946 where he \nserved as assistant district attorney in Madera County. In 1953, he was \nelected to the Justice Court in Chowchilla. Five years later, he was \nappointed by Governor Goodwin Knight as a Madera County Superior Court \njudge.\n  When he was appointed by President Dwight Eisenhower to the Federal \ncourt bench, Judge Crocker, at 44 years old, became the youngest \nFederal judge in the United State at the time. For 8 years, he commuted \nto his job in Los Angeles. In 1961, he became the first Fresno based \nFederal judge with the creation of the Eastern District of California. \nFor the next 12 years, Judge Crocker heard all the cases in the \nsouthern section of the Eastern District until a second Federal judge \nwas authorized in Fresno.\n  Judge Crocker would serve under 10 U.S. Presidents during a \nremarkable career on the Federal bench. Despite earning senior status \nin 1980, he continued to work and hear cases until he retired in 2002 \nat the age of 87.\n  A man of keen intellect, Judge Crocker was also acknowledged by those \nwho knew him for his gregarious nature and gentlemanly ways. He was \nadmired by his colleagues for his sharp memory. A giving person, he \nlent his time and talents to a number of community causes, including \nLions Club and coaching Little League baseball. In his spare time, he \nenjoyed golfing, tending to his garden and playing bridge with his \nfriends. He will be missed.\n  Judge Crocker was preceded in death by his beloved wife of 68 years, \nElaine.

On \nFebruary 28, 1910, the city of Lindsay was incorporated with a \npopulation of 1,500 people.\n  The beginning of the 20th century would see economic growth and an \nincrease in population in the area. Attracted by the promise of \nLindsay's growing economy and appealing living conditions, the city of \nLindsay became a popular destination for people in search of a better \nlivelihood. The city's rail cars would transport the region's \nagricultural products to new markets, allowing the citrus and olive \nindustries to flourish.\n  Spanning the 20th century, the city of Lindsay thrived with the \naddition of businesses, churches, schools, and community organizations. \nThe ingenuity and determination of new generations of farmers would \ncontinue to enhance the city's agricultural eminence. Even when faced \nwith the hardships of the Great Depression, community members and the \nLindsay Chamber of Commerce pulled together to establish the first \nOrange Blossom Festival in 1932, which promoted the city's prolific \ncitrus industry. To this day, the Orange Blossom Festival continues to \nbe a citywide celebration of the city's rich heritage in citrus \ngrowing.\n  In 1995, the city of Lindsay was awarded the prestigious All America \nCity Award by the National Civic League. This well deserved recognition \nis a testament to the city of Lindsay's community spirit.\n  The city of Lindsay has grown from a town of 1,500 to a strong \ncommunity of over 10,000 residents. The successful history of the \ncity's first hundred years can be attributed to its vision, optimism, \nand an endearing sense of community. As the residents of the city work \ntogether to make their community a better place to call home, I \ncongratulate them on their centennial celebration and wish them another \n100 years of good fortune and success. \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/22/senate-section/article/S615-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S615]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING THE UNI-CAPITOL WASHINGTON INTERNSHIP PROGRAMME\n\n Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, today I wish to take note of a \ngreat international internship program that is now celebrating its 11th \nyear. I am proud to be involved for a 4th year in the Uni-Capitol \nWashington Internship Programme, UCWIP, an exchange program in which \noutstanding college students from Australia's top universities compete \nto serve as interns for the U.S. Congress. This program has been \nbringing the Washington internship experience to students from \nAustralia for more than 10 years. In addition to working in \ncongressional offices, the program provides students with a number of \nother opportunities and activities including visits to U.S. historic \nsites, visits to government agencies and education events.\n  This semester Benjamin Watson, a student from the University of \nWestern Australia, is spending a couple of months in my office, helping \nme serve Idaho constituents. But students from the Uni-Capitol \nWashington Programme can be found throughout congressional offices, \nworking for both the House and the Senate.\n  I asked Ben to share his thoughts about this program, and he said, \n``The UCWIP has truly been a once-in-a-lifetime experience. Working in \nSenator Crapo's office has given me an insight into the workings of the \nworld's most influential democracy, adding a practical element to my \nstudies in politics and law. My internship has given me the chance to \ninteract with interesting people and understand the processes and \nprocedures of U.S. Congress, within the friendly and welcoming \nenvironment of Senator Crapo's office.''\n  Ben has been a great addition to my intern staff for the spring \nsemester, and has spent many hours helping keep my schedule and \nactivities running smoothly. His efforts are much appreciated. And I am \nsure that the other offices that have participated in this program feel \nthat way toward the work of those assigned to their offices.\n  I cannot conclude without recognizing the efforts put into this \nprogram each year by its director and founder, Eric Federing, who spent \na number of years working on Capitol Hill himself. After he visited \nAustralia a number of years ago, he determined to find a way to \nintroduce the U.S. Congress to the students he met. He has done such \ngreat work in sharing his enthusiasm and experiences with so many \nAustralian students. More than 100 students have made the long journey \nfrom their universities in Australia to Washington, DC, to take part in \nthis program. In addition to the work opportunities provided on Capitol \nHill, Uni-Capitol Washington also expands the yearly experience to \ninclude some of America's historical sites and famous landmarks, \nincluding Gettysburg and New York City.\n  It has been an honor to participate with this program, and I look \nforward to continuing my association with the Uni-Capitol Washington \nInternship Programme next year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/22/senate-section/article/S615-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S615-S616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO HAROLD McGRAW, JR.\n\n Mr. DODD. Madam President, today I honor a great American from \nmy home State of Connecticut, Harold McGraw, Jr.\n  After serving as a captain in the Army Air Corps during World War II, \nMr. McGraw joined the family business, McGraw-Hill, as a sales \nrepresentative in 1947. Over the next half century, he worked his way \nup to the position of president of the McGraw-Hill book company, and \nthen CEO and chairman of the parent corporation, McGraw-Hill, Inc.\n  Not satisfied with simply succeeding in business, Mr. McGraw quickly \nbecame a leader in his community. In the 1980s, he founded the Business \nCouncil for Effective Literacy, BCEL, and served as its president for a \ndecade. He spoke at events across the country to champion the cause of \nadult literacy, giving generously of his own wealth and raising funds \nfrom corporate and public entities alike.\n  A BCEL grant led to the formation of the National Coalition for \nLiteracy and established Mr. McGraw as a key public policy expert on \nthis important issue. His work laid the foundation for the National \nLiteracy Act and the National Institute for Literacy, and those of us \nin Congress and in the executive branch quickly became familiar with \nhis tireless advocacy. He spoke up in person and in letters. He \nmobilized the business community. And he was always accessible to adult \nlearners, teachers, and local adult literacy programs.\n  Always cognizant of the role education played in his own success, Mr. \nMcGraw has worked hard to make education a focus of his civic \nengagement, including efforts with the New York Public Library, the \nCouncil for Air to Education, the International Center for the \nDisabled, and the Barbara Bush Foundation for Family Literacy.\n  A proud Princeton graduate, Mr. McGraw gave back to his alma mater \nwith a generous gift to establish The McGraw Center for Teaching and \nLearning at Princeton University. Princeton President Harold Shapiro \nsaid that the McGraw Center would help ``redefine teaching and learning \nfor future generations.'' Mr. McGraw has also lent his publishing \nexpertise to the Princeton University Press.\n  The Harold W. McGraw, Jr. Prize in Education, established in 1988 by \nThe McGraw-Hill Companies to mark the Company's 100th anniversary, \nhonors those who have dedicated themselves to improving American \neducation.\n  But Mr. McGraw is no stranger to honors himself. In 1990, President \nBush awarded him the Nation's highest literacy award at a special White \nHouse ceremony.\n  And he is the recipient of honorary degrees from the Graduate School \nof Princeton University, the City University of New York, Ohio \nUniversity, Pine Manor College, Fairfield University, Hofstra \nUniversity, and Marymount Manhattan College, as well as the Cleveland \nE. Dodge Medal for Distinguished Service to Education from Columbia \nUniversity's Teachers College.\n\n[[Page S616]]\n\n  Mr. McGraw has given so much to our country at large, but he hasn't \nforgotten the State he and I both love. A major supporter of the \nlibrary in his town of Darien, he has also contributed generously to \nNorwalk Hospital and St. Joseph's Hospital, along with his local \nchurch. He has worked to support elderly care at the Waveny Care Center \nin New Canaan, CT, Pegasus Therapeutic Riding in Stamford, and a wide \nrange of civic organizations, from the Boy Scouts to the Literary \nVolunteers of Connecticut.\n  Harold McGraw represents the best of American business and civic \nculture. All of us in Connecticut are proud to call him one of our own, \nand the many whose lives have been touched by his commitment to adult \nliteracy are grateful for his efforts. We look forward to his continued \ngood deeds and remain inspired by his example. It is my pleasure to \nhonor this great American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/22/senate-section/article/S616-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING DIANE CAVES\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Madam President, today I honor the life and \nservice of Diane Caves, a bright and talented young woman whose life \nended far too soon, in the tragic earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, \non January 12, 2010.\n  Diane worked for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, as a \npolicy analyst in the Office of Public Health Preparedness and \nResponse. Her commitment to public service was recognized just last \nyear when she was named 2009 Federal Employee of the Year for Atlanta \nin the Outstanding Professional Category, at the age of 30.\n  Diane led the development in 2008 of CDC's first comprehensive \nnationwide report on public health preparedness, ``Public Health \nPreparedness: Mobilizing State by State.'' Her work launched a regular \nseries of reports that demonstrate accountability and drive program \nimprovements to help protect the Nation from public health emergencies.\n  She shined equally bright among her friends and in her community. She \nwas an avid soccer player, an insatiable reader, and a world traveler. \nShe brought people together to share their interests in food, knitting, \nbooks and sports, and motivated others with her energy, wit and \nunyielding optimism.\n  Diane recently volunteered for a short assignment to Haiti to work on \nthe President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, or PEPFAR. Congress \nreauthorized this historic commitment to the fight against global AIDS \na little more than a year ago, with strong support from both parties. \nPEPFAR represents the very best of America. It is a remarkable program \nthat is saving lives around the world with the contributions of people \nlike Diane and her colleagues at CDC.\n  Diane didn't go to Haiti for the recognition. She went because she \nwas passionate about public health, because she was a committed public \nservant, and because, above all, she wanted to help people. She didn't \ngo to Haiti because it would be easy or comfortable. She asked to go \nwhere the challenges were greatest, the work was the hardest and the \npotential to help was limitless.\n  Diane didn't go to Haiti to be a hero. But she has come home as one.\n  She was brought to Dover Air Force Base last week, and a family \nmemorial service was held in her hometown of Oak Ridge, TN. Her family \nand friends will mourn her quietly and privately as a loved one. We \nwill also mourn her as a nation, as we do any American who dies in \nservice to this country. There will be a ceremony at CDC in her honor \non March 1, 2010, where her name will be added to a memorial for \nemployees who died while in service.\n  We are thankful for the life and service of Diane Caves. Her smile, \nher laugh and her spirit will always be remembered. Her service will \nalways be celebrated. Her extraordinary gifts and talents were shared \nwith many during her short life, and they will never be forgotten.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with her husband Jeff Caves; her parents \nLee and Linda Berry; her brother David Berry; and with Jeff's family \nand all of her friends and colleagues who will mourn her and miss her \nand strive always to live up to her example.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/22/senate-section/article/S616-2", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR.

Madam President, today I pay tribute to the \nprofessional career and community achievements of Dr. Sandra Diane \n``Sandi'' Sanders of Fort Smith, AR.\n  Dr. Sandi Sanders, who did her master's and doctoral work at the \nUniversity of Arkansas, has been an educator and involved in the Fort \nSmith community all of her life. She played a major role in the \ndevelopment of the former Westark Community College which today is the \nUniversity of Arkansas-Fort Smith, UAFS. She served in many different \nroles including provost, chief academic officer, senior vice chancellor \nand chief of staff, and most recently interim chancellor. Her \nleadership has guided UAFS to be one of the premiere community colleges \nin Arkansas and across the Nation.\n  She has served and continues to serve in the community in many \ndifferent roles such as former director of the Arkansas State Chamber \nof Commerce, board of directors at Arvest Bank of Fort Smith, United \nWay Women's Leadership Giving Steering Committee, former campaign \nchairman for the 2005 United Way of Fort Smith, and many other \nactivities. She is currently serving as project director for the U.S. \nMarshall Museum being built in Fort Smith. Her dedication to her \ncommunity is shown through the numerous hours devoted to making her \nsociety a better place for her neighbors and for future residents.\n  Dr. Sanders has brought great leadership and outstanding integrity to \nthe Arkansas community. Her leadership has been and will continue to be \ncritical in an ever-changing environment. The work of educating young \npeople should not be taken lightly and I am proud to have Dr. Sanders \nteaching and advising students in our great State.\n  Madam President, I ask that my colleagues join me in recognizing the \ngreat contributions Dr. Sandi Sanders has made to Arkansas and the \nUnited States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/22/senate-section/article/S616-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Pate, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/22/senate-section/article/S616-4", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/22/senate-section/article/S616-5", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S616]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE RECEIVED DURING ADJOURNMENT\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Under the authority of the order of the Senate of January 6, 2009, \nthe Secretary of the Senate, on February 16, 2010, during the \nadjournment of the Senate, received a message from the House of \nRepresentatives announcing that the Speaker has signed the following \nenrolled bill:\n\n       S. 2950.

A bill to amend chapter 53 of title 49, United States Code, \nto establish a public transportation safety program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce, at the request of \nthe administration and on behalf of my fellow original cosponsors \nSenator Menendez, Senator Mikulski, and Senator Cardin, the Public \nTransportation Safety Program Act of 2010. This legislation is designed \nto provide the Federal Transit Administration with the proper funding \nand rulemaking, examination, and enforcement authority to improve the \nsafety of our nation's transit systems.\n  The issue of improving transit safety is a bipartisan issue, on which \nI think all Members can come to agreement. While this proposal from the \nadministration is a good and appropriate first step in the Federal \nGovernment's efforts to improve transit safety, I look forward to \nworking with my cosponsors and all of my colleagues on the Senate \nBanking Committee to make the final bill, which will emerge from the \nSenate Banking Committee, the strongest legislation possible for \nensuring the safety of our nation's transit systems.\n  Transit is among the safest modes of transportation. Between 1998 and \n2007, incidents on public transportation rail systems fell by half.\n  But in light of a recent series of high-profile accidents, Americans \nhave grown concerned, and rightfully so. As our Nation's transit \nsystems age, it is becoming increasingly clear that it is time for the \nFederal government to take a more direct role in their oversight.\n  Currently, the Federal Transit Administration has limited authority \nto implement and enforce national transit safety standards and we have \ngone without a proper national transit safety program for far too long.\n  Having been handed an unfunded mandate, States have been forced to \nscrape by with State Safety Oversight boards. Many of these boards lack \nauthority, expertise, a dedicated budget or even full-time employees to \nmonitor safety.\n  This is unacceptable. This ad hoc approach to transit safety \noversight must be replaced with better oversight and clear national \ntransit safety standards. Congress should provide the FTA with the \nauthority and the resources to bring consistency and Federal leadership \nto our transit safety system. It is our duty to ensure that accidents \nlike those that occurred in 2009 are prevented.\n  I commend the Administration, particularly Secretary LaHood and \nadministrator Rogoff, for taking a leadership role on this very \nimportant issue and sending the proposed legislation to Congress. This \nproposal is a good start, and I look forward to discussing it with my \ncolleagues.\n  The Obama administration has indicated its commitment to improving \ntransit safety. It is time for us to do the same.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3015\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today in support of a resolution \nhonoring the lifetime achievements of C. DeLores Tucker. Along with her \nfamily and many friends with us today in Washington, we pay tribute to \nher life of service and courageous commitment to justice for women and \nfor the African-American community.\n  Cynthia DeLores Nottage Tucker was born in Philadelphia, PA, on \nOctober 4, 1927 and was the tenth of eleven children in her family. Her \nBahamian-born Baptist minister father and her hard-working mother \napproached life from a Christian perspective and encouraged their \nchildren to do so as well. She grew up in a nurturing and achievement-\noriented household. ``My mother and father gave us wonderful values,'' \nTucker once told Good Housekeeping magazine. ``They taught us to be \ngood and loving, and to use our lives to help others.''\n  Young DeLores originally intended to become a doctor and, as a girl, \nspent summers working in local hospitals. When she graduated from \nGirls' High of Philadelphia, her father took her to the Bahamas as a \nreward. During the trip, she became seriously ill and was restricted to \na sickbed that kept her out of college for a year. This setback changed \nthe course of her life. She subsequently finished her education at \nTemple University and the Wharton School of the University of \nPennsylvania. She also received two honorary degrees, from Morris \nCollege in Alabama and Villa Maria College in Pennsylvania.\n  C. DeLores Tucker first became active in the postwar civil rights \nmovement when she worked to register Black voters during a 1950 mayoral \ncampaign. In July 1951, she married a friend of her brother, Bill \nTucker, a construction company owner who also owned real estate in and \naround Philadelphia. For several years, DeLores sold real estate and \ninsurance and was active in local politics. She also became an \naccomplished fundraiser and public speaker. The experience she gained \nin civic causes and work with her husband, helped to make her a well \nknown figure in the city. She became the first African-American and \nfirst woman to serve on the Philadelphia Zoning Board.\n  As the civil rights movement gained momentum in the late 1950s and \nearly 1960s, DeLores found the perfect channel for her activism. She \njoined the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, \nNAACP, and helped the NAACP raise funds. She never shied away from \nsensitive political issues. As part of her civil rights activism, she \nwalked with Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in the Selma to Montgomery \nmarch. In 1965, she participated in the White House Conference on Civil \nRights and was a strong advocate of the 1965 Voting Rights Bill signed \nby President Lyndon Johnson.\n  DeLores Tucker's life was guided by her deep convictions. Throughout \nthe 1960s, she campaigned for African-American candidates and served on \nher party's state committee. Her strong will and organizing skills \nbrought her to the attention of those in power. In January 1971, she \nwas named Secretary of the Commonwealth by Governor Milton J. Shapp. \nThis appointment made DeLores the first African-American woman in the \nUnited States to serve in such a role.\n  The responsibilities of her job were serious. As Secretary of the \nCommonwealth, she was the keeper of the Great Seal of the Commonwealth \nand had the duty of authenticating government documents through the \nseal's use. By statute, she was a member of a number of important state \nboards and commissions. She also helped implement an affirmative action \nprogram to bring more equality to Pennsylvania's hiring practices. \nDuring her tenure, she advocated for the appointment of women and \nAfrican-Americans as judges and as members of state boards and \ncommissions. She led the effort to make Pennsylvania one of the first \nstates to develop voter registration by mail and reduce the voting age \nfrom 21 to 18. Further, she helped pass statutes that would permit \nstudents to register and vote from their college districts. Ebony \nmagazine named her among the ``100 most influential'' African-Americans \nevery year of her tenure.\n  After leaving state government, Dr. Tucker was a candidate for \nseveral political offices, including lieutenant governor and United \nStates Senator. Although her efforts were unsuccessful, she never \nwavered in her commitment to public service. She continued her \ncommitment to community service, working with underprivileged young \npeople both in Philadelphia and across the country.\n  DeLores Tucker always continued to participate in politics. As a \nfundraiser and organizer, she was involved in Jesse Jackson's \npresidential campaign in 1984. She chaired the Black Caucus of her \nparty's national committee for several years, where she worked to \nincrease the involvement of African-American women in politics.\n  One of Dr. Tucker's greatest legacies was her work as a founder of \nthe National Political Congress of Black Women in 1984 which was \ncreated to advance the interests of the African-American community, \nespecially women. The group devised a comprehensive ten-point plan to \nreclaim and improve the African-American community by focusing on voter \nregistration, educational quality and equity, welfare reform that would \nnot victimize poor people, and fair and adequate legal services for \neveryone. The National Political Congress of Black Women addressed both \nbroad national\n\n[[Page S626]]\n\nissues as well as local issues by, for example, supporting African-\nAmerican congresswomen, as well as honoring civil rights pioneers, \nincluding Myrlie Evers-Williams, Dr. Betty Shabazz, and Coretta Scott \nKing. The organization encouraged Black women to participate in the \npolitical process as voters, candidates, policymakers, fundraisers and \nrole models. Today, the organization is known as the National Congress \nfor Black Women. In 1992, Dr. Tucker succeeded Shirley Chisholm as the \nnational chair of the National Congress of Black Women and served in \nthat role until her death in 2005.\n\n  In 1991, Dr. Tucker founded the Bethune-DuBois Institute to promote \nthe cultural and educational development of African-American youth. \nDuring this time, Dr. Tucker began her public criticism of some kinds \nof rap music. She argued that record companies should halt the \ndistribution of popular music that she believed contained derogatory \nlyrics about women and minorities and had a negative impact on young \npeople. Objecting to the sale of such lyrics to minors, she asked the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation to launch an inquiry. Both the NAACP \nand the Congressional Black Caucus supported Dr. Tucker's initiative.\n  Dr. Tucker rose to national prominence in African-American civil \nrights circles through her tireless activism and political fundraising. \nShe worked to end racism and make the United States a more equal, \nmulticultural society. Her career in civil rights spanned more than 50 \nyears. Her husband, Bill Tucker, told the Washington Post that DeLores \n``was one of the most fearless individuals I have ever known . . . She \nwill take on anyone, anything, if that's what she thinks is right.''\n  Dr. Tucker chaired the Black Caucus of her party's national committee \nfor 11 years and spoke at five national conventions. As a member of the \nnational committee, she was one of the original organizers of the Black \nCaucus and the Women's Caucus. She worked tirelessly to ensure that \nwomen, African-Americans and other minorities had fair representation \nwithin her party. She was the first African-American to serve as \nPresident of the National Federation of Democratic Women. Dr. Tucker \nalso served as a member of the NAACP Board of Trustees and on the board \nof the Points of Light Foundation. She was also a member of Alpha Kappa \nAlpha Sorority.\n  During her career, Dr. Tucker received more than 400 awards and \nhonors, including the NAACP Thurgood Marshall Award, the Martin Luther \nKing, Jr. Distinguished Service Award and the Philadelphia Urban League \nWhitney Young Award.\n  C. DeLores Tucker passed away on October 12, 2005. Her legacy lives \non through the work of her husband, Bill Tucker, her many nieces and \nnephews, and the hundreds of people she helped and mentored during her \nlife.\n  DeLores Tucker was a daughter of Philadelphia, a city that has \nproduced many notable leaders, in fields as diverse as the fine arts, \npolitics, science, athletics, business, literature and entertainment. \nIn December of 1939, Marcia Davenport wrote an article in Collier's \nmagazine about the great internationally known contralto, Philadelphian \nMarian Anderson. Davenport's article described Anderson as a young girl \nin south Philadelphia--whose father, John Anderson, died when she was \nten--playing on an imaginary piano and singing despite the poverty her \nfamily lived in.\n\n       But in the heart of Anna Anderson, as she watched her child \n     throbbing with music, there was a steadfast belief that for \n     any worthy end, a way will come.\n\n  For DeLores Tucker, through hard work, a passion for advocacy, a \nstrong faith and a loving family, a way did come. A way to stand up for \nthe powerless; a way to overcome racism, prejudice, and hatred; a way \nto shine the bright warm light of justice and compassion in the dark \ncorners of America. Yes, a way did come for DeLores Tucker to use her \nvoice to sing her own hymn of equal rights and opportunity for all, \nespecially women and African-Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/22/senate-section/article/S626-1", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S626]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 3315.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4532, received \nfrom the House and at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 4532) to provide for permanent extension of \n     the attorney fee withholding procedures under title II of the \n     Social Security Act to title XVI of such Act, and to provide \n     for permanent extension of such procedures under titles II \n     and XVI of such Act to qualified non-attorney \n     representatives.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I urge the Senate to pass by unanimous \nconsent H.R. 4532, the Social Security Disability Applicants' Access to \nProfessional Representation Act of 2010, which was recently passed by \nthe House of Representatives by a vote of 412 to 6.\n  Claimants of Social Security disability benefits who want to appeal \ndecisions on their cases face many complexities. Therefore, many wish \nto hire professionals to represent them in these appeals. These \nrepresentatives can request to have their fees withheld by SSA from the \nretroactive benefits owed to the claimant. The withheld fees are \nforwarded directly to the representatives by SSA. This fee arrangement \nmakes it much more attractive for these representatives to take on \nthese cases, which will provide claimants with easier access to \nprofessionals willing to represent them before SSA. Prior to enactment \nof the Social Security Protection Act of 2004, this direct payment of \nfees was only available to attorneys, not to nonattorneys, and only \napplied to Social Security claims, not to supplemental security income, \nSSI, claims.\n  The Social Security Protection Act authorized two nationwide \ndemonstration projects for a period of 5 years each. One project \nextended the attorney fee withholding and payment procedures that \nexisted for Social Security claims to supplemental security income \nclaims. A second project allowed nonattorney representatives the option \nof fee withholding for both Social Security and supplemental security \nincome claims. This second project also required that nonattorney \nrepresentatives who wish to apply for the direct fee payment program \nmust have passed an examination written and administered by the \nCommissioner of Social Security, have met certain educational and \nprofessional liability insurance requirements, and have passed a \ncriminal background check.\n  The demonstration projects have been successful, but both sunset on \nMarch 1, 2010. H.R. 4532 eliminates the sunsets of both of the \ndemonstration projects. This bill unifies the attorney and nonattorney \nfee withholding process for both Social Security and supplemental \nsecurity income. The bill is a commonsense reform to the Social \nSecurity Act and should be enacted.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues in the House of Representatives \nfor the work they put into this bill. I urge my colleagues in the \nSenate to support H.R. 4532.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nbill be read three times, passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table, and any statements relating to the measure be printed \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The bill (H.R. 4532) was ordered to a third reading, was read the \nthird time, and passed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/02/22/senate-section/article/S673-3", "month": "02", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S673-S674]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n DEPLORING THE RAPE AND ASSAULT OF WOMEN IN GUINEA AND THE KILLING OF \n                          POLITICAL PROTESTERS\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.
