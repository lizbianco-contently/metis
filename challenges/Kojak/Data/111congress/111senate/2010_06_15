Madam President, the President will speak to the \nAmerican people from the Oval Office tonight about a crisis in the gulf \nthat is now in its ninth week. If early reports are accurate, the \nPresident will use his remarks not as an occasion to unite the Nation \nin a common effort to solve the immediate problem but to make his case \nfor a new national energy tax commonly known as cap and trade. If true, \nthis means the President plans to use this justifiable public outrage \nover an explosion that killed 11 people and the oilspill that followed \nas a tool for pushing a divisive new climate change policy even as \nhundreds of thousands of gallons of oil continue to spill into the gulf \neach day.\n\n[[Page S4896]]\n\n  Most Americans are baffled by all this. The crisis, as they see it, \nis a broken pipe at the bottom of the ocean, miles-long oil slicks, and \nthreatened coastlines. The first thing they want to know is what the \nadministration plans to do to plug the leak, clean up the oil, and \nmitigate the spill's effects on the livelihoods of those affected. Yet \nday after day, as the oil continues to flow, what we hear from the \nadministration is how tough they plan to be with BP and now, \napparently, how important it is that we institute a new tax which will \nraise energy costs for every single American but which will do \nabsolutely nothing to plug the leak. Never has a mission statement fit \nan administration as perfectly as Rahm Emanuel's ``never allow a crisis \nto go to waste.'' Climate change policy is important, but first things \nfirst.\n  Americans are saying two things at the moment: Stop this spill and \nclean it up. So with all due respect to the White House, the wetlands \nof the bayou, the beaches of the coast, and our waters in the gulf are \nfar more important than the status of the Democrats' legislative agenda \nhere in Washington. Americans want us to stop the oilspill first, and \nuntil this leak is plugged, they are not in any mood to hand over even \nmore power in the form of a new national energy tax to a government \nthat, so far at least, hasn't lived up to their expectations in its \nresponse to this crisis.\n  Republicans are happy to have an energy debate. Like most Americans, \nwe support an all-of-the-above agenda that seeks to produce more \nAmerican energy and use less. But while American livelihoods are in \nimmediate danger and we watch oil gush into our waters and wash up on \nour beaches, now is not the time to push ideology; it is the time to \nfix the problem.\n  But if the White House insists on using this event as an opportunity \nto push the same kind of government-driven agenda that got us the \nhealth care bill, then they will need to answer some questions. Since \nthe outset of this crisis, they have clearly been more focused on \nidentifying a scapegoat than in taking charge. But questions persist \nabout the administration's response. Here are just a few:\n  First, the administration acknowledges that it took BP at its word \nearly on about its ability to respond to a crisis such as this. The \nquestion is, Why? Why? Why did the Minerals Management Service under \nthis administration accept BP's word that it was prepared to deal with \na worst-case spill such as the one we are now experiencing in the gulf?\n\n  Second, why were the inspections MMS performed on the Deepwater \nHorizon, and presumably on other rigs as well, unable to detect the \nproblems that eventually became so apparent? What changes need to be \nmade to make these inspections effective?\n  Third, the law requires the President to ensure the effective cleanup \nof an oilspill when it occurs. Specifically, it requires the President \nto have a national contingency plan in place, and that plan is supposed \nto provide for sufficient personnel and equipment to clean up a spill. \nClearly, the administration's National Contingency Plan was not up to \nthe task. Why not? Did it rely too much on the oil companies to perform \nthe cleanup?\n  Also, why, as has been widely reported, has the administration been \nslow to accept offers of assistance from countries that have offered \nskimming vessels and other technologies to help clean up the spill? \nSince the cleanup is clearly not going as planned, shouldn't we be \naccepting legitimate offers of assistance wherever we can get them?\n  The first priority, as I have said, is plugging the leak. Then we \nmust turn our attention to questions such as these and to a thorough \ninvestigation of what went wrong on the Deepwater Horizon and how we \ncan prevent anything like it from ever, ever happening again. That will \nbe a monumental, months-long job, as there were so many failures at so \nmany levels. Once that process begins, perhaps the administration can \nwork to unite the country in the aftermath of this crisis in a way \nthat, frankly, it has failed to do up to now.\n  Legislation to respond to this oilspill should be an opportunity for \ngenuine bipartisan cooperation of the kind the President so frequently \nsays he wants and of the kind that has been sorely needed and sorely \nlacking in the midst of this calamity.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4896-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, as we close in now on 2 months since \nthe deep water explosion that set off the gulf oilspill, the toll of \nthis disaster is continuing to mount--from the oil-soaked pelicans we \nsee on the front cover of each newspaper everyday, to the tar balls \nthat dot a previously pristine coastline, to the closed fishing grounds \nand half-empty hotels. The human impact is felt in Louisiana, \nMississippi, Florida, throughout the gulf coast region. This disaster \nhas reached into our economy, our environment, and the way we see our \nenergy future. But there is one place it also threatens to reach and \nthat is into our pocketbooks.\n  When it comes to BP's promises to cover all the costs associated with \nthis disaster, I am sorry but I am not ready to take them for their \nword. That is because as a Senator from the Pacific Northwest, \nWashington State, I have seen firsthand what happens when big oil is \nallowed to make promises and not required to take action. When the \nExxon Valdez oilspill happened in 1989--I remember it so well--that \ncompany assured the public that the economic and environmental damage \nwould be paid for. Then I remember them fighting tooth and nail all the \nway to the Supreme Court, to deny fishermen and families from my home \nState the compensation they were due.\n  So I am not impressed by BP's promises and I am not ready to take the \nword of a company with a track record of pursuing profit over safety. \nInstead, I believe it is time for us to answer some very fundamental \nquestions, such as who should be responsible to clean this up? Who is \ngoing to bear the burden of big oil's mistake? Should it be the \ntaxpayers or families and small business owners who paid such a high \nprice already or should it be the companies that are responsible for \nthis spill, including BP, which, by the way, is a company that made a \n$6.1 billion profit in the first 3 months of this year alone?\n  I cosponsored the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act because the answer \nis clear. I believe BP needs to be held accountable for the \nenvironmental and economic damages of this spill and I am going to \nfight to make sure our taxpayers do not wind up losing a single dime to \npay for this mess. To me, it is an issue of fairness. If an oil company \ncauses a spill, they should be the one to clean it up, not our \ntaxpayers. This bill eliminates the current $75 million cap on oil \ncompany liability so taxpayers will never be left holding the bag for \nbig oil's mistakes. This is straightforward, common sense, and fair.\n  I have to say, I am extremely disappointed that this commonsense bill \ncontinues to be blocked by the Republicans every time we have tried to \nbring it up. But I want everyone to know I am going to keep fighting \nfor the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act until we get it passed.\n  That alone is not enough in response. This week I also signed on to a \nletter to BP's CEO, asking them to back up the promises they are making \nto pay with action by requiring them to set up a $20 billion fund to \nbegin covering the damages we will see.\n  It is also why I am working to make sure this never happens in any \nother part of our country. I have always been opposed to drilling off \nthe coast of my\n\n[[Page S4897]]\n\nhome State of Washington and this tragedy is just one more painful \nreminder of the potential consequences of opening the west coast to \ndrilling. The economic and environmental devastation caused by the \nExxon Valdez disaster is still impacting people and families and \nbusinesses in my State. Washington State's coastal region supports over \n150,000 jobs and it generates almost $10 billion in economic activity--\nall of which would be threatened if drilling were allowed to happen off \nour west coat.\n  I am going to keep fighting for legislation that bans drilling off \nthe west coast and makes sure big oil companies are never allowed to \nroll the dice with Washington State's economy and environment.\n  We need to hold big oil accountable. We need to make sure that \ndisasters such as this never happen again. We also need to remember the \nworkers who were killed and injured in this horrific tragedy. We cannot \nforget that this is an issue that is larger than this one tragedy. The \nentire oil and gas industry has a deplorable record of worker and \nworkplace safety. We have to make sure that every worker is treated \nproperly and protected, and that companies that mistreat their workers \nare held accountable.\n  We know the oil industry is able to operate under stricter safety \nstandards and regulations because they are already doing that--in \nEurope, in Australia, and even in Contra Costa County in California, \nwhere that county has a set of stricter guidelines that have reduced \ntheir injuries and fatality rates for their workers.\n  But we also know worker safety should not be measured just by injury \nrates. We should be working at reducing the dangerous conditions that \nexist such as fires and hazardous spills and release of toxic gases. \nWhen accidents do happen, we have to record them, learn from them, and \nbuild on a program to prevent them from ever happening again. We have \nto make sure our workers are treated with respect and their rights are \nprotected. Like a lot of people, I was appalled last week to read \nreports in the Washington Post about BP's history of worker safety \nviolations and numerous reports of worker intimidation. No workers \nshould ever believe that reporting safety violations could endanger \ntheir job and no company should ever pursue its bottom line in a way \nthat endangers its workers.\n  The Senate deserves answers from BP on worker safety conditions and \nhow suppressing worker complaints could have contributed, actually, to \nthis disaster. So I was extremely disappointed last week when I held a \nhearing in my subcommittee to examine worker safety issues in the oil \nand gas industry and representatives of BP failed to show up--failed to \neven show up.\n  Workers everywhere have to feel confident that their employers are \nputting their safety first and companies that betray that trust have to \nbe held accountable. I am going to keep working to make sure that \nhappens. I look forward to having future hearings that I hope BP will \ncome to in the coming weeks so we can get to the bottom of this. \nMeanwhile, I am going to continue fighting to keep drilling away from \nthe Washington State coastline and I am going to keep pushing to make \nsure our taxpayers do not have to pay for the mistakes big oil makes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, would you please advise me when I have \nspoken for 9 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will so advise the \nSenator.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator from Washington because she brings \nback an experience that I had 21 years ago, when I went to Prince \nWilliam Sound in the beautiful State of Alaska. It is one of the most \nbeautiful places on Earth but at that moment it was a sad situation. \nThe Exxon Valdez tanker had run aground and spilled literally thousands \nand thousands of barrels of black, sludgy, crude oil on this beautiful, \npristine area. I went out in a Coast Guard cutter to one of the tiny \nlittle islands in the middle of Prince William Sound, which is \notherwise as beautiful as God ever made this Earth, and there, covered \nin oil, was this rock-strewn island, and men and women, dressed in \nyellow slickers, were taking big cotton cloths and trying to scoop up \nthe oil and put these cloths into bags to be carted away. I asked one \nof the workers, after the television cameras were off, I said, Do you \nthink we are doing any good? He said, If we didn't do anything it would \ntake 10 years for God to clean up this mess. For all we are doing, it \nmight take 9 years and 6 months.\n  It was a pretty cynical view, but I tell you, 21 years later Prince \nWilliam Sound is paying the price for that one tanker that ran aground.\n  Senator Murkowski of Alaska told us some species of fish have all but \ndisappeared. Herring can't be found in this area anymore. Yes, some of \nit is recovering, but it is slow, painfully slow. It takes generations \nfor that to happen.\n  We decided at that moment in history that we had to have an oilspill \nliability fund. In other words, we say to the oil companies, when you \nproduce a barrel of oil we want 8 cents from each barrel to go into an \noilspill liability fund so if there is another spill in the future and \nyou cannot pay for it as a company, there will at least be this fund \ncollected from your industry to try to repair the damage--8 cents a \nbarrel.\n\n  Let me tell you what the price of oil is today according to the Wall \nStreet Journal. It is over $75 a barrel. So 8 cents represents about \none-tenth of 1 percent of the cost of a barrel of oil. Keep that in \nmind because I want to tell you about an amendment that is coming to \nthe floor this afternoon.\n  In the bill pending on the floor, we increased that 8 cents to 41 \ncents. The idea is to have enough money in this oilspill liability fund \nthat if in some future crisis you do not have a deep-pocket, big-time \noil company such as BP, we will at least have enough money collected \nfrom the industry to repair the environmental damage from tankers \nrunning aground or drilling in the gulf or other places that goes awry. \nWe raise it from 8 cents to 41 cents. It is one-half of 1 percent of \nthe cost of a barrel of oil.\n  Why do I bring this up? John Thune, Republican Senator from South \nDakota, is going to offer an amendment this afternoon. Most people will \nnot get a chance to read it in its entirety. It is 210 pages long. Let \nme tell you several features that are worth noting, particularly as \nPresident Obama speaks to the American people tonight about what is \ngoing on in the Gulf of Mexico, with this bill. John Thune offers the \nRepublican substitute amendment, and what John Thune does for the \nRepublicans is to eliminate the increase in this tax on a barrel of \noil. Of course, big oil doesn't want to spend this money. They don't \nwant to pay this tax. They don't want to create this oilspill liability \nfund. And the Republican substitute says they do not have to. Even \nthough we know and see every single minute of every day the damage \nbeing done in the gulf, the Republican substitute amendment eliminates \nthe increase in the tax on a barrel of oil.\n  That is not all. In our bill we also increased the liability for \noilspills. Now it is at $1 billion. We increase it to $5 billion. Is \nthere anyone who thinks that we can escape with only $5 billion in \ndamages from what is going on in the Gulf of Mexico? I don't. Sadly, I \nthink it is going to be much more. We tried to change the underlying \nlaw to say in the future, for any for oilspills, there will be \nliability up to $5 billion in our underlying bill. The Republican \nsubstitute eliminates the increase in liability for the big oil \ncompanies.\n  This is a dream come true for big oil, but it is not a dream come \ntrue for America, where we are so dependent on oil today and where we \nneed to make certain if there is another environmental disaster \ntomorrow, we are prepared to take care of it.\n  What is the alternative if the Thune Republican substitute passes? If \nthe damage occurs in Prince William Sound, in the Gulf of Mexico, who \nwill be expected to bail out the damage? American taxpayers. So the \nRepublican substitute takes the burden off the big oil companies and \nputs it on the taxpayers of this country. That is wrong. It is \nfundamentally wrong. If for no other reason I hope the Senate rejects \nthe Republican substitute, that they would have the nerve to stand up \nin the Senate today, standing up for big oil under these circumstances. \nHow can\n\n[[Page S4898]]\n\nthey possibly defend that? They will try, and you will hear it on the \nfloor.\n  There is one other provision that ought to be noted in the Thune \nsubstitute and here is what it says. It eliminates the language in the \nunderlying bill that creates incentives in America's Tax Code for \nAmerican businesses to relocate their production facilities overseas. \nThink about it. We have incentives in our Tax Code rewarding American \nbusinesses that build production facilities overseas. Does that make \nany sense in this economy, with 8 million people out of work and 6 \nmillion who have given up looking for jobs, that we would eliminate the \nprovisions that stop companies from moving overseas? We need to keep \ngood-paying jobs right here in America.\n  The Republican substitute does not agree. The Republican substitute \nwants to continue to incentivize American companies so they will move \nproduction facilities overseas. We give them a break in the Tax Code \nnow in terms of the taxes they pay on the income they earn overseas, \nbut the bill before us eliminates it and the Republican substitute \ndefends it.\n  How can they do this? In one amendment they defend big oil companies \nand stop us from collecting money to protect taxpayers if there is \nanother environmental disaster. Then they turn around and try to \nprotect the loopholes in the Tax Code so that American businesses can \nmove their production facilities overseas. It is the clearest \ndefinition of the difference between the two political parties I have \nseen in a long time.\n  Earlier, the Senate Republican leader came forward, Senator \nMcConnell, and said we need more government in the Gulf of Mexico. I \nthink we do have an important responsibility here as a government to \nmake sure the damage that has been done by British Petroleum is in fact \ntaken care of and repaired--and there will be a lot of it, \nunfortunately. It is interesting to hear these speeches from the \nRepublican side of the aisle about how we need an expanded role of \ngovernment. It seems as though some of my colleagues are suffering from \npolitical amnesia. It was not too long ago that they were coming here \ncrying that government was too big and had too big a hand in our \neconomy, but we have learned through the recession brought on through \nthe greed of Wall Street, through this terrible environmental disaster \nin the Gulf of Mexico, there is a legitimate and important role of \ngovernment.\n  Tonight the President of the United States will address the American \npeople and tell us about what we are doing and what we need to do. It \nwill go beyond this terrible environmental disaster and challenge us to \nlook to the big picture, the picture about the future of energy and the \nAmerican economy. There are some people who do not want to talk about \nthis, but it is fundamental. We need to move our nation forward--with \ncleaner, renewable, sustainable sources of energy.\n  We need to have more efficient cars and trucks that burn less fuel \nfor the same mileage. We need to have fewer emissions into the \nenvironment which damage our lungs and the Earth on which we live, and \nwe need to have a policy that is forward looking. When I listen to the \nother side of the aisle, they are looking in the rearview mirror. We \ncannot afford to do that anymore. America can move forward together \nwhen we accept our responsibility to the environment and to provide \nclean, renewable energy for the growth of our economy.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Madam President, there is no doubt that the vivid \nimages we see every day of economic and environmental tragedy unfolding \nin the gulf are unprecedented, if not apocalyptic in nature. They have \nopened our eyes to the need for a fundamental redirection in our policy \nand the need for definitive action now to hold big oil accountable. The \nimages are horrific, and they have made Americans realize the dirty \nfuels of our industrial past and the environmental and human toll they \nare taking in the gulf as we speak should now give way to a consensus \non a real, meaningful investment in clean energy and increased \noversight of corporate polluters.\n  The time has come for change and this Congress needs to stand up for \nall those families in the gulf, for the rich habitats of marshes and \nestuaries that are being destroyed. The time has come to make the big \npolluters pay. But the time has also come to look ahead and plan for a \nsmarter, greener, safer, cleaner future.\n  No one--no one--can look at what is happening in the gulf and think \nwe should not call big oil to task. No one can look at the images of \nbrown pelicans drowning in a tide of crude oil and not wonder how to \nstop it and, at the same time, how to move to a comprehensive energy \npolicy that will take us beyond our reliance on fossil fuels and toward \nclean energy independence. No one can look at Louisiana shrimpers and \noystermen, fishing fleets idle, businesses closed, and not feel for \nthose families wondering how they will get their lives back.\n  This is not the time to shield big oil from full responsibility, as \nour colleagues on the other side seem to favor. This is not the time \nfor excuses. Two things are clear. Those who are at fault must be held \naccountable. We need to embrace this tragedy as an opportunity to \nformulate a new American energy policy that creates American jobs and \nultimately invests billions of dollars that we spend on foreign oil at \nhome on clean energy sources. Our friends on the other side of the \naisle have said no to that approach. They have said no to energy \nreforms and favored big oil. They said no to every effort to hold big \nbusiness accountable for its failures. They said no to Wall Street \nreform and favored big banks. They said no to environmental oversight \nand favored corporate polluters. They have said no to even commonsense \neconomic recovery legislation to put people back to work and save the \neconomy from the disaster 8 years of their policies have created. They \nsaid no to families denied health coverage and favored big insurance \ncompanies. They have also continuously blocked my Big Oil Bailout \nPrevention Act that would hold BP accountable for damages, lifting the \nliability cap from the ridiculous $75 million worth of liability--less \nthan 1 day's profit for BP--and lifting it to an unlimited liability \nsince they have created unlimited damages in the gulf. No, they come up \nwith proposals that basically are to protect big oil.\n  Let's index it to their profits regardless of how much damage they \nhave created. Let's worry about the ``smaller driller'' even if they \ncause unlimited consequences to our environment. Is there a difference \nbetween a $100 billion company and a $10 billion company when both of \nthem create the same environmental damage that has been created in the \ngulf? I don't think so.\n  The question is, Whose side do we stand on. Do we stand with the \ntaxpayers to make sure they don't reach into their pockets for big \noil's consequences, or are we going to defend big oil? If we were to \nbring to the floor a bill to invest in a clean energy future and create \nclean energy American jobs, they would say no to that as well.\n  It seems to me it is time to say yes to American-made clean energy, \nyes to the millions of jobs it would create. It is time to also end tax \nloopholes for big oil companies, such as BP, that are avoiding paying \nbillions of dollars in taxes. They are getting huge tax breaks for \ndrilling activities and revenues, and they are concocting foreign tax \nschemes, all of which amount to more than $20 billion over the next 10 \nyears.\n  That is why I have introduced a bill to end tax loopholes for big \noil. It seems to me the flow of revenues to the oil companies is like \nthe gusher at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico. It is pretty heavy and \nconstant. There is no valid reason for these multibillion-dollar \ninternational corporations to shortchange the American taxpayer. They \ncertainly are not using the extra money they get from exploiting tax \nloopholes to bring down the price of a gallon of gasoline for New \nJersey families.\n  Unlike the gusher in the gulf, we can topfill these loopholes and \nshut them down quickly and permanently, if we pass this legislation. \nBut my colleagues on the other side continue to say no to commonsense \nreforms. We could use the billions of dollars and giveaways to big oil \nfor an alternative fuel program. We need to look at the\n\n[[Page S4899]]\n\neconomic potential for modern, safe, renewable energy rather than to \ntake the risk of another environmental and economic disaster. Instead \nof doubling down on 19th century fossil fuels, we should be investing \nthe money we have been giving to big oil in the clean, limitless, 21st-\ncentury energy that would create thousands of new jobs, significantly \nreduce the burden of energy costs, and help clear the air we \ncollectively breathe. It is time we close those loopholes and move \nforward on alternative fuels and embrace the future rather than cling \nto the ways of the past and pay the oil companies to continue those \nways of the past.\n  Specifically, the legislation I have introduced recoups royalties \nthat oil companies avoided paying for oil and gas production on public \nlands. It prevents big oil from manipulating the rules on foreign taxes \nto avoid paying full corporate taxes in the United States. It ends tax \ndeductions and giveaways to big oil such as deductions for classifying \noil production as manufacturing, deductions for the depletion of oil \nand gas through drilling, and the deductions for the cost of preparing \nto drill. That is right. Big oil actually gets a deduction for \npreparing to drill.\n  Among other provisions, it recoups royalty revenue with an excise tax \non oil and gas produced on Federal lands and on the Outer Continental \nShelf to pay back taxpayers for contract loopholes. That would save an \nestimated $5.3 billion. It ends big oil's abuse of foreign tax credits, \nsaving another $8 billion.\n  While the Close Big Oil Tax Loopholes Act stops giving big oil tax \nbreaks, it protects refineries and oil companies with yearly revenues \nof less than $100 million and lets them retain certain tax credits and \ndeductions. It repeals big oil's expensing of drilling costs. In the \nPresident's budget, this saved $10.9 billion, but we are exempting \nsmaller companies that would lower that estimate. It repeals big oil's \ndepletion allowance for oil and gas wells estimated to save $9.6 \nbillion. It is time to close these big tax oil loopholes, time to stem \nthe flow of revenue to the oil companies, and invest in smart, \nalternative fuels for the future.\n  The fact is, oil companies make up 4 of the top 10 spots on the \nFortune 100 list of the largest corporations. In the first 3 months of \nthis year alone, in the first quarter of 2010, the top 5 oil companies \nmade over $23 billion in profits--not revenue, profits.\n  They can afford to do business without American taxpayers subsidizing \nthem. It is time for action. Millions of Americans are out of work. \nFamilies are hurting. Communities are hurting. People everywhere are \nfeeling the pinch, and big oil companies are raking in the profits.\n  At the same time, some of them, such as BP, are creating enormous \nenvironmental disasters in our country. That is why I am proud of my \ncolleagues in the Senate Democratic caucus who sent a letter to BP \nsaying: Put $20 billion down in an escrow account administered \nindependently so we can make sure those in the gulf begin to have the \nrelief they so desperately need.\n  To my colleagues on the other side, it is time to stop saying no and \ndo what is right, what makes sense, and what keeps us secure. It is \ntime to stop saying no to commonsense policies that end tax loopholes \nthat benefit big oil. It is time to protect American taxpayers by \nlifting the liability cap so big oil, which made the spill, messed up, \nshould clean up, be responsible for it, instead of American taxpayers. \nIt is time to use those tax breaks from big oil and close them to \ninvest in clean energy solutions that create greener, better, more \nsecure American jobs for the 21st century. It is time to hold big oil \naccountable and invest in the future.\n  Those are the choices. I hope we will make the right ones.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. How much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 3 minutes 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Madam President, I just came back from \nPensacola. I saw the oil not only out in the gulf, I saw the oil in \nPensacola Bay. It is also in Perdido Bay. There are tar balls in the \nbay. They are slipping underneath the booms. Those tar balls are \ngetting into the wetlands, into the marsh grass. But out there in the \nbay, there is this reddish orange gunk. Sometimes it is in streamers. \nSometimes it is in hamburger-sized patties. Sometimes it is in quarter, \ndime-sized patties. It looks awful. That is what we are facing. We are \ngoing to face it for a long time, especially if the oil continues to \ngush into the gulf for the rest of the summer.\n  We have to have a command-and-control structure. After talking to all \nof our people in Pensacola at the emergency operations center, it is \ngetting better. But it had to get better because when the oil entered \nFlorida waters in Perdido Bay, the emergency operations center in \nFlorida was not even informed by the EOC in Pensacola. So it has to be \ntightened up more, like a military chain-of-command structure, so when \nthings need to get done they can get done immediately.\n  The problem in the past has been the Coast Guard is here. BP is \nthere. BP is doing its thing. We can't do that for the long term, as \nmuch as we will be facing.\n  Secondly, we have to set up a trust fund because we are going to be \nin this for the long haul. Think of the restaurants and their \nlivelihood that is at stake--not just the fishermen, the restaurants \nbecause people are not coming. What about the hotels? What about the \nlessened revenue for local governments and the school boards as a \nresult of people not having the economic activity due to our fishing, \nour oystering, our beaches, our tourism, and all that? It is humongous. \nWe need a trust fund.\n  Fifty-five of us sent a letter 2 days ago saying we want a trust fund \nset up by BP, operated by an independent group, that would be on the \nmagnitude of $20 billion. Let's get it now. I don't think BP is going \nto be going broke. But on the basis of the experience with the Exxon \nValdez, a lot of those claims, there were questions about whether they \never got paid when there were legitimate claims.\n  Third, tonight is the time for the President to say: We are going to \ndeclare that this Nation is getting on a road rapidly to make our \nindependence from our dependency on oil.\n  That is a report straight from the Gulf of Mexico on the Florida \ncoastline.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Florida for \nhis comments. All of us are deeply concerned about his State, the \ncoast, and those others on the gulf coast. I know he is working hard to \nsee that the Federal Government makes the appropriate response.\n  Tonight the President of the United States speaks to the Nation from \nthe Oval Office about the oil spill. The oil spill is in its 57th day. \nI would like, with respect, to suggest what I hope the President does \nnot do tonight and what I hope he does do, because the entire Nation's \nattention is focused on this tragic spill, the consequences for the \npeople in the gulf, the consequences for the people of this country, \nand the consequences for our energy and economic future.\n  What I hope the President does not do tonight, No. 1, is use the oil \nspill as an excuse to pass a national energy tax, collecting hundreds \nof billions of dollars from Americans and driving jobs overseas looking \nfor cheap energy. The so-called cap-and-trade national energy tax is \nnot appropriate here because it has nothing to do with cleaning up this \noil spill. Not only does it drive jobs overseas, it also does not work \nwhen applied to fuel. We have had plenty of testimony before the \nEnvironment and Public Works Committee. It would simply raise the \ngasoline tax but it is not going to change behavior enough to reduce \nthe amount of gasoline consumed or carbon emitted. Finally, when \napplied to utilities, is premature because we have not yet found ways \nto recapture carbon from coal plants cost effectively or in a way that \nwould enable coal plants to make money from the carbon rather than \nraising the price of everybody's electric bill.\n  So, No. 1, I hope the President stays focused and does not follow the \nadvice of the White House Chief of Staff, who\n\n[[Page S4900]]\n\nhas been so often quoted: Never let a crisis go to waste. This is a \ncrisis, but do not try to mislead the American people into thinking the \ncure for the oil spill is a new national energy tax that drives jobs \noverseas looking for cheap energy.\n  No. 2, I would hope the President--while helping us figure out what \nto do about the oil spill and making sure it never happens again--does \nnot destroy the rest of the gulf coast economy in the meantime. The \nSenators from Louisiana, Ms. Landrieu and Mr. Vitter, have both spoken \neloquently on behalf of the livelihoods of so many in that area. We do \nnot stop flying after a terrible airplane accident, and we are not \ngoing to stop offshore drilling after a tragic spill such as this one. \nWhat we need to do is to find out why it happened and to make sure it \ndoes not happen again.\n  Thirty percent of the oil and twenty-five percent of the natural gas \nwe produce in the United States comes from thousands of wells in the \nGulf of Mexico. If we were to shut them down, natural gas prices, home \nheating prices, and gasoline prices, all would skyrocket, and we would \nrely more on tankers from overseas that have a worse safety record than \nthe offshore oil drillers.\n  No. 3, I hope the President will not recommend, as the current \nlegislation pending in the Senate does, that we spend taxes collected \nfor the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund on something other than cleaning \nup oil spills. Let me say that again. I think Americans might be \nlooking at Washington and wondering: What is this? You mean to say I am \npaying a higher gasoline tax, in effect, to go into a fund to clean up \noil spills and the Congress is thinking about spending that money on \nsomething other than cleaning up oil spills? The answer is exactly \nright.\n  The proposal that is on the floor before the Senate today would raise \nfrom 8 cents to 41 cents the per-barrel fee on oil that is supposed to \nbe used to clean up oil spills and spend it on more government. So that \nis another thing I hope the President does not do tonight. I hope he \nremembers it is called the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. If we want \nto re-earn the trust of the American people, we would spend the oil \nspill cleanup money on cleaning up oil spills.\n  Finally, I hope the President does not pretend that renewable \nelectricity has anything to do with reducing our dependence on foreign \noil. Already, I see the ads for the windmills that the big corporations \nare putting out. But let's think about renewable electricity for a \nminute. We are talking about oil in the gulf. We use oil for \ntransportation, not to create electricity. Renewable electricity--wind, \nsolar, and biomass--creates electricity, which we do not need more of \nfor transportation because there is so much unused power at night. So a \nclean energy program that is a national windmill policy or a national \nsolar energy policy or national biomass policy may be useful for the \ncountry in some ways, but it has nothing to do with reducing our \ndependence on foreign oil. I will say more in a minute on how we can do \nthat.\n  But let me stop for a minute, if I may, to back up what I said. Solar \nenergy, for example, is two-hundredths of 1 percent of the electricity \nwe produce in the United States. We all hope someday we can reduce its \ncost by a factor of four and put it on rooftops as an intermittent \nsupplement to our electricity needs. It has great potential for that. \nBut the better way to spend money is on research and development to \nreduce its cost, not to pretend that somehow solar panels have anything \nto do with cleaning up the oil spill or reducing oil consumption.\n  Biomass, which is sort of a controlled bonfire, has the potential to \nhelp clean up our forests and generate electricity. We have in the \nforests of Tennessee, New Hampshire, and other places dead trees from \nthe pine beetle or from other disease. Cleaning them up and burning \nthem to create electricity is a good idea, and there is biomass is also \nan important source of energy for our industrial sector as well. But \nthe idea of cutting down and burning trees to create large amounts of \nelectricity is a preposterous idea in the United States.\n  As an example, one would have to continuously forest an area one-and-\na-half times the size of the Great Smoky Mountain National Park in \norder to produce enough electricity to equal one nuclear reactor. And \nin foresting an area one-and-a-half times the size of the Great Smoky \nMountain National Park, you would have hundreds of trucks every day \nrunning up and down the mountain, belching out fumes, carrying the wood \nto a place to burn it.\n  Finally, wind, which has become the ``pet rock'' of the 21st century \nenergy policies. Wind can also be a useful supplement in our country. \nBut it is important to know that it only produces 1.8 percent of our \nelectricity, and wind turbines have nothing to do with reducing our \ncountry's dependence on oil. In addition, there are many other more \nefficient ways to produce clean, carbon-free electricity.\n  For example, I just mentioned that wind produces 1.8 percent of all \nof our electricity and about 6 percent of our carbon-free electricity. \nNuclear power produces 20 percent of all of our electricity and 70 \npercent of our carbon-free, pollution-free electricity. To produce the \n20 percent of our electricity that comes from about 100 nuclear \nreactors today would require 186,000 of these 50-story wind turbines \ncovering an area the size of West Virginia. The Tennessee Valley \nAuthority, in the region where I live says that it can depend on wind \nto be there when it needs it 12 percent of the time because, of course, \nyou can only use it when the wind blows. This compares to the \ndependability of nuclear to be there 91 percent of the time when it is \nneeded.\n  Then we have all seen and heard the awful stories of the pelicans \nimmersed in oil. Well, that is not the only form of energy that causes \na problem with birds. The American Bird Conservancy says the 25,000 \nwind turbines we have today can kill up to 275,000 birds a year, and \none wind farm in California killed 79 Golden Eagles in one year.\n  So the point is, we need renewable energy. We need to advance it. We \nhope solar becomes cost competitive. Biomass can be useful. So can wind \npower. But it has nothing to do with reducing our dependence on foreign \noil.\n  Now what do I hope the President does say tonight.\n  Well, No. 1, I hope the President stays focused on cleaning up the \noil spill--cleaning up the oil spill and taking care of those who have \nbeen harmed. We need a plan to fix the problem. We need accountability \nin the regulation of energy production. We need to ask the question, \nWhere is the President's plan? Where are the people and the equipment \nnecessary to implement the President's plan to clean up an oil spill? \nThis is not the first time we have had such a spill. After the Exxon \nValdez tanker spill--that was different, but it was still a big spill \nof oil--the country was convulsed by that, and Congress acted and \npassed the Oil Pollution Act of 1990. It said the President shall \nensure that he has a plan to clean up a worst-case oil spill and have \nthe people and equipment to do it.\n\n  Effectively, the President has delegated that job to the spiller. \nPerhaps President Bush would have done the same. Perhaps President \nClinton would have done the same. But if the only option the President \nhas is to delegate the law to the spiller, perhaps he should amend his \nplan or we should change the law. We should discuss that, and perhaps \nthe President will make a recommendation on that.\n  But tonight the first thing is: Clean up the oil. Get the job done. \nPlug the hole. No. 2, help people who are hurt. I come from a State \nwhere we have just had a thousand-year flood event, where we have had \n$2 billion of damage in Nashville alone, and the flood damage went all \nthe way to Memphis. We know what that kind of pain is, and people are \nbusy helping each other and cleaning up and not looting and not \ncomplaining. But we feel deeply for the people on the gulf coast and we \nwant to help them. We would like to help make sure BP pays for the \ncleanup and damages as they have promised. We would like to help raise \nthe limits on liability and address the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund. \nCongress might consider the nuclear energy model of insurance for the \nfuture because that model gets all of the nuclear companies involved \nin, No. 1, making the nuclear reactors safe, and in, No. 2, addressing \nany sort of accident they had.\n  I wish to see a similar sort of insurance fund for the oil well \ncompanies so you do not have just BP involved in cleaning it up, but \nyou have every\n\n[[Page S4901]]\n\nother oil company interested also in providing the technology, the \nexpertise, the help and the advice to do the job.\n  The third and final thing I hope the President does is chart a way \nfor our clean energy future. I have heard a lot about that on the other \nside of the aisle, and there is a great deal of bipartisan cooperation \nin this area. Let me be specific. For fuel, I hope the President will \nrenew his support for electric cars and trucks. Republican Senators--\nall 41 of us--have said we support the idea of electrifying half our \ncars and trucks. That is a very ambitious goal for our country. But we \ncan do it. It is the single best way to reduce our dependence on \nforeign oil. If we were to electrify half our cars and trucks--which \nwould take a while--we could reduce our dependence on oil by perhaps \none-third. But we would still be using 12 million barrels of oil a day.\n  Senator Dorgan and I and Senator Merkley have introduced bipartisan \nlegislation to create a better environment for electric cars and trucks \nin America. The President has strongly urged this idea, and Secretary \nChu has worked hard to create support for batteries and for cars. There \nis room for bipartisan agreement on the single best way to reduce our \ndependence on oil, and that would be by encouraging electric cars and \ntrucks; electrifying half of them.\n  No. 2, for electricity, the single best way to produce clean \nelectricity is nuclear power. One hundred nuclear reactors produce 20 \npercent of our power, but 70 percent, as I said, of all of our carbon-\nfree electricity. Senator Webb and I have introduced legislation to \ncreate an environment in which we can build 100 more nuclear reactors.\n  We do not need these reactors in order to have electric cars and \ntrucks. The Brookings Institution and Obama administration officials \nhave said we do not need to build one new powerplant in order to \nelectrify half our cars and trucks because we have so much extra \nelectricity at night. If we plug them in when we sleep we can have \nelectric cars and trucks and would need no new windmills, no new \nnuclear plants, no new coal plants for that purpose.\n  But if we need new green electricity, the best source for it is \nnuclear powerplants. They are the most useful. They are the most \nreliable, and they do the least damage to the environment. The number \nof deaths due to nuclear accidents at American commercial U.S. nuclear \npowerplants is zero. The number of deaths due to nuclear accidents in \nthe Navy nuclear fleet is zero. There is a system of accountability, \nand as a result, a very good record.\n  So it is electric cars and trucks for fuel, nuclear power for \nelectricity. The President has been very good in the last few months on \nnuclear power. He has appointed strong members to the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission. He has appointed strong members to a commission \nto deal with used nuclear fuel. He has done a good job of beginning to \nget the loan guarantees going for the first new plants. So electric \ncars and trucks and nuclear power are areas where we should be able to \nwork in a bipartisan way in the future.\n  The third area is on energy research and development. The President \nhas recommended and the Congress has approved more money for energy \nresearch and development. Republicans support doubling our energy \nresearch and development for a clean energy future. That would mean \nprojects such as reducing the cost of solar power to one-fourth of \ntoday's cost. That would mean recapturing carbon from coal plants. It \nwould mean developing a 500-mile battery, which would almost guarantee \nthe electrification of half our cars and trucks over time. It would \nmean intensive research to find ways to recycle used nuclear fuel in a \nway that does not isolate plutonium. It would also mean research for \nmaking clean biofuels from crops we do not eat.\n  Making great advances in solar, carbon recapture, electric batteries, \nnuclear recycling, and biofuels would be the third important part of \nour energy future. While we are at it, Congress should pass the clean \nair bill Senator Carper and I have authored, and that 13 other Senators \nhave cosponsored. It is cosponsored by eight Democrats, six \nRepublicans, and one Independent. While we are figuring out what to do \nabout carbon, we can go ahead and do what we know how to do, which is \nreduce pollution from mercury, sulphur, and nitrogen from our coal \nplants to improve our air quality, reduce health care costs, and save \nlives.\n\n  So there are many things I hope the President will talk about to have \nbipartisan support: fuel, electric cars and trucks, electricity, \nnuclear plants, energy R, solar, carbon recapture, batteries, \nnuclear, clean fuels, and finally, the clean air bill Senator Carper \nand I and others support.\n  This is an important time for our country. It is a time when we \ndeserve bipartisan action. It is a time when we deserve to look to the \nfuture. It is a time when we need to focus on cleaning up the spill, \nhelping the people who are hurt, planning for a future, and doing it in \na realistic and bipartisan way.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan op-ed I wrote and which was published in the Wall Street Journal on \nFriday and an address I gave yesterday in Knoxville to a group of \nscientists entitled ``Nuclear Power is Green.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, June 11, 2010]\n\n                    An Energy Strategy for Grown-Ups\n\n                          (By Lamar Alexander)\n\n       The tragic Gulf oil spill has produced overreaction (``end \n     offshore drilling''), demagoguery (``Obama's Katrina'') and \n     bad policy recommendations (``We must generate 20% of our \n     electricity from windmills''). None of this helps clean up \n     and move forward. If we want both clean energy and a high \n     standard of living, here are 10 steps for thoughtful grown-\n     ups:\n       (1) Figure out what went wrong and make it unlikely to \n     happen again. We don't stop flying after a terrible airplane \n     crash, and we won't stop drilling offshore after this \n     terrible spill. Thirty percent of U.S. oil production (and \n     25% of natural gas) comes from thousands of active wells in \n     the Gulf of Mexico. Without it, gasoline prices would \n     skyrocket and we would depend more on tankers from the Middle \n     East with worse safety records than American offshore \n     drillers.\n       (2) Learn a safety lesson from the U.S. nuclear industry: \n     accountability. For 6o years, reactors on U.S. Navy ships \n     have operated without killing one sailor. Why? The career of \n     the ship's commander can be ended by a mistake. The number of \n     deaths from nuclear accidents at U.S. commercial reactors is \n     also zero.\n       (3) Determine what the president's cleanup plan was and \n     where the people and the equipment were to implement it. In \n     1990, after the Exxon Valdez spill, a new law required that \n     the president ``ensure'' the cleanup of a spill and have the \n     people and equipment to do it. President Obama effectively \n     delegated this job to the spiller. Is that a president's only \n     real option today? If so, what should future presidents have \n     on hand for backup if the spiller can't perform?\n       (4) Put back on the table more onshore resources for oil \n     and natural gas. Drilling in a few thousand acres along the \n     edge of the 19-million acre Alaska National Wildlife Refuge \n     and at other onshore locations would produce vast oil \n     supplies. A spill on land could be contained much more easily \n     than one located a mile deep in water.\n       (5) Electrify half our cars and trucks. This is ambitious, \n     but it is the best way to reduce U.S. oil consumption, \n     cutting it by one-third to about 13 million barrels a day. A \n     Brookings Institution study says we could electrify half our \n     cars and trucks without building one new power plant if we \n     plug in our cars at night.\n       (6) Invest in energy research and development. A cost-\n     competitive, 500-mile-range battery would virtually guarantee \n     electrification of half our cars and trucks. Reduce the cost \n     of solar power by a factor of four. Find a way for utilities \n     to make money from the CO2 produced by their coal plants.\n       (7) Stop pretending wind power has anything to do with \n     reducing America's dependence on oil. Windmills generate \n     electricity--not transportation fuel. Wind has become the \n     energy pet rock of the 21st century and a taxpayer rip-off. \n     According to the Energy Information Administration, wind \n     produces only 1.3% of U.S. electricity but receives federal \n     taxpayer subsidies 25 times as much per megawatt hour as \n     subsidies for all other forms of electricity production \n     combined. Wind can be an energy supplement, but it has \n     nothing to do with ending our dependence on oil.\n       (8) If we need more green electricity, build nuclear \n     plants. The 100 commercial nuclear plants we already have \n     produce 70% of our pollution-free, carbon-free electricity. \n     Yet the U.S. has just broken ground on our first new reactor \n     in 3o years, while China starts one every three months and \n     France is 80% nuclear. We wouldn't mothball our nuclear \n     Navy if we were going to war. We shouldn't mothball our \n     nuclear plants if we want low-cost, reliable green energy.\n       (9) Focus on conservation. In the region where I live, the \n     Tennessee Valley Authority could close four of its dirtiest \n     coal plants if we reduced our per capita use of electricity \n     to the national average.\n       (10) Make sure liability limits are appropriate for spill \n     damage. The Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund, funded by a per-\n     barrel fee on\n\n[[Page S4902]]\n\n     industry, should be adjusted to pay for cleanup and to \n     compensate those hurt by spills. An industry insurance \n     program like that of the nuclear industry is also an \n     attractive model to consider.\n       These 10 steps forward could help America grow stronger \n     after this tragic event.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                         Nuclear Power is Green\n\n       Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, hanging in my office in the \n     Dirksen Senate Office Building in Washington, D.C., is a \n     photograph taken forty years ago of President Nixon meeting \n     with Republican congressional leaders in the White House \n     Cabinet Room. Sitting over at the side are two young White \n     House aides, Pat Buchanan and Lamar Alexander, both of us \n     barely thirty years old. I was invited to the meeting because \n     my job then was to help the president with congressional \n     relations. I can distinctly remember the conversation that \n     day.\n       President Nixon was attempting to persuade Republican \n     leaders that a new environmental movement was coming fast. \n     The members of Congress did not sense this as clearly as the \n     president did. The president turned out to have better \n     antennae than the congressmen did. Our big and complex \n     country, like a big freight train, moves slowly when starting \n     in a new direction, but once going, it moves rapidly and the \n     momentum is hard to stop. This certainly was true of the \n     modern environmental movement during the early 1970s.\n       We Americans suddenly were falling all over ourselves \n     looking for ways to limit our impact on the planet, looking \n     for cleaner and greener ways of living. 1970 was the year of \n     the first Earth Day. Congress enacted Clean Air and Clean \n     Water laws and created the Environmental Protection Agency. \n     Recycling became as faddish as the hula hoop. All of this \n     made sense to me because growing up in East Tennessee I was \n     raised to appreciate the beauty of our natural environment \n     and the importance of clean water and air. That is why I \n     chaired the President's Commission on Americans Outdoors \n     during the 1980s, and why I spend so much time as a United \n     States Senator working on stronger clean air laws, on \n     stopping mountaintop mining, and on introducing legislation \n     to expand wilderness within the Cherokee National Forest. For \n     me, it has been a lifelong moral imperative to treasure \n     natural resources at the same time we use them responsibly to \n     make our lives more productive.\n       That is why in a speech in Oak Ridge in May of 2009, I \n     called for America to build 100 new nuclear plants during the \n     next twenty years. Nuclear power produces 70 percent of our \n     pollution-free, carbon-free electricity today. It is the most \n     useful and reliable source of green electricity today because \n     of its tremendous energy density and the small amount of \n     waste that it produces. And because we are harnessing the \n     heat and energy of the earth itself through the power of the \n     atom, nuclear power is also natural.\n       Forty years ago, nuclear energy was actually regarded as \n     something of a savior for our environmental dilemmas because \n     it didn't pollute. And this was well before we were even \n     thinking about global warming or climate change. It also \n     didn't take up a great deal of space. You didn't have to \n     drown all of Glen Canyon to produce 1,000 megawatts of \n     electricity. Four reactors would equal a row of wind \n     turbines, each one three times as tall as Neyland Stadium \n     skyboxes, strung along the entire length of the 2,178-mile \n     Appalachian Trail. One reactor would produce the same amount \n     of electricity that can be produced by continuously foresting \n     an area one-and-a-half times the size of the Great Smoky \n     Mountains National Park in order to create biomass. Producing \n     electricity with a relatively small number of new reactors, \n     many at the same sites where reactors are already located, \n     would avoid the need to build thousands and thousands of \n     miles of new transmission lines through scenic areas and \n     suburban backyards.\n       While nuclear lost its green credentials with \n     environmentalists somewhere along the way, some are re-\n     thinking nuclear energy because of our new environmental \n     paradigm--global climate change. Nuclear power produces 70 \n     percent of our carbon-free electricity today. President Obama \n     has endorsed it, proposing an expansion of the loan guarantee \n     program from $18 billion to $54 billion and making the first \n     award to the Vogtle Plant in Georgia. Nobel Prize-winning \n     Secretary of Energy Steven Chu wrote recently in The Wall \n     Street Journal about developing a generation of mini-reactors \n     that I believe we can use to repower coal boilers, or more \n     locally, to power the Department of Energy's site over in Oak \n     Ridge. The president, his secretary of energy, and many \n     environmentalists may be embracing nuclear because of the \n     potential climate change benefits, but they are now also \n     remembering the other positive benefits of nuclear power that \n     made it an environmental savior some 40 years ago.\n       The Nature Conservancy took note of nuclear power's \n     tremendous energy density last August when it put out a paper \n     on ``Energy Sprawl.'' The authors compared the amount of \n     space you need to produce energy from different \n     technologies--something no one had ever done before--and what \n     they came up with was remarkable. Nuclear turns out to be the \n     gold standard. You can produce a million megawatts of \n     electricity a year from a nuclear reactor sitting on one \n     square mile. That's enough electricity to power 90,000 homes. \n     They even included uranium mining and the 230 square miles \n     surrounding Yucca Mountain in this calculation and it still \n     comes to only one square mile per million megawatt hours.\n       Coal-fired electricity needs four square miles, because you \n     have to consider all the land required for mining and \n     extraction. Solar thermal, where they use the big mirrors to \n     heat a fluid, takes six square miles. Natural gas takes eight \n     square miles and petroleum takes 18 square miles--once again, \n     including all the land needed for drilling and refining and \n     storing and sending it through pipelines. Solar photovoltaic \n     cells that turn sunlight directly into electricity take 15 \n     square miles and wind is even more dilute, taking 30 square \n     miles to produce that same amount of electricity.\n       Now these are some pretty big numbers. When people say ``we \n     want to get our energy from wind,'' they tend to think of a \n     nice windmill or two on the horizon, waving gently--maybe \n     I'll put one in my back yard. They don't realize those nice, \n     friendly windmills are now 50 stories high and have blades \n     the length of football fields. We see awful pictures today of \n     birds killed by the Gulf oil spill. But one wind farm in \n     California killed 79 golden eagles in one year. The American \n     Bird Conservancy says existing turbines can kill up to \n     275,000 birds a year. And for all that, each turbine has the \n     capacity to produce about one-and-a-half megawatts. You need \n     three thousand of these 50-story structures to equal the \n     output of one nuclear reactor. And even then, they only \n     produce electricity about one-third of the time--that's how \n     often the wind blows. At the only wind farm in the Southeast \n     United States, at Buffalo Mountain, the Tennessee Valley \n     Authority says that electricity is only being generated about \n     19 percent of the time. Based on the wind industry's own \n     numbers, I have estimated that to provide 20 percent of our \n     nation's electricity we would need 25,000 square miles of \n     turbines. That's an area the size of the State of West \n     Virginia. At some point, this stops being picturesque and \n     begins to look like what good environmentalists and \n     conservationists have always fought against--the invasion of \n     precious natural landscapes by industrial civilization. Or, \n     we are destroying the environment in the name of saving the \n     environment.\n       Most comparisons of wind power to nuclear power are grossly \n     misleading because nuclear is so much more reliable than \n     wind. You'll notice that I said a few minutes ago that a wind \n     turbine produces one-and-one-half megawatts. That would be \n     true if the wind blew all of the time, but of course it blows \n     about one-third of the time, and then only when it wants to, \n     which is often at night when we don't need more electricity. \n     And today, such large amounts of electricity can't be stored. \n     So the Tennessee Valley Authority, whether it is producing \n     wind from its 18 turbines on Buffalo Mountain or buying it \n     from South Dakota, says wind in its portfolio has only a 10 \n     to 15 percent dependable capacity--that is, wind power can be \n     counted on to be there 10 to 15 percent of the time when you \n     need it. TVA can count on nuclear power 91 percent of the \n     time, coal, 60 percent of the time and natural gas about 50 \n     percent of the time. This is why I believe it is a taxpayer \n     rip-off for wind power to be subsidized per unit of \n     electricity at a rate of 25 times the subsidy for all other \n     forms of electricity combined.\n       Still, people who are genuinely concerned about landscapes \n     and pollution and global warming have argued against nuclear \n     power's green credentials because of the waste. Well, the \n     ``problem of nuclear waste'' has been overstated because \n     people just don't understand the scale or the risk. All the \n     high-level nuclear waste that has ever been produced in this \n     country would fit on a football field to a height of ten \n     feet. That's everything. Compare that to the billion gallons \n     of coal ash that slid out of the coal ash impoundment at the \n     Kingston plant and into the Emory River a year and a half \n     ago, just west of here. Or try the industrial wastes that \n     would be produced if we try to build thousands of square \n     miles of solar collectors or 50-story windmills. All \n     technologies produce some kind of waste. What's unique about \n     nuclear power is that there's so little of it.\n       Now this waste is highly radioactive, there's no doubt \n     about that. But once again, we have to keep things in \n     perspective. It's perfectly acceptable to isolate radioactive \n     waste through storage. Three feet of water blocks all \n     radiation. So does a couple of inches of lead and stainless \n     steel or a foot of concrete. That's why we use dry cask \n     storage, where you can load five years' worth of fuel rods \n     into a single container and store them right on site. The \n     Nuclear Regulatory Commission and Energy Secretary Steven Chu \n     both say we can store spent fuel on site for 60 or 80 years \n     before we have to worry about a permanent repository like \n     Yucca Mountain.\n       And then there's reprocessing. Remember, we're now the only \n     major nuclear power nation in the world that is not \n     reprocessing its fuel. While we gave up reprocessing in the \n     1970s, the French have all their high-level waste from 30 \n     years of producing 80 percent of their electricity stored \n     beneath the floor of one room at their recycling center in La \n     Hague. That's right; it all fits into one room. And we don't \n     have to copy the French. Just a few miles away at the Oak \n     Ridge National Laboratory they're working to develop advanced \n     reprocessing technologies that go well beyond what the French \n     are doing, to\n\n[[Page S4903]]\n\n     produce a waste that's both smaller in volume and with a \n     shorter radioactive life. Regardless of what technology we \n     ultimately choose, the amount of material will be \n     astonishingly small. And it's because of the amazing density \n     of nuclear technology--something we can't even approach with \n     any other form of energy.\n       So to answer the question, ``Is Nuclear Green?'' I believe \n     the answer is ``Yes.'' When you compare it with all the \n     problems we face in discovering and mining and burning fossil \n     fuels, when you think of the thousands of square miles of \n     American landscape we're going to have to cover with \n     windmills or solar collectors to get appreciable amounts of \n     energy--when you compare that to the one square mile taken up \n     by a nuclear reactor and comparatively small amount of spent \n     fuel--well, I don't think there's any question about which \n     technology is going to have the least impact on the \n     environment.\n       And as a group of geophysicists and earth scientists, I \n     know that you appreciate the fact that nothing can be more \n     natural than harnessing the heat of the earth. As we know, \n     energy cannot be created; it is transformed. Potential energy \n     becomes kinetic energy and then the cycle starts over. Nearly \n     all the energy on the earth comes from the sun. Plants and \n     trees are stored solar energy. The energy to sustain animal \n     and human life comes from plants and other animals. Fossil \n     fuels are organic matter that was buried millions of years \n     ago. Wind and hydropower are energy flows set in motion by \n     the sun's heat. Capturing sunlight on your rooftop is the \n     most direct way of tapping solar energy and converting it \n     into electricity.\n       There is one form of energy, however, that has little to do \n     with the sun. Deep within the earth the temperature rises to \n     as much as 7,000 degrees Celsius. Much of that heat comes \n     from the breakdown of two elements--Uranium and Thorium. We \n     can tap into the earth's natural heat by using the steam that \n     rises naturally out of the earth at geysers and fumaroles to \n     create electricity. Dig deep enough anywhere on earth and you \n     will encounter geothermal energy.\n       When we generate power with a nuclear reactor, we just \n     replicate this naturally occurring process that already goes \n     on deep within the earth. We just do it in an accelerated, \n     controlled way and harness the heat that is produced for our \n     own use. We gather through mining naturally occurring \n     uranium, purify and concentrate and maybe enrich it, and then \n     arrange it in such a way as to greatly speed up a process \n     that would have happened anyway--which is the fissioning of \n     Uranium 235. We can then use the heat to boil water and \n     produce electricity.\n       But even this accelerated reaction is not entirely unique \n     to our engineered nuclear reactors. Two billion years ago, in \n     the country of Gabon in uranium deposits in the Oklo region, \n     a lucky combination of hydrology and bacteria converted some \n     natural uranium deposits into a nuclear reactor that ran for \n     what was probably hundreds of thousands of years. Scientific \n     American reported a few years ago that these natural reactors \n     probably released, over a period of thousands of years, the \n     same energy that the Watts Bar reactor produces in a decade--\n     which is to say a huge amount of power. It's interesting to \n     note that two billion years after those reactors shut off, \n     the world is still here and life still evolved, even though \n     the waste from those reactors wasn't contained and Greenpeace \n     wasn't there to picket.\n       So nuclear power is as natural as sunlight. It comes from \n     the same source that heats the earth's core. It is a lot more \n     efficient than converting sunlight into electricity or the \n     process of converting sunlight into energy for plant life. \n     The beauty of nuclear power is that we are able to increase \n     the efficiency of this energy source in our reactors and \n     ultimately create electricity that produces very little \n     waste.\n       I believe nuclear is green. I believe it is natural. I \n     believe it's the best thing that could have happened to the \n     environment to provide the low-cost, reliable, green energy \n     that America needs for the 21st Century.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nNebraska.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4903-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4903-S4904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EXTENDER ALTERNATIVE\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today in support of an alternative \napproach to the extenders legislation. The Thune amendment is a very \nsimple, if not a novel idea in Washington these days. The novel idea is \nthat it would actually pay for the spending proposed in the bill--all \nof it. Furthermore, it doesn't raise harmful taxes on the job creators \nof this country to pay for temporary tax relief. It does not raise \ntaxes temporarily, nor does it raise taxes permanently, as the \nunderlying bill proposes to do.\n  To illustrate the difference between the Thune amendment and the \nBaucus substitute, I will share a USA TODAY editorial from May 25, \n2010. I am quoting:\n\n       Now it's time to start making choices about what's vital, \n     and for those programs that are paying the bills instead of \n     borrowing.\n\n  I could not agree more with that editorial.\n  The alternative is a good first step on the road to fiscal \nresponsibility. We all noted recently that our national debt has \nreached $13 trillion, and as alarming as that milestone is, we are \nactually on pace to double that by 2020. For 2010 alone, the United \nStates is expected to run an annual deficit of $1.6 trillion--1 year. \nNext year isn't much better with a projected deficit of $1.3 trillion. \nTotal U.S. Government debt is near 100 percent of gross domestic \nproduct. Let me say that again. Our debt is near 100 percent of our \nentire gross domestic product. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, net interest on publicly held debt would more than quadruple \nbetween 2010 and 2020, rising from $209 billion in 2010 to $916 billion \nin 2020. These are sobering figures. We should be under no illusions \nthat the road to fiscal responsibility will be anything but a hard job, \nbut we have to start somewhere. It just isn't acceptable to kick the \ncan down the road and continue to deem all of our spending as an \nemergency.\n  As the USA TODAY editorial noted:\n\n       None of these needs suddenly popped up yesterday. The \n     dictionary defines emergency as: ``a sudden, generally \n     unexpected occurrence.'' In Congress-speak, though, an \n     emergency is something you don't want to pay for.\n\n  The amendment fully offsets the spending and tax relief provisions by \nenacting a series of responsible initiatives such as rescinding \nunobligated stimulus funds; cutting $100 million out of Congress's \nbudget; cutting wasteful and duplicative government programs--640 \ndifferent instances are identified in the amendment; freezing Federal \nGovernment salaries; capping the hiring of Federal employees; cutting \nthe budgets of Federal agencies by 5 percent--something the President \nand OMB Director Peter Orszag outlined on Monday; and selling unused \ngovernment property and real estate.\n  I wish to be clear about something. Even I support some of these \nprograms that are targeted. However, we are in a dire fiscal situation \nthat calls for significant contributions from everyone. Government \ncannot be all things to all people, and some reductions must be made \nbecause it is very clear by any economist's definition that this \nspending is not sustainable.\n  We must examine our government spending and weed out the lowest \npriorities. We must make hard choices. That is why we are sent here. \nBut that means establishing priorities and having the courage to make \nthose decisions. Just look at the recent study by the Bank for \nInternational Settlements. It ranks the United States of America fourth \nin general government debt among developed countries, ranking only \nbehind Greece--which is getting a lot of attention these days--Italy, \nand Japan. Being ranked No. 1 is not a goal we should be working to \nachieve, but that is certainly where we are headed if we keep spending \nover 40 percent more than revenues are bringing in. If we want our \nchildren and our grandchildren to have any chance at a prosperous \nfuture, we must start to make tough decisions today.\n  As I mentioned, another reason to support the alternative is that it \ndoes not contain tax increases. Let's take a look at the tax increases \ncontained in the Baucus substitute. We have higher taxes on carried \ninterest, new taxes on S corporations, and harmful retroactive taxes on \nother parts of the economy.\n  Punishing job creators with tax increases that will only stifle \ngrowth, expansion, and investment is not the recipe for success. Nearly \n10 percent unemployment is high enough. Congress should not be adopting \npolicies that will push it higher. Yet, ironically, only here in \nWashington would this bill be titled a ``jobs bill.'' Plus, only in \nWashington, DC, does it make sense to pay for temporary, short-term \nextensions of tax relief with permanent tax increases. Is it any wonder \nso many business groups that typically support tax relief are opposed \nto the Baucus bill? On one hand, they need the tax relief for the rest \nof the year, but at the high cost of paying more taxes permanently, \nmany are saying: Thank you, but no thanks.\n  Finally, the bill increases the taxes oil companies are required to \npay into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund from 8 cents to 41 cents--a \nfivefold increase.\n\n[[Page S4904]]\n\nAt first glance, this seems reasonable given the disastrous \nenvironmental mess that is occurring in the gulf. But in this bill, the \nmoney is being used to pay for new, unrelated, more government \nspending.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle claim the money will stay \nin the fund, but you can't have it both ways. You can't claim to be \nusing the money both for gulf cleanup and to finance other spending. To \ndo both would add an additional $15 billion to our national debt beyond \nwhat is being claimed. It is a lot like the health care bill which pays \nfor new entitlement by siphoning $\\1/2\\ trillion in the Medicare trust \nfund. Its backers claim to be strengthening the trust fund, but they \nare double-counting the money. The extenders bill pays for new spending \nby siphoning $15 billion from the oilspill cleanup funding.\n  This amendment offers Senators a choice between increasing our \nnational debt when the country is crying out for fiscal responsibility \nversus paying for what we spend without increasing taxes or increasing \nthe deficit--making hard choices.\n  I am fully aware some will come to the floor criticizing the \namendment, making all sorts of claims, but I disagree. The amendment \nattempts to make tough choices, rational choices. We have to start \nsomewhere.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Thune amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4904-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4904-S4905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               GULF VISIT\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, this past Friday I had the opportunity to \ntravel to the Gulf of Mexico along with three of our colleagues, \nincluding Senator Mikulski, my colleague from Maryland, Senator Vitter \nfrom Louisiana, and Senator Merkley from Florida. All of us know the \nimportance of coasts. We represent coastal States, and we know how \nimportant it is to our economy, and we know how important it is to our \nway of life. I know Senator Vitter represents that area.\n  We wanted to visit and see firsthand the impact the BP oilspill is \nhaving on the communities in the Gulf of Mexico. I must tell my \ncolleagues, seeing it firsthand, one can really start to understand the \nmagnitude of this disaster. One can see the horrific impact it is \nhaving on the people of that region, and one can see the anger in their \neyes and the desperation of people who are no longer working, and one \ncan see the oil. You can see the oil all over. You can see it in the \nwater. You see it in the marshes. You see it on the coast. It is a \nhorrible thing to see.\n  We visited the area known as the Grand Isles. The Grand Isles is a \nbeach area not too far from New Orleans. Grand Isles is a beach \ncommunity. It is a city. It reminds me a little bit of Ocean City, MD. \nI was just thinking of how the people of Maryland would be responding \nif they knew Ocean City would not be open for the season. When we saw \nthe area of Grand Isles, it was empty. No one was on the beaches. There \nwere some people on the beaches working, cleaning up, but no tourists, \nno people, no children enjoying the water. You couldn't go into the \nwater. The disaster is having a horrible impact on the economy of not \njust Grand Isles but the entire region.\n  We then had a chance to go by boat to see Queen Bess Island and \nPelican or Bird Island, which are two of the major islands that are \nused by birds for nesting. We saw oil. We saw oil on the booms that had \nbeen deployed. We saw oil on the rocks on the island itself, and, more \ntragically, we saw birds that were covered with oil. This should never \nhave happened.\n  I think it just strengthened our resolve about the priorities we must \nhave in this Senate, the priorities that government must follow. The \nfirst, of course, is to stop the flow at the wellhead because oil is \ngushing out into the Gulf of Mexico. What we saw, of course, is oil \nthat had been in the water for many days, had degraded but was still \nguck and still deadly to birds and certainly deadly to the economy of \nthe region. But oil is still coming out at the wellhead.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that BP has tried many ways of stopping \nthat oil from coming into the gulf. Of course, as the Presiding Officer \nknows from the hearings we have had in the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, BP said they had proven technology to deal with any of these \ntypes of spills. Well, that proven technology doesn't exist. They are \ntrying to on the fly determine how to deal with the oil.\n  So now they have a process of capturing the oil that will bring in \n18,000 barrels a day. Remember, BP said originally it was a 1-barrel-a-\nday incident, and then they increased it to 5,000 barrels a day. We now \nknow it is closer to 40,000 barrels a day. The technology they are \ndeploying will recover about 18,000 barrels.\n  They hope to be able to increase that perhaps 5,000 to 10,000 \nbarrels, still leaving tens of thousands of barrels gushing into the \nGulf of Mexico, and it will continue for several months until the \nrelief wells are drilled. That is the current status.\n  Our priority, of course, is to stop the wellhead but also to contain \nthe damages. Oil appears sometimes unexpectedly at different locations. \nSo the game plan has to use the best technologies we have with booms \nand skimmers to keep the oil from reaching sensitive areas.\n  Admiral Watson, the Coast Guard Command, reviewed the strategy with \nus. While we think it is important for the command to set performance \nstandards for BP across the board, we also think we have to have the \nright organizational structure.\n  Let me just mention one point that was troubling to us. Yes, we saw \nbooms that had been deployed, but they were not maintained. If they are \nnot maintained, oil gets to the shore, killing birds and killing our \nenvironment. We have to make sure that is corrected. I thank Admiral \nWatson. He got back to me Saturday night. We had a conversation, along \nwith Senator Boxer, and steps are being changed. That is why we have to \nhave performance standards on BP oil. We have to make sure we are in \ncontrol, as to making sure all technologies are deployed to protect our \nenvironment. Then, yes, we have to hold BP fully accountable for all of \nthe damages.\n  We all talk about how they have to be fully accountable. But let's \nremind the public that BP, in getting the permit to drill, said they \nhad proven technology to deal with any type of incident. They were not \ntruthful on that statement. They didn't have that. So they have to be \nheld fully accountable. We are talking about criminal investigations \nthat will go where they may. But they clearly have to pay all of the \neconomic and environmental damages. The economic damages are clear. We \nhave talked to fishermen who aren't fishing this season, and they don't \nknow if they will ever go back to fishing. We talked to one fisherman \nwhose family has been in that business for generations. We talked to \nshop owners where there was nobody in the shop. We saw charter boat \nowners who cannot operate. BP has to be accountable to these small \nbusiness owners and the property owners.\n  I strongly support the effort of our majority leader and the \nPresident to have BP put money into a trust fund, with independent \ntrustees, so we can expedite the process. It doesn't do a business \nowner any good if he has a long list of documents he has to fill out to \nget the help he needs in order to keep his business afloat. Those who \nwere victimized need to be able to get relief as soon as possible. I \nthink an escrow fund makes a lot of sense, and $20 billion seems like a \nreasonable start. I hope we will move forward. I know the President is \nmeeting with the CEO of BP Oil on Wednesday. Tomorrow, I hope that will \nlead to the resolution of that issue.\n  Let me point out that BP also has to be held responsible for the \nenvironmental damages that will go well beyond the Gulf of Mexico. The \nLoop Current is bringing the oil around the Keys and to the east coast \nof the United States. It will affect many regions, including mine in \nthe Mid-Atlantic. Many of our migratory wildlife travel through the \ngulf. We don't know whether they will be returning to Maryland. We \ndon't know the impact it will have on our wildlife population--those \nwho enjoy hunting and bird watching on the Eastern Shore, those who \nunderstand the importance of the diversity of our wildlife--whether we \nwill be endangering different species. We need to document that and \nmitigate it.\n\n[[Page S4905]]\n\n  I have the honor of chairing the Water and Wildlife Subcommittee of \nthe Environment and Public Works Committee. We are holding hearings, \nthanks to Senator Boxer, next month to start the accounting process, to \nmake sure there is an independent, objective accounting as to the full \ndamages that BP has caused and its related organization--economic \ndamages and environmental damages. Then, going forward with drilling, \nwe all understand mineral management is a critical part of our energy \nstrategy. We cannot drill unless we have an independent agency issuing \nthe permits. We have to make sure the public's interest is protected as \nnew permits are granted.\n  Yes, there are areas where we don't drill today because they are \nenvironmentally too sensitive and there is not enough oil to make it \nworth the risk. I include in that the area I represent in the Mid-\nAtlantic, where there was a site they were going to move forward with \ndrilling just 50 miles from Assateague Island, just 60 miles from the \nmouth of the Chesapeake. If we would have had a spill a fraction of the \namount that occurred in the gulf, with the prevailing winds and \ncurrents, it would have a devastating impact on the Chesapeake Bay and \nthe beaches of Maryland and also Delaware and Virginia. It is not worth \nthe risk. The oil is not significant enough there for that.\n  Lastly, I hope we use this opportunity, as President Obama suggested, \nto move forward with a new energy policy for our country. We need to \nrely less on oil and more on alternative and renewable energy sources. \nI agree we need to do more with nuclear power. We need to consume less \nenergy and improve the way we operate our buildings and the way we \nmanage our transportation systems. We need to become energy \nindependent, and we can do that. But we cannot do it through drilling. \nWe can do it through a comprehensive energy policy so we can protect \nour national security and create jobs in America rather than exporting \nthose jobs overseas and, yes, so that we can protect our environment \nfrom the type of disaster that has occurred in the Gulf of Mexico. I \nhope that is how we respond.\n  My trip to the gulf reinforced my efforts, and I hope the efforts of \nall my colleagues, to say that we can do things better. Let's clean up \nthis mess, let's hold BP responsible, and let's develop an energy \npolicy that will protect America's security, help our economy, and \nprotect our environment.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there will be 20 \nminutes for debate concurrently on the nominations, which will be \nequally divided and controlled between the Senator from Vermont, Mr. \nLeahy, and the Senator from Alabama, Mr. Sessions, or their designees.\n  The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank the distinguished Presiding Officer. Today, the \nSenate is being allowed to confirm only a few more of the 28 judicial \nnominations that have been reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee \nover the past several months, but which have been stalled by the \nRepublican leadership. We have yet to be allowed to consider \nnominations reported last November. In addition to the three \nnominations being considered today, there are another 17 judicial \nnominations available that were all reported unanimously by the \nJudiciary Committee. There is no excuse and no reason for these months \nof delay. The Senate Republican leadership refuses to enter into time \nagreements on these nominations. This stalling and obstruction is \nunprecedented.\n  The Senate is well behind the pace I set for President Bush's \njudicial nominees in 2001 and 2002. By this date in President Bush's \nPresidency, the Senate had confirmed 57 of his judicial nominees. \nDespite the fact that President Obama began sending us judicial \nnominations 2 months earlier than did President Bush, the Senate has to \ndate only confirmed 28 of his Federal circuit and district court \nnominees. After today's 3 confirmations, the comparison will stand at \n31 to 57, which is barely half of what we were able to achieve by this \ndate in 2002. Another useful comparison is that in 2002, the second \nyear of the Bush administration, we confirmed 72 Federal circuit and \ndistrict judges. In this second year of the Obama administration, we \nconfirmed 16 so far. In fact, our Senate Republicans have allowed so \nfew nominees to be considered that in 1 hour today, the Senate is going \nto have three confirmations. That will increase our judicial \nconfirmations for the year by almost 20 percent. Meanwhile, Federal \njudicial vacancies around the country hover around 100.\n  This is the second year of the Obama administration. Although \nvacancies have been at historic highs, Senate Republicans last year \nrefused to move forward on judicial nominees. The Senate confirmed the \nfewest in 50 years. The Senate Republican leadership allowed only 12 \nFederal circuit and district court nominees to be considered and \nconfirmed despite the availability of many more for final action. They \nhave continued their obstruction throughout this year. Only 16 Federal \ncircuit and district court nominees have been confirmed so far this \nyear, although another 28 have been reported favorably by the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  About a week or so ago, three distinguished women were confirmed by \nvirtually unanimous votes. These nominees were reported unanimously by \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee back in March; all Democrats and \nRepublicans voted for them. These three distinguished women put their \nlives on hold and were still held up for months before they were \nallowed to be confirmed.\n  To put these delays into historical perspective, consider this: In \n1982, the second year of the Reagan administration, the Senate \nconfirmed 47 judges. In 1990, the second year of the George H.W. Bush \nadministration, the Senate confirmed 55 judges. In 1994, the second \nyear of the Clinton administration, the Senate confirmed 99 judges. In \n2002, the second year of the George W. Bush administration, the Senate \nconfirmed 72 judges. The only year comparable to this year's record-\nsetting low total of 16 was 1996, when the Republican Senate majority \nrefused to consider President Clinton's judicial nominees and only 17 \nwere confirmed all session.\n  Senate Democrats moved forward with judicial nominees whether the \nPresident was Democratic, as in 1994, or Republican, as in 1982, 1990, \nand 2002, and whether we were in the Senate majority, as we were in \n1990, 1994, and 2002, or in the Senate minority as in 1982. Senate \nRepublicans by contrast have shown an unwillingness to consider \njudicial nominees of Democratic Presidents. They did in 1996, 2009, and \n2010.\n\n[[Page S4906]]\n\n  Over the last recess, I sent a letter to Senator McConnell and to the \nmajority leader concerning these matters. In that letter, I urged, as I \nhave since last December, the Senate to schedule votes on these \nnominations without further obstruction or delay. I called on the \nRepublican leadership to work with the majority leader to schedule \nimmediate votes on consensus nominations--many, like those finally \nbeing considered today, I expect will be confirmed unanimously--and \nconsent to time agreements on those on which debate is requested. As I \nsaid in the letter, if there are judicial nominations that Republicans \ntruly wish to filibuster--after arguing during the Bush administration \nthat such action would be unconstitutional and wrong--then they should \nso indicate to allow the majority leader to seek cloture to end the \nfilibuster.\n  The three nominees being considered today were all reported \nunanimously by the Judiciary Committee way back in March. They could \nhave been confirmed, they should have been confirmed long before now.\n  They are supported by their home State Senators. I note that in all \nthree cases, that means both a Democratic Senator and a Republican \nSenator.\n  Judge Tanya Walton Pratt has been nominated to serve as a Federal \ndistrict court judge in the Southern District of Indiana. If confirmed, \nJudge Pratt will be the first African-American Federal judge in Indiana \nhistory. The Judiciary Committee reported her nomination favorably \nwithout dissent on March 4, more than 3 months ago. Judge Pratt is \ncurrently a Marion County Superior Court judge where she has served \nsince 1997. The substantial majority of the ABA rated Judge Pratt \n``well qualified'' to serve on the U.S. District Court Southern \nDistrict of Indiana. She has 17 years of judicial experience and has \nthe support of both home State Senators, Republican Senator Lugar and \nDemocratic Senator Bayh.\n  Brian Jackson's nomination to the U.S. District Court for the Middle \nDistrict of Louisiana was reported by voice vote by the Judiciary \nCommittee on March 18, nearly 3 months ago, and has the support of both \nhome State Senators, Democratic Senator Landrieu and Republican Senator \nVitter. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously \nrated Mr. Jackson well qualified to be a U.S. District Judge for the \nMiddle District of Louisiana, its highest possible rating. If \nconfirmed, Mr. Jackson will be the second African-American judge to \nserve on the district court in the Middle District of Louisiana.\n  The nomination of Elizabeth Erny Foote to a seat on the United States \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Louisiana also has the \nsupport of Senator Landrieu and Senator Vitter. Ms. Foote has worked \nfor the past 30 years in private practice at The Smith Foote Law Firm \nin Alexandria, LA, after clerking for Judge William Culpepper of the \nLouisiana Third Circuit Court of Appeals. When she began her legal \npractice in Alexandria, she was only the fourth woman ever to do so. \nHer nomination was reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee by \nvoice vote with no dissent on March 18 and has been awaiting Senate \naction ever since.\n  I congratulate the three of them and predict all three will be \nconfirmed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be able to use my \nremaining time as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                       Nomination of Elena Kagan\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, our Nation recently celebrated Memorial \nDay, honoring the sacrifice and the service of our brave men and women \nin uniform. Yesterday was Flag Day, and before too long we will \ncelebrate the Fourth of July.\n  I wish to speak about Solicitor General Elena Kagan's nomination to \nthe Supreme Court. I thought it might be good to set the record \nstraight about some of the charges being leveled at President Obama's \nnominee to the Supreme Court, Solicitor General Elena Kagan. Those \nintent on opposing this nomination--just as they seem to undercut the \nPresident no matter what he does--have searched high and low to find a \nbasis to oppose this intelligent and accomplished nominee.\n  I understand the partisanship, but I disagree with it. A Supreme \nCourt nominee is there for all the country, not for one political party \nor the other, and most nominees will serve long after the Senators who \nvoted for the nominee are gone.\n  I do not think it is good for the country to make it this partisan. \nAfter the American people elected President Obama, leaders of the \nRepublicans urged massive resistance from the outset. They have talked \nabout wanting him to fail and have done everything they could to \nundermine his efforts to rescue our economy from the worst downturn \nsince the Great Depression, to reform health care for all Americans, to \nlower taxes for Americans making less than $250,000 a year and to \nreform Wall Street so that we never again suffer the kind of greed and \nprofiteering that put our economy at risk.\n  When the Senator from Alabama became the ranking Republican on the \nSenate Judiciary Committee last year, he lamented the way nominees were \ntreated. He said:\n\n       What I found was that charges come flying in from right and \n     left that are unsupported and false. It's very, very \n     difficult for a nominee to push back. So I think we have a \n     high responsibility to base any criticisms that we have on a \n     fair and honest statement of the facts and that nominees \n     should not be subjected to distortions of their record.\n\n  I agree with that statement and very much regret the distortion of \nDean Elena Kagan's record as dean of the Harvard Law School. No one \nshould have attacked her unfairly for following the law while seeking \nto honor Harvard's nondiscrimination policy. No one should be \nmisrepresenting her views and smearing her character or questioning her \ncommitment to our men and women in uniform. Yet that is what has been \nhappening repeatedly since her nomination.\n  In fact, some of these same smears were considered last year in \nconnection with her nomination to be Solicitor General. She received a \nbipartisan vote of approval then. I was hoping that would put it to \nrest. Instead, some continue to accuse her of an anti-military bias and \nviolating the law. They say that she ``barred the U.S. military from \ncoming on the Harvard Law School campus,'' that she ``kicked the \nmilitary off Harvard's campus,'' that she ``disregard[ed] the law . . . \nin order to obstruct military recruitment during a time of war,'' that \nshe was punishing and taking actions against our military men and \nwomen, that she condemned the U.S. military, that she acted in a way \nthat was ``not lawful,'' and that she ``violated the law.'' That is \nincorrect. I would have thought, and certainly had hoped, that since \nthe facts are known, these misstatements would not be repeated. \nRegrettably, this has not been the case.\n  The unfair attacks that have been leveled at this nominee are all the \nmore reason for her to have a chance to respond. Anyone who has a sense \nof fairness would not be raising questions and contending they still \nhave concerns while at the same time seeking to delay her an \nopportunity to respond. Those who have been all too willing to attack \nthis nominee during the last four weeks, and who purport to know her \nthoughts and her heart, should not be seeking to delay her opportunity \nto set the record straight and defend her character and good name. \nThose who unfairly characterize her as anti-military and, in effect, \nanti-American and unpatriotic, owe her the opportunity to respond. And \nshe will this month when we have our hearings.\n  Let's be clear on the facts. Dean Kagan did not ban the military from \nHarvard's campus. Harvard's students always had access to military \nrecruiters. The facts are that military recruitment remained steady \nthroughout Dean Kagan's tenure, it even increased during the brief time \nthat the military was restricted from using Harvard's Office of Career \nServices, OCS. Unfortunately, these facts will not prevent some critics \nfrom claiming that she kicked military recruiters off campus when she \ndid no such thing. This is not debatable.\n  What is debatable is the wisdom of the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' \npolicy. In my opinion, the ``Don't Ask Don't Tell'' policy forces good \nand capable people to choose between compromising their integrity and \nbeing barred from military service. At a time when we need a strong and \nskilled military more than ever, our existing policy\n\n[[Page S4907]]\n\nmakes the Armed Forces less effective. As Admiral Mullen, Chairman of \nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently said, ``allowing gays and lesbians \nto serve openly would be the right thing to do.'' I agree. The current \npolicy needlessly robs our Armed Services of the talents and commitment \nof countless people, and it should be changed. Every member of our \nmilitary should be judged solely on his or her contribution to the \nmission, without regard to sexual orientation. Rejecting the \ndiscrimination that results from the ``Don't Ask Don't Tell'' policy is \nlong overdue.\n  Does this statement here on the floor of the Senate make me anti-\nmilitary? Of course not. Does Admiral Mullen's position on the policy \nmake him anti-military? Of course not. He is a distinguished four-star \nadmiral. Did Dean Kagan's comments on the policy render her anti-\nmilitary? Not on your life. Anyone at all familiar with her record \nknows better. Veterans from Harvard Law School have come to her \ndefense. They know and recall her support of them and their service to \nthe country. They know of the dinners and meetings she held with \nveterans.\n  I am confident that a fair reading of her record will show she was \nsupportive of our military, our veterans, and Harvard law students who \nwished to serve in the military. So let's stop the misstatements and \nthe overheated rhetoric. Let's show her the respect she deserves.\n  In her speech at West Point 3 years ago, Dean Kagan spoke of being in \nawe of the courage and the dedication of those who were preparing for \nthe military. She went on to speak directly to the issue, saying:\n\n       I have been grieved in recent years to find your world and \n     mine, the U.S. military and U.S. law schools at odds, indeed, \n     facing each other in court on one issue. That issue is the \n     military's ``don't ask, don't tell'' policy. Law schools, \n     including mine, believe that employment opportunities should \n     extend to all their students, regardless of their race or sex \n     or sexual orientation. And I personally believe that the \n     exclusion of gays and lesbians from the military is both \n     unjust and unwise. I wish devoutly that these Americans could \n     join this noblest of all professions and serve their country \n     in this most important of all ways. But I would regret very \n     much if anyone thought that the disagreement between American \n     law schools and the U.S. military extended beyond this single \n     issue. It does not. And I would regret still more if that \n     disagreement created any broader chasm between law schools \n     and the military. It must not because of what we, like all \n     Americans, owe to you.\n\n  Hers were not the words of someone who is anti-military. There should \nbe no place in America for discrimination. We ask our troops to protect \nfreedom in places around the globe. It is time to protect the basic \nfreedoms and equal rights at home.\n  I commend the House of Representatives for passing legislation just \nlast month to end this discriminatory policy, and the Senate Armed \nServices Committee for doing so, as well. Congress is moving forward to \nadopt the policy of nondiscrimination that Harvard Law School had \nadopted and that Dean Kagan supported. I have long supported \nsimilar legislation in the Senate. I believe this is an important issue \nworthy of an up-or-down vote by the Senate. Regrettably, like so many \nsteps forward in legislation to protect equality throughout our \nhistory, the repeal of this discriminatory policy will likely be \nfilibustered by a recalcitrant minority.\n\n  I also find it ironic that those Republican Senators most critical of \nthe nominee have filibustered and voted against funding for our troops \nand against services for our veterans. When the American people hear a \nRepublican Senator criticizing Elena Kagan's respect and support for \nthe military, they might ask whether that Senator filibustered the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for fiscal year 2010. Led by the \nRepublican leadership, more than 30 Republican Senators did. Even after \ntheir filibuster was defeated, most Republican Senators proceeded to \nvote against the bill and the authorities it provided our military. \nLikewise, when the Senate considered the consolidated appropriations \nbill to provide funding for veterans and military construction, again \nled by the Senate Republican leadership, more than 30 Republican \nSenators sought to filibuster and stall that funding. Even when their \nfilibuster was broken, more than 30 Republican Senators voted against \nthat bill to provide the necessary funding for services to our \nveterans.\n  Also obscured by the blinders worn by her critics are the following \nfacts: Harvard Law School adopted its nondiscrimination policy in 1979, \nlong before Elena Kagan ever attended Harvard Law School as a student \nlet alone before she became an acting professor and ultimately its \nDean. Like almost every other law school in America, Harvard requires \nemployers to sign a statement that they do not discriminate. Only after \nan employer confirms its nondiscrimination employment policy and hiring \npractice can the employer use the logistical assistance of the Harvard \nLaw School's Office of Career Services. This office merely facilitates \nrecruitment by scheduling interviews and distributing student resumes \nto employers. It does not provide physical space on campus for \nemployers to conduct interviews. In fact, private law firms typically \nconduct interviews off campus.\n  In 1994, Congress adopted the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' policy as \npart of the National Defense Authorization Act. This law prohibited \ngays and lesbians from serving openly in our military. Two years later, \nin 1996, Congress passed the so-called ``Solomon Amendment'' as part of \nthe National Defense Authorization Act. This statute allows Federal \nfunds to be denied to universities that have ``a policy or practice'' \nthat ``prohibits, or in effect prevents'' the military's access to \nstudents on campuses for purposes of military recruiting. In order to \ndeny Federal funds under the Solomon amendment, the Secretary of \nDefense must determine that a university has such a policy or practice, \n``transmit a notice [of such determination] . . . to Congress'' and \n``publish in the Federal Register a notice of the determination and the \neffect of the determination on the eligibility of the [university] for \ncontracts and grants.''\n  The Solomon amendment did not directly prohibit a law school from \napplying its nondiscrimination policy to military recruiters. It did \nnot make such an action a crime. The Solomon amendment gave \ninstitutions a choice between satisfying the Secretary of Defense's \nrequirements on military recruitment or risk foregoing certain Federal \nfunds. Senator Sessions acknowledged this very point when he said last \nyear, ``well, let me say, that amendment didn't order any university to \nadmit anybody or to allow anybody to come on campus.'' In fact, it is \nnot a criminal statute but an attempt to use the threat of a Federal \nfunding cutoff as leverage.\n  In 1998, the Air Force determined that Harvard's alternative \narrangement for military recruitment facilitated by the HLS Veterans \nassociation, in lieu of OCS, complied with the Solomon amendment. In \n2002, under the Bush administration, the Air Force reversed course and \nenter into a new and contradictory determination that the arrangement \nno longer satisfied the Solomon amendment. It threatened Dean Robert \nClark, a Republican and Dean Kagan's predecessor, with a cutoff of \nmillions of dollars. In response, Dean Clark ``regrettably'' allowed \nmilitary recruiters to use OCS while continuing to emphasize his strong \nopposition to ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell.''\n  In 2003, Solicitor General Kagan became the first woman to serve as \ndean of the Harvard Law School when she succeeded Dean Clark. For the \nfirst few years in this position she maintained the law school's \nnondiscrimination policy that all employers, with the sole exception of \nthe military, had to follow to use the Office of Career Services. She \ncontinued to allow the military access to OCS, despite the fact that it \ncould not sign a nondiscrimination statement. However, she also \nrepeatedly voiced her opposition to the ``Don't Ask, Don't Tell'' \npolicy, as Dean Clark had, calling it ``a moral injustice of the first \norder.''\n  Also in 2003, the Forum for Academic and Institutional Rights, Inc., \nFAIR, an association of law schools, began a lawsuit challenging the \nSolomon amendment and seeking a preliminary injunction enjoining its \nenforcement. On November 5, 2003, the district court denied the \ninjunction and FAIR appealed to the court of appeals for the Third \nCircuit. On January 12, 2004, in her capacity as a law professor, Dean \nKagan joined more than 50 other Harvard law professors to support an \namicus brief backing FAIR's appeal to the\n\n[[Page S4908]]\n\nThird Circuit. Unlike FAIR, which argued that the Solomon amendment \nviolated the first amendment, the brief she joined made the more modest \nargument that the Department of Defense had misinterpreted the law. The \namicus brief argued: (1) that the Solomon amendment did not apply to \ngenerally applicable nondiscrimination policies, like Harvard's, that \ndid not specifically target the military; and (2) it only required that \nschools give military recruiters ``entry'' and ``access,'' not \nnecessarily equal access.\n  Noting the confusion surrounding the legal requirements of \neligibility for Federal funding under the Solomon amendment, Congress \namended the statute in October, 2004. The effect of those changes was \nnot settled until the Supreme Court decided the case in 2006.\n  On November 29, 2004, the Third Circuit concluded, 2-1, in an opinion \njoined by Reagan appointee Judge Walter Stapleton, that the ``Solomon \nAmendment violates the First Amendment by impeding the law schools' \nrights of expressive association and by compelling them to assist in \nthe expressive act of recruiting.'' The Third Circuit's opinion did not \naddress the Harvard law professors' amicus brief.\n  From the beginning of her tenure until November 30, 2004, Dean Kagan \nhad allowed the military to use OCS. Only after the Third Circuit \nconcluded that the Solomon amendment was unconstitutional did Dean \nKagan return to Harvard's prior policy of excluding the military from \nOCS. However, like her predecessors, Dean Kagan continued to allow \nmilitary recruiters entry to the campus and facilitated interviews on \ncampus through the HLS Veterans Association. This special arrangement \nwas in place only for a few months in 2005.\n  In May 2005, the Supreme Court agreed to review the Third Circuit's \ndecision. During that summer, while the government appeal was pending, \nthe Pentagon informed Harvard University that its Federal funds were in \njeopardy if it continued to restrict military recruiters from OCS \nservices. The Pentagon never notified Congress nor published in the \nFederal Register that Harvard was not compliant with the Solomon \namendment.\n  On September 20, 2005, Dean Kagan reinstated the military's exception \nfrom Harvard's nondiscrimination policy and again granted it access to \nOCS. Dean Kagan's decision to lift the military's restriction from OCS \nwas long before the Supreme Court held oral argument on December 6, \n2005, or decided the case.\n  The day after reinstating the military's use of OCS, Dean Kagan was \none of 40 Harvard law professors to sign onto an amicus brief to the \nSupreme Court. As they did before the Third Circuit, the Harvard law \nprofessors argued that the Pentagon had misinterpreted the Solomon \namendment and that properly read, the amendment ``rules out policies \nthat target military recruiters for disfavored treatment, but it does \nnot touch evenhanded anti-discrimination rules that incidentally affect \nthe military.'' The Supreme Court rejected their argument. On March 6, \n2006, the Supreme Court also reversed the Third Circuit and upheld the \nconstitutionality of the Solomon amendment.\n  Let's be clear. She did not break the law. She did not violate the \nlaw. She did her best to follow the law, even a law that led to \ndiscriminatory consequences with which she strongly disagreed. She \nengaged in legal action and participated in a legal challenge to the \ninterpretation and application of the law by the Bush administration \nand reversed an earlier interpretation by the Air Force. Yet this legal \naction is what some now claim amounted to illegal conduct. That is \nincorrect.\n  Recently there was an op-ed in the Washington Post by Walter \nDellinger dated May 14, 2010, that discusses this issue. Mr. President, \nI ask unanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the Washington Post, May 14, 2010]\n\n                  How I Know Kagan Isn't Anti-Military\n\n                         (By Walter Dellinger)\n\n       The nomination of an anti-military leftist to the Supreme \n     Court would make for a riveting story. But in the case of \n     Elena Kagan, it's just not true.\n       When Kagan became dean of Harvard Law School in 2003, \n     Harvard, like virtually every other law school, had a long-\n     standing policy that the assistance of its placement office \n     was available only to employers that would interview and \n     consider hiring any student. Employers that insisted on \n     ``pre-screening'' students for high grades or other criteria \n     were not eligible for the school's placement assistance, nor \n     were recruiters who declined to hire students on the basis of \n     race, sex, religion or sexual orientation. The placement \n     office, in other words, is there to serve the career \n     aspirations of all students.\n       Under Kagan's predecessor at Harvard, the highly respected \n     corporate scholar Robert C. Clark, military recruiters \n     acknowledged that they were not able to comply with the \n     school's generally applicable anti-discrimination policy and \n     could not use the placement office's services. In 2002, the \n     Bush administration asserted that a federal provision called \n     the Solomon Amendment required the law school to grant \n     military recruiters an exemption from its anti-discrimination \n     policy. Faced with a threatened cutoff of federal funds to \n     the whole university, Clark announced that the placement \n     office would begin assisting military recruiters. When Kagan \n     became dean in 2003, she continued this practice.\n       In November 2003, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd \n     Circuit held that the Solomon Amendment was unconstitutional, \n     which meant there was no longer an enforceable, federally \n     mandated exception to the law school's anti-discrimination \n     policy. Kagan announced that military recruiters were once \n     again ineligible for assistance from the school's placement \n     office. In the fall of 2004, after the Justice Department \n     challenged the 3rd Circuit decision and the Supreme Court \n     agreed to review the lower court's ruling, Kagan announced \n     that the school would once again comply with the government's \n     demand for placement-office support for military recruiters.\n       On the basis of this unremarkable application of an \n     established anti-discrimination policy, Kagan has been \n     accused of harboring an ``anti-military'' animus. Some \n     critics have falsely equated Harvard's anti-discrimination \n     policy with the anti-military and anti-ROTC policies favored \n     by some campus leftists in the 1970s. Those policies, \n     however, were categorically different: They were directed at \n     the military. In contrast, the anti-discrimination policies \n     applied before, during and after Kagan's tenure as dean were \n     in no way intended to single out the military but were \n     applied in an evenhanded way to all prospective employers.\n       It was also far from clear that Harvard even violated the \n     Solomon Amendment. That law withheld federal funding from any \n     school that has a policy of denying military recruiters \n     access to the campus ``in a manner equal in quality and \n     scope'' to other recruiters. Neither the text of the law nor \n     its history (targeting anti-ROTC and anti-military rules) \n     compelled the conclusion that the law was violated by an \n     anti-discrimination policy applicable to all recruiters.\n       When some groups challenged the constitutionality of the \n     Solomon Amendment, Kagan joined a majority of her faculty \n     colleagues in a friend-of-the-court brief that I drafted as \n     their counsel, urging the court to exercise judicial \n     restraint and avoid ruling on the constitutional issue by \n     simply holding that it was not clear that Congress intended \n     to preclude the evenhanded application of anti-discrimination \n     policies. There were no dissents from the chief justice's \n     opinion dismissing this statutory argument. We knew that it \n     would be a difficult sell for the court because the actual \n     party to the case wanted to seek a constitutional ruling, a \n     course we thought imprudent and unwise. As the oral argument \n     showed, a number of justices thought the Harvard brief raised \n     a very serious question. For today's debate, the key point \n     about the brief that Kagan joined is that it urged a prudent \n     course, arguing that ``sound principles of judicial restraint \n     counsel that this Court should resolve the question of \n     statutory coverage before turning, only if necessary, to \n     constitutionality.''\n       No action Kagan took as dean remotely suggests anything but \n     the greatest respect for the military. Even when the law \n     school's anti-discrimination policy effectively precluded \n     placement-office assistance to military recruiters, she \n     permitted student veteran groups to use law-school premises \n     to facilitate military recruitment of Harvard students. At no \n     point were military recruiters ever barred from the campus or \n     banned from recruiting Harvard law students. And military \n     veterans who entered Harvard Law School when Kagan was dean \n     have praised her efforts to ensure they were welcomed and \n     respected for their service.\n       Separately, it is true that as dean, Kagan expressed strong \n     personal opposition to the ``don't ask, don't tell'' \n     restrictions on service by gays and lesbians in the military. \n     But that is not an anti-military position. Rather, it is the \n     position now shared by many senior military leaders and the \n     commander in chief.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Finally, I find it ironic: Here is this very pro-military \nnominee who is being criticized as somehow being anti-military, being \ncriticized by some of the same Republican Senators who have \nfilibustered and voted against funding for our troops and against \nservices for our veterans. I think most people see through that.\n  Mr. President, we are required to vote at what time?\n\n[[Page S4909]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate is voting at about 11:50 a.m. when \nall time is expired.\n  Mr. BAYH. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nnomination of Judge Tanya Walton Pratt. I joined together with Senator \nLugar to recommend Judge Walton Pratt because I know firsthand that she \nis a highly capable lawyer who understands the limited role of the \nFederal judiciary.\n  Before I speak to Judge Walton Pratt's qualifications, I would like \nto comment briefly on the state of the judicial confirmation process \ngenerally. In my view, this process has too often been consumed by \nideological conflict and partisan acrimony. This is not, I believe, how \nthe Framers intended us to exercise our responsibility to advise and \nconsent.\n  During the last Congress, I was proud to work with Senator Lugar to \nrecommend Judge John Tinder as a bipartisan, consensus nominee for the \nSeventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Judge Tinder was nominated by \nPresident Bush and unanimously confirmed by the U.S. Senate by a vote \nof 93-0. It was my hope that Judge Tinder's confirmation would serve as \nan example of the benefits of nominating qualified, non-ideological \njurists to the Federal bench.\n  In selecting Tanya Walton Pratt, President Obama has demonstrated \nthat he also appreciates the benefits of this approach. I was proud to \nonce again join with Senator Lugar to recommend her to the President, \nand I hope that going forward other Senators will adopt what I call the \n``Hoosier approach'' of working across party lines to select consensus \nnominees.\n  I would also like to personally thank Senator Lugar for his \nextraordinary leadership and for the consultative and cooperative \napproach he has taken to judicial nominations. During my time in \nCongress, it has been my great privilege to forge a close working \nrelationship with Senator Lugar across many issues. This has been \nespecially true on the issue of nominations--when a judicial nominee \nfrom Indiana comes before the Senate, our colleagues can be confident \nthat the name is being put forward with bipartisan support, regardless \nof which political party is in the White House or controls a majority \nin the U.S. Senate.\n  I should also note that Judge Walton Pratt is a historic nominee. If \nconfirmed, she will be our State's first African-American Federal \njudge. While this day is long overdue, I hope that her confirmation \nwill inspire Hoosier children of all backgrounds to pursue their dreams \nand show them that, in America, anything is possible if you study hard \nand play by the rules.\n  On the merits, Tanya Walton Pratt is an accomplished jurist who is \nwell-qualified for a lifetime appointment to the Federal judiciary. She \nhas extensive trial experience, having served as, a judge on the Marion \nSuperior Court since 1997. For much of this time, she served in the \ncriminal division, handling major felonies and presiding over dozens of \njury trials per year. More recently, she has played a critical role in \nthe probate division, presiding over adoption cases and placing \nchildren in loving homes.\n  During this time, Judge Walton Pratt has been recognized as a leader \namong Indiana jurists. She has served as chair of the Marion County Bar \nAssociation and on the executive committee of the Marion Superior Court \nSystem. Among other accolades, she has been honored as ``Outstanding \nJudge of the Year'' by the Indiana Coalition Against Sexual Assault.\n  Judge Walton Pratt has shown that she is deserving of the public \ntrust. She has demonstrated the highest ethical standards and a firm \ncommitment to applying our country's laws fairly and faithfully. She \nunderstands that the appropriate role for a judge is to interpret our \nlaws, not to write them.\n  Tanya Walton Pratt is also a recognized leader in our community. She \nhas also been honored with numerous awards including the Career \nAchievement Award from the Archdiocese of Indianapolis and the Key to \nthe City of Muncie.\n  I can say with confidence that Tanya Walton Pratt is the embodiment \nof good judicial temperament, intellect, and evenhandedness. If \nconfirmed, she will be a superb and historic addition to the Federal \nbench. I am pleased to give her my highest recommendation.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me--and Senator Lugar--in supporting \nthis extremely well-qualified and deserving nominee.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, Brian Jackson and Elizabeth Erny Foote \nare outstanding candidates for judgeships in Louisiana's Middle and \nWestern Districts. I was honored to recommend Brian Jackson and Beth \nFoote to the President last year.\n  These two well-qualified, noncontroversial nominees are sorely needed \nin the districts they have been nominated to serve, where courts are \nfacing unacceptable backlogs and sitting judges are overwhelmed with \nunmanageable caseloads. Ms. Foote and Mr. Jackson have been eager for \nthis body to let them get to work serving justice to the people of \nLouisiana since they were reported by the Judiciary Committee on March \n18. I am relieved to see that their long journey toward confirmation is \ndrawing to a close.\n  Brian Jackson is an exemplary public servant with a distinguished \nrecord as an attorney and prosecutor. He has extensive Federal \nexperience, having worked for the Department of Justice for 16 years. \nFrom 1992 to 2002, he served as first assistant U.S. attorney and U.S. \nAttorney for the Middle District of Louisiana. As the first assistant \nU.S. attorney, he managed or litigated a variety of civil and criminal \ncases. Because of his leadership, he was selected in 2001 to be the \ninterim U.S. attorney for the Middle District pending the confirmation \nof President Bush's nominee.\n  Prior to becoming an assistant U.S. attorney, he served as an \nassociate deputy attorney general in Washington, DC. In this role, he \nwas as a principal adviser to the Attorney General and Deputy Attorney \nGeneral on civil rights and criminal justice policies. In 1992 he was \nhonored as the recipient of the Attorney General's Award for Equal \nEmployment Opportunity for his leadership in this area.\n  Since 2002, he has distinguished himself in private practice in the \nfirm Liskow and Lewis, where he is a shareholder. He is currently chair \nof the firm's government investigations and white collar crime groups \nand he is on Liskow and Lewis' board of directors and is the immediate \npast chair of the firm's diversity committee.\n  In addition to this distinguished career in private practice, Brian \nhas also been extremely active in public service. He has graciously \nserved on the boards of several nonprofit organizations, including \nCatholic Charities of New Orleans, The Pro Bono Project, Teach for \nAmerica for the South Louisiana Region, and The Metropolitan Crime \nCommission, for which he served as vice chair. Additionally, he has \ngiven back to the legal community by serving on the board of directors \nfor the New Orleans Chapter of the Federal Bar Association.\n  Finally, Brian's impressive academic credentials have also prepared \nhim to serve Louisiana's Middle District. He received his bachelor of \nscience, Xavier University in 1982. He received his J.D. from the \nSouthern University School of Law in 1985 where he served as editor-in-\nchief of the Southern University Law Review and his master's of law \nwith concentration in international and comparative law from Georgetown \nUniversity Law Center in 2000.\n  With these credentials, firm roots Louisiana's Middle District, and a \nlong and impressive career in the U.S. Department of Justice, Brian \nJackson is truly ready to hit the ground running as district court \njudge.\n  Elizabeth Erny Foote is an experienced attorney with 30 years of \nexperience in Federal litigation. She is a partner in the Smith Foote \nLaw firm in Alexandria, LA, where she primarily practices civil \nlitigation. She has had extensive experience in Federal court \nthroughout her career, having litigated in all three Federal Court \nDistricts of Louisiana, in addition to the Fifth Circuit Court of \nAppeal.\n  In addition to this outstanding private practice, Beth has proven her \ndedication to the legal profession through her service to the Louisiana \nState Bar Association.\n  In addition to this outstanding private practice, Beth has proven her \ndedication to the legal profession through her service to the Louisiana \nState Bar Association, with which she has been actively involved since \n1985\n\n[[Page S4910]]\n\nand is currently the immediate past president. In 1994, she became the \nfirst woman to serve as an officer in the Louisiana State Bar \nassociation when she was elected treasurer. The same year she received \nthe President's Award for outstanding service.\n  Beth is truly a respected civic leader throughout Louisiana. In \naddition to her contributions to the legal field, she has demonstrated \nher commitment to justice and equality through a number of nonprofits \nand government initiatives. Her prestigious awards and honors include: \nthe 2004 Alexandria Human Relations Commission Award for her efforts in \npromoting better understanding and quality of life in her community, \nthe 2004 Louisiana Heroine Award presented by the Louisiana Association \nof Nonprofit Associations, the 2000 Central Louisiana Woman of the \nCentury Award, and the 1996 Central Louisiana Women Business Owners' \n``Business Owner Woman of Excellence'' Award.\n  Finally, Beth's impressive academic credentials have prepared her to \nserve Louisiana's Western District. She received a bachelor of arts \nfrom Louisiana State University in 1974, a master's of arts from Duke \nUniversity in 1975, and a J.D. from Louisiana State University Law \nSchool in 1978. She has also been an adjunct professor at the Paul M. \nHebert Law Center at LSU, teaching courses in appellate advocacy.\n  I believe Beth's principled commitment to the field of law, her \nimpressive 30-year career as an attorney, her extensive Federal \nlitigation experience, and her esteemed statewide reputation make her \nan excellent nominee for judge for Louisiana's Western District.\n  The time to confirm these two noncontroversial nominees is far \noverdue. I urge my colleagues to confirm these nominees without further \ndelay so that they may begin the important work the people of Louisiana \nneed them to do.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time be \nyielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the first \nnominee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe a sufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Tanya Walton Pratt, of Indiana, to be United States District Judge \nfor the Southern District of Indiana?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, there are not many lists on which Senator \nDan Inouye ranks second. He was Hawaii's first Congressman, and he now \nis the longest serving Senator from that great State. He is the first \nJapanese American to serve in the House and first Japanese American to \nserve in the Senate. He was the first chairman of the Senate Select \nCommittee on Intelligence. He has cast more votes than any other \nSenator west of the Mississippi. We have all heard the stories about \nhis bravery, both legislatively and on the fields of war where, because \nof his gallantry, he was awarded the Congressional Medal of Honor.\n  But there is one place where he comes in No. 2, though it is a \nremarkable accomplishment nonetheless. This past Friday, Senator Inouye \nbecame the second longest serving U.S. Senator in this Nation's \nhistory, passing Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina. Every day \nsince Hawaii has been a State, Senator Inouye has proudly represented \nits citizens in Congress. Every day since January 3, 1963, 46\\1/2\\ \nyears ago, Hawaiians have been proud to call Dan Inouye their Senator. \nEvery day I have had the privilege of knowing him and serving with him, \nI have been proud to call Dan Inouye my friend.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, last October, the Senate had an \nopportunity to call attention to one of our colleagues who so rarely \ncalls attention to himself when Senator Daniel Inouye became the third \nlongest-serving Senator in U.S. history. This past Friday, Senator \nInouye reached an even loftier milestone when he surpassed Strom \nThurmond to become the second-longest serving Senator in history. So we \nhonor him for this remarkable feat of longevity.\n  Senator Inouye's dedication to the people of Hawaii is legendary, and \nso is his story. He was only 17 when he heard the sirens over Honolulu \nand saw the gray planes overhead. But he was old enough to know that \nlife would never be the same.\n  Sure enough, a few years later, he would be lying in a hospital bed \nat Percy Jones Army hospital recovering from wounds sustained in a \ngrenade attack in the mountains of northern Italy. It was there that he \nfirst met his future colleague, Bob Dole, who evidently mentioned that \nafter the war he planned to go to Congress.\n  As it turned out, Senator Inouye beat him by a few years, and he has \nsurvived him here in the Senate by many more.\n  For his heroic actions in World War II, Senator Inouye received our \nNation's most prestigious award for military valor, and he has earned \nthe admiration of all Americans. Dan Inouye became a member of one of \nthe most decorated U.S. military units in American history and one of \nits longest-serving, and finest, Senators. So, Senator, thank you for \nyour service, and congratulations on another remarkable achievement.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I rise to congratulate our senior Senator, \nmy good friend and longtime colleague, Senator Dan Inouye, on his \nimpressive milestone.\n  On Friday, Senator Inouye became the second-longest-serving Senator \nin the history of this storied institution.\n  Dan was sworn into the Senate in 1963, just a few years after Hawaii \nbecame a State. At the time, he was the first and only Japanese \nAmerican to step foot in this room as a Member of this prestigious \nbody. Today, he is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee. Dan \nInouye did not just break barriers, he shattered them.\n\n[[Page S4911]]\n\n  Of course, the Senate is only the most recent chapter in Dan Inouye's \nlifetime of service to our country, which includes his Medal of Honor \nservice in the Army during World War II, and his service in the Hawaii \nTerritorial Legislature and the U.S. House of Representatives.\n  Hawaii may be the youngest State in this great country, but as \nSenator Inouye's milestone demonstrates, our contributions continue to \nshape the United States of America.\n  From President Barack Obama, who grew up not far from Senator \nInouye's childhood home on the island of Oahu, to each teacher, \nsoldier, construction worker, and farmer, we are proud of the many \naccomplishments of Hawaii's people. We are proud to be the 50th State, \nand we are proud of Senator Inouye's long career serving our Nation.\n  Aloha and congratulations, Dan.\n  (Applause, Senators rising.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Brian Anthony Jackson, of Louisiana, to be \nU.S. District Judge for the Middle District of Louisiana?\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I have a pending amendment to the tax \nextenders bill and want to say a few words on that.\n  At a time when we have a recordbreaking $13 trillion national debt \nand an unsustainable Federal deficit, at a time when two out of every \nthree corporations in America paid no Federal income taxes between 1998 \nand 2005, at a time when ExxonMobil, the most profitable corporation in \nthe history of the world, not only paid no Federal income taxes in 2009 \nbut actually got a $156 million refund from the IRS, at a time when we \ndesperately need to end our dependence on fossil fuel and transform our \nenergy system, the amendment I am offering, along with Senator Wyden, \nSenator Whitehouse, Senator Menendez, and Senator Lautenberg, is simple \nand straightforward.\n  This amendment simply repeals over $35 billion in tax breaks to the \noil and gas industry, all of which were recommended for elimination in \nPresident Obama's fiscal year 2011 budget, which the Joint Committee on \nTaxation has estimated would raise over $35 billion in a 10-year \nperiod.\n  To put this in perspective, the taxpayer dollars saved by repealing \nthese tax breaks represents about 1 percent of the total projected \nrevenue of the oil and gas industry over this same time period. In \nother words, the cost of repealing these tax breaks for the oil and gas \nindustry is negligible.\n  More than $25 billion of the money saved under this amendment would \nbe used to reduce the deficit. I hear my friends coming down every day, \nappropriately, talking about our recordbreaking deficit and our huge \nnational debt. Mr. President, $25 billion in this amendment is used for \ndeficit reduction.\n  Mr. President, $10 billion would be invested in the highly successful \nEnergy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant Program over a 5-year \nperiod, which would go to 50 States in this country to help them move \nforward in terms of energy efficiency and sustainable energy.\n  This amendment has widespread support throughout this country from \norganizations representing millions of Americans, including the League \nof Conservation Voters, the Sierra Club, the American Council for an \nEnergy Efficient Economy, Friends of the Earth, the Union of Concerned \nScientists, Physicians for Social Responsibility, the American Public \nHealth Association, moveon.org, Environment America, Oceana, 1 Sky, \nGreenpeace, Public Citizen, the Center for Biological Diversity, the \nConservation Law Foundation, and 350.org.\n  In addition, the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block Grant \nfunding this amendment would provide is strongly supported by the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the National League of Cities, the National \nAssociation of State Energy Officials, and the National Association of \nDevelopment Organizations, and I am pleased to report that Taxpayers \nfor Common Sense and the National Wildlife Federation strongly support \nrepealing the oil and gas tax breaks this amendment would eliminate.\n  Let me briefly explain why this amendment needs to be included in \nthis overall legislation. First, there is no debate; everybody here \nunderstands we have to address the deficit crisis and the $13 trillion \nnational debt we face. Well, I say to my friends: If you are serious \nabout doing this and doing it in a way that doesn't decimate the middle \nclass or working families, this amendment is a good step forward: $25 \nbillion in deficit reduction over a 10-year period is significant and \nit would help us address a major crisis.\n  Secondly, we all understand--or I hope we all understand--we have to \nreform the Tax Code, which is grossly unfair today. We must make the \nTax Code fairer and more equitable for ordinary Americans and, in my \nview, that means ending the absurdity of seeing large corporations, \nenormously profitable corporations, not pay their fair share of taxes \nand, in some cases, not paying any taxes at all. Each and every year, \nlarge and profitable corporations all over this country are able to \navoid paying billions of dollars in Federal income taxes through \nloopholes in the Tax Code and generous tax breaks. This is simply \nunacceptable, it is unfair especially with a record-breaking\n\n[[Page S4912]]\n\ndeficit, it is very poor public policy, and it has to be changed.\n  To highlight how absurd this situation has become, take a look at the \nAugust 2008 report on the subject by the Government Accountability \nOffice or the GAO. According to this report--and I hope Americans hear \nthis--two out of every three corporations in the United States paid no \nFederal income taxes from 1998 to 2005--two out of three. Amazingly \nthese corporations had a combined $2.5 trillion in sales but paid no \nincome taxes to the IRS. This statistic includes one out of four large \ncorporations. That is according to the GAO.\n  Further, according to a report from the Citizens for Tax Justice, 82 \nFortune 500 companies in America paid:\n\n     zero or less in federal income taxes in at least one year \n     from 2001 to 2003.\n\n  I am thinking now about working people in the State of Vermont and in \nthe State of New Mexico or in Oklahoma, where people are making 10, 12 \nbucks an hour; people are working 40, 50, 60 hours a week; people who \nare paying their fair share of taxes. Yet we end up having these large \nmultinational corporations making billions of dollars every year in \nprofits and then they avoid paying their fair share of taxes. That is \nan issue we have to address.\n  This same report from Citizens for Tax Justice states:\n\n       In the years they paid no income tax, these companies \n     earned $102 billion in U.S. profits.\n\n  How is that? Not a bad deal: $102 billion in profits, zero income \ntaxes.\n\n       But instead of paying $35.6 billion in income taxes as the \n     statutory 35 percent corporate tax rate seems to require, \n     these companies generated so many excess tax breaks that they \n     received outright tax rebate checks from the U.S. Treasury, \n     totaling $12.6 billion.\n\n  How is that? They make huge amounts of money, don't pay any taxes, \nand then Uncle Sam gives them a rebate. That is quite the scam.\n  In other words, between 2001 and 2003, 82 of the largest, most \nprofitable corporations in this country received a $12.6 billion tax \nrefund--tax refund--from the IRS when, if they were paying their 35 \npercent of corporate taxes as the law requires, they would have paid \nover $35 billion in taxes. That is a net loss to the U.S. Treasury of \n$48 billion.\n  It is not just Bernie Sanders who has strong concerns about this \nissue. The issue of abusive corporate tax breaks has even gotten the \nattention of Forbes Magazine.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I will yield in a few minutes and be happy to discuss \nthis issue with my friend.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Just one short question. Is the Senator talking about \namendment No. 4318?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I am, but not yet. I will get to that in a moment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. OK.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, the issue of abusive corporate tax breaks \nhas even gotten the attention of Forbes Magazine, which reported on \nApril 1, 2010--this is Forbes Magazine--Forbes 500, dynamic capitalism, \nForbes Magazine, and this is what they say on April 1, 2010:\n\n       As you work on your taxes this month, here's something to \n     raise your hackles: Some of the world's biggest, most \n     profitable corporations enjoy a far lower tax rate than you \n     do--that is, if they pay taxes at all.\n\n  Forbes Magazine. This is not one of the more progressive journals in \nAmerica.\n  So enough is enough. We can and must reduce the deficit in a way that \ndoes not harm the American middle class. Making sure that large and \nprofitable corporations are not able to avoid paying taxes could \nsignificantly reduce the deficit. It is not the only thing we have to \ndo, but it would be an important step forward.\n  As a first step in this direction, the amendment I am proposing today \ngoes after the three most generous tax breaks enjoyed by the oil and \ngas industry and would raise over $35 billion in revenue over a 10-year \nperiod--$35 billion, 10 years. All of these tax breaks were recommended \nfor elimination in President Obama's fiscal year 2011 budget request.\n  Specifically, this amendment eliminates the expensing of intangible \ndrilling costs to raise over $10.9 billion. It eliminates percentage \ndepletion for oil and gas while saving over $9.6 billion; and it \neliminates the so-called manufacturing tax deduction for oil and gas \nproduction, saving over $14.7 billion over the next decade, according \nto the Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  I want my colleagues to take a look at this chart, because what this \nchart tells us is that during the last 10 years, the five largest oil \ncompanies--ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, Texaco, and ConocoPhillips--\nearned over $750 billion in profits--10-year period, $750 billion, the \ntop five oil companies. During the first quarter of this year, big \noil's profits increased by 85 percent. Providing tax breaks to this \nprofitable industry at a time of record-breaking deficits simply does \nnot make sense. We can't afford to do it.\n  Let me give one example of the absurdity of continuing to provide tax \nbreaks to the oil and gas industry. I want my colleagues to take a look \nat this chart right here. As we all know, ExxonMobil was the most \nprofitable corporation in the history of the world from 2006 through \n2008, making $40 billion in profits in 2006, $41 billion in 2007, and \n$45 billion in 2008. Not bad. These profits, among other things, \nenabled Exxon to provide a $398 million retirement package to its \nformer CEO, Lee Raymond.\n  In 2009, one of the most economically difficult years since the Great \nDepression--millions of people losing their jobs, their homes, their \nsavings--ExxonMobil was still able to make $19 billion in profits in \nthe midst of a severe recession.\n  I have a question for my friends on both sides of the aisle to \nconsider: Out of that $19 billion profit, how much did ExxonMobil pay \nin taxes to the IRS? How much did they pay? How many billions of \ndollars? How many hundreds of millions of dollars did they pay? Well, \nthe answer is: Zero, not one red nickel.\n  So all over America, working families are struggling to keep their \nheads above water. They pay their taxes. Yet we have a corporation, the \nmost profitable in the history of the country, that last year made $19 \nbillion in profit, and they didn't pay a nickel in taxes.\n  But that is not, as they say, the whole story. It gets worse than \nthat.\n  As this chart right here on my right shows, ExxonMobil reported to \nthe SEC that not only did it avoid paying any Federal income taxes, it \nactually received a $156 million refund from the IRS. Twenty-two \npercent of the children in this country live in poverty. We have \nrecord-breaking deficits. We have a $13 trillion national debt, and \nExxonMobil receives $156 million in a tax refund after making $19 \nbillion in profits. This has to stop.\n  This amendment I am offering would begin to make sure that ExxonMobil \npays at least a minimal amount of their record-breaking profits in \ntaxes to the Federal Government. That is the very least we can do.\n  But ExxonMobil is not the only corporation enjoying these tax breaks. \nChevron, the fourth most profitable oil company in America, a company \nthat made a $10 billion profit last year when other companies were \nfighting to stay alive, reported to the SEC that it received a $19 \nmillion refund from the IRS. This is Chevron. I know. It is not as much \nas ExxonMobil, but a $19 million refund after you make $10 billion in \nprofits, that is not too shabby.\n  Valero Energy, the 25th largest company in America with $68 billion \nin sales last year, received a $157 million refund check from the IRS, \nand over the past 3 years it received a $134 million tax break from the \noil and gas manufacturing tax deduction that this amendment seeks to \neliminate. And on and on it goes. ConocoPhillips, et cetera, et cetera.\n  Let me very briefly turn to what this amendment would do with the \nrevenues. In terms of deficit reduction, as I have indicated, the \nbenefits are substantial. As we all know, the underlying bill we are \ndebating today, which I support, would increase the deficit by about \n$87 billion over 10 years. This amendment, my amendment, would cut that \nby about a third--$25 billion over 10 years. This amendment importantly \nwould also invest $10 billion into the Energy Efficiency and \nConservation Block Grant Program which, as I mentioned earlier, will \ncreate jobs, save people money on their fuel bills, and help transform \nour energy system away from fossil fuels.\n  I get a little bit tired of hearing my friends come to the floor of \nthe Senate talking about the need to reduce our\n\n[[Page S4913]]\n\ndeficit. I get a little bit tired of people talking about the need for \nequity. If we cannot address a situation where some of the most \nprofitable corporations in America pay zero Federal taxes and, in fact, \nget a tax rebate, then I am not quite sure what this institution is \ndoing.\n  So we now have an opportunity to move forward, to address our deficit \ncrisis. We have an opportunity to move forward to transform our energy \nsystem. We have an opportunity in this amendment to create jobs and \nbreak our dependency on fossil fuel.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to a debate on \namendment No. 4318; that the time for such debate be limited to half an \nhour equally divided; that once the time has expired on this debate, \nthe Senate proceed to a vote on amendment No. 4318.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I hear my friend's objection. I think \nthat is unfortunate. The American people should be able to have a \ndifferent vote and debate on this issue. But I hear what the Senator \nhas said.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I think the regular order is to go out \nnow. First, I suggest that I will want some time this afternoon to \nexplain what this amendment really does and also to explain in some \ndetail the marginal wells this would affect. The average marginal well \nin my State of Oklahoma is 2 barrels a day. We are not talking about \ngiants here. This is a totally different situation. We will have an \nopportunity to pursue that after resuming the regular order.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4913-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4913]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I wish to bring to my colleagues' \nattention the fact that we have this problem we deal with too often \ncalled the alternative minimum tax. I bring it to my colleagues' \nattention.\n  Last week, I had an opportunity to address my colleagues on the \nunfinished tax legislative business. These four items are the \nunfinished business to which I was referring. The legislation before \nthe Senate deals with only one but, of course, an important piece of \nthe unfinished legislative business. These tax extenders are on their \nsecond legislative stop through the Senate.\n  As the chart shows, the tax extenders, which are overdue by almost \nhalf a year, are not alone in that unfinished business. There are three \nother major areas of unfinished business. As we can see from the chart, \nwe have the death tax with which we have not dealt. Another area is the \n2001 to 2003 tax rate cuts and family tax relief package. Then the \nthird area is the AMT patch, the alternative minimum tax.\n  Over the past few years, the AMT is frequently a subject of many of \nmy addresses to my colleagues. I intend to keep talking about the AMT \nuntil this Congress actually takes action on reforming the AMT.\n  Instead of taking action, Congress this session has done absolutely \nnothing, and the problem continues to get worse for at least 26 million \nAmerican families--let me emphasize middle-class American families--who \nwill be caught in this AMT trap and, as a matter of fact, are now \nalready caught.\n  Those being caught or are caught are the families who make estimated \ntax payments and who will be making their second payment this very day.\n  Last year, in 2009, a bit over 4 million families were hit by the \nalternative minimum tax. I think this was 4 million families too many, \nbut it is considerably better than the more than 26 million additional \nfamilies who will be hit this year in 2010 if Congress does not take \naction.\n  The reason we are experiencing this large increase this year is that \nover the last 9 years Congress has passed legislation that would \ntemporarily--and only temporarily--increase the amount of income exempt \nfrom the alternative minimum tax. These temporary exemption increases \nhave prevented millions of middle-class American families from falling \nprey to the alternative minimum tax until right now.\n  While I have always fought for these temporary exemptions, I believe \nthe AMT ought to be permanently repealed. One reason I have previously \ngiven for permanent repeal is that it may be difficult for Congress to \nrevisit the alternative minimum tax on a temporary basis every year. Of \ncourse, this current situation, now 6 months into this year, proves me \nright. Congress has yet to undertake any meaningful action on the \nalternative minimum tax.\n  The budget resolution, passed well over a year ago, provided revenue \nroom for a short-term extension of the alternative minimum tax patch. \nThat was a lot less than what President Obama's budget did, which made \nthe patch permanent.\n  On this point, since too often people think I do not agree with \nPresident Obama enough, this is one point where I believe the tax \npolicy of President Obama has it exactly right.\n  About 18 months ago, much to the criticism of some on the other side, \nI made the 2009 AMT patch an issue in the economic stimulus \nlegislation. The reason I did is that 24 million middle-class families \nwould have, on average, paid $2,400 more in income taxes for 2009 if \nthe patch had been abandoned. For those 24 million people, paying \n$2,400 more into the Federal Treasury would have been a real hurt. My \n2009 AMT patch amendment was adopted in the stimulus legislation by the \nFinance Committee. That was 18 months ago.\n  Despite assurances the AMT relief is an important issue, nothing has \nactually been put forward as a serious legislative solution this year. \nAgain, we can see the checklist chart. There has been no House \ncommittee markup or floor action, no Senate committee markup or floor \naction. This year is almost half done. A theoretical discussion is not \na substitute for real action, to which anyone making a quarterly \npayment today will attest.\n  I am hopeful I can get folks on Capitol Hill rethinking about the AMT \nand realize that it is a real problem right now. Everyone seems to \nagree that something needs to be done quickly, but the discussion does \nnot go any further than just discussion.\n  The second quarterly payment is due today. Today taxpayers across the \ncountry are under a legal requirement to pay their estimated taxes, and \nwith it the additional money that would be owed because the AMT has not \nbeen patched. They would use form 1040-ES. I bet I will be here \nSeptember 15 when the third payment comes due saying largely the same \nthing.\n  Congress does not seem to be under any pressure to actually take \naction. Many on the other side insist that, unlike new spending \nproposals or extensions of existing programs, AMT reform should happen \nonly if it is revenue neutral. That means any revenues--I want to put \nquotes around these words--any revenues ``not collected'' through \nreform or repeal of the AMT must be offset by new taxes from somewhere \nelse.\n  Notice I said ``collected,'' and I did not say ``lost.'' This \ndistinction is important for the simple reason that the revenues we do \nnot collect as a result of AMT relief are not, in fact, lost to the \nTreasury. The AMT collects revenues it was never supposed to collect in \nthe first place. In other words, middle-class income people were not \nsupposed to pay this tax in the first place--that is that 24 million--\nbecause this AMT was originally conceived as a mechanism to ensure that \nhigh-income taxpayers were not able to completely eliminate their tax \nliability. From that standpoint, even the AMT has failed because in \n2004, IRS Commissioner Everson told the Finance Committee the same \npercentage of taxpayers continue to pay no Federal income tax as they \ndid back in 1969. Even I think, on raw numbers, it is a much larger \nnumber. Back then it was only 155 taxpayers.\n  Today, at least 24 million to 26 million middle-class families are in \nthese alternative minimum tax crosshairs. That is quite a change from \nthe 155\n\n[[Page S4914]]\n\nrich people in 1969 who were not paying any tax, the reason for the \nalternative minimum tax to be passed in the first place.\n  Finally, if we offset revenues not collected as a result of AMT \nrepeal or reform, total Federal revenues over the long term are \nprojected to push through the 30-year historical average and then keep \ngoing.\n  The AMT then is a completely failed policy that is projected to bring \nin future revenues that it was never designed to collect in the first \nplace.\n  President Obama met those of us who favor repeal partway by staking \nout a position on AMT reform during his 2008 campaign. His position \nprovided for a permanent AMT patch. His budgets have maintained that \nposition.\n  While permanent repeal without offsetting is the best option, we \nabsolutely must do something to protect taxpayers and do it now, even \nif it involves a temporary solution, such as an increase in the \nexemption amount.\n  Of course, if we do that, we are going to be in the same fix next \nyear, and I will be making that same point again.\n  Today, Tuesday, June 15, 2010, taxpayers making quarterly payments \nare going to once again discover that the AMT is neither the subject of \nan academic seminar nor a future problem that we can put off dealing \nwith. The AMT is a real problem right now, and if this Congress is \nserious about tax fairness, it needs to stand up and take action.\n\n\n                              Job Creation\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to address the Senate for a minute on another \nissue about how many jobs the stimulus bill created.\n  In recent weeks, a number of my colleagues have come to the floor to \nproclaim the success of the massive $862 billion stimulus bill Congress \nenacted in 2009. Although the number of private sector jobs has \nincreased by only about half a million since 2009, they continue to \ninsist the stimulus bill has created millions of new jobs. How do they \njustify these claims?\n  The stimulus bill requires certain recipients of stimulus funds to \nreport the number of jobs they have created or saved or, more \naccurately, they report the number of jobs funded with the stimulus \ndollars.\n  The stimulus bill also requires the Congressional Budget Office to \nissue a quarterly report on these numbers. The Congressional Budget \nOffice is careful to point out that the number of jobs being reported \nby stimulus recipients is not a comprehensive estimate of the economic \nimpact of the stimulus bill. According to the Congressional Budget \nOffice, the actual numbers could be higher or lower.\n  According to CBO ``estimating the law's overall effects on employment \nrequires a more comprehensive analysis than the recipients' reports \nprovide.''\n  For this analysis, CBO relies on a computer model. In other words, \nCBO does not look at the actual jobs data. Instead, it looks at a model \nof the economy.\n  CBO is very upfront about all of this. CBO used a computer model to \npredict how many jobs the stimulus bill would create before it was \nenacted into law. Now the stimulus bill is, in fact, law, and CBO is \nusing a computer model to tell us it did just what they said it would \ndo--create jobs.\n  Why would CBO rely on a model instead of actual data? According to \nCBO--and I have a three- or four-sentence quote here:\n\n       Data on actual output and employment are not as helpful in \n     determining the stimulus bill's economic effects because \n     isolating those effects would require knowing what path the \n     economy would have taken in the absence of the law. Because \n     that path cannot be observed, there is no way to be certain \n     about how the economy would have performed if the legislation \n     had not been enacted.\n\n  My judgment is that CBO is saying this: CBO doesn't know how much \nbetter or worse the economy would have been if the stimulus bill had \nnot been enacted. That means the Congressional Budget Office also \ndoesn't know how much better or worse the economy is now as a result of \nthe stimulus bill. So basically CBO is saying: Trust us--or more \nspecifically: Trust our model. But if the model was wrong to begin \nwith, then wouldn't it still be wrong? According to the Congressional \nBudget Office, their model relies on historical relationships to \ndetermine estimated multipliers for each of several categories of \nspending and tax provisions in the stimulus bill. The problem is that \nthere is no way to know whether these historical relationships remain \nconstant over time or whether they change under different economic \ncircumstances.\n  In short, the jobs numbers attributed to the stimulus bill are based \non assumptions which may or may not have any basis in reality.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, George Santayana wrote:\n\n       Those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat \n     it.\n\n  Today, we must remember the past. We must learn from past mistakes, \nand we must do our best to avoid repeating them.\n  In its response to the Great Depression of the 1930s, the Federal \nGovernment made a serious mistake. It is important to remember this \npast so we are not condemned to repeat it. The stock market crashed in \n1929. By 1933, the unemployment rate reached a high of 25 percent. A \nfew years later--4 years later, to be precise--in 1937, the economy was \nrebounding. The unemployment rate had fallen to 14 percent, gross \ndomestic product was growing at an average rate, if you can believe it, \nof 9 percent a year, and the stock market had more than doubled over \nthe past 4 years. That was 1937. The economy was on the road to \nrecovery. But this exceptional economic growth did not just happen. It \nresulted from strong actions by the Federal Government. From 1933 to \n1937, for example, the United States dramatically increased the money \nsupply. Lower interest rates and greater credit availability helped to \nstimulate spending and economic growth. New Deal programs also helped. \nSpending was modest but significant compared to the magnitude of the \nGreat Depression. But the response provided a notable boost to the \neconomy, and it helped instill confidence in the Federal Government's \nability to tackle the Depression.\n  But in 1937, after 4 years of growth, the government made a mistake. \nConcerned about short-term deficits, what did it do? It began to cut \nspending and it began to raise taxes. A bonus for World War I veterans, \nwhich provided a boost in consumer spending, was allowed to expire in \n1937. Social security taxes were collected for the first time in 1937. \nAnd marginal tax rates increased dramatically. What happened? This \npremature attempt to reduce deficits pushed the economy back over the \nedge. It was premature. The jobless rate shot back up to 19 percent. In \n1938, gross domestic product fell by 3 percent. Shortsighted policy \ndecisions\n\n[[Page S4915]]\n\ncaused a double-dip. The mistaken desire to balance the budget too \nquickly effectively lengthened the Great Depression by 2 more years.\n  I understand the desire today to reduce deficits. I share that \ndesire. We do need to put in place deficit reduction that will take \neffect after the recovery has kicked in. But we must also learn from \nthe 1937 history. We must not repeat the mistake that led to the \ndouble-dip downturn of the late 1930s. If we were to dramatically cut \nspending or increase taxes to reduce the deficit in the short run, it \nwould run the risk of causing a double-dip in this great recession.\n  Today, the economy remains too fragile to begin cutting back. \nUnemployment stands at 9.7 percent. The May jobs report was \ndisappointing. The private sector created only 41,000 new jobs. In \ntotal, 15 million Americans still remain out of work, and half those \nunemployed have been unemployed for more than 6 months. Gross domestic \nproduct grew 3 percent in the first quarter of 2010, but this was down \nfrom 5.6 percent in the fourth quarter of 2009.\n  Just as in 1937, we are in a recovery period. That is true. And just \nas in 1937, it is a recovery that is showing signs of weakness. If we \nact recklessly today, we risk a double-dip recession. If we adopt a \nconstrictive fiscal policy in the short run, we risk prolonging the \ngreat recession for years to come. We cannot act without regard to the \nconsequences of our actions.\n  Make no mistake, we must tackle and should tackle our long-term \ndeficits. That is clear. And that is why one of the goals of the \nPresident's Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform is to \n``achieve fiscal sustainability over the long run.'' We do need to act \naggressively to reduce our long-term deficits as the economy enters a \nphase of expansion. But first we must pull ourselves out of this great \nrecession.\n  One of the best things we can do to facilitate the delicate recovery \nis to pass the American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act before us \ntoday. This bill extends tax cuts for families and businesses that will \nhelp them in these difficult times, and this bill sustains vital social \nsafety net programs that will also help foster economic growth.\n  We have made the mistake of cutting back too soon once before, and we \nmust not make it again. The Thune amendment, which will be before us in \nthe not to distant future this week, will move in the wrong direction. \nInstead of helping to create economic demand, the Thune amendment would \ncurtail aggregate demand by more than $50 billion. Instead of \ncontinuing the good the Recovery Act has done, the Thune amendment \nwould chop it off.\n  The Thune amendment would, among other things, cancel unspent and \nunallocated mandatory spending in the Recovery Act--stop it. That \nspending is working. The Recovery Act is working. The Federal Reserve \nand many independent economists have credited the Recovery Act with \nplaying an important role in stabilizing the economy.\n\n  This is what the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said in its \nmost recent report:\n\n       CBO estimates that in the first quarter of calendar year \n     2010, [the Recovery Act's] policies raised the level of real \n     . . . gross domestic product . . . by between 1.7 percent and \n     4.2 percent, lowered the unemployment rate by between 0.7 \n     percentage points and 1.5 percentage points, increased the \n     number of people employed by between 1.2 million and 2.8 \n     million, and increased the number of full-time equivalent \n     jobs by 1.8 million to 4.1 million compared with what those \n     amounts would have been otherwise.\n\n  That is what CBO says about the recovery. And the Congressional \nBudget Office projects that the Recovery Act will continue to create \njobs. It projects that the Recovery Act will create the peak number of \njobs in the third quarter of this year and then begin to taper off. But \nwe do not want to abruptly cut that job creation off. In this fragile \neconomy, the last thing we should do is to cut back on this proven job \ncreator. It works. It has been working.\n  We passed the Recovery Act to give a needed boost to our economy. The \nbill was designed to work over 2 years. That was the intent of it. We \nhave successfully started down the road to recovery, but if we were to \nwithdraw these critical funds, we would risk causing further damage to \nour fragile economy. Revoking the Recovery Act funds now would send \nexactly the wrong signal to the American economy and to unemployed \nAmericans.\n  The Thune amendment would also cut other valuable spending programs. \nThe Thune amendment's spending cuts are arbitrary and they are \nrestrictive. For example, one provision in the Thune substitute \namendment would freeze the salaries of all Federal employees except for \nMembers of the armed services. But what about civilian defense workers? \nWhat about law enforcement? What about border protection?\n  Another provision would cap the total number of Federal employees at \ncurrent levels. If an agency needed to hire a new employee, it would \nfirst need to find an existing employee to fire. This would \ndramatically reduce the flexibility of agencies to make hiring \ndecisions.\n  The Thune substitute amendment would also cut discretionary spending \nby 5 percent across the board for all agencies except the Department of \nVeterans Affairs and the Department of Defense. Apparently, this 5-\npercent cut would apply to the Department of Homeland Security. It \nwould apply to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Apparently, it \nwould apply to all the intelligence agencies, just to name a few.\n  The Thune amendment would also, by the way, rescind $80 billion in \nappropriated but unspent Federal funds. But just because the funds have \nnot yet been obligated does not mean they are superfluous. For example, \nwhen money is appropriated to build a battleship, it does not all get \nobligated in the first year. By cutting funds that have not yet been \nobligated, it would adversely affect the construction of that \nbattleship.\n  I support finding ways to make our government more efficient, but \nthese cuts are arbitrary. They are inappropriately restrictive.\n  The Thune amendment would also make changes to the new health care \nlaw that would leave more Americans without insurance. The Thune \namendment does this by expanding the affordability exception to the \nindividual mandate for purchasing health insurance. This expansion \nwould eliminate coverage for millions of Americans. It would strike at \nthe heart of health care reform. And the Congressional Budget Office \ntells us it would also increase premiums for everybody else.\n  The Thune amendment, just to repeat, would increase premiums for \nmillions of Americans who would have health insurance. The irony of \nthis proposal in the Thune amendment is that it raises money for the \ngovernment because the government would not provide as much in tax \ncredits to Americans to help them buy insurance. That is the irony. But \nCongress has just enacted health care reform. Congress just expressed \nour Nation's commitment to helping all Americans to buy health \ninsurance. We should let the new health care law take effect.\n  The Thune amendment would also propose changes to our medical \nliability system that the Senate has rejected many times over the \nyears. The Thune amendment would cap damages and make other changes to \nState laws. This is not the solution to medical malpractice.\n  While the Congressional Budget Office says these kinds of ideas would \ngenerate savings, we should ask: What is the cost of those savings? \nWhat would be the cost to patients? What would be the cost to States?\n  The same studies upon which CBO relied in calculating its cost \nestimate point out that certain tort reform policies may also increase \nthe number of risky procedures performed. And these policies may lead \nto more patient injuries and more patient deaths.\n  One study upon which CBO relied said that these policies would lead \nto a 0.2-percent increase in mortality.\n  That sounds an awfully high price to pay.\n  Imposing national tort reform standards flies in the face of our \nNation's civil liability system. That system has always been forged at \nthe State level. And national damage caps would put patient safety at \nrisk.\n  The Thune amendment employs some of the offsets that it does because \nit drops the oilspill liability tax. Imagine that: The proponents of \nthe Thune\n\n[[Page S4916]]\n\namendment would rather put the recovery at risk by cutting back the \nRecovery Act, they would rather cut health insurance coverage in health \nreform, and they would rather expose patients to greater risk. They \nwould rather do all these things than raise taxes on big oil, to pay \nfor oilspills.\n  And the Thune amendment employs some of the offsets that it does, \nbecause it drops some of the tax loophole closers in the underlying \nsubstitute amendment. The underlying substitute amendment closes \nloopholes in the Tax Code that unfairly benefit certain individuals.\n  One such loophole is carried interest. The underlying substitute \nremoves an inequity of the Tax Code that allows investment managers who \noperate through partnerships to have the income that they earn for \ntheir services taxed at half the tax rate of other working individuals.\n  Here's how the carried interest tax loophole works. An investment \nmanager joins a partnership with some investors. But the investment \nmanager does not provide any capital. The investment manager provides \nservices.\n  The investment manager contracts to receive compensation not in the \nform of wage income, but in the form of a share of the partnership. \nThat way, the investment manager gets to pay lower capital gains tax \nrates on the investment manager's income, rather than the higher wage \ntax rates that the rest of Americans pay.\n  The underlying substitute says: No longer should we allow investment \nmanagers to have a better tax rate than teachers or doctors or \nfirefighters. Our amendment plugs this tax loophole. But the Thune \namendment would strike that provision. The Thune amendment would allow \nthat tax loophole to continue.\n  The underlying substitute also includes an important provision that \ncloses another serious inequity in the Tax Code.\n  Lawyers, doctors, and other professionals who operate as partners or \nsole proprietors are currently subject to Social Security taxes on \ntheir service income up to $106,800. And they are subject to Medicare \ntaxes on all their service income. Everybody is. But some doctors and \nlawyers organize themselves as an S corporation and they can pay \nthemselves an artificially low salary. That way, they can avoid paying \nSocial Security or Medicare taxes on much of the income generated by \ntheir services. That is just not fair.\n  And what is more, it hurts the Social Security and Medicare trust \nfunds.\n  The choice of entity should not affect an individual's tax liability \nfor his or her services.\n  Unfortunately, Senator Thune's amendment does not close this \nloophole. The Thune amendment would strike this loophole closer in the \nunderlying substitute.\n  The underlying substitute would also close several foreign tax \nloopholes.\n  The Senate Finance Committee developed these loophole closers jointly \nwith the House Ways and Means Committee, with the assistance of the \nTreasury Department.\n  These loophole-closers would shut down highly structured and complex \ntransactions implemented by multinational corporations to avoid paying \nU.S. tax.\n  These tax benefits claimed by the multinational corporations were \nclearly not contemplated when Congress passed the tax law.\n  Closing these loopholes would preserve and create jobs here in \nAmerica. Closing these loopholes would discourage U.S. multinational \ncorporations from shipping American jobs overseas.\n  Permitting the continued exploitation of these loopholes would only \nencourage U.S. multinationals to invest additional capital overseas, \nrather than here in America. Allowing these loopholes to continue would \nresult in the loss of American jobs.\n  The underlying substitute amendment tackles these loopholes. Senator \nThune's amendment, on the other hand, ignores them. By not addressing \nthem, the Thune amendment would allow this irresponsibility to \ncontinue.\n  And so, the Thune amendment would put the recovery at risk by \ncurtailing the Recovery Act. It would cut the number of Americans with \nhealth insurance and raise premiums. It would nationalize medical \nmalpractice law, putting patients at risk. And it would protect big oil \nand multinational corporations that ship their jobs overseas.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Thune amendment.\n  And I urge my colleagues to support the bill before us. Let us \nprotect and strengthen this fragile economic recovery. Let us preserve \nand create jobs, here in America. And let us enact the American Jobs \nand Closing Tax Loopholes Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I know Senator Thune will be here in a \nmoment. I saw him just a while ago.\n  One of the things hurting our economy is that Congress is sending no \nmessage whatsoever that we are serious about reducing the \nuncontrollable debt that every economist says is unsustainable, and \nthat this is a cloud over our economic recovery. The sooner we quit \nthinking we can make the economy rebound by just spending a few more \nbillion dollars and increasing our debt, the better off we will be and \nwe will get on a sound track to go forward.\n  I know good people can disagree, but I believe very strongly in this, \nand I just wanted to share that thought.\n\n\n                          Oilspill in Alabama\n\n  I would like to make a few brief comments about the oilspill in the \nGulf of Mexico, and my home State of Alabama. I was there Friday and \nvisited Orange Beach, Gulf Shores, Dauphin Island, and Bayou La Batre, \nexamined the beaches and talked with our good mayors and other \nofficials who are there. There are a few things I would like to share \nthat indicate we are not where we need to be.\n  I have not been one who wants to run out and blame the President for \neverything. But I do believe as we are now going into day 57 that we \nneed to understand our response is not working well. It could be much \nbetter.\n  For example, I visited Mayor Tony Kennon and his team in Orange \nBeach. Perdido Pass has a very strong current. You would think you \ncould put up boom and stop oil from coming in. They told us oil was out \nthere. They were expecting it to come in, maybe the biggest amount they \nhad expected since the beginning of the spill. It was expected to hit \nthe coast this past Saturday or Sunday, and it did indeed hit. The city \nis developing their own plan with their own engineer about how to deal \nwith the currents and the flow of oil to keep it out of the estuaries \nthat are inside of Perdido Pass.\n  It is complicated. They had a top engineer, Henry Seawell, one of \nAlabama's best. He was there working on it. I just happen to know him. \nBut the Coast Guard was not there; BP was not there. The mayor said:\n\n       You know, we feel like we are not even at the table, we are \n     not at the children's table. They are not talking to us. But \n     we know more about how to deal with this pass than anybody \n     else in the U.S. Government because we have been working on \n     it, it is our area, and we are trying to protect it.\n\n  Sure enough, the oil came. We were behind schedule. They started \nlate. Nobody had done anything until the city started, apparently a \ngood bit of oil got in and that is not good. It also got on the beach. \nWe can clean that up pretty quickly, however a lot hit the beach.\n  Then a little further down the beach, at Gulf Shores, we had a \nsimilar discussion. I went to Fort Morgan, across the mouth of the \nMobile Bay where Admiral Farragut sailed in, and we went across to \nDauphin Island. The mayor there, Jeff Collier, had some of the same \nconcerns as Mayor Robert Craft in Gulf Shores. Then I went up and met \nwith Mayor Stan Wright, the mayor of Bayou La Batre, himself a seafood \nprocessor. He noted to me, and has repeatedly stated, that Bayou La \nBatre probably represents the largest seafood processing on the entire \ngulf coast. They are basically being shut down, and a lot of people who \nwork there are losing their jobs. They are low-income workers who do \nnot have extra money to live on, and they are hurting, really hurting. \nIf we are going to receive money from BP, they need to get it out there \nto the people right now, before they lose their homes or have their \npower cut off. The mayor told me how people are calling him about their \nelectricity being cut off. It is not a little matter. The whole \nsituation is a big deal.\n  I am glad the President has gone to the gulf coast. I am hopeful \ntonight we\n\n[[Page S4917]]\n\nwill hear some good ideas for progress. I just wanted to share one \nthing that struck me very vividly. Mayor Kennon's team in Orange Beach \ntold us they had seen a strip of compact oil from the air and a boat \nabout 6 miles offshore. It had the red color, thick process--a strip \nabout 30 miles wide and 2 miles long. This was Friday morning. It was \nexpected to hit Friday night or early Saturday morning. Nobody knew for \nsure. But it had been out there for a number of days.\n  So we are asking, Why don't we put a skimmer there? This is the only \nthing coming in that threatens the beaches. Apparently there were two \nstrips of this offshore at some distance. It represents a significant \nthreat. You could see that threat getting closer and closer. The \nobvious thought--Mr. President, having been from Alaska, you know the \nimportance of these matters--if you had a good skimmer--where two boats \npull the boom and direct the oil into a central location, then you can \nget it out and put it in a barge or tanker.\n  There was not any. It would have been rather easy, I suggest, with a \ngood skimmer, to have gone out, with plenty of time to scoop up almost \nall of that oil or at least a big portion of it. That was not done. It \nkept coming in, and coming in, and basically by Saturday it was hitting \nthe beaches.\n  You ask, where are they? We are not talking with one another enough, \nit seems to me. It does appear there are more skimmers, more boom, more \nvessels, equipment, and pumps available around the world that could be \ncalled on to assist, and we have not accepted all offers of assistance. \nNor have we, apparently, sought to lease, buy or purchase the boom, \npumps, and skimmers that might help us.\n  I was just looking at a press release today that stated, Admiral \nAllen, the national incident commander, Provides Guidance to Ensure \nExpedited Jones Act Waiver Processing Should It Be Needed.''\n  He says he will process any requests for waivers of the Jones Act.\n  For some reason the admiral is still talking about waivers and \noffering to expedite them. Who is requesting them? Why doesn't he \nrequest it? If there is a ship that can skim, it can be brought down to \nthe gulf coast, and it would make a big difference. In fact, I saw the \nadmiral, I believe, the day before yesterday on the television say we \nneed to do a better job. This would have been Monday. We need to do a \nbetter job of intercepting the oil between the spill site and the \nshore.\n  Good. I thought it might be harder to do. I thought it might be \nlittle splotches here and there, all over, and it would be impossible \nto scoop it all up. But if it is moving, and it tends to move in lines \nand fairly compact 30-foot strips, then with good equipment we can make \na big dent and just stop it.\n  So I don't know what the problem is. But we do know 17 countries have \noffered to help, however we only have two skimmers, as I understand it, \nin the gulf, and those are from Mexico--which we are glad to have. \nPumps have been offered. I do not believe we have taken advantage of \nthat. It takes some pretty good pumping equipment to get this oil \nsoaked up, and only 600,000 feet of boom have been received from \nabroad. The UK has also offered us dispersants, which we have not \ntaken.\n  I don't know what all the details are, but it seems to me that we can \nand must do a better job of coordinating. We need to ensure people who \nneed resources are paid now, and we need to understand that there is \ngreat potential for effective skimming to occur where the oil has \nformulated and configured in groups so it can be skimmed. That \napparently is more feasible than a lot of people understand. We need to \nbe focusing on that.\n  The people along the gulf coast are upset about it. One mayor told \nme: I am a man of good judgment. I am worried about BP's slow response. \nThey talk about responding. They talk about paying, but not enough \npayment is actually getting out where we have clear cases of \nsubstantial losses. Of course, the economy is not where it has been and \nwhere we need to see it develop. The beach areas probably wouldn't have \nbeen as strong this year as previous years because of the economic \ndownturn. But the testimony from people at public meetings I have \nattended is crystal clear that we have almost a 50-percent drop in \nreservations, a 50-percent drop in bookings, and this ripples through \nthe entire community. We already have real estate problems. We already \nhave a little decline in beach attendance. Now we have all this \nhorrible news on the TV and large amounts of cancellations. Some people \ndo need money now. This process needs to be accelerated, and I hope we \nwill hear something in some of what the President tells us tonight. I \nthink he has heard that. He has been down to the gulf coast. He has \ntalked to people. He probably has a better understanding today, after \nwe are 2 months into it, than he previously had.\n  Maybe we can make this system work a little better. I don't only want \nto complain. I am thankful the President is showing attention. I am \nthankful he has stepped out and is showing some leadership. But for \nsome reason, there still seems to be a lack of connection between the \ntalk up at the top and what is happening on the ground. I have been \nthere. I have talked to people. People are not getting money. People \nare in serious crisis already, people who would be entitled to receive \nmoneys. I don't think BP should pay out money fraudulently. They don't \nneed to pay those who don't deserve it. They ought to be careful in how \nthey handle these payments. But for the most part, people are making \nlegitimate claims. Some of them are desperate now. I don't think we \nhave a unified effective plan to intercept as much of the oil as we \ncould offshore. Nor have we had the kind of support from the Federal \nGovernment we would like to see, with scientifically determined \nprocesses, placing boom and skimming equipment to stop the flow of the \noil, particularly into our estuaries, including Mobile Bay.\n  Mobile Bay is not that wide of an opening. People thought we could \nstop it. You could put boom across and stop it. The truth is, with the \ntides, it is a strong current. Anchors won't hold it. When water moves \nin, it will go over or under or even break the boom. It is not an easy \nthing. We need some sort of Chevron-like layers of boom outside the \nentrance to try to catch as much as we can before it comes in. A \nlittle, but I don't think enough, effort has been made. In fact, we now \nhad a significant amount of oil that have gotten into that great \nestuary.\n  I wanted to share those thoughts. I believe we can do better. I \nbelieve oil production in the gulf is essential for the national \ninterest. I believe this spill, this accident should not have happened. \nI believe if people had been exceedingly careful and competent in what \nthey did, this would not have happened. I believe after this accident, \nthere is going to be a complete review by every company out there. I \nthink we will have an even lower possibility of accidents in the \nfuture. But we need more confidence that blowout preventers work, and \nthat we have safety mechanisms in place. We need more confidence that \nthis will happen. We need to understand there is always a possibility \nthat some sort of blowout or spill will occur, but we can do better to \nprevent it. We can do better about plugging the leak or capturing the \noil where it comes out of the pipe. I believe all of these are \npossible.\n  I am not happy. I am disappointed that we weren't better prepared in \ncase such an accident did occur. Very disappointed. I believe the oil \nindustry, in particular BP's plan, as the Mobile Press Register has \npointed out, was not well thought out. Their plan talked about what to \ndo with walruses and things such as that. We don't have any walruses on \nthe gulf coast. This was not a well thought out plan. Criticism is \njustified in many different areas.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to share my thoughts. Again, I \nappreciate the President visiting the gulf coast. Hopefully, they are \nbreaking down some of these dysfunctional areas to get us to a higher \nlevel of response and effectiveness, and maybe they will also be able \nto continue to make progress in reducing the amount of flow coming out \nof this well. Obviously, that is the most critical point.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The clerk will call the \nroll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4918]]\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, the tax extenders bill includes a \nsettlement that involves a class action lawsuit that is known as Cobell \nv. Salazar. The total cost of this settlement is about $3.4 billion. \nThis settlement will affect hundreds of thousands of Indian people \nacross the United States who are class members in this lawsuit. It was \nsigned last December by the Obama administration with the lead \nplaintiffs and their attorneys. Part of the settlement provides $1.4 \nbillion to individual Indians whose trust assets have been mismanaged \nby the Federal Government for over 100 years. Another $2 billion would \nbe used by the Department of the Interior to consolidate Indian land \nownership to prevent a repeat of these claims.\n  On Wednesday, June 9, 2010, Attorney General Holder and Secretary \nSalazar sent letters to the Senate leaders opposing an amendment I \nfiled on Tuesday, June 8. My amendment corrects serious flaws in the \nsettlement. I am going to respond to their letter as well as explain my \namendment.\n  The Attorney General and the Secretary argue that the amendment makes \nmaterial changes to the settlement that would render it void. To begin \nwith, I must point out that the parties have changed their settlement \nin material ways several times--several times--since it was announced \nthat the agreement had been reached. Whenever they deem fit, they \nchange it. For the reasons I am about to go into, they should change it \nagain. If they don't, then Congress should act.\n  In their letter to leadership, the Attorney General and Secretary \nSalazar say:\n\n       The nature of any settlement agreement is that no one gets \n     everything they asked for.\n\n  I know the Cobell case has waged on and on in the courts for 14 \nyears. It has been up and down on appeal many times--too many times. In \nfact, it is on appeal right now. So I support settling this case. I \nsupport providing fair compensation to people harmed by decades of \nFederal mismanagement. I support consolidating the fractionated \nownership of land to prevent the recurrence of problems that led to \nthis court case. But I cannot support the settlement as drafted by the \nadministration. It has flaws, and I believe some of them are very \nserious. All of them can and should be fixed without making major \nchanges to its overall structure. Leaders in Indian country agree.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a letter dated June 11, 2010, from the \nNational Congress of American Indians to Senator Dorgan and to me be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, the National Congress of American \nIndians' letter states that the changes in my amendment address \nlegitimate concerns that have been raised by tribal leaders and Indian \npeople. The NCAI letter references resolutions passed by the Affiliated \nTribes of Northwest Indians and the Great Plains Tribal Chairmen's \nAssociation supporting my amendment.\n  So what does my amendment do? It addresses five significant \nweaknesses in the settlement. The first issue is attorneys fees. This \nsettlement was signed by the Department of Justice and two of the \nplaintiffs on December 7, 2009. Originally, the settlement said that \nCongress had to approve it in 24 days--by New Year's Eve. Well, \nsupporters said there was no time for a hearing; Congress had to act \nimmediately. I disagreed. Any $3.4 billion settlement paid for by \ntaxpayers that affects the lives of hundreds of thousands of people \nshould have a hearing before Congress.\n  I requested that the Committee on Indian Affairs hold a hearing on \nthe settlement. Chairman Dorgan scheduled one nearly 6 months ago and \nthat hearing was December 17, 2009. During the hearing, it was \ndisclosed that the parties had entered into a separate agreement \ncovering attorneys fees. In the side agreement, the plaintiffs' lawyers \nagreed not to ask the court for more than $99.9 million in \npresettlement attorneys' fees and costs, and the administration agreed \nnot to argue that the attorneys should get anything less than $50 \nmillion. So, in effect, the two parties quietly agreed that the \nplaintiffs' attorneys should be paid between $50 million and $100 \nmillion.\n  This separate agreement also provided that when attorneys asked the \ncourt for presettlement fees, the attorneys must provide \ncontemporaneous time records, but they said only ``where available.'' \nThis is a very remarkable agreement, especially for a court case that \nwas pretty much all about inadequate government recordkeeping in the \nfirst place.\n  What the government has done is agreed not to demand \ncontemporaneously prepared time records when the attorneys ask the \ncourt for their fees--fees that will be taken directly out of the funds \nthat are supposed to be distributed to the class members in the suit. \nThis settlement should be about compensating the individual Indians who \nwere harmed by government mismanagement. My amendment requires \nproduction of contemporaneous records and it caps the fees at $50 \nmillion. Fifty million dollars is an amount that both parties agreed \nwould not be appealed. It is their number, so it must be fair.\n  Besides the issue of attorneys fees, there have been other concerns \nraised about the settlement--about the possibility of a multimillion \ndollar incentive award to named plaintiffs; about the qualification of \nthe bank where the money will be deposited; about the role of Indian \ntribes and the land consolidation aspect of the settlement; and about \nthe formula for distributing the money. My amendment addresses each of \nthese issues.\n  The amendment would also require that any ``incentive awards'' to \nnamed plaintiffs be justified by documented expenses. Leading the case \nof Indian landowners against the government for 14 years has \nundoubtedly been an exhausting burden and an expensive burden. The \nnamed plaintiffs should be allowed to ask the court to have those \nexpenses reimbursed. My amendment would limit any such award to an \naggregate amount of $15 million and only for the expenses incurred by \nthe class representatives. This is the amount the plaintiffs told us is \ntheir total estimated out-of-pocket expenses. The amendment would allow \nfull reimbursement of these expenses.\n  My amendment also addresses the selection of the bank that will hold \nthe $1.4 billion in settlement funds. The settlement is especially lax \nin setting standards to ensure the safety of these funds--lax, I \nbelieve, to the point of being irresponsible. My amendment simply \nrequires the court to consider certain factors when approving a \nproposed bank: experience, a history of regulatory compliance, plus \ncompetitive interest rates and fees. These factors are important \nbecause if anything happens to the money, then the class members bear \nthe risk of the loss. I cannot fathom why asking the court to simply \nconsider these commonsense protections will void the settlement.\n  The amendment I have offered will require the Secretary of the \nInterior to consult with Indian tribes on implementation of the Indian \nland consolidation program. In order for this $2 billion consolidation \nprogram to succeed, the tribal governments should be partners in \nimplementation. The amendment would require that to happen.\n  Finally, my amendment would provide relief for certain class members \nfor whom the pro rata formula used in the settlement does not work. \nThis formula is simple and will be easy to use. That is why the \nadministration likes it. In many cases, the formula won't work and will \nlead to unfair results. It is necessary that we create a system for \nindividual class members with unique circumstances to petition the \ncourt for a nonstandard settlement payment.\n  Under my amendment, the court would be provided with broad \nflexibility to make discretionary awards in appropriate cases.\n  In closing, I urge Members of the Senate to support this amendment to \nthe Cobell settlement provisions in this measure. My amendment doesn't \nchange the structure of the settlement. It does improve, however, the \nagreement for the hundreds of thousands of class members covered by the \nsettlement.\n  What my amendment doesn't do is void the agreement. Let me repeat, my\n\n[[Page S4919]]\n\namendment does not void the agreement; it does not void the settlement. \nPlaintiffs have the ability to void the settlement if they don't \nbelieve the changes are in the best interests of the class members. The \nadministration can void it if they don't believe there should be \nfinancial standards for selection of the bank that will hold and manage \n$1.4 billion of settlement funds. By passing this amendment, we will \nnot void the agreement.\n  Congress has the obligation to never rubberstamp an agreement and to \nnot rubberstamp this agreement.\n  Adopting my amendment is the right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                                                 National Congress\n\n\n                                          of American Indians,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 11, 2010.\n     Re Cobell Settlement and Senator Barrasso's Amendment 4313 to \n         the American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act of 2010.\n\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     Chair, Committee on Indian Affairs, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. John Barrasso,\n     Vice Chair, Committee on Indian Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dorgan and Vice Chairman Barrasso: As you \n     know, a very important vote may soon occur in the Senate. \n     Currently the Senate is considering H.R. 4213, the American \n     Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act of 2010. For Indian people \n     across the country the most important provision in the \n     legislation is Section 607, which would authorize the \n     settlement of the Cobell v. Salazar litigation over federal \n     mismanagement of Indian trust funds. Senator Barrasso has \n     proposed an amendment that would address some concerns about \n     the settlement that have been raised by tribal leaders and \n     Indian people. These are legitimate concerns that have come \n     from the grassroots in Indian country, and it is our hope \n     that the parties and the Senate try to find common ground on \n     these concerns.\n       The National Congress of American Indians has long \n     supported a settlement of this litigation because it is time \n     to bring justice to Indian people and because the contentious \n     litigation has distracted from efforts to address the many \n     other issues that Indian country faces. When the settlement \n     was first announced in December of 2009, there was a general \n     feeling of elation and relief throughout Indian country. We \n     are extremely grateful to the Administration and to Eloise \n     Cobell and her team for working so hard on this settlement \n     and bringing it to the brink of resolution.\n       However, we also believe that Ms. Cobell described it well \n     when she said that this is a ``bittersweet victory'' for \n     Indian country. There is no doubt that the injuries to Indian \n     people have been much greater than the compensation they will \n     receive. In addition, over the past several months, Indian \n     tribes and Indian people have had an opportunity to more \n     closely examine the details of the settlement. Hearings have \n     been held in Congress, and meetings have taken place on \n     reservations across the country. As might be expected with a \n     class action settlement of this size and complexity, the \n     details have generated considerable discussion and some \n     disagreements.\n       Senator Barrasso has solicited the views of tribal leaders \n     on the details of the settlement and has filed a proposed \n     amendment. The Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians and the \n     Great Plains Tribal Chairman's Association, two large and \n     well respected regional tribal organizations, have both \n     passed resolutions favoring Senator Barrasso's amendment. A \n     similar resolution has been submitted to NCAI for \n     consideration during our Midyear Session during the week of \n     June 20. However, NCAI's consideration of the resolution may \n     happen after Congress has voted.\n       As you know, both the Administration and the Cobell \n     plaintiffs have raised concerns that any amendments to the \n     Cobell settlement legislation would render the settlement \n     null and void. We understand the need for the parties to a \n     difficult settlement to adopt this posture. However, we have \n     little doubt that if Congress were to make modest and \n     reasonable adjustments, the parties will readily amend the \n     settlement agreement to conform to the implementing \n     legislation.\n       NCAI's interest is that Congress passes a settlement that \n     is responsive to legitimate concerns raised by tribal leaders \n     and members of the class, and that a contested floor vote on \n     these issues may not be conducive to our shared goal of \n     settling the litigation. I will briefly address the elements \n     of Senator Barrasso's amendment. Amendment 4313 would:\n       1. Cap attorneys' fees at $50 million and incentive awards \n     at expenses up to $15 million. The settlement was accompanied \n     by a side agreement that the federal government would not \n     contest an award of attorney's fees in a range between $50 to \n     $100 million. These attorneys' fees have generated \n     considerable discussion. Most account holders will receive an \n     award in the range of $1500, which is less than what was \n     expected. Over the years, the Cobell plaintiffs have \n     frequently estimated the size of the damages in the hundreds \n     of billions, so disappointment at the size of the award has \n     combined with views about the size of the attorneys' fees. \n     This is a difficult issue because we also recognize that the \n     Cobell attorneys have worked very hard on the litigation for \n     the last 14 years, and class action attorneys in Indian law \n     cases should be fairly compensated on a par with similar \n     class actions. We suggest that the numbers are not far apart, \n     and an accommodation could be reached.\n       2. Require that a special master select the bank that will \n     handle the $1.4 billion award. The settlement agreement \n     indicates that the award will be deposited in a bank selected \n     by the plaintiffs and approved by the court. Senator \n     Barrasso's amendment would require that court should consider \n     certain criteria for experience in the handling of large \n     deposits, compliance with banking laws, and competitiveness \n     of fees. This appears to be a reasonable provision to ensure \n     competent and efficient management of the funds.\n       3. Allow tribes to participate in the land consolidation \n     program that will occur on their reservations. NCAI strongly \n     supports Senator Barrasso's proposal to permit tribes to \n     participate in the land consolidation program that will be \n     funded by the settlement. Land consolidation is critical for \n     addressing trust management problems created by fractionation \n     and preventing future mismanagement. However, Indian tribes \n     have had concerns about the ability of the Bureau of Indian \n     Affairs to administer the land consolidation program on the \n     scale and in the timeframe required by the settlement. Since \n     1975, Indian tribes have been able to contract with the BIA \n     to manage BIA programs on their reservations. The Indian Land \n     Consolidation Program is one of the few programs that does \n     not allow tribal participation in this way. We believe that \n     allowing tribal governments to participate in land \n     consolidation will greatly benefit the program because tribes \n     have the greatest interest in its success, and because tribes \n     know the local conditions on their reservations much better \n     than a centrally-located BIA.\n       4. Set aside a $50 million fund for class members who may \n     not be fairly compensated by the formula distribution. The \n     inclusion of natural resource mismanagement claims within the \n     settlement has been controversial within Indian country \n     because it was not a part of the original Cobell claim, and \n     because the formula would be unfair to some landowners. \n     Although the resource mismanagement settlement allows an opt-\n     out, it would be extraordinarily difficult for Indian \n     landowners to pursue mismanagement claims on their own. \n     Senator Barrasso's amendment would set-aside $50 million out \n     of the settlement to make equitable adjustments for certain \n     landowners who would not be adequately compensated by the \n     formula. So long as it does not substantially slow down the \n     operation of the formula distribution, we believe it is \n     reasonable to set aside a small portion of the settlement to \n     smooth out some of the inequities of the formula system.\n       Thank you very much for considering our views on this \n     important issue. We greatly appreciate the enormous efforts \n     that all of you have put into resolving the Indian trust \n     funds litigation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jefferson Keel,\n                                                   NCAI President.\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Arthur S. Flemming Awards 2009\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Madam President, I rise today once again to recognize \nsome of our Nation's great Federal employees.\n  This week, the Trachtenberg School at the George Washington \nUniversity announced the winners of the annual Arthur S. Flemming \nAwards. These distinguished awards for public service have been \nbestowed upon outstanding Federal employees for the past 61 years. The \nFlemming Awards recognize career Federal employees, both civilian and \nmilitary, who have served between 3 and 15 years in government. \nNominees come from across the many departments, agencies, and service \nbranches. Notable winners include former Senators Elizabeth Dole and \nDaniel Patrick Moynihan, Defense Secretary Robert Gates, former Federal \nReserve Chairman Paul Volcker, astronaut Neil Armstrong, among others.\n  The awards are named for Arthur S. Flemming, who had a long and \nexemplary career in public service which spanned from 1939 until his \ndeath in 1996. He served in a number of important roles, including \nSecretary of Health, Education, and Welfare under President Eisenhower.\n\n[[Page S4920]]\n\n  Secretary Flemming also served on the U.S. Civil Service Commission \nunder Presidents Roosevelt and Truman, the National Advisory Committee \non the Peace Corps under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson, and as \nChairman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights under Presidents Nixon, \nFord, Carter, and Reagan. President Clinton awarded him the Medal of \nFreedom in 1994.\n  It is fitting that these awards, which were originally bestowed by \nthe DC Jaycees, are named for Flemming. His lifetime of dedication to \npublic service continues to inspire so many.\n  The Flemming Awards are divided into three categories: applied \nscience, engineering, and mathematics; basic science; and managerial or \nlegal achievement. These categories highlight some of the most \noutstanding and exciting accomplishments by our public servants who are \nhelping to lead the way in scientific discovery, efficient public \nmanagement, and upholding justice.\n  This year's medals in applied science, engineering, and mathematics \nwere won by a trio of brilliant individuals who are keeping America at \nthe forefront of STEM research.\n  Dr. Lynn Antonelli is leading the way in developing laser-based \nsensors for the Navy. The sensors she and her team created have found \ncommercial and medical applications, in addition to providing our Navy \nvessels with extended optics and sensing underwater.\n  Dr. Steven Brown of the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology--or NIST--also works with light. He and his team have made \ngreat strides in the field of light measurement that have enabled more \ndetailed environmental imaging of the Earth. His work is \nrevolutionizing the ability to detect minute changes in the environment \nas a result of climate change.\n  Also winning the applied science, engineering, and mathematics award \nis Dr. John Kitching. John has been leading the world's top research \nprogram in atomic measurement. He and his team developed ultra-\nminiature devices that can improve the accuracy of GPS, \ntelecommunications, and medical imaging. They even have important \nnational security uses, including in the more accurate detection of \nchemical toxins.\n  The three Federal employees who won this year's award for basic \nscience are pioneers on the cutting edge of science research.\n  Dr. Dietrich Leibfried is one of NIST's leading experts on quantum \ncomputing. This exciting field could lead to supercomputers faster and \nmore powerful than the best ones we have today. Dietrich Leibfried is \nresponsible for many innovations in quantum computing, including the \nsuccessful demonstration of a simple, fully programmable quantum \ncomputer, the first step in a long-term effort to build supercomputers \nthat can handle nationally important applications, such as weather \nprediction, secure data encryption, and developing new drugs.\n  The basic science award is also going to Dr. Shyam Sharan of the \nNational Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health. He has \ndeveloped a simple and reliable way to analyze genetic mutations that \nincrease a patient's chances of developing breast cancer. This will \nhelp doctors identify those who have the highest risk of cancer and \ntreat them preventively.\n  Sharing the award with them is Dr. Eite Tiesinga, who works at NIST \non ultra-cold atoms. By manipulating these atoms, scientists can \ncarefully tune the quantum gases that might one day power quantum \ncomputers. Eite is frequently asked by researchers around the world to \nconsult on their measurements and findings, and his work on ultra-cold \natoms has put the United States ahead in the race to achieve successful \nquantum computing.\n  Four outstanding public employees were chosen for this year's \nmanagerial and legal achievement medal.\n  Angela Clowers works at the Government Accountability Office, and she \nled the GAO's efforts to audit transportation investments made under \nthe Recovery Act. Her careful analysis and testimony before Congress \nprompted the Department of Transportation to refocus some of its \ninvestments in order to stimulate additional job growth. Angela also \nled the GAO's audit of government assistance to the American auto \nindustry under TARP.\n  Another who won this award is Dr. Marla Dowell of NIST'S laboratory \nin Boulder, CO. Marla leads the world's most comprehensive research \nprogram in laser metrology. She won this award for outstanding \nmanagement skills and for leading a team that is developing lasers for \nhighly accurate measurement of manufacturing equipment. This will have \nprofound and positive effects on both defense programs and high-tech \nbusinesses.\n  Kana Enomoto won the award for a distinguished career working on \nmental health access. She served as a leader in this area in the \naftermath of Hurricane Katrina through her work at the Substance Abuse \nand Mental Health Services Administration. Kana also spearheaded \nefforts to improve the agency's operations, human resource management, \nand other critical functions as the Acting Deputy Administrator.\n  The fourth winner of this award is Natalie Harrop of the Air Force \nGlobal Logistics Center in Utah. Natalie distinguished herself as a \nlead budget analyst for the Air Force's 748th Supply Chain Management \nGroup. She revolutionized the group's financial management, and her new \nsystem is being implemented across the 448th Supply Chain Management \nWing. It is saving hundreds of work hours and over $5 million.\n  These 10 men and women are not an exception, they are exemplary. They \nrepresent the norm of excellence of our civil service. They have \nachieved great things and now join the ranks of those who share the \nArthur S. Flemming Award for their great contribution to our Nation.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in congratulating the winners of \nthe 2009 Arthur S. Flemming Awards and thanking them all for their \nservice. They are all truly great Federal employees.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BEGICH.

Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, this country has a $13 trillion national \ndebt and a record-breaking deficit, and it is time we began to address \nthat issue.\n  This country has the potential now to transform our energy system \naway from fossil fuel, away from offshore drilling into energy \nefficiency and sustainable energy, and when we do that, we create \nmillions of good-paying jobs over a period of years. That is what this \namendment does.\n  Over the last decade, the five \nlargest oil companies in America--\nExxonMobil, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, BP, and Shell--made over $750 \nbillion in profits. These profitable companies do not deserve to \ncontinue to have major tax breaks that in some cases not only prevent \nthem from paying anything in taxes but enable them to get huge tax \nrefunds from the IRS.\n  What the Sanders-Menendez-Whitehouse-Wyden-Lautenberg amendment would \ndo is eliminate three major loopholes. It would bring $35 billion into \nour coffers over a 10-year period. It would use $25 billion of those \n$35 billion for deficit reduction. It would use $10 billion to fund \nenergy conservation and sustainable energy and in the process create \nover 100,000 new jobs over a period of years.\n  It may make sense to somebody, but it does not make sense to me that \nwe have a company such as ExxonMobil, which has been the most \nprofitable company in the history of the world, making huge profits and \nlast year not only paying nothing in taxes but getting a refund from \nthe Treasury of $156 million. Let me repeat that. ExxonMobil, the most \nprofitable corporation in the history of the world--year after year, \nhuge profits--last year not only paid nothing in taxes but received a \n$156 million check from the taxpayers of this country to help them. \nThat is absurd.\n  ExxonMobil is not the only company to enjoy that kind of outrageous \ntax treatment. Chevron received a $19 million tax refund; Valero \nEnergy, a $157 million refund; and ConocoPhillips received over $450 \nmillion in tax breaks from the oil and gas manufacturing deduction over \nthe past 3 years.\n  I am going to yield the floor in a moment because I want to refute \nsome of what my friend from Oklahoma will be saying.\n  Here is what the bottom line is. The bottom line is we have a huge \ndeficit and huge tax breaks for profitable corporations. We have the \nopportunity now to do what President Obama put into his 2011 budget and \neliminate those tax breaks, bring $35 billion more into the Treasury--\n$25 billion for deficit reduction and $10 billion to create over \n100,000 new jobs as we make our country more energy efficient and we \nmove to sustainable energy.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. The Senator is yielding the remainder of is time?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I reserve the remainder of my time. I reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I thank my friend from Vermont. I know my friend from \nVermont would not intentionally say something that is not true. \nSometimes he does not have and sometimes I do not have the actual \nfacts, so inadvertently we might misrepresent.\n  Let me just say as far as Exxon is concerned that from 2004 to 2008, \nthey paid more than $18 billion in U.S. Federal income taxes, and that \nis just some of the taxes they pay.\n  I have to say this, though. The whole discussion on this--the Sanders \nbill would effectively put the small and the marginal producers in \nAmerica out of business. Before I go into that in any detail, let me \njust share this. It is interesting, when I listen to liberals talk \nabout doing away with drilling, with oil and gas and coal and nuclear--\nif you do that, you cannot run this machine called America. Every time \nthey talk about doing something to stop production, as they are doing \nright now in the gulf--a lot of these people are using and exploiting \nthe tragedy in the gulf to try to retard or stop all production in \nAmerica. Consequently, this is something where we would be in a \nposition where we would be so rationed in oil and gas that we would \nhave to be more dependent on many of these countries on which we do not \nwant to be dependent.\n  We did a study. I think this would surprise the Chair. If we didn't \nhave any political restrictions on what we could do in North America, \nwe could completely eliminate our reliance upon the Middle East for any \ngas or oil within 4 years. That is pretty shocking. Our problem is not \nthat we do not have enough oil and gas. We have more reserves than any \nother country. A CRS report came out with that just the other day.\n  What I want to do is give my honorable friend a chance to respond to \nmy statement, and then I will reserve the remainder of my time to \ndiscuss in a little more detail how this affects the very small, \nmarginal operators in America.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I will take just a few minutes now.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I will reserve the remainder of my time. But let me say \nthis to my friend from Oklahoma, who I know is an honest guy. We \ndisagree. We have differences of opinion. It was not my suggestion that \nExxonMobil did not pay taxes over those years. That was not my \nsuggestion. But let me say this. He mentioned that they do pay taxes, \nwhich is true. But let's understand that ExxonMobil was the most \nprofitable corporation in the history of the world from 2006 through \n2008, making $40 billion in profits in 2006, $41 billion in 2007, and \n$45 billion in 2008. In the midst of a recession, my understanding is \nthey made $19 billion in profits last year.\n  Would my friend from Oklahoma deny that despite making these huge \nprofits last year, $19 billion, they received--they paid zero in 2009 \nand in fact received a $156 million refund from the taxpayers of this \ncountry? I hope my friend from Oklahoma would comment on whether that \nis good public policy.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I would say first of all, whether that is \ngood policy--I think you have to have the accurate input before you \nmake a policy determination. The oil and gas industry is very \ncomplicated. In order for them to go out and risk their capital, they \nhave to plow this money back in. Frankly, most of it is plowed back \ninto exploration.\n  What I wanted to get across, which I think is important, is that the \nSanders\n\n[[Page S4923]]\n\namendment repeals three things--first of all, expensing for intangible \ndrilling costs; that is IDC. It repeals percentage depletion for \nmarginal oil and gas wells. It repeals the manufacturing deduction for \noil and gas.\n  I predicted a long time ago, when the gulf spill took place, that \npeople were going to try to parlay this into something to punish oil \nand gas. This is what they have been trying to do for a long time. It \ncould very well be that tonight, when the President makes his big \nspeech, he is going to talk about, now we are going to have to look at \ncap and trade, as if there is some relationship between what happened \nin the gulf and cap and trade.\n  Repealing expensing of intangible drilling costs eliminates the \nability to expense intangible drilling and development costs, which \nwould force at least a 25- to 30-percent reduction in drilling budgets, \nleading to lost jobs, lost production, and higher prices to consumers. \nOn the floor of the Senate yesterday, I spent some time talking about \nhow many jobs actually would be lost in the State of Louisiana. But the \nIDC is an expensing-out item that has been in our Tax Code since 1913. \nIt really only applies to the smaller operators, so they are the ones \nwho are singled out for oil and gas production.\n  Likewise, since 1926 small producers and millions of royalty owners \nhave had the option to utilize percentage depletion to both simplify \nand account for the decline in the value of minerals from a property. \nAs you know, they do deplete as you produce minerals.\n  Who is going to pay the most for this? I will share with you who pays \nfor this, but right now I will yield the floor and reserve the \nremainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Let me say to my friend from Oklahoma, who talked about \nthe oil companies plowing their money back into new wells, that the big \nfive oil companies spent $270 billion over the past decade buying back \ntheir own stock--about $100 billion more than they spent on oil \nexploration.\n  My friend from Oklahoma talks about jobs. That is obviously an \nimportant issue. I would concede there may be some job loss here, but \nit is matched by an investment in sustainable energy that will create \nfar more employment than the relatively small number of jobs that might \nbe lost.\n  I would mention Dr. Krueger, the Chief Economist at the Treasury \nDepartment. He has estimated that repealing these tax breaks would lead \nto a decline in employment in oil and gas production of less than one-\nhalf of 1 percent at most. That translates into the potential loss of \n1,650 jobs in the oil and gas industry. I do not mean to minimize that. \nOne job lost is one job too many. But on the other hand, in this bill \nwe put $10 billion into the Energy Efficiency and Conservation Block \nGrant Program, where the estimate is we can create 140,000 jobs over \nthe same period of time. On one hand, we might lose 1,600 jobs; on the \nother hand, we gain 140,000 jobs.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me mention one thing I want to make sure I get in \nhere before we run out of time. We went through this class warfare once \nback in 1980. We had Jimmy Carter as President of the United States. He \nhad the windfall profits tax. I am sure my friend from Vermont \nremembers that at that time. I remember it well. That is when they were \ngoing to have a windfall profits tax on the oil and gas industry. The \nresults of that:\n\n       The WPT reduced domestic production between 3 and 6 percent \n     and increased oil imports from 8 to 16 percent. . . . This \n     made the United States more dependent upon imported oil.\n\n  That is the Congressional Research Service, which is nonpartisan.\n  That is a major issue here in terms of our dependence on other \ncountries for our ability to run this machine called America.\n  Let's get back to the percentage depletion. The percentage depletion \nis particularly important for the production of America's over 600,000 \nlow-volume marginal wells. The average marginal well produces 2 barrels \na day.\n  Let me tell you what that is so my colleagues, when they get ready to \nvote, will really understand whom they are affecting. A marginal well \nis a well producing under 15 barrels per day. The average is 2 barrels \na day. My friend is talking about all these big giants. I am not nearly \nas concerned about the big five and the majors as I am about my \nmarginal operators in my State of Oklahoma. With an average of 2 \nbarrels a day, the marginal producers actually account for 28 percent \nof all domestic production in the lower 48 States--28 percent. These \nare all small people.\n  If you are concerned also about whom you are affecting by this \nlegislation, look at the royalty owners. There are literally millions \nof royalty owners. They have maybe a small piece of property, maybe \ntheir homestead. They are the ones who would be denied the use of their \nland. By putting the small ones out of business, they are the ones you \nare damaging.\n  I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, how much time does Senator Inhofe have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nand the Senator from Vermont 3 minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I have 3 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, what we are talking about now is \nbeginning to address the deficit issue in a significant way, and $25 \nbillion over a 10-year period is a good start. I think we cannot \ncontinue to have people coming down to the floor of the Senate and \nsaying: Think about the legacy we are leaving our children and \ngrandchildren. And then when it really comes to the point of doing \nsomething, of saying to ExxonMobil, which made $19 billion in profit \nlast year and got a $156 million refund from the IRS, you can't have it \nboth ways, this is a time to stand up and do the right thing. Again, it \nis not just ExxonMobil. It is Chevron, which received a $19 million \nrefund from the IRS. It is Valero Energy, the 25th largest company in \nAmerica with $68 billion of sales last year and received a $157 million \nrefund check.\n  What we have the opportunity to do now is to, in fact, address the \ndeficit crisis--$25 billion over a 10-year period; create over 100,000 \nnew jobs over that period as we move into energy efficiency and \nsustainable energy.\n  With that, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Let me correct this again. I had already stated that the \nstatement my good friend from Vermont made was a false statement, \ninadvertently, in terms of Exxon and what they had paid. I commented \nthat they paid more than $18 billion in the years between 2004 and \n2008. He returned and said in 2009 is when they have not paid any. They \nhave already paid $\\1/2\\ billion in 2009 in U.S. Federal income tax, \nand they will not know the final liability until they file a return \nlater this year. So they are still doing it. The information that my \ngood friend has is false.\n  Getting back to the bill and who this affects, it doesn't affect \nExxon, BP, and all these giant companies. It is the small producers \nthat will be driven out of business. Without being able to do the \ndeduction of the expenses on manufacturing, if this bill passes, this \nis going to single out the oil and gas industry, the only industry that \ndoes not enjoy the same deductions. They are punitive to this industry \nbecause right now it is quite obvious they are trying to exploit the \ntragedy in the gulf.\n  It is my understanding I have a minute and a half remaining.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. INHOFE. I am timing it. It can't be expired.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator had a minute and a half when he \nstarted this segment.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Since my colleague has the last say, may I have 30 \nseconds to finish? I was going to respond to the comment about the \ndeficit. We ought to be concerned. I am concerned about the deficit. \nWhat is interesting about this debate, I am ranked by the National \nJournal as the most conservative Member of the Senate. I suggest my \nproud liberal friend from Vermont is probably on the other end of the \nspectrum.\n  If we look at who is responsible for deficit spending, I think \nMembers will find he would be more responsible than\n\n[[Page S4924]]\n\nI would. I thank the Senator for the additional 30 seconds.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I am not a liberal but a progressive. Sometime we will \ntalk about the difference.\n  Mr. President, I did not vote for the $3 trillion war in Iraq. I did \nnot vote for the hundreds of billions of dollars in tax breaks. I did \nnot vote for the Medicare Part D Program which drove up the deficit \naltogether as a matter of fact. I suspect my friend may have voted the \nother way on all of those issues which were not paid for.\n  In terms of ExxonMobil, let's be clear. I don't know what ExxonMobil \ntold my colleague, but I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord what ExxonMobil told the Securities and Exchange Commission, the \nSEC. What is reported by the SEC for 2009 is they received a $156 \nmillion refund. That is the SEC.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            United States Securities and Exchange Commission\n\n      Form 10-K--Annual Report Pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of \n                  the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n\n                                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS--18.

Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. SANDERS. Allow me to finish my remarks. This is where we are. \nWhere we are right now is a moment at which we either go forward or \nnot, be serious or not. We hear day after day concerns about the \ndeficit. What we know is the oil industry, year after year, has been \nenormously profitable. We know in 2009 a number of oil companies, \nincluding ExxonMobil, did not pay any taxes. Let's do something about \nit. Let's pass this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4312\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I stand in strong support of my amendment \nNo. 4312. I urge all colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to come \ntogether to pass this commonsense amendment.\n  What is this amendment about? It is about something that is of great \nconcern to me, representing the State of Louisiana. It is about the Oil \nSpill Liability Trust Fund. It is about the ongoing crisis in the gulf. \nI am afraid what it is about is an example of that now famous quote of \nthe White House Chief of Staff, Rahm Emanuel, who, around February \n2009, said: We are not going to let a good crisis go to waste. He was \ntalking about the financial crisis. I am afraid that same attitude, \nthat same politicization of real crises is going on with the ongoing \noil disaster in the gulf.\n  This is a real crisis, an ongoing crisis, an ongoing disaster. The \nflow continues. It is so significant--even subtracting out the amount \nof oil BP is capturing, it is so significant that it is like a whole \nnew major oilspill each and every day. It goes on and on and on.\n  What is the provision in this bill in relation to that crisis? In \nthis bill there is a dramatic increase in the tax to fund the Oil Spill \nLiability Trust Fund from 8 cents per barrel to 41 cents, over a \nfivefold increase. If that were going into that liability trust fund, \nand if it were staying there for oil cleanup, we could come together \nand probably support that effort in a bipartisan way. But instead, what \nhas happened?\n  As soon as all of that new revenue goes into the trust fund, $15 \nbillion over 10 years, it is stolen. It is spent on unrelated spending. \nIt isn't a true trust fund. It is spent on other government deficit \nspending. It is used essentially to hide deficit spending elsewhere. It \nis double counting, what I call Enron accounting. If a private company \nwere doing this and putting this in their prospectus, putting this in \ntheir SEC reports, they would be prosecuted for criminal fraud.\n  My amendment is simple. It says two things: Anything that goes into \nthe Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund can only be used to clean up \noilspills. Pretty basic, pretty simple. Secondly, it cannot be double \ncounted, used as an offset for other unrelated government deficit \nspending. That is pretty simple. I think it is a minimum requirement we \nshould ask in the midst of this ongoing crisis in the gulf.\n  Again, are we going to treat that as a real crisis and address the \nchallenge that is there or are we going to use and abuse that crisis in \nWashington to advance preexisting agendas such as big government \nspending, additional deficit, trying to mask and hide those? I suggest \nthe only responsible thing to do is to treat the crisis for what it is, \nto respect the people of the gulf and to pass this Vitter amendment \nthat says, No. 1, money into that trust fund can only be used to clean \nup oilspills; and, No. 2, it cannot be double counted to mask other \ndeficit spending.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4311\n\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to tell a very important story. \nSome of my colleagues have heard me talk previously about a woman named \nTecora, a homeowner from south Minneapolis who is at risk of losing her \nhome. Back in 2005, Tecora was looking for a mortgage and said she \nasked her bank for a conventional mortgage with fixed payments. \nPresented with a series of options, she unsurprisingly chose the \ncheapest one. Yet the simple option got her an exotic mortgage called \nan option ARM or an adjustable rate mortgage. Now her monthly payments \nhave doubled over time and Tecora now owes $317,000 on a $288,000 loan.\n  During the housing bust and paying double what she was initially \npaying on her mortgage, Tecora started having trouble with her \npayments. Hoping to save her home, Tecora entered President Obama's \nHAMP program which is intended for people who want to avoid \nforeclosure.\n  One day, however, her mortgage servicer informed her that her file \nwas closed because she ``voluntarily left the HAMP program.'' Here is \nthe problem. She didn't. She never did. Tecora never asked that her \nfile be closed. She never tried to leave the program. Now every\n\n[[Page S4925]]\n\nday she worries anew about losing her home simply because her servicer \nmade a mistake. Tecora worked hard her whole life, but now she looks to \nthe future in fear.\n  ``I'm squeaking by,'' she told the Minneapolis Star Tribune, ``by the \nplaque on my teeth.''\n  As USA TODAY reported in March, these kinds of problems happen all \ntoo frequently. In an article entitled ``Homes Can Be Lost by Mistake \nWhen Banks Miscommunicate''--a headline that says exactly what it \nsounds like: homes can be lost by mistake when banks miscommunicate--\nthe author detailed a pattern of bank errors within HAMP that have led \nto people losing their homes or almost losing their homes. It should \nnot have to be this way. That is why I have offered an amendment with \nSenators Snowe and Murray, amendment No. 4311, to create an Office of \nthe Homeowner Advocate for people who are struggling with problems in \nthe HAMP program.\n  This amendment is currently pending to the tax extenders bill. The \ntax extenders bill aims to help people who are suffering during this \neconomic crisis. It includes extensions of unemployment insurance for \npeople who have lost their job during the recession. It promotes \nAmerican jobs by continuing the small business lending program which \nhas helped create or retain over 650,000 jobs since its creation. It \nincludes money for the national housing trust fund which will create \njobs and help ensure people have affordable places to live.\n  Our Office of the Homeowner Advocate would continue this effort to \nprovide a safety net to people who are struggling economically. In \nparticular, it would help one of the groups of people who have suffered \nthe most during the recession--homeowners. Our Office of the Homeowner \nAdvocate is modeled after the very successful Office of the Taxpayer \nAdvocate at the IRS. It would ensure that homeowners participating in \nthe HAMP program know that someone is on their side, someone with the \nauthority to actually fix the mistakes created by mortgage servicers \nparticipating in HAMP. When homeowners call this office with concerns, \nthe office has two important powers. First, it can make sure servicers \nactually obey the rules of the program or suffer the consequences. \nSecond, it ensures that the bank would not be able to sell people's \nhomes right away, giving the homeowner advocate time to actually solve \nthe problem. The office is temporary, lasting only as long as HAMP \ndoes. But while it lasts, it ensures that homeowners would not be \nlosing their homes because of simple errors.\n  This amendment is supported by the Treasury Department. When we first \nfiled the amendment to the Wall Street reform bill, the White House \ndeclared it one of the top 10 amendments that would improve the Wall \nStreet reform bill. Unfortunately, the amendment didn't receive a vote. \nSo we are bringing it to the Senate once again to ensure that \nhomeowners in all of our States have the protections they need.\n  The amendment is supported by consumer groups from around the \ncountry, ranging from Americans for Financial Reform to Consumers \nUnion, SEIU, and the National Council of La Raza. It is also supported \nby the superintendent of the New York State banking system, who calls \nit a big step forward for homeowners.\n  Significantly, Congress will not have to authorize any additional \nappropriations for this amendment. Let me say that again: Congress will \nnot have to authorize any additional appropriations for this amendment. \nThe office would be funded entirely by existing HAMP administrative \nfunds. I am going to say it again. We will be helping homeowners \nwithout authorizing any new money at all--nothing, zero, zip.\n  I was pleased to work with Senator Vitter, who just spoke, to make \nthis amendment even stronger by ensuring that no homeowner can game the \nsystem and still participate in HAMP, and also by increasing the \ntransparency of the program. These two changes are incorporated in this \nmodification to our amendment, which also incorporates some changes \nsuggested by Senator Shelby to ensure that the Homeowner Advocate \nprocess does not overly delay appropriate foreclosures.\n  I hope my colleagues see that the Homeowner Advocate is an easy way \nto help homeowners in all our hometowns--in Minnesota, in Arkansas, all \nover this country--get the protections they need to keep their homes. \nLet's adopt this amendment and stand up for homeowners everywhere in \nthis country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4312\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I wish to speak in opposition to the \nVitter amendment.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is essentially offering an amendment which \nhas the effect of preventing the oilspill liability tax from going into \neffect. This is a head-scratching amendment. Why in the world would any \nSenator suggest there be no increase in the oilspill liability tax?\n  Right now, beginning in about--let's see, what year was it?--1990, \nCongress, in the wake of the Exxon Valdez oilspill, enacted an Oil \nSpill Liability Trust Fund and oilspill liability tax, obviously, to \npay for potential or future oilspills. The tax was set at 5 cents a \nbarrel. In the 20 years since that time, the tax has been increased \njust 3 cents to 8 cents a barrel. At the same time, the price of oil \nhas increased, since 1990, from the neighborhood of $20 a barrel to $72 \na barrel today. Within the last 2 years, oil has been as high as $147 a \nbarrel.\n  So with the increased evidence of the damage oilspills can create, \nand with the increased price of oil, we thought it was an appropriate \ntime to raise the oilspill liability tax on oil companies to help pay \nfor future spills. That is why we are doing this. In this bill, we \npropose to raise that tax to 41 cents a barrel. That is a very modest \nincrease, where today oil in the market is roughly $72 a barrel.\n  You hear this argument--it is not even an argument. It is like Alice \nin Wonderland stuff. I do not know where this stuff comes from. It is \nAlice in Wonderland stuff, that somehow we should not do this because \nit is double counting or something like that. The money that is raised \nfrom the oilspill liability tax goes to the Oil Spill Liability Trust \nFind. And our Federal Government has a cash flow system of accounting, \nso by definition we will start to lower the budget deficit. That is not \ndouble counting. That is just the way it works.\n  It sounds as though the Senator from Louisiana either does not want \nto lower the budget deficit or he does not want to increase the tax on \noil companies from 8 cents a barrel, which is so small. The fact is, \nwhat he is doing is saying this: He is saying that the Budget Office, \nfor budget purposes, cannot count the oilspill liability tax to reduce \nthe budget deficit. So, in effect, what he is saying is, there is no \noilspill liability tax. What he is saying is the taxpayers should pay \nfor the cleanup, not the oil companies. That is basically what he is \nsaying. He is basically saying--by putting the kibosh on the Oil Spill \nLiability Trust Fund and the revenue coming from it--that he wants to \nprotect the oil companies, protect the oil companies from any increase \nin the taxes from 8 cents a barrel up to 41 cents a barrel and, rather, \nhave the taxpayers pay for the cleanup, not the oil companies that \nwould pay the increase in the oilspill liability tax but the taxpayers.\n  I do not think that is what the vast majority of Americans wish to \nsee. I think that is over the top and I, therefore, urge my colleagues \nto roundly defeat the amendment from the Senator from Louisiana who, in \neffect, does not want the oilspill liability tax increased and, in \neffect, is saying, taxpayers, pay for the cleanup, not the oil \ncompanies.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 5 minutes 43 seconds--all on \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, it is a little difficult to know where to \nstart, since my good friend and colleague has said so many things that \nare flat out wrong.\n  No. 1, my amendment does not prevent the tax increase. That is \nabsolutely and perfectly clear. Let me say\n\n[[Page S4926]]\n\nit again. My amendment does not block and does not prevent the tax \nincrease.\n  No. 2, my amendment does do two things. It says that any money in the \nOil Spill Liability Trust Fund can only be used for oilspill cleanup \nand, secondly, that it cannot be used to offset other spending. That is \nexactly what is going on in this bill.\n  My colleague knows that the $15 billion created by this tax increase \nis used as an offset in this bill. It masks spending in this bill of \n$15 billion. If it were not for that money, the ``score'' of this bill \nwould be $15 billion higher. It would go from $79 billion to $94 \nbillion.\n  What I am saying is simple. We should not be grabbing, stealing that \noilspill liability money to mask other spending, to double count it, to \nessentially steal it from the trust fund.\n  Again, my amendment does not prohibit the tax increase. By the way, \nif my colleague thinks the oil companies are paying that tax, not the \nconsumer, I do not think he understands how the world works. But my \namendment does not block that tax increase. It simply says money in the \nOil Spill Liability Trust Fund has to be used for oilspill cleanup, and \nit cannot be used as an offset, cannot be double counted for other \nspending, as it is clearly in this bill.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, if everyone else is amenable, I am \nprepared to yield back--if everyone else is yielding back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I believe there is a Senator who might \nwant to speak on this amendment. We are tracking him down right now. So \nI suggest we do not yield back the remainder of our time.\n  Mr. VITTER. Then, Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I want to ensure that the quorum call does \nnot run down my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator would like the time divided \nevenly?\n  Mr. VITTER. Yes, that would be my request, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered, on this \namendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that all time on \nall amendments be yielded back. I believe that is amenable to everyone.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                       Vote On Amendment No. 4318\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Sanders amendment No. 4318.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 35, the nays are \n61. Under the previous order, requiring 60 votes for the adoption of \nthis amendment, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I voted for the Sanders amendment on \ntax incentives for oil and natural gas production to H.R. 4213, the Tax \nExtenders Act.\n  Pennsylvania is in the midst of a historic boom in natural gas \nproduction from the Marcellus Shale formation. This industry is on \ntrack to create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the Commonwealth, and \nbillions of dollars in revenue, both of which are badly needed in my \nhome State. But the development of one natural resource must proceed \nwith the utmost care for two others: water and land. I know that the \nnatural gas industry desires to maintain the tax incentives which would \nbe removed by the Sanders amendment. President Obama has also proposed \nremoving these tax incentives in his fiscal year 2011 budget proposal. \nHowever, I cannot support further incentives for natural gas until that \nindustry agrees to full public disclosure of the chemical composition \nof its hydraulic fracturing fluids, which are used to break apart the \nshale deep underground and initiate the gas flow. There is placeholder \nlanguage to this effect in the discussion draft of the Kerry-Lieberman \nAmerican Power Act, and I hope that natural gas companies large and \nsmall will support these provisions as the bill, or another energy \nbill, moves forward into law. There are many issues that the natural \ngas industry must cooperate with the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania on, \nincluding hydraulic fracturing disclosure, wastewater recycling, \nresponsible well development, and a severance tax. My support for \nincentives for natural gas will remain contingent on that industry \ndemonstrating its commitment to developing the Marcellus Shale in a \nmanner that all Pennsylvanians will look back on, generations from now, \nwith pride.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I opposed the amendment of my friend \nfrom Vermont. Although I understand his frustration and his intentions, \nI could not agree with the effects of the amendment. Over the years, as \nchairman and ranking member of the Finance Committee, I have supported \npolicy reforms in taxation of oil and gas income. Many times, the major \noil firms have registered their objections. Also, in the area of \ncorporate taxation, I pushed hard to curtail a practice that oil firms \nused to erode the U.S. tax base. That practice, known as corporate \ninversions, was curtailed in the 2004 FSC-ETI legislation.\n  I re-doubled my efforts to make the reform applicable to four oil \nservice firms but was rebuffed by the House of Representatives' \nleadership in the years 2004-2007.\n  Chairman Baucus and I have been careful to not impair tax incentives \nfor independent, smaller producer oil and gas production. We have \ndifferentiated the availability of these incentives for smaller \nproducers and made clear that major oil and gas producers did not \nreceive many of these incentives.\n\n[[Page S4927]]\n\n  The amendment of my friend from Vermont blurs that line and would \nadversely affect domestic production. We need to ensure an adequate \nsupply of domestic oil and gas to keep the price at the pump down. \nTogether with incentives for alternative fuels, line ethanol and \nbiodiesel, and conservation, these small producer incentives with \nhopefully reduce our reliance on imported oil. Chairman Baucus joins me \nin this view.\n  For these reasons, I opposed the amendment of my friend from Vermont.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, section 302(a) of S. Con. Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, permits the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the allocations of a committee or committees, \naggregates, and other appropriate levels and limits in the resolution \nfor legislation that invests in clean energy and preserves the \nenvironment, including legislation that encourages conservation and \nefficiency. This adjustment to S. Con. Res. 13 is contingent on the \nlegislation not increasing the deficit over either the period of the \ntotal of fiscal years 2009 through 2014 or the period of the total of \nfiscal years 2009 through 2019.\n  I find that Senate amendment No. 4318, an amendment offered by \nSenator Sanders to Senate amendment No. 4301, an amendment in the \nnature of a substitute to H.R. 4213, fulfills the conditions of the \ndeficit-neutral reserve fund to invest in clean energy and preserve the \nenvironment. Therefore, pursuant to section 302(a), I am adjusting the \naggregates in the 2010 budget resolution, as well as the allocation to \nthe Senate Finance Committee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S.

Madam President, I don't see the proponent of the \namendment on the Senate floor.\n  There he comes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I urge support for the Vitter amendment. \nIt does two very simple things: It says any money coming into the Oil \nSpill Liability Trust Fund can only be used to clean up oilspills. It \nalso says the money cannot be used as an offset for unrelated spending, \nas it is in this bill. It cannot be used to mask other deficit spending \nor as an offset for unrelated spending.\n  The amendment specifically does not negate or block the tax increase \nof funds into the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund.\n  I reserve the reminder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, this amendment is sheer sophistry. The \neffect of his amendment will say that not oil companies but the \ntaxpayers will pay for cleanups.\n  The effect of this amendment would mean no increase in oilspill \nliability tax from 8 cents a barrel today up to 41 cents. If there is \nno increase in the spill liability tax, oil companies aren't going to \npay for future cleanups, the taxpayers will. He has this--I said \n``sophistry.'' So it is a sophistry kind of argument. It is fog and \ndouble counting and bead counting. That is not what is going on here.\n  The bottom line is this amendment has the effect of taxpayers paying \nfor the cleanup, not the oil companies. This will effectively repeal \nthe increase up to 41 cents per barrel. I urge Senators to not support \nthis amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 21 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. VITTER. My good friend and colleague's argument is not sophistry, \nit is just statements that are not true. This amendment does not block \nthe tax increase, period. It does not. It simply says the money has to \nbe used to clean up oil spills, and it cannot be used as an offset for \nother spending. Please support this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

This \namendment will not reduce in any way the available resources for \ncombating the spill in the gulf, or any other future spill. The moneys \nin the Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund may be used to advance cleanup \ncosts but that does not relieve British Petroleum as the primarily \nliable party for paying the full costs of the gulf spill cleanup which \nwill reimburse the trust fund for any funds expended.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4311\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, let me tell you about this amendment. \nIt comes from me and Senator Snowe, and it would create the Office of \nthe Homeowner Advocate within HAMP. It is needed because people don't \nreally have an advocate within HAMP. They get their questions answered \nfrom servicers who often make mistakes, and people have been losing \ntheir homes simply because of mistakes.\n  The White House called this one of the 10 best amendments for the \nWall Street reform bill. It didn't get a vote then. It costs nothing. \nNo new money. It costs absolutely nothing. Senator Vitter weighed in \nand made it better by having me put in something about people who can \nafford their mortgage can't participate in HAMP, and it removes \nlanguage that would delay foreclosures.\n  I urge all my colleagues to vote--that was telling me I was out of \ntime?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Order in the Chamber.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Oh, it was order in the Chamber.\n  In that case, I will also say that it will make data public.

Mr. President, I wish to address my colleagues about \nthe upcoming judiciary hearing and the nomination of Solicitor Kagan to \nthe Supreme Court. I have always been of the opinion that the Senate \nneeds to conduct a comprehensive and careful review of Supreme Court \nnominees. It is important that the nominee be given a fair, respectful, \nand also deliberative process. This is a lifetime appointment to the \nhighest Court in the land, so it is our duty to ensure that the Supreme \nCourt of the United States candidate understands the proper role of the \nSupreme Court in our system of government, and would be true to the \nConstitution and the laws as written. We need to be certain that the \nnominee will not come with an agenda to impose his or her personal \npolitical feelings and preferences on the bench.\n  The Senate needs enough time to adequately review the nominee's \nrecord to make these determinations. But because Solicitor Kagan does \nnot have the usual background of being a judge on the Federal or State \nbench, we have no concrete examples of her judicial philosophy in \naction. It is critical that we understand whether she has a proper \njudicial philosophy because Solicitor Kagan is being considered for the \nSupreme Court. So it is even more important for us to look at her \nentire record and to give particular weight to her statements and \nwritings as well as the positions she has taken over the years.\n  In order for the Senate to fulfill its constitutional responsibility \nof advise and consent, we must get all of her documents from the \nClinton Library and have enough time to analyze them so we can \ndetermine whether she should be a Justice. I share the concerns of the \nJudiciary Committee ranking member, Senator Sessions, that Solicitor \nKagan's documents will not be fully produced in time for the committee \nto conduct a thorough review of the nominee's record.\n  I hope we will receive these materials in time before the Judiciary \nCommittee holds the Kagan hearings. From the materials and documents \nthat we received so far, and which the committee is still reviewing, \nSolicitor Kagan's record clearly shows she is a political lawyer. In \nfact, a recent Washington Post article said her papers in the Clinton \nLibrary ``show a flair for the political,'' and that she had ``finely \ntuned . . . political antennae.''\n  Solicitor Kagan was involved in a number of hot-button issues during \nPresident Clinton's second term, including gun rights, welfare reform, \npartial-birth abortion, and Whitewater. The documents we received from \nthe Clinton Library show that Ms. Kagan\n\n[[Page S4929]]\n\npromoted liberal positions and offered analyses and recommendations \nthat often were more political than legal in nature.\n  Solicitor Kagan's memos from the Marshall papers also indicate a \nliberal and seemingly outcome-based approach to her legal analysis. So \nI look forward to asking Solicitor Kagan about her record and her \njudicial philosophy. But a judge needs to be an independent arbiter, \nnot an advocate or a rubberstamp for a political agenda. We already \nknow that Solicitor Kagan has held far left political views from a \nyoung age. She has been a long-time political lawyer, and she is a \npersonal friend of the President.\n  As Solicitor General, she has been a prominent member of the Obama \nadministration's team. As a nominee to the Supreme Court, Solicitor \nKagan has the burden of showing that despite her record as a political \nlawyer, rather than as a sitting judge or practitioner, if she is \nconfirmed she will apply the law impartially and not as a member of \nsomeone's team who is working to achieve their preferred political \nresult.\n  Moreover, President Obama's standard for picking judicial nominees is \none that places a premium on a judge's empathy for certain individuals \nor groups rather than on an even-handed reading of the law. As a \nSenator, President Obama lauded judicial nominees who would decide \ncases based on ``one's deepest values, one's core concerns, one's \nbroader perspectives on how the world works, and the depth and breadth \nof one's empathy.''\n  As a Presidential candidate, President Obama said he would appoint \njudges who have empathy for certain groups. As President he said his \njudges would have ``a keen understanding of how the law affects the \ndaily lives of the American people.''\n  The Obama ``empathy'' standard concerns me greatly because the \ninference is that an empathetic judge will pick winners and losers \nbased on his or her personal preferences rather than the law blindly \npicking winners and losers.\n  When President Obama nominated Solicitor Kagan to the Supreme Court, \nVice President Biden's chief of staff, who was involved in vetting the \nSupreme Court of the United States candidates, assured liberals they \nhad nothing to worry about from her selection. In fact, he said \nSolicitor Kagan was ``clearly a legal progressive.'' Thus, it is safe \nto assume that the President was true to his promise and picked someone \nwho embodied his empathy standard.\n  Because Solicitor Kagan does not have one of the best indicators of a \nSupreme Court nominee's judicial philosophy; that is, a judicial record \non a State or Federal bench, then I believe she should be very \nforthcoming with the Judiciary Committee's inquiries into her judicial \nphilosophy.\n  In fact, Ms. Kagan herself advocated that a nominee should respond to \nspecific inquires into the nominee's judicial philosophy and positions \non constitutional issues.\n  Solicitor Kagan wrote in her University of Chicago Law Review \narticle, ``Confirmation Messes, Old and New:''\n\n       The kind of inquiry that would contribute most to \n     understanding and evaluating a nomination is . . . discussion \n     first, of the nominee's broad judicial philosophy and, \n     second, of her views on particular constitutional issues. By \n     ``judicial philosophy'' . . . I mean such things as the \n     judge's understanding of the role of courts in our society, \n     of the nature of and values embodied in our Constitution, and \n     of the proper tools and techniques of interpretation, both \n     constitutional and statutory.\n\n  She also wrote that a nominee could comment on ``hypothetical cases'' \nand on general issues such as ``affirmative action or abortion,'' or \n``privacy rights, free speech, race and gender discrimination, and so \nforth.''\n  Given the fact that Solicitor Kagan has been nominated to a lifetime \nposition on the Nation's highest Court, the Senate must determine that \nif confirmed, she will interpret the Constitution with judicial \nrestraint and without imposing her personal political policy \npreferences and biases.\n  The Senate must determine by examining the totality of her record \nthat if confirmed, she would not be a rubberstamp for the President's \npolitical agenda. We will have to see whether Ms. Kagan will live up to \nher own standard for Supreme Court nominees and whether she will be as \nforthcoming as she argued Supreme Court of the United States nominees \nshould be in the Senate confirmation process.\n  So I am going to be pursuing this for my people of Iowa because they \nare very concerned. I am getting a lot of phone calls both for and \nagainst her that have to be taken into consideration.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Interchange Fees\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, a few weeks ago we considered a Wall \nStreet reform bill which tried to address some of the underlying \nproblems in our economy which led to the recession. It was an ambitious \nundertaking. The Senate Banking Committee, under Chairman Dodd, led us \nthrough a very difficult and lengthy debate over the bill.\n  Part of the debate included an amendment which I offered relative to \nwhat is known as an interchange fee. An interchange fee is the amount \nof money charged to a business when a customer presents a credit card. \nSo if I go to a restaurant in Chicago and pay for the bill with a \ncredit card, the restaurant is going to have to pay a percentage of my \nbill to the credit card company or at least to the issuing bank of the \ncredit card. And then I, of course, have to pay the bill when it comes \nin the mail.\n  This so-called interchange fee--the charge by the credit card company \nto the business I am patronizing--is a fee that turns out to be very \nlarge and expensive. Nearly $50 billion in credit and debit card \ninterchange fees is collected each year, primarily by the largest \ncredit card companies and by the largest banks that issue those credit \ncards. This is virtually unregulated. There is no regulation as to the \namount charged or collected from these businesses. Visa and MasterCard, \nwhich dominate the credit and debit card industries, establish the \ninterchange rates that all merchants and, by extension, their customers \npay to banks whenever a card is swiped. So if the restaurant I went to \nis charged 1 percent, 2 percent, or 3 percent because I presented a \nVisa card or a MasterCard, that is going to be reflected in the bill I \npay. It certainly is going to come off of any profit margin the \nrestaurant might realize as a result of my patronizing it.\n  Already more than half of the retail transactions in America are \nconducted by debit and credit cards. Every time someone uses a credit \nor debit card to make a donation to a charity, Visa and MasterCard \nrequire an interchange fee to be paid. There have been exceptions where \nthey have said they will suspend the fees, but by and large, if one \nmakes a donation to the charity of their choice using their credit or \ndebit card, part of the money they think they donated is going to end \nup in the hands of these credit card companies.\n  According to a January 14 analysis by the Huffington Post, banks and \ncard companies make an estimated $250 million a year from their \ninterchange or swipe fees on charitable donations. In other words, it \nturns out that Visa and MasterCard are declaring themselves part of \nthis charitable contribution and taking millions of dollars out of it. \nI would like to see more of that money go to the charitable purposes \nfor which people donate their money.\n  The Huffington Post noted that charities such as Habitat for Humanity \npay about 2.15 percent of their donation in card fees. St. Jude's \nChildren's Research Hospital, well known and well respected, pays about \n2.5 percent in card fees. Is it really necessary for Visa and \nMasterCard and the big banks to take a cut out of every charitable \ndonation? We are not talking about the cost of the transaction. I will \nconcede the fact that the regular proportional cost of a transaction of \nusing the card is certainly fair for Visa and MasterCard to charge, but \nthey raise that dramatically. There is no way that Visa and MasterCard \ncould justify\n\n[[Page S4930]]\n\n2.5 percent if I use my debit card to try to make a donation to St. \nJude's Children's Research Hospital. They are literally gaming the \nsystem and profit-taking from charities.\n  In the wake of the devastating earthquake in Haiti in January, Visa, \nMasterCard, and their member banks voluntarily suspended the collection \nof interchange fees for some charitable donations for earthquake \nrelief. It seems these companies can survive without charging these \nfees for charitable donations. They have done it. One bank, Capital \nOne, has decided not to collect interchange on donations made to \ncharity by their cards. I salute them. It is the right thing to do. Why \naren't they all taking this position? Why don't they exempt charitable \ninstitutions from these issuing bank and credit card fees? I wish other \nbanks were as reasonable when it came to interchange fees and \ncharitable causes as Capital One.\n  There is another group--universities. They pay a heavy cost in \ninterchange fees. They lose a fortune in interchange when people use \ncards to pay for things such as tuition and housing.\n  After my amendment passed the Senate, I received a letter from the \nAmerican Council on Education and eight other major university \nassociations thanking me. The letter said:\n\n       As a result of your amendment, we believe that colleges and \n     universities will see reduced debit card costs which they \n     will be able to pass on to students and their families \n     through lower costs as well as increased resources for \n     institutional grant aid and student services.\n\n  The reach of credit cards is unlimited in our economy. So are the \ngreedy hands of the credit card companies and their issuing banks when \nit comes to these interchange fees. When I said in this amendment that \nwe really want those fees to reflect the reasonable and proportional \ncost of processing the transaction, they screamed bloody murder because \nthere is a lot of money being made--some $50 billion across the economy \nfrom these fees. Wouldn't it be great if we could enable colleges and \nuniversities to lower the cost students have to pay and put more \nresources into financial aid?\n  The letter also said that under my amendment, ``colleges and \nuniversities will be able to offer discounts to students and their \nfamilies for payments made with checks and debit cards.'' That is \nanother thing they don't like to talk about. These two major credit \ncard giants, Visa and MasterCard, really have a sweet deal. They \nbasically coordinate their policies. It is as if Coke and Pepsi reached \nan agreement and said to your local store: Don't you dare offer that \nother product at a discount. That is virtually what has happened with \nVisa and MasterCard. They tell the stores: You can't give any better \ntreatment; you can't say this is a Visa store or a MasterCard store. No \nway. You have to say we accept all credit cards from these issuing \nagencies. And basically, you can't limit it to debit cards, limit it to \ncheck cards, give a discount, limit the amount in terms of the dollar \namount you can charge on these cards.\n  I also want to say that governments are paying these credit card \ncompanies a lot as well. Think of all the ways in which people conduct \ntransactions with Federal, State, and local governments. Every time \nsomebody uses a card to pay for a driver's license or a parking sticker \nor a ride on public transit or to pay a ticket or to obtain a permit, \nthere is an interchange fee. The city of Chicago paid $7.5 million in \ninterchange fees last year. The Chicago Transit Authority paid $1.8 \nmillion per year in interchange fees. The Illinois Tollway paid $11.6 \nmillion in interchange fees last year. In most cases, the government \nagencies have no bargaining power when it comes to the amount of the \ninterchange fee. Every dollar spent on these fees is a dollar that \ncould have been spent on jobs and services and a dollar that could have \nbeen spared from the taxpayer.\n  The American Association of Motor Vehicle Administrators represents \nDMVs across the country. They accept cards for payment of things such \nas driver's licenses, car registrations, and license plates. They wrote \na letter. They said:\n\n       State motor vehicle agencies and other state agencies are \n     experiencing unprecedented financial strain today, as we seek \n     to control costs where possible. . . .While our customers \n     certainly appreciate the convenience of electronic \n     transactions, few understand that the costs of accepting \n     credit and debit card payments for motor vehicle agencies are \n     higher today than ever before, and that these fees compound \n     the current budget crisis that many states face.\n\n  The cost of interchange fees affects every local government, every \nState, every Indian tribe, and even the Federal Government. Right now, \neven the Federal Government is as helpless as any small business when \nit comes to trying to reduce their interchange costs.\n  The amendment which I offered, which was adopted on the floor of the \nSenate by a vote of 64 to 33, requires debit interchange fees to be \nkept at a reasonable level, and it allows sellers to offer discounts to \nconsumers without threat of punishment from Visa and MasterCard. The \namendment was adopted in a broadly bipartisan vote, as 17 of my \nRepublican colleagues joined me in passing it. The amendment is going \nto help American families, each of whom pays an estimated $427 a year \nto subsidize the credit card companies and the banks issuing these \ncards.\n\n  Lobbyists for the financial industry have thrown the kitchen sink at \nmy amendment in an effort to keep the $50 billion interchange fee \nsystem completely unregulated. Imagine, here is Durbin's amendment \ngetting into $50 billion worth of profit-taking these credit card \ncompanies and their banks, the biggest banks, are engaged in.\n  Incredibly, the card companies and banks have even argued that they \nneed to preserve the $50 billion interchange system in order to protect \nconsumers. Give me a break. On the issue of consumers, they have no \nshame. Do my colleagues recall that we passed a credit card reform bill \nand the credit card companies said: We will need 6 months to really get \nall this stuff together, all these changes. Give us a little time.\n  Remember what happened in that 6-month period? Every time you would \ngo to pick up the mail and there was something from the credit card \ncompany, you would open it and they would announce they were raising \ninterest rates. So they ran the rates up as high as they could before \nthe Credit Card Reform Act went into effect.\n  When have Visa and MasterCard and the big banks ever stood up for \nconsumers? Didn't we just see them fall all over themselves to gouge \ncardholders before this last credit card act went into effect? Where do \nthe banks and card companies think their $50 billion in interchange \nfees comes from? It comes from consumers who subsidize the interchange \nsystem by paying higher retail prices. It is a massive hidden transfer \nof wealth from consumers to big banks.\n  The amendment represents one of the big wins for small businesses and \nconsumers in years. It will help small businesses grow and create jobs.\n  Don't let the Wall Street lobbyists fool you. They will say anything \nto protect their big bank profits.\n  I have received some letters from Illinois small businesses \nsupporting my interchange reform. From James Phillip, Jr., owner of \nPhillip's Flower Shops in Westmont, IL:\n\n       As an 87-year old family business, over one-third of our \n     customer purchases are paid by credit and debit cards; yet we \n     found that over the years our cost of clearing credit cards \n     and complying with their rules has increased faster than the \n     total amount cleared--to the point that it is now extremely \n     burdensome on the independent retailer. . . .I am writing to \n     voice my support for legislation that would make credit card \n     fees and rules for merchants more reasonable and competitive.\n\n  Mr. President, whether it is Colorado or Illinois, if we are coming \nout of this recession, it will be because small businesses are on the \nmove, expanding their employment, expanding their efforts, expanding \ntheir businesses. This is a drag on small business.\n  From Robert Jones, president of the American Sale patio store in \nTinley Park, IL:\n\n       I am a small businessman in Illinois. I want to thank and \n     encourage you to push for credit card and debit card \n     interchange reform. Being a small business we have absolutely \n     no choice and no power to negotiate with the big credit card \n     companies over their fees. They basically tell us ``take it \n     or leave it.'' Since the vast majority of our customers now \n     pay with credit cards due to all the points and perks they \n     are getting for doing so, we have no alternative. They \n     essentially have a monopoly on taking payments from our \n     customers. I applaud your amendment to level this playing \n     field.\n\n  From George LeDonne, owner of LeDonne Hardware in Berkeley, IL:\n\n\n[[Page S4931]]\n\n\n       As the owner of a hardware store in Berkeley, IL, I am \n     directly affected by these fees. Small businesses are closing \n     every day as it becomes more of a struggle to stay \n     profitable. Your help in recognizing and acting on this is \n     appreciated.\n\n  Russ Peters, owner of Mobile Print, Inc., a printing company in Mount \nProspect, IL:\n\n       I wish you to know I definitely support this reform. Credit \n     cards are ubiquitous in today's marketplace and these common \n     sense reforms will benefit a small business like mine.\n\n  Jim Dames, he owns the Snackers Cafe in Western Springs:\n\n       Please help small businesses, I can't fight the credit card \n     companies alone.\n\n  And here is an old friend of mine, George Preckwinkle, president of \nBishop Hardware and Supply. He has 10 locations in central Illinois. I \nhave known George for 40 years. He wrote me a letter. And George is not \nof the same political faith that I am, so I accept this as being a \ngenuine statement, not partial in any way. George writes:\n\n       It is very important to business, especially smaller \n     business, to solve the problems retailers are having with \n     exorbitant fees and contractual restrictions imposed by Visa \n     and MasterCard. Senator Durbin's amendment would be a huge \n     help.\n\n  I cannot tell you how great it is to hear from my friend George, who \nprobably has never voted for me but just sent me the nicest note about \nthis effort.\n  I could go on with a long list, but I will not. But I will just tell \nyou this: The information we are receiving is very clear. Whether the \nbusiness is small or large, whether it is a private entity or a public \nentity, such as the city of Chicago, the city of Springfield, IL, \nwhether we are talking about universities that are trying to keep their \ncosts down for students, whether we are talking about charities that \nliterally are trying to raise enough money to do the good things that \nneed to be done in our country and in our world, the credit card \ncompanies are always there with their hand out and their demands for \nthese fees. For years, there has been virtually no competition. These \nsmall businesses do not have a fighting chance against these credit \ncard companies.\n  Well, I can tell you, I have roused a sleeping giant, if it was ever \nasleep, in the giant credit card companies in what they are trying to \ndo on Capitol Hill. They are smothering this place with lobbyists who \nare calling, and they realize they have almost no credibility \nwhatsoever, so they are finding surrogates.\n  The latest group, which really saddens me, is the credit unions. \nHistorically, I have always voted with the credit unions. I have \nthought they virtually represent the right way to loan money, and they \nget special treatment because of that approach. Their idea, of course, \nis they collect the money from their members in their savings, and they \nloan it out so that their members can buy cars and other things that \nare necessary. They keep their costs low because they are nonprofit. We \ndo not tax them, so we give them special treatment. But they also issue \ncredit cards, so we exempted them from my amendment. Virtually every \ncredit union in America, but for three, is exempt. We put a $10 billion \nthreshold for any financial institution that would be affected by it. \nThat eliminates almost 8,000 credit unions. Only three would be \ncovered. They are huge. Yet the credit unions are roaming all over \nCapitol Hill saying the Durbin amendment is the end of the world.\n  Here is their logic: If we end up reducing the interchange fee on \ndebit cards in the biggest banks, then Visa and MasterCard have said to \nthe smaller banks and credit unions: We are going to reduce your \ninterchange fee too. And they say they have to do that because they \njust cannot separate all these different banks and credit cards. Well, \nthat is just a bunch of baloney, if I can say that on the floor of the \nSenate--and I just did--because Visa has 122 different categories of \ninterchange fees today; MasterCard, over 100. So the argument that they \ncannot separate the little banks from the big banks--get out of here.\n  Secondly, they have the power today to lower interchange fees \nunilaterally. They can just call and say to these credit unions and \ncommunity banks: We are going to lower the interchange fee that is \nbeing paid to you. They can do it, and these banks have no recourse \nwhatsoever. If the banks and credit unions think that is an unfair \nproposition, then they are standing in the shoes of small business--in \nexactly the same position.\n  These Visa and MasterCard credit card companies have reached the \npoint where they have so much power and virtually no competition, that \nit was confirmed last week in a hearing of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee that they are currently being investigated by the Antitrust \nDivision at the U.S. Department of Justice. No details were provided in \nterms of this investigation, but the person who spoke for the \nDepartment of Justice confirmed that fact. They have reached the point \nwhere they virtually have no competition. They can impose whatever they \nwant.\n  Let me make one last point about that. If Visa and MasterCard make \ntheir money because more people own credit cards and more banks issue \ncredit cards, does it make sense that they would create an environment \nwhere credit unions and smaller banks would not want to issue credit \ncards? Of course not. The profitability of Visa and MasterCard is when \nmore people are using credit cards, more banks are issuing credit \ncards. So if they are going to make it more difficult for banks and \ncredit unions to issue credit cards, they are really cutting off their \nnose to spite their face, and I think that is pretty obvious.\n  But it is interesting to me how fearful credit unions are of Visa and \nMasterCard. They are literally shivering in their boots. They do not \nunderstand that they are the victims as much as the small businesses \nare of these powerful credit card companies. I wish for once they would \nstep back and take a look and not just automatically sign up whenever \nthe largest banks in America say jump. It just should not be that the \ncommercial banks, the community banks, the credit unions are doing \nthis, and it really is a vast departure from where they have been \nhistorically.\n  So at this point, the bill is now in conference committee, and I know \nSenator Dodd and Chairman Barney Frank of the House Banking Committee \nare working hard to try to enact this bill. I know the strong \nbipartisan vote in the Senate is an indication of how we feel about it. \nI hope our friends in the House, though they do not have that provision \nin their bill, will consider making this part of the conference \ncommittee report.\n  It will be a positive day for us in America when the message is \nfinally delivered to the credit card companies that they can no longer \nhave this dictatorial grip over small businesses and the issuing banks \nthey have today.\n  I hope we can see, in the next 2 weeks, a bill coming forward on Wall \nStreet reform with many important provisions. This is one that is \ncertainly important to me personally and I think will be a way for us \nto help small businesses increase jobs and help this economy come out \nof this recession. I hope we can do that soon.\n  Mr. President, I see another colleague on the floor, and I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. First of all, Mr. President, let me thank the \ndistinguished assistant majority leader for his continuing work on this \nissue. It protects small businesses and consumers from gouging by the \ncredit card companies and the monolithic monopoly power they bring to \nbear. I was pleased to vote for and support this amendment on the \nfloor, and I wish the assistant majority leader much success in the \nconference committee to get that in the final bill.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nForeign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act, which I have filed as \namendment No. 4324 to the package currently under consideration by the \nSenate. This amendment would close a loophole in Federal law that \nallows foreign manufacturers to evade accountability when their \nproducts injure Americans here at home. It would do so by requiring \nforeign manufacturers to meet the same standards as domestic \nmanufacturers. It is a simple reform. It is much needed. It will \nprotect American industry against unfair competition or having to, in \neffect, subsidize dangerous foreign products. It will foster American \njobs for that reason. It will keep\n\n[[Page S4932]]\n\nAmerican consumers safe, and it will help Americans who are injured \nmake sure they get an adequate recovery for their injuries from the \nforeign manufacturer who caused them the harm.\n  What happens here in America when a foreign manufacturer is able to \navoid responsibility for a defective product that causes an injury to \nan American? When they are able to avoid responsibility, one of two bad \nthings happen. One or the other has to be. One is that the injured \nAmerican gets no recovery. Their injury goes unredressed. They cannot \nfind the accountable company, and they just have to suffer without \ncompensation. The second alternative is that an American company, under \nthe theory of joint and several liability, has to make good for the \nharm caused by the foreign company. It becomes a cost to the American \ncompany.\n\n  This actually came up in the hearing on the bill when an Alabama \ncontractor explained how he had to make good on the claims of \nhomeowners whose homes he built when, without knowing it, he had used \ndefective Chinese wallboard in the homes and they emitted sulfur that \nwas bad for the health of the home occupants, that corroded piping, and \nthat caused an immense amount of work that had to be redone to have his \ncustomers be satisfied customers. It became his problem when the \nChinese wallboard company was nowhere to be found when their defective \nproduct caused all this harm down in Alabama. These are things that \nshould not happen, and they are bipartisan concerns.\n  I want to say I am proud and grateful to have had the opportunity to \nwork with Senator Sessions and Senator Durbin to achieve these goals. \nBoth Senator Sessions and Senator Durbin were original cosponsors when \nI first introduced this bill on a stand-alone basis. Thirteen other \nbipartisan cosponsors have since signed on to that bill, and I am very \ngrateful for all their support.\n  Let me describe for a few minutes the specifics of this particular \namendment.\n  There are two legal hurdles that currently face an American harmed by \none of these foreign manufacturers. As my lawyer colleagues know, \nsomeone who gets injured and brings a lawsuit must bring the \nresponsible party into the proper court. This requires the injured \nparty, one, to serve process on the defendant, to file the papers in \nthe lawsuit with the defendant, and two, to establish personal \njurisdiction over the defendant, consistent with the due process clause \nof the Constitution. No service of process, no jurisdiction, no \nlawsuit, no recovery, no assistance for the injured American.\n  The problem is that service of process on a foreign manufacturer is \noften extremely costly and extremely slow because it often must be done \nabroad rather than here in the United States. For instance, when an \nAmerican seeks to serve a defendant in a country that is a signatory to \nwhat is called the Hague Convention on the Service Abroad of Judicial \nand Extra Judicial Documents in Civil and Commercial Matters, the \ncomplaint must be translated into the foreign language, transmitted to \nthe central authority in the foreign country, and then delivered \naccording to the rules of service in the home country of the defendant, \nwhich may not be hospitable to foreign litigants. Even more complex \nprocedural hurdles face an American seeking to serve a defendant in a \ncountry that has not signed the Hague Convention.\n  But let's say you get through all that expense and all that hassle \nand all that delay. Even when an American does serve process \nsuccessfully on a foreign manufacturer, personal jurisdiction then can \nprove an insurmountable hurdle. This is because Supreme Court decisions \ninterpreting the due process clause make it hard to exercise \njurisdiction over foreign companies, even those whose products have \ninjured Americans.\n  So something clearly needs to be done to bring the way we treat \nforeign manufacturers into line with the liability and responsibility \nof domestic manufacturers. They should not have this advantage over our \ndomestic industry.\n  This amendment provides a simple solution to both of these problems. \nIt requires a foreign manufacturer that wants to import products into \nthe United States for our consumers to use to register an agent in the \nUnited States who will accept service of process for cases in the \nUnited States. By designating such an agent, the manufacturer would \nconsent to the personal jurisdiction of the courts in the State where \nthe agent is located, and no further complicated service of process \nwould be required. This is not dissimilar, for example, to the way a \ncorporation from outside my home State of Rhode Island must register to \ntransact business in our State--a requirement that exists in many \nStates around the country. I suspect it exists in the distinguished \nPresiding Officer's home State of Colorado.\n  Finally, let me make clear to whom this applies and how. The big \nforeign manufacturers that ship billions of dollars of products into \nthe United States and whose names we would all instantly recognize \nalready can be held accountable somewhere in the United States by \nvirtue of their having American operations or by virtue of the size of \ntheir imports. They can usually be found. And for companies such as \nthat, complying with the new law will be as simple as designating \nsomeone in their U.S. headquarters to be that agent for service \nprocess. It will be a 5-minute task to comply with this law.\n\n  For foreign companies that have set up manufacturing operations \nsomewhere in the United States, they will get the same treatment as \ndomestic companies under this bill. Their domestic operation will be a \nlocation where they can be served. It is the foreign manufacturers that \ntake advantage of our marketplace, but when their defective product \ninjures someone and can't be found, that are the real targets of this \namendment, they don't want to be held responsible anywhere.\n  Who are they? Well, to give a few examples, they are the ones who \nmake the drywall I talked about, full of sulfur, that corrodes wiring \nand makes the residents sick. They are the companies that make cheap \ntoys with lead paint on them that is poisonous to children or metal \nplumbing fittings that rupture under routine use because they are so \nshoddy or those that contaminate medical supplies that are sold into \nthe United States with unthinkable chemicals. These companies may look \nperfectly legitimate when they sell their products, but when you try to \nfind them once you have been injured by them, it is like grasping \nsmoke. They disappear, and they avoid all accountability when their \nproducts hurt our fellow Americans.\n  It is these companies that this amendment will fully bring within the \nscope of the American legal system. It is important that we do this, \nbecause they should play by the same rules our American companies do \nwith respect to service of process and availability for redress.\n  The Foreign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act applies to major \nproduct categories including consumer goods, drugs, cosmetics, and \nchemicals through the Federal agencies that already regulate those \nproduct categories and through the components of the Department of \nHomeland Security that oversee our Nation's imports. The amendment \nempowers those agencies to use their expertise in these fields to set \nappropriate thresholds; for instance, to exempt small foreign \nmanufacturers from having to register an agent, and allows a working \nperiod to ensure that no disruptions in imports occur during the \nimplementation period of this amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I think it is \nimportant. By leveling the economic playing field, it will allow \nAmerican manufacturers to compete fairly with foreign manufacturers, \nthereby protecting American jobs. By holding foreign manufacturers to \nthe same standards as American manufacturers, it will protect our \nconsumers and American businesses without raising any trade issues. It \nwill eliminate this terrible situation of a foreign product causing an \ninjury to an American for which that American can get no relief or a \nforeign company causing an injury to an American but because they can't \nbe found, having an American company that worked on the installation of \nthe product, that sold the product, that is for some reason jointly and \nseverally liable for that injury having to carry the cost that belongs \non the foreign manufacturer and would be their cost if only they could \nbe found and served and brought to account in an American court. Both \nof\n\n[[Page S4933]]\n\nthose things are rankly unfair, and this is the best solution to put an \nend to those two injustices.\n  I think it is an important and a much needed fix to a quirk in our \nlaws. We should pass it as soon as possible. I hope very much it can \nbecome a part of the legislation to which it is now a pending \namendment.\n  I thank you very much.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Wednesday, \nJune 16, following morning business, the Senate resume consideration of \nthe House message with respect to H.R. 4213; that there then be 5 \nminutes of debate equally divided and controlled between Senators \nBaucus and Grassley or their designees; that upon the use or yielding \nback of that time, Senator McConnell or his designee be recognized to \nmake a Budget Act point of order against the Baucus motion; that once \nthe point of order is raised, Senator Baucus then be recognized to \nwaive the applicable budget point of order; that if the waiver fails, \nthen the Baucus motion to concur with an amendment be withdrawn, and \nSenator Baucus then be recognized to move to concur in the House \namendment to the Senate amendment to the bill with an amendment; \nprovided notwithstanding the withdrawal of the previous motion, the \npreviously agreed-upon amendments Nos. 4302, as modified, 4326, and \n4311, as modified, be incorporated into the new Baucus motion to \nconcur; that the Reid amendment No. 4344 be reoffered with the same \ntext; that on Thursday, June 17, beginning at 10 a.m., the Senate \ndebate the Thune substitute amendment No. 4333, to be reoffered with \nthe same text; that the amendment be debated for 2 hours, with the time \nequally divided and controlled between Senators Baucus and Thune or \ntheir designees; that upon the use or yielding back of time, Senator \nBaucus be recognized to raise a budget point of order against the Thune \namendment; that Senator Thune, or his designee, then be recognized to \nmove the applicable budget point of order; that if the waiver fails, \nthen the Thune substitute amendment be withdrawn; further, that if the \nwaivers for either Baucus our Thune amendments succeed, the amendments \nremain pending; finally, that the cloture motion be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, pursuant to section 302(a) of S. Con. Res. \n13, the 2010 budget resolution, I made adjustments to the 2010 budget \nresolution earlier today for Senate amendment No. 4318, an amendment \noffered by Senator Sanders to S.A. 4301, an amendment in the nature of \na substitute to H.R. 4213.\n  The Senate did not adopt Senate amendment No. 4318. Consequently, I \nam further revising the 2010 budget resolution to reverse the \nadjustments previously made pursuant to section 302(a) to the \naggregates and to the allocation provided to the Senate Finance \nCommittee.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S.

Mr. President, I rise today to celebrate the 40 year \nanniversary of HELP of Southern Nevada, a nonprofit organization \nproviding Nevadans with housing, emergency services, life skills and \nprevention--the four cornerstones for which its name is an acronym. \nHELP has served as a vital resource to hundreds of thousands of \nNevadans, and continues to provide unwavering support to our \ncommunities.\n  HELP was first created out of the Junior League of Las Vegas in 1969, \nand called the Voluntary Action Center. They incorporated a year later, \nin 1970, and became one of Nevada's premier resource centers for the \ndisadvantaged. In that year, HELP provided its services to 300 people \nin southern Nevada. Today, they serve 55,000 distinct clients every \nyear.\n  The services HELP offers range from financial assistance with rent \nand transportation costs, to providing meals to families during the \nholidays. A focus on providing practical assistance in gaining self-\nsufficiency makes HELP one of southern Nevada's greatest social service \nproviders. Its services include seven different areas of support: \nCommunity Alternative Sentencing, Holiday Programs, Nevada 2-1-1, \nSocial Services, Weatherization, Work Opportunities Readiness Center--\nW.O.R.C., and the Youth Center.\n\n[[Page S4934]]\n\n  To highlight a few of the great contributions of HELP of Southern \nNevada, let me tell you about the Community Alternative Sentencing \nprograms and the Youth Center. The Community Alternative Sentencing \nProgram offers hope to individuals facing incarceration and other \nsanctions. In lieu of these penalties, individuals give their times and \nservices to aiding nonprofits in community service. In addition to the \nproductive and illuminating experience this program offers its \nparticipants, it saves taxpayers the cost of incarceration, and \ndirectly increases the capacity of nonprofits to help in the community. \nThe HELP of southern Nevada Youth Center provides training and \nassistance to Southern Nevada's youth to prevent homelessness and equip \nyoung people for success. Many are matched with volunteer mentors from \nthe community, who work help them get the most out of classes they take \nat the center which help them develop work and personal skills. These \nprograms only scratch the surface of HELP's vast offerings.\n  It brings me great joy to see Nevadans working so hard to make \nmeaningful and lasting influences in our community. Over the course of \nfour decades HELP and its devoted staff and volunteers have exemplified \nthe ideals of selflessness and public service. I know that the hundreds \nof thousands of individuals whose lives have been touched by the work \nof HELP would share in my desire to express our gratitude. Furthermore, \nI would like to congratulate HELP. The positive changes they have made \namongst the lives of individuals and within the community are truly \nremarkable achievements. I am grateful and honored to recognize the \n40th anniversary of HELP of Southern Nevada today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4934-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                BIG OIL\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the explosion on the Deepwater Horizon \noil rig in the Gulf of Mexico was a tragedy for the workers killed and \ntheir families. It has also become an economic disaster for the people \nof the gulf coast and an unparalleled environmental disaster for our \nNation. As we work to stop and clean up the spill, we also need to end \nthe coziness between big oil and the Federal agencies that regulate the \nindustry. That chummy relationship has shielded big oil from being held \naccountable for years, and it is high time we make sure that government \nis cracking down on, not cozying up to, the oil companies.\n  As I discussed a few days ago at a Judiciary Committee hearing \nexamining liability issues related to the BP oilspill, Congress should \ntake action right away to deter wrongdoing and encourage the kind of \nresponsible, careful drilling we need. One way to do that is to \neliminate big oil's liability cap for natural resources and economic \ndamage caused by oilspills, such as the loss of travel and tourism \nrevenue that businesses across the gulf are experiencing. I am a \ncosponsor of Senator Menendez's legislation to do just that. The \noilspill in the gulf has made it painfully clear that this liability \ncap is far too low. The existing $75 million liability cap is less than \n1 day's worth of profits for BP, which earned almost $6 billion in \nprofits in the first quarter of this year.\n  But that must be just the beginning of a comprehensive effort to \nchange the way government approaches big oil. For far too long, the oil \nindustry has gotten special treatment, in large part because it is one \nof the wealthiest, most powerful special interests in Washington. The \noil and gas industry gave $35 million in political donations in the \nlast Presidential election cycle, and $\\1/4\\ billion in donations over \nthe last 20 years. One of the reasons I have worked to curb the \ninfluence of money in politics for so many years is because of the \nundue influence of big oil.\n  Those donations have contributed to the oil industry's access to \nCongress and to the agencies that are supposed to regulate oil \nexploration and production. It is no coincidence that the oil industry \nhas received unjustified tax breaks and other favorable treatment for \nyears. That has to change, and we can start by getting rid of taxpayer-\nfunded giveaways for the oil and gas industry, as I have proposed in my \nControl Spending Now Act, legislation to cut the deficit by about $\\1/\n2\\ trillion over 10 years. Part of that bill would end a taxpayer \nsubsidy for the processing of oil company permits. I also support \nefforts to repeal over $35 billion in oil and gas tax breaks targeted \nby President Obama for elimination. As we seek to rein in record \ndeficits, it is time to end these unjustified giveaways to an industry \nthat doesn't need taxpayer support.\n  Congress must also make sure that regulators aren't simply acting as \nrubberstamps for whatever the oil industry wants. Unfortunately, too \noften the Federal Government ends up listening more to the powerful \nindustries it is supposed to be regulating than to the consumers it is \nsupposed to be protecting. Whether it is Wall Street or big oil that is \ncalling the shots, the result is rarely good for my constituents in \nWisconsin.\n  Another critical way to hold big oil accountable is to pass my ``Use \nIt or Lose It'' legislation to ensure oil companies are diligently \nexploring the Federal leases they currently have, and not sitting on \nthose leases in an effort to drive up gas prices. We should also \nrestore the Clean Water Act, CWA, to its full strength. The CWA is the \nmain statute used to prosecute polluters who dump oil into waters of \nthe United States, and it is never been more important to ensure that \npolluters are held accountable for the damage they do to our economy \nand our environment.\n  Congress has the responsibility to look ahead and do what it takes to \nprevent a disaster like the one in the gulf from happening again. We \nhave to come at this issue from all sides to make sure that BP is held \naccountable for the current spill, that we work to prevent future \nspills with proper regulations, and that we upend the culture that \nprovides tax breaks and special treatment for big oil in the first \nplace. Working to stop and clean up the spill in the gulf is not \nenough. Congress has to clean up the cozy Washington culture that \nfavors big corporations over the needs of American people, and over the \nprotection of our economy and our air and water.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4934-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4934-S4935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 GUINEA\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Guinea is a fragile, resource-rich state \nin West Africa that has been plagued by political uncertainty since the \ndeath of its longtime President, Lansana Conte, in December 2008. Much \nof this upheaval can be attributed to the fact that the President, in \nhis 25 long years of rule, left little room for governance reform. His \nautocratic legacy included abusive security forces, a collapsed \neconomy, a divided civil society, and a squabbling opposition. As a \nresult, there was no clear successor and no viable path forward. \nPresident Conte's commitment to democracy was cosmetic, at best, and \neasily trumped by his dictatorial tendencies and unwillingness to \nrelinquish power.\n  As many Guinea watchers expected, the day after President Conte, \ndied, a military junta calling itself the National Council for \nDemocracy and Development, CNDD, seized power and dissolved the \nconstitution and legislature. Given the deteriorated state of \ngovernance and widespread impunity, the junta was initially hailed by \nmany as a safeguard against the endemic problems of corruption, \ninsecurity, and rampant drug trafficking--all of which contribute to \nthe lack of legitimate governance. Furthermore, the fact that the CNDD \nappointed a civilian prime minister and promised to hold Presidential \nand legislative elections gave many Guineans hope that the country was \non the verge of a legitimate political transition.\n  But those elections were repeatedly postponed, despite repeated \nclaims by the junta that a transition to civilian rule would occur. As \nthe months passed, a number of signs, including the appointment of \nmilitary officers to key government posts, indicated that CNDD was in \nfact not planning to relinquish power and was certainly not ready--or \nwilling--to oversee an election process.\n  In fact, over the next few months the CNDD sought to tighten its hold \non power severely, including an attempt in September 2009 by security \nforces to brutally crush a peaceful, prodemocracy rally. I joined many \nin the international community at that time in condemning such blatant \nand violent repression. A U.N. Commission was\n\n[[Page S4935]]\n\nsent to investigate the atrocities while the CNDD crackdown cast a dark \nshadow on Guinea's prospects for peace and stability.\n  During this period, I was pleased to see the Obama administration \nengage proactively to help reverse Guinea's political crisis--\nparticularly in the aftermath of the shooting of CNDD leader Captain \nDadis Camara. In those fragile moments of uncertainty, the consistent \ndiplomacy undertaken by our senior officials played an important role. \nWorking with key regional actors and organizations, the State \nDepartment helped to broker an important political agreement, known as \nthe Ouagadougou Declaration, which was widely welcomed as an end to the \nprotracted political vacuum that had existed. The signing of this \nagreement ushered in a transitional united government that, while \nimperfect, has been actively supported by the Obama administration.\n  Unquestionably Guinea remains on delicate ground but the upcoming \nPresidential elections scheduled for June 27 create an opportunity for \nGuinea--and our bilateral relationship--to progress forward. \nUndoubtedly the process will be chaotic and messy, but there is a good \nchance we could see this beleaguered country bounce back from decades \nof mismanagement. Of course, in order for Guinea to truly progress, \nthese elections must be the beginning of serious and sustained reform--\na process which must also include accountability for the abuses \ncommitted in September 2009. Elections are only one component of the \ndemocratic process, but still they are a significant one and may give \nthe people of Guinea their long deserved chance to finally turn the \npage on their troubled political history.\n  While there are plenty of factors that could lead to another election \npostponement including the will of the transitional government and the \ncapacity and efficiency of the election commission, I remain optimistic \nthat this will not occur. Certainly there are real challenges to \nfostering democracy given Guinea's history, but the recent commitment \nfrom the Acting President and Chief of the Army to remain neutral and \nensure the elections are free, credible, and transparent should not go \nwithout notice. I have long said that promoting and supporting \ndemocratic institutions should be a key tenet of our engagement with \nAfrica, as institution building is essential to Africa's stability and \nits prosperity. In the case of Guinea--a nation that has great \npotential to flourish and thrive--credible elections are an important \nfirst step on the road to better governance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4935-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO RON GETTELFINGER\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, leaders demonstrate their talent and \ncharacter not when life is easy but at times of crisis. During the \ngreatest crisis in the history of the American auto industry, that \nindustry's workers and the communities in which they live have \nbenefitted enormously from the leadership of a quiet Kentuckian whose \ndevotion to working families cannot be overstated.\n  When Ron Gettelfinger took office as president of the United Auto \nWorkers in 2002, I do not think anyone, and certainly not Ron, foresaw \nthe turbulence ahead. As his 8 years as president of the UAW come to a \nclose, it is time to congratulate and thank him for exceptional \nleadership in tough times.\n  Ron navigated those rough waters guided by two lights: a clear-eyed \nassessment of what was necessary to preserve America's auto industry, \nand the sure knowledge that millions of families depended on its \npreservation.\n  That knowledge came from Ron's days on the assembly line at Ford's \nLouisville assembly plant, from his days as his plant's local \npresident, from his service as regional president for UAW members in \nIndiana and Kentucky, and from his time at Solidarity House in Detroit. \nHe is a sharp, tough-minded negotiator, but underlying his talents and \nskills is a real emotional bond with the workers who have depended on \nhis leadership. That bond with his members meant that when Ron \nGettelfinger asked them to make sacrifices, they knew it was not \nbecause he was taking the easy way out, but because it was necessary.\n  The sacrifices have been great. Ron knows this better than anybody. \nBut he also knows that in making those sacrifices, the workers of the \nUAW have set the stage for a renaissance in the U.S. auto industry, one \nthat is already taking shape in the form of increased sales, more \nconsumer confidence, and a commitment to the clean energy technologies \nthat will shape our transportation future.\n  I have been proud to stand with Ron Gettelfinger in many of his \nbattles. Members of the United Auto Workers honor the leaders who over \nnearly a century of progress and challenge have guided their union. I \nhave no doubt that for generations yet to come, those workers will \nhonor Ron's work in guiding their union through one of the most \ndifficult periods in its history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4935-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO NINA THOMAS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

As Ms. Thomas ends her many \nyears of exceptional service to Vermont Law School and its students, I \nwish her the very best as she enters this new chapter of her life. I \nthank her for her service, and I know her commitment over the years has \nhelped to make the school the special, unique place it is today.\n  Nina Thomas is a native of Vermont, having attended grade school in \nthe same building that is now part of the Vermont Law School campus in \nSouth Royalton, VT. In 1976 she returned to be part of a fledgling \ninstitution where her care, her counsel, and her wisdom have made a \ndifference in the lives of many law students who have passed through \nher office. Her dedication helped the school grow into a successful \ninstitution for legal education that is a source of pride for Vermont \nand Vermonters. Her career spanned from the early days of the school's \nbeginnings to the present, where it stands as a national leader in \nenvironmental legal thinking and learning.\n  As Nina Thomas enters her retirement, I hope she will take great \ncomfort in knowing that the mark she left at Vermont Law School will be \na lasting one and that her contributions are part of the school's \nstrong foundation. I know she will be dearly missed by faculty and \nstaff and most especially the students to whom she has given so much.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4935-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4935-S4936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO TOM HOWARD\n\n  Mr. LEAHY.

He \nserved in the U.S. Army in Korea between 1963 and 1966, and earned a \nB.A. from Johnson State College in history and international relations \nin 1970. Tom went on to earn a master's degree in executive development \nin public service at Ball State University in 1974, and wrote his \nmaster's thesis on youthful offenders.\n  Appointed as executive director of the bureau in 1979, Tom has built \nthe agency into a diverse organization with statewide impact. Under his \nleadership, the organization developed cutting-edge programs, like the \nReturn House in Barre, VT--a program operated by the Washington County \nYouth Service Bureau for 18- to 22-year-old young men who are returning \nto the community after being incarcerated. In addition to his \ncommitment to working with young people and youthful offenders, Tom has \nsecured millions of dollars in Federal, State, and foundation grants to \nbring sustainable services and opportunities to youth.\n  We are fortunate in Vermont. I am always impressed by the high level \nof collaboration on behalf of Vermont's communities to solve its \nproblems. Over the years, I have brought the Senate Judiciary Committee \nto Vermont several times for field hearings to explore community \nefforts to counter drug-related crime in rural America.\n\n[[Page S4936]]\n\nOn each occasion, I have looked to Tom for testimony about the work he \nand his organization have done with youthful offenders. Tom not only \noffers his knowledge of work going on around the State, but provides \nthe expertise of his organization, and personal stories about the lives \nof the young people he works with.\n  As a fellow photographer, I would be remiss if I failed to note that \nTom's office documents a life full of adventure. His walls depict the \nbureau's accomplishments--such as when he was invited to represent \nVermont's 21st Century Community Learning Center Programs at a White \nHouse Ceremony hosted by President Bill Clinton. They also capture the \nfaces of those who inspire him, like the pupils for whom he served as a \nteacher and counselor at the Wittlich Prison in West Germany.\n  I believe Tom embodies the core principles of what it takes to serve \nVermont's youth, from his skill as an administrator, to his \ncontribution as a caring person. I thank Tom for all that he does, and \nI commend his work to the Senate as an example to others. We are \ngrateful for his service to Vermont's young people and families for the \npast 31 years. Marcelle and I wish Tom and his family all the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4936-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4936]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                    LADY SEA WARRIORS SOFTBALL TEAM\n\n Mr. AKAKA.

Mr. President, I ask my colleagues to join me in \npaying tribute to Robert Little Ebert, a respected and inspiring \nMaryland community leader and philanthropist who passed away at age 93 \non May 9, 2010.\n  Mr. Ebert served as Allegany County commissioner from 1962 to 1970, \nand he continued to dedicate himself to the progress and prosperity of \nthe area throughout his lifetime. Mr. Ebert was especially dedicated to \neradicating poverty throughout his community, and he demonstrated a \nconsistent willingness to help people through his involvement in \nvarious philanthropic and community organizations.\n  Mr. Ebert was born in Parkersburg, WV in 1916, and attended Marietta \nCollege in Ohio, graduating in 1938. He later worked as a radio \nnewscaster in the Midwest and served as an Ensign in the U.S. Navy \nduring World War II. Following the war, Mr. Ebert moved to Cumberland, \nMD, to join his mother in the S.T. Little Jewelry Company, a family \nbusiness founded by his great-grandfather in 1851. Mr. Ebert eventually \nbecame president and general manager of the company, and he devoted \nhimself to the development and success of his business's locale in \ndowntown Cumberland.\n  Mr. Ebert's leadership and business acumen helped shape downtown \nCumberland. He served as chairman of the Downtown Cumberland Business \nAssociation and the Downtown Development Commission. He served as \nchairman of the Board of the Allegany County Department of Social \nServices and as chairman of the Allegany County Chapter of the American \nRed Cross and was involved with civic organizations such as the \nCumberland Cultural Foundation and the Cumberland Rotary Club.\n  While Mr. Ebert often wished for his charitable contributions to \nremain anonymous and tried to stay behind-the-scenes, his philanthropic \nendeavors eventually inspired him to become the founding donor of the \nCommunity Trust Foundation. The Community Trust Foundation, established \nin 2006, serves Maryland's Allegany and Garrett Counties as well as \nWest Virginia's Mineral County by providing the administrative \nservices, sophisticated investment management, professional advice, and \nstewardship that help communities maximize their charitable giving and \ninvesting.\n  The Community Trust Foundation served as a stepping stone for Mr. \nEbert to establish the Elta Mae and Robert Little Ebert Family Hope \nFund. The Family Hope Fund is a leader in fostering cooperation and \ncollaboration among the area's many philanthropic organizations that \nwork to prevent poverty. The fund has made, and will continue to make, \nenormous achievements thanks to Mr. Ebert's leadership and dedication.\n  Mr. Ebert was immensely successful professionally, and he was also a \nloving husband, father, grandfather, and great-grandfather. He leaves \nbehind three daughters, five granddaughters, and four great-\ngrandchildren as well as countless friends and admirers.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in remembering the many \naccomplishments of Mr. Robert Little Ebert and in recognizing him as a \ntruly inspiring community leader and humanitarian.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4936-4", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4936-S4937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          REGENT, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today I recognize a community in \nNorth Dakota celebrating its 100th anniversary. On June 24 to 27, the \nresidents of Regent will gather to celebrate their community's history \nand founding.\n  On the peaceful prairies of southwestern North Dakota, a city of just \nover 200 people will be joyfully celebrating 100 years of trials, \ntribulations, growth, and happiness. Regent was\n\n[[Page S4937]]\n\nfounded on the railroad lines in 1910. Railroad officials gave it a \nregal-sounding name, thinking it would become the county seat. Early in \nits history, Regent was billed as ``The Queen City'' or ``The Wonder \nCity.''\n  My good friend and colleague, a former North Dakota State tax \ncommissioner and current U.S. Senator, Byron Dorgan is from this great \ntown. Senator Dorgan has never forgotten his roots, and that has helped \nmake him into the highly respected and dedicated public servant that he \nis.\n  Today, the Enchanted Highway has brought a larger than life size \nexample of the community's hard work and dedication to the State. The \nEnchanted Highway is off of Interstate 94 and is approximately 20 miles \neast of Dickinson, ND. It then extends for 32 miles south to Regent. \nThe world's largest scrap metal sculptures portray part of the \ncountryside's wonder and beauty from ``Pheasants on the Prairie'' to \n``Deer Crossing.''\n  The community currently has the luxury of enjoying the finer aspects \nof life, such as fishing, participating in community activities, or \nspending time with family. The community's energy can be seen with this \nyear's centennial celebration, filled with the zest and heart of the \npeople. Over 4 days, Regent will be enjoying a watermelon feed, all-\nschool reunion, a dance, parade, choral performances, and many more \ncelebratory events.\n  Mr. President, I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Regent, \nND, and its residents on their first 100 years and in wishing them well \nin the future. By honoring Regent and all the other historic small \ntowns of North Dakota, we keep the great tradition of the pioneering \nfrontier spirit alive for future generations. It is places such as \nRegent that have helped to shape this country into what it is today, \nwhich is why this community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Regent has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4937-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         BRADLEY, SOUTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to the 125th \nanniversary of the founding of Bradley, SD. This small town has seen \nmore than its fair share of hardships, but with strength and hard work, \nthe citizens consistently band together to make the town an even better \nplace to live and work.\n  As the Chicago, Milwaukee, and St. Paul Railroad expanded, the \ncompany decided to build a settlement for the workers to get mail \ndelivered. They called it Prairie Hill. Once trains began running, \nbusinesses began forming 2 miles south of the original location. With \nland donated from the McKinney family, Bradley was eventually formed. \nThis small town quickly became a popular location for homesteaders and \ndeveloped into the largest primary wheat market in the country. In \n1891, a fire nearly destroyed the town. Only a couple of buildings and \nhomes withstood the fire. This strong community rallied together to \nrebuild their town. Another fire struck in 1916, but 800 volunteers \ncame together, using a bucket brigade to again save the town.\n  Bradley acquired its name through an interesting turn of events. A \ngroup of laborers and a railroad official got in a brawl early one day. \nW.R. Bradley was visiting the town and saved the life of the chief \nengineer for construction. He was honored by having the town named \nafter him.\n  Like a lot of small towns formed in South Dakota at this time, \nBradley started as a railroad stop but quickly became more. Bradley is \na caring community of people who work together when times get tough. \nThey will honor their historical milestone with a weekend celebration, \nincluding craft booth and a food booth, a 5K race, and a softball \ntournament. I wish them the best for their weekend and their \nfuture.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4937-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO WILLIAM A. RICHARDS\n\n Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I would like to recognize the \naccomplishments of William A. Richards--a friend, a colleague, and a \ndedicated public servant. Bill is retiring this month after nearly half \na century of service to the U.S. Army and the Department of Defense. I \nhad the privilege of working with Bill as an instructor at West Point. \nHis lengthy career, as a soldier and as a civilian, truly exemplifies \nthe motto of the Academy--``Duty, Honor, Country.''\n  Bill graduated from West Point in 1967 and served as an infantry \nofficer in Vietnam and Germany. He continued his education at the \nWoodrow Wilson School at Princeton, receiving a master's degree in \npublic policy. He then returned to West Point to supervise the core \ncurriculum in American Government.\n  Following his return to West Point, Bill was selected for the \nprestigious position of speechwriter and executive assistant to NATO's \nSupreme Allied Commander--Europe. His exceptional work in this position \nresulted in his next assignment as speechwriter to Defense Secretary \nCaspar Weinberger. Bill held this position until his retirement in \n1989, after serving for 22 years in uniform.\n  Bill then started a second career as a budget analyst in the office \nof the Under Secretary of Defense, Comptroller, at the Pentagon. His \nmilitary experience and speechwriting skills enabled him to analyze and \ntranslate the complexity of the annual defense budget. After 20 years \nof serving our Nation in this role, Bill retires as someone who is \nhighly respected for his knowledge, experience, and dedication.\n  I congratulate him on a job well done. He leaves a proud and enduring \nlegacy of public service. I wish Bill and his wife Donna the very best \nin the years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4937-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MONROE ROTARY CLUB\n\n Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, today I am proud to recognize the \nmembers of the Monroe, LA, Rotary Club who have served our country \nhonorably during war.\n  I would like to thank Kent Anderson, Edward Cascio, Tom Dansby, Kitty \nDegree, Donnie Franklin, George Hutchison, John Morris, Walt Pierron, \nand Barney Tucker for their courageous military service during wartime \nand for continued civic service in the greater Monroe area.\n  With the motto ``Service Above Self'' it is no surprise that these \nmen would be inclined to be a member of Rotary. Their lifetime of \nservice is exhibited not only in service to their fellow citizens \nduring a time of war but also in continued commitment to their \ncommunity.\n  Rotary's four-way test asks four questions of all things members \nthink, say, and do. These questions are: Is it the truth? Is it fair to \nall concerned? Will it build goodwill and better friendships? Will it \nbe beneficial to all concerned? These four simple questions have proven \nto be excellent guidelines for a life of service. We thank these men \nfor serving the Monroe community with these principles. The Monroe \nRotary Club has sponsored many local projects, including Boy Scouts, \nGirl Scouts, youth baseball, the Food Bank of Northeast Louisiana, and \nthe Salvation Army, to name just a few.\n  Thus, today, I honor these veterans for their distinguished service \nin the U.S. armed services during wartime, and for their continued \nservice to the State of Louisiana in the Monroe Rotary Club.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/15/senate-section/article/S4937-4", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4937]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:45 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5502.

A bill to amend title 23, United States Code, to improve \nhighway mobility in rural States for the benefit of all States; to the \nCommittee on Environment and Public Works.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleague Senator \nBarrasso in introducing the Rural Mobility and Access for America Act.\n  The transportation challenges in rural States are unique. In my State \nof North Dakota, we have more miles of road per capita than any State \nin the Nation. There are more than 11,000 miles of highway in North \nDakota, which translates into approximately 166 miles of road for every \n1,000 people in North Dakota. We have a very large road network with a \nsmall population base to support it. In fact, North Dakota only has 16 \npeople supporting each lane mile of Federal-aid road. The national \naverage is 129 people per lane mile.\n  Highways in North Dakota and other rural States connect the Nation \nand help ensure the effective movement of people and goods across the \ncountry. Today, the highways in the western part of my State are being \nimpacted by a rise in truck traffic as a result of the oil boom \noccurring from the development of the Bakken formation. Our roads and \nhighways are seeing a dramatic increase in trucks that are transporting \nsupplies to the oil fields or oil to gathering lines.\n  The agriculture industry is also reliant on a strong, nationally \nconnected road network to move products and services. Approximately 69 \npercent of the goods shipped annually from North Dakota are carried by \ntruck. Significant and growing agricultural businesses throughout my \nstate rely on the road network to receive raw goods and transport their \nfinished products to market.\n  In addition, we have a large percentage of truck traffic that crosses \nour state. Sixty percent of the truck traffic does not originate or \nterminate within the state, but it still has an impact on our highways. \nIn the next 10 years, commercial trucking in North Dakota is expected \nto increase by 42 percent.\n  Discussions surrounding the reauthorization of the highway bill have \nfocused on congestion and the needs of large metropolitan areas. Some \nof the proposals being advanced shift money from the traditional \nhighway formula programs to set-asides for large metro areas. However, \nmaintaining a nationally connected system requires substantial \ninvestments in highways in and across rural areas as well.\n  It is important that our transportation policy continues to recognize \nthe importance of investment in rural States, like North Dakota. The \nbill I am introducing with Senator Barrasso makes certain rural States \nare not left behind. Under this proposal, if a metro mobility program \nis included in the highway reauthorization, a corresponding rural \nprogram would be funded at a level equal to \\1/3\\ of the amount \nprovided for the metro mobility program. The funds would be distributed \nevenly to the 18 States that qualify under our bill, and the States \ncould use the funds for any of the eligible uses under the Surface \nTransportation Program.\n  Our bill provides an important balance to make sure our roads, both \nurban and rural, get the support necessary to maintain a nationally \nconnected system. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado:\n  S. 3487. A bill to amend the Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act \nof 1978 to provide electric consumers the right to access certain \nelectric energy information, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss a bill \nthat I filed, called the Electric Consumer Right to Know Act. This bill \ntakes a common-sense step toward broadening consumers' access to data \nabout their electricity usage. On top of that, I am proud to say that \nthis idea came directly from one of my Colorado constituents.\n  In today's marketplace, consumers have a clear understanding of the \nprice of gasoline and what their car mileage means for their pocket \nbooks. They also have ready access to the number of minutes remaining \non their cell phone. However, consumers lack clear, timely data about \ntheir electricity use and its price. Providing increased transparency \nwill help consumers with their decisions about electricity usage in \ntheir home or business.\n  The bill I filed today would provide timely access to these data by \nestablishing consumers' clear right to access data on their own \nelectricity usage. This right is an important step toward a more \neffective, reliable and efficient electrical grid, and a step toward \nhelping consumers use electricity more efficiently and save money on \ntheir electric bills.\n  For the past year I have been travelling across Colorado as part of a \nwork force tour to talk directly to Coloradans and hear their \ninnovative policy ideas to create jobs, including hosting an Energy \nJobs Summit in Denver back in February. As part of this Summit, we \nasked experts in energy policy and business to join us for a \nconversation about how we can better position Colorado and the United \nStates to lead in the 21st century clean energy economy.\n  We heard from Energy Secretary Steven Chu, Governor Bill Ritter, \nSenator Michael Bennet, and Congressman Ed Perlmutter. But, more \nimportantly, we heard from Coloradans who came to share their views on \nwhat the Federal Government can do, or in some instances not do, to \nsupport job creation and transition to cleaner and more efficient \nenergy use.\n  One consumer participant at the Summit noted that, even though he had \na smart meter at his home, his power company would not let him access \nhis electrical meter readings to learn how he was using electricity. If \nhe could access those readings, he could better understand his energy \nuse, learn how to be more energy efficient and save money. That is why \nI am introducing the Electric Consumer Right to Know Act to improve \ncommunication between the consumers and their utility, spur innovation \nin developing creative technologies that will save energy, and provide \nclarity while these programs are being developed.\n  This bill has several important parts. First, it establishes a \nframework for the right to access information, defining specifically \nwhat that right means, and giving clarity to those who will further \ndevelop and enforce that right. This bill says that if you have a smart \nmeter, or similar electronic device that reads electric energy usage, \nthat you ought to have access to the utility company's data on your \nenergy use.\n  How that access is granted is delineated in three ways in this bill:\n  If your meter communicates with your utility on an hourly or shorter \ntime interval, my bill states that your meter readings should be \navailable within 24 hours.\n  Second, if your smart meter is capable of communicating energy use \ndata directly from your meter, under this bill, you have the right to \naccess those data and use them directly at your home or business.\n\n[[Page S4941]]\n\n  Third, for consumers who have standard meters, with this bill, there \nare no additional requirements except that your readings shall be \navailable electronically in a timely manner.\n  Next, the bill directs the Federal Regulatory Energy Commission to \nconvene an open, extensive and inclusive stakeholder process to work \nthrough the details of this measure to ensure that implementing the \nconsumers' right to access their information also retains consumer \nprivacy, and ensures the integrity and reliability of the grid.\n  The outcome of this process will be national guidelines establishing \nthe right of consumers to access their electricity data, including \nminimum national standards that utilities must meet to ensure that \nright of access. In developing those minimum standards, the FERC will \ntake into consideration the ongoing and important work at the National \nInstitute of Standards and Technology in developing a smart grid \nroadmap, as well as the innovative state and local programs already \nbeing developed across the country to integrate smart meters into the \nelectrical grid, including Colorado, California, Texas, Pennsylvania, \nand others.\n  In Colorado, Xcel Energy has been working with the City of Boulder on \na pilot program called SmartGridCity to develop a community-scale smart \ngrid with over 20,000 residents participating. Not only are these \nconsumers improving their understanding of their electricity use, Xcel \nnotes that they have already avoided several blackouts due to the \nimproved communication between consumers and the grid. Power \ninterruptions cost the American economy roughly $80 billion per year \nand \\2/3\\ of those losses come from interruptions lasting less than \nfive minutes. I am proud to see Coloradans and our state's utilities \ntaking important steps together in learning how to make the grid more \nreliable, efficient, and help save everyone money.\n  Finally, part of ensuring the right to access your data includes the \nright to retain the privacy of your data. When consumers gain access to \ntheir data, they will also need to clearly understand how it will be \nused, especially when consumers grant third-party access to it. This is \nwhy this bill states that the FERC will establish, among other \nimportant measures, guidelines for consumer consent requirements. \nRetaining privacy is critical to building consumer trust in the smart \ngrid and facilitating the transition to when the smart grid becomes a \npart of everyday life for every American family.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and all interested \nstakeholders in establishing this right, defining it in a way that \neliminates unintended consequences, and enforcing this right in a way \nthat improves the efficient use of electrical energy.\n  This bill is an important first step in implementing smart meters \nacross the country, moving us toward an electrical grid that is more \nreliable and more efficient a smart grid' if you will. There are \nseveral pieces of the puzzle that will be required to realize that \nfuture, and one critical part of that puzzle is the right of consumers \nto access their electricity data. I urge my colleagues of both parties \nto join me in supporting this important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. SPECTER (for himself, Ms. Stabenow, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 3493. A bill to reauthorize and enhance Johanna's Law to increase \npublic awareness and knowledge with respect to gynecologic cancers; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to \nintroduce The Gynecological Cancer Education and Awareness Act of 2010 \nalso known as Johanna's Law.\n  Every year, over 80,000 women in the United States are newly \ndiagnosed with some form of gynecologic cancer such as ovarian, \nuterine, or cervical cancer. In 2009, 28,000 American women are \nestimated to have died from these cancers.\n  Early detection of these cancers must be improved to decrease this \ntragic loss of life. Unfortunately, thousands of women in the U.S. each \nyear aren't diagnosed until their cancers have progressed to more \nadvanced and far less treatable stages. In the case of ovarian cancer, \nwhich kills more women in the U.S. than all other gynecologic cancers \ncombined, more than 40 percent of all new diagnoses take place after \nthis cancer has progressed beyond its earliest and most survivable \nstage.\n  Women are often diagnosed many months, sometimes more than a year \nafter they first experience symptoms due to a lack of knowledge of \nearly warning signs of gynecological cancers. Adding to the challenge \nof a prompt and accurate diagnosis is the similarity of gynecological \ncancer symptoms to those of more common gastrointestinal conditions and \nbenign gynecologic conditions such as perimenopause and menopause. \nWomen too often receive diagnoses reflecting these benign conditions \nwithout their physicians having first considered gynecologic cancers as \na possible cause of the symptoms.\n  The Gynecological Cancer Education and Awareness Act has improved \nearly detection of gynecologic cancers by creating a national awareness \nand an education outreach campaign to inform physicians and individuals \nof the risk factors and symptoms of these diseases. When gynecological \ncancer is detected in its earliest stage, patients 5-year survival \nrates are greater than 90 percent and many go on to live normal, \nhealthy lives.\n  The national awareness campaign has been carried out by the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, HHS, to increase women's \nawareness and knowledge of gynecologic cancers. The campaign has \nmaintained and distributed a supply of written materials that provide \ninformation to the public about gynecologic cancers. Further, the \nprogram has developed public service announcements encouraging women to \ndiscuss their risks for gynecologic cancers with their physicians, and \ninform the public about the availability of written materials and how \nto obtain them. The cost of continuing this awareness campaign is $5.5 \nmillion per year from 2010-2012, totaling $16.5 million.\n  The educational outreach campaign will be carried out through \ndemonstration grants through HHS. These demonstration grants will go to \nlocal and national non-profits to test different outreach and education \nstrategies, including those directed at providers, women, and their \nfamilies. Groups with demonstrated expertise in gynecologic cancer \neducation, treatment, or in working with groups of women who are at \nespecially high risk will be given priority. Grant funding recipients \nwill also be asked to work in cooperation with health providers, \nhospitals, and state health departments. The projected cost of the \neducational outreach campaign is $5 million per year from 2010-2012, \ntotaling $15 million.\n  This legislation was brought to my attention by my friend Fran \nDrescher, who was diagnosed with uterine cancer in 2000 and whose \ndiagnosis was also delayed due to her lack of knowledge about symptoms \nof this disease. She has recovered from uterine cancer and is \nadvocating on behalf of gynecological cancer awareness. She also \nbrought to my attention one of the many victims of gynecological \ncancers, Johanna Silver Gordon, after whom this bill is named, who was \ndiagnosed at an advanced stage of ovarian cancer.\n  Johanna, the daughter and sister of physicians, was extremely health \nconscious taking the appropriate measures to maintain a healthy \nlifestyle including exercising regularly, eating nutritiously, and \nreceiving annual pap smears and pelvic exams. Johanna however did not \nhave the information to know that the gastric symptoms she experienced \nin the fall of 1996 were common symptoms of ovarian cancer. She didn't \nlearn these crucial facts until after she was diagnosed at an advanced \nstage of this cancer. Despite aggressive treatment that included four \nsurgeries, various types of chemotherapy, and participation in two \nclinical trials, Johanna died from ovarian cancer 3 1/2 years after \nbeing diagnosed. Johanna is survived by her sister Sheryl Silver who \nhas tirelessly worked to increase the information available regarding \ngynecological cancers.\n  As former Chairman and Ranking Member of the Labor, Health and Human \nServices, and Education Appropriations Subcommittee, I led, along with \nSenator Harkin, the effort to double funding for the National \nInstitutes of Health, NIH, over 5 years. Funding\n\n[[Page S4942]]\n\nfor the NIH has increased from $12 billion in fiscal year 1995 to $27 \nbillion in fiscal year 2003. In 2004, the NIH, through the National \nCancer Institute provided $243 million for gynecological cancer \nresearch. We must continue this growth to gain more information about \ngynecological cancers so that we can find a cure for this cancer.\n  I believe this bill can provide desperately needed information to \nphysicians and individuals so that women can be diagnosed faster and \nmore effectively. I urge my colleagues to move this legislation forward \npromptly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3493\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
