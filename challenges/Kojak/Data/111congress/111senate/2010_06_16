Mr. President, last night the President provided more \ndetail on his administration's efforts to stop the oilspill in the \ngulf. If implemented successfully, some of what he said was \nencouraging. However, I wish the President would have used this \nopportunity to focus entirely on stopping the spill and to cleaning it \nup instead of using this crisis as an opportunity to push for a new \nnational energy tax.\n  The immediate issue here is a broken pipe that has been spewing \nhundreds of thousands of gallons of oil a day into the ocean for more \nthan 8 weeks. The fact that the White House wants to use this crisis as \nan excuse to push more of its legislative agenda on the American \npeople--with the same kinds of arguments it used to push health care--\nis really nothing short of startling.\n  During the health care debate, Americans were told we couldn't afford \nto put off the administration's vision of government-driven reform. \nHealth care costs were rising so quickly, the President said, that \ninaction was not an option. We heard the same thing last night. It is a \nrecurring theme out of this White House.\n  In the middle of a jobs crisis, Americans were told they needed to \nspend nearly $1 trillion on longstanding Democratic priorities that \nDemocrats called a stimulus bill. They passed it, and we lost another 3 \nmillion jobs.\n  Out-of-control health care costs are pricing people out of the market \nand threatening to bankrupt government, so they passed a massive \ngovernment-driven health care bill that promises to send health care \ncosts even higher than they already are.\n  Our financial crisis was caused in large part by recklessness at \ngovernment-sponsored entities such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, and \ntheir solution to that crisis was to pass a massive government \nintrusion into Main Street without even addressing Fannie or Freddie.\n\n[[Page S4952]]\n\n  Now, in the midst of the worst environmental catastrophe in American \nhistory, they are talking about a new national energy task to achieve \ntheir ideological goal of passing global warming legislation. Americans \nare pleading with the administration to fix the immediate problem in \nthe gulf and the White House wants to give us a new national energy tax \ninstead.\n  Every time we face a crisis, it seems this administration takes us on \nanother ideological tour of the far left's to-do list, when all the \nAmerican people want from it are some straightforward, practical \nsolutions.\n  So the White House may view the oilspill as an opportunity to push \nits agenda here in Washington, but Americans are more concerned about \nwhat it plans to do to solve the crisis down in the gulf. Americans \nhave had enough of this crisis rhetoric coming out of this White House. \nThey want real answers to real problems. And it doesn't get more real \nthan the problem in the gulf.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/16/senate-section/article/S4952-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, last night the President of the United \nStates addressed one of the toughest issues any President has ever had \nto face. This is an environmental disaster of historic magnitude. It is \none that could not have been anticipated. We have never had anything \nquite like it--at least near the United States. It is certainly one the \nPresident and our government did everything they could do to respond, \nbut this frustrating situation continues.\n  What the President reminded us of last night is that we need to \ncoordinate every effort, but understand that, in the end, there is no \nU.S. department of deep sea drilling. What it comes down to is that we \nneed to turn to the private sector, which has the resources, the \nexpertise, and the capability of not only dealing with the continuing \noilspill in the Gulf of Mexico but the aftermath as well.\n  It has been clear from the outset that this President has been very \nfirm and resolute that British Petroleum, this oil company, is going to \nbe held responsible for the damage that has been done. It will be at \ntheir expense, and not at the expense of American taxpayers, that we \nwill help the businesses affected and do anything within our power to \nrestore the devastation which has occurred to the environment.\n  It was interesting yesterday that in testimony before the House of \nRepresentatives, many of the leaders of the major oil companies that \ncompete with BP were as forthright publicly as they have been privately \nin other conversations. They made it clear that many of the activities \nengaged in by BP were inconsistent with the highest standards of their \nindustry. They made it clear that when it came to this blowout \npreventer, which should have stopped the flow of oil, it was \ninadequate. It hasn't been tested. It was not the kind of technology \nthat had redundancy built in so that there would be some peace of mind \nand understanding that in the event of a rig disaster, it would work. \nIt failed, and it failed in a situation which has caused more \nenvironmental damage in our country than we have ever seen from one \noccurrence.\n  I saw 21 years ago what happened in the Prince William Sound of \nAlaska, and I can tell you that more than two decades later, they are \nstill suffering--suffering from lawsuits against the Exxon oil company, \nwhich unfortunately were ruled against the plaintiffs; suffering from \nenvironmental damage which will continue at least indefinitely.\n  What we have in the situation in the gulf is different. We have an \nadmission by BP that they are at fault and an acceptance of \nresponsibility for what they characterize as legitimate claims. I think \nit is proper--and many of us in the Senate joined majority leader Harry \nReid in making the request--that BP set aside some $20 billion in an \nescrow fund, a trust fund that will be available to pay for these \ndamages. It troubles me that this company is talking about declaring a \ndividend and paying out billions of dollars to its shareholders when, \nfrankly, we don't know what the ultimate cost is going to be of the \ncleanup in the Gulf of Mexico. I want to be certain BP continues in \nbusiness and meets its responsibility, that it sets aside the funds \nnecessary to protect our Nation from the damage it has caused.\n  I also believe we need to increase the responsibility of oil \ncompanies when it comes to future drilling. Right now, there is a tax \non each barrel of oil of 8 cents--8 cents. A barrel of oil is now \nselling for about $75. So 8 cents on each barrel is paid by an oil \ncompany into an oilspill liability fund. That has generated a little \nover $1 billion in the event that we run into a disaster which needs to \nbe taken care of. In the BP circumstance, the company is assuming \nliability. But tomorrow, God forbid, if another tragedy occurs with a \ncompany that doesn't have BP's resources, it will be this oilspill \nliability fund that will be called on to repair the damage, and $1 \nbillion is not enough. Eight cents a barrel is not enough.\n  Before the Senate today is an extenders bill which will increase the \namount per barrel to 41 cents. This will be gathered together over time \nfrom the oil producers and the oil industry into an insurance fund, a \nbasic oilspill insurance fund. I think that is only reasonable. The \nbill also increases the liability cap of companies under this oilspill \nliability to $5 billion. Currently, it is $1 billion. So both of these \nitems are in our bill in an effort to hold the major oil companies \naccountable for any future disasters and to protect the taxpayers from \npaying out-of-pocket or paying out of the Treasury for any of these \ncosts.\n  What is interesting is that the Republicans are going to come forward \nwith a substitute brought on by John Thune, who is a Senator from South \nDakota. The Republican substitute eliminates the increase in the tax on \na barrel of oil for the oilspill liability fund. Of course, the big oil \ncompanies don't want to pay it, and this elimination of the tax is \ncertainly on their agenda. It is unfortunate that Republican Senators \nare going to come forward and propose this. We need this money in the \noilspill liability fund. To have a situation where this money is not \nbeing collected leaves us vulnerable in terms of future disasters where \nthe taxpayers will be picking up the bill.\n  There is a provision in the Thune amendment, the Republican \nsubstitute, which eliminates the provision in our bill relating to the \nTax Code when it comes to American companies shipping jobs overseas. \nMost of us believe that if we are going to get out of this recession, \nwe need to strengthen American businesses and certainly hire more \npeople in the United States, pay them a decent wage, and bring them \nback to work and out of the ranks of the unemployed.\n  At this point in time, many American companies are locating \nproduction facilities overseas because of perverse incentives which we \nhave created in our Tax Code. The bill brought to the floor eliminates \nmany of these incentives--eliminates the tax loopholes companies are \nusing to be more profitable by locating overseas. So the Thune \namendment, the Republican substitute amendment, comes forward and says: \nWe don't want to do that. We\n\n[[Page S4953]]\n\nwant to leave in the Tax Code--according to the Republicans--those \nprovisions which create incentives to ship American jobs overseas. That \nmakes no sense to me.\n\n  Last night I attended a meeting of the deficit commission, to which I \nwas appointed by Senator Reid. There was an economist there who tried \nto make the argument that allowing businesses in the United States--and \ngiving them incentives, incidentally--to locate and produce overseas \nwas good for the American economy. He argued if they could produce more \noverseas, it would ultimately mean they would be more profitable and \nproduce more jobs in the United States.\n  I told him if that logic applied, then we ought to have a record \nnumber of manufacturing jobs because, over the last 20 years, more and \nmore American businesses have moved production facilities offshore, \noverseas.\n  Instead, the opposite is true. In my State and in Michigan, all \nacross the United States we have seen manufacturing jobs declining \ndramatically while production facilities have been sent overseas. This \ntheory that is obviously behind the Republican Thune substitute is that \nwe ought to reward American companies for locating and producing \noverseas. I do not agree with that. I hope we will oppose the Thune \nsubstitute and we will move as soon as we can to deal with the \nsituation where we have increased jobs here in the United States to \ndeal with this recession.\n  I understand we are going to have speakers later on in the Democratic \nside and I want to reserve time for those speakers. I reserve the \nremainder of time on the Democratic side, and if there is no one here \nto speak on the Republican side, I will yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  Is it my understanding that the time will be taken from the \nRepublican side at this point?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I believe the Republicans, if I am not mistaken, under \nthe unanimous consent were first in morning business.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum, with the \nunderstanding the time that runs now will come from the time previously \nallotted to the Republican side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, could you please let me know when I \nhave consumed 10 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/16/senate-section/article/S4953-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4953-S4954]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MISSED OPPORTUNITY\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, all of us watched the President's \nremarks last night. It is rare for a President to make a speech from \nthe Oval Office. President Reagan did it with the Challenger tragedy. \nPresident George W. Bush, spoke about 9/11. I thought the President was \nright to focus on what the government is doing to clean up the oil \nspill, and what we are doing to help those who are hurt. I think he \nmissed an opportunity, though, in terms of looking to the energy \nfuture.\n  He mentioned the climate bill. Of course that is House passed cap-\nand-trade bill which doesn't have enough support to pass the Senate. He \nmentioned windmills and solar panels, which have nothing to do with \nreducing our dependence on foreign oil. I thought the missed \nopportunity was the President could have announced a mini-Manhattan \nProject to reduce our dependence on foreign oil by electrifying half \nour cars and trucks, which we could do without building any new \npowerplants by plugging them in at night. The President is in favor of \nthat. Secretary Chu is a leader in it. In a bipartisan way we support \nthat goal. All 41 Republican Senators support electrifying our cars and \ntrucks. Senator Dorgan, Senator Merkley, and I support legislation for \nthat. He could have talked about that.\n  A second part of the clean energy future could have been creating the \nenvironment to build 100 new nuclear power plants. The President has \ntaken some impressive steps to create a better environment for nuclear \npower. All 41 Republican Senators support that. That would be for clean \nelectricity, not for fuel, but it would be a clean energy future.\n  Third, the President could have focused on mini-Manhattan Projects \nfor energy research and development, such as reducing the cost of solar \npower by a factor of 4; recapturing carbon from coal plants; trying to \ninvent a 500-mile battery, which would have made sure that we electrify \na significant part of our cars and trucks in America; recycling used \nnuclear fuel; and biofuels--all 41 Republican Senators support the goal \nof doubling energy research and development. So does the President. So \nthose are three steps toward clean energy independence that we agree \non.\n  He mentioned windmills and solar panels, which have nothing to do \nwith reducing our dependence on foreign oil--those are for electricity, \nnot fuel. They are puny amounts of electricity, in any event. If he \nwould stick with the things that we and he agree on, he could have used \nthat speech for an important step forward for our country. In that \nsense, I think it was a missed opportunity.\n  This past weekend the President sent a letter to Congress urging us \nto approve $50 billion in emergency aid to State and local governments. \nI want to speak about that today from the vantage point I have as a \nformer Governor and former U.S. Secretary of Education. According to \nthe Wall Street Journal on Monday, the letter said budget cuts at State \nand local levels were leading to massive layoffs of teachers, \npolicemen, and firefighters.\n  The two points I want to make are that, No. 1, we here in \nWashington--I tried not to, but the majority did--created this \nfinancial cliff over which the States are about to run. And, No. 2, \nwhen it comes to the question of $23 billion for teachers, I think we \nneed to ask, where is the money going to go? And from whose \nschoolchildren are we going to borrow it? Because right now we do not \nhave extra money lying around in Washington, DC. We have a great big \nproblem with spending and debt.\n  Let me start with what I said first, which is that we in Washington \nhave created this financial cliff over which State Governors are \nrunning. As we were debating the health care bill I said, not really in \njest, that everybody who votes for it ought to be forced to go home and \nserve as Governor of their State under the new rules.\n  Take Tennessee, for example. We were very fortunate that our State \nwas one of the two winners in the Race to the Top education plan. Give \ncredit to the Governor and teachers in the State. Tennessee will get a \nhalf billion dollars as a result of it. Yet, according to our Governor, \nthe health care bill will take away more than twice as much during the \nsame period of time by imposing $1.1 billion in new Medicaid costs on \nthe State between 2014 and 2019. So we are causing problems for the \nState that caused the layoffs.\n  Let me not ask you to take my word for it. Here is a January op-ed \nfrom the Wall Street Journal by the Democratic Lieutenant Governor of \nNew York, Mr. Ravitch, who says the Federal stimulus, which Congress \npassed at the beginning of 2009:\n\n     . . . has provided significant budget relief to the states. . \n     . .\n\n  He approved of that.\n\n     but this relief is temporary and makes it harder for States \n     to cut expenditures. In major areas such as transportation, \n     education and health care, stimulus funds come with strings \n     attached. These strings prevent States from substituting \n     federal money for state funds, require states to spend \n     minimum amounts of their own funds, and prevent states from \n     tightening eligibility standards for benefits.\n\n  Lieutenant Governor Ravitch goes on to say:\n\n       Because of these requirements, states, instead of cutting \n     spending in transportation, education and health care, have \n     been forced to keep most of their expenditures at previous \n     levels. . . .\n\n  We did that. Congress did that.\n\n     . . . and use federal funds only as supplements. The net \n     result is this: The federal stimulus has led States to \n     increase overall spending in these core areas, which in \n     effect has only raised the height of the cliff from which \n     state spending will fall if stimulus funds evaporate.\n\n  That is the Lieutenant Governor of New York talking about the \nevaporation of stimulus funds which comes\n\n[[Page S4954]]\n\nat the end of this year and he is saying we made it harder for States \nto pay their bills. At the time the stimulus package was passed, \neveryone said it was one-time funding. All of us knew that Medicaid \ncosts were overwhelming the States. Still, Congress went ahead--the \nmajority, in any event--and increased the federal match for Medicaid, \nand required States not to change eligibility requirements. Thus they \ncreated this financial cliff at the end of the year which will cause \nthe States' share for Medicaid spending to increase from an average of \n34 percent to 43 percent, a net increase of $39 billion in costs for \n2011. We are getting close to the $50 billion we are being asked to \nbail States out for.\n\n  Let me say a word about teacher salaries. The first question is, \nwhere is the rest of the money going to go? The request, as it has been \ntalked about, says this will save 100,000, maybe 300,000 teacher jobs. \nWe are supposed to appropriate $23 billion for that purpose.\n  At $100,000 that works out to about $230,000 per teacher job saved. \nIf we are saving 300,000 teacher jobs with that $23 billion, that works \nout to $76,667 per teacher job saved. The average national teacher's \nsalary is $46,752. Where does the rest of the money go?\n  At the beginning of this administration there was a huge increase in \neducation funds; $97 billion over 2 years for elementary and secondary \neducation and $53.6 billion for the State Fiscal Stabilization fund. We \nwere assured this was one-time funding. In April 2009, the Department \nof Education itself said in its guidance to the States on how to spend \nthe money:\n\n       The [funds are] expected to be a one-time infusion of \n     substantial new resources. These funds should be invested in \n     ways that do not result in unsustainable continuing \n     commitments after the funding expires.\n\n  What we could have said is, we don't have any more money either, \nStates. We just print it up here. So don't expect us to send you \nanymore.\n  The U.S. Department of Education helpfully suggested what some of \nthose one-time expenditures might be--making improvements in teacher \neffectiveness; establishing pre-K-to-college-and-career data systems; \nmaking progress toward rigorous college- and career-ready standards; \nproviding targeted, selective support; and effective interventions for \nthe lowest performing schools. In other words, the States and schools \nwere told: Don't spend this money on continuing programs. Spend it \nonce.\n  Our Governor, a Democratic Governor in Tennessee, got the message. \nGovernor Bredesen said in his State of the Union Address in 2009:\n\n       Please let me make it clear that no proposed version of the \n     stimulus is any panacea or silver bullet; substantial cuts \n     are still needed under any circumstances. Furthermore, it is \n     vital to remember that this stimulus money is one-time \n     funding.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The 10 minutes of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the Chair. I see none of my colleagues here.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Senator Barrasso from Wyoming is \nwaiting.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask for another 60 seconds to conclude my remarks. I \nthank the Chair.\n  When we think about the funding, we need to remember the best things \nfor us to do. They are to stop imposing health care mandates on States, \nwhich make it impossible for them to pay their bills; and to properly \nsupport public education, especially public higher education, which is \ngoing to take a terrible blow because of the passage of the health care \nbill. Thanks to the health care bill, tuition payments for students are \ngoing to rise.\n  Second, we should recognize that the stimulus money passed last year \nwas one-time funding. We created this financial cliff and now we have \nan unprecedented level of debt in the Federal Government. We do not \nhave $23 billion lying around to send to the States.\n  Whether we are sending $230,000 per teaching job, $76,000 per \nteaching job, or scaling it back and saying we are only going to send \nthe national average, which is $46,000, the question still remains: \nFrom whose grandchildren will we borrow the money?\n  We need to reduce the growth of the Federal debt. We should not be \nbailing out States with another $50 billion.\n  I thank the Senator from Wyoming and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Wyoming is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, could you please inform me how much time \nis remaining in morning business?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 17 minutes on the \nRepublican side.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/16/senate-section/article/S4954-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4954-S4956]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HEALTH CARE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today as someone who \nhas practiced medicine in the State of Wyoming since 1983, taking care \nof families across the great State of Wyoming as an orthopedic surgeon \nand also as a medical director of the Wyoming Health Care, which is a \nprogram to offer low-cost medical screenings, health screenings to help \npeople; early detection, because we know that is a way to keep down the \ncost of care--to help them find problems before they get too far \nprogressed so we can get effective treatments.\n  This is a very successful program. Often doctors are asked for their \nopinions on issues. Then, if a patient has a question, they ask for a \nsecond opinion from a second physician.\n  Well, I come to the floor today to offer my second opinion on this \nhealth care bill. I have been doing this week after week, as we have \nhad a year-long debate and discussion about the health care bill that \nhas now been signed into law. I come to the floor because it seems that \nevery week, every week since the bill became law, there has been a new \nrevelation, a new unintended consequence that the people of America \nlook at and say: This is a bill, now a law, that was not passed for me. \nIt is to help someone else.\n  The promises the American people heard when the bill was being \ndebated and discussed, we are now finding that those promises have been \nbroken. Again this week one of those major promises, fundamental behind \nthe health care law, has been broken. The American people are concerned \nand distressed because it affects them personally. They believe they \nwere misled.\n  The goal of the health care legislation last year was to lower the \ncost of health care. There is agreement all across the country we need \nto do that; we need to lower the cost of care, to improve quality of \ncare. Absolutely. It is in the best interest of all Americans if we can \nimprove the quality of care; then, of course, to increase access to \ncare. The more we can do to allow more people in this country to have \naccess to care, the better it is.\n  Lower cost, improved quality, improved access. Well, that is not what \nthis Senate Chamber passed because I believe the bill that was passed \nis clearly not going to lower cost, and the Congressional Budget Office \nagrees. It is not going to improve quality, and it is not going to \nimprove access, as we see from statements from the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services about the shortage of primary care providers, the \nshortage of physicians and nurse practitioners and others to help. So I \ncontinue to believe the law we now have passed is bad for patients, bad \nfor payers, the people who are going to pay the health care bill of \nthis country, and bad for providers, the nurses and doctors who take \ncare of those patients.\n  I believe the bill fundamentally is going to result in higher costs \nfor patients, less access for care, and unsustainable spending. The \nSpeaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, said: You are going to have to \nfirst pass the bill to find out what is in it. Once again, this past \nweek, we have learned about something new that is in the health care \nlaw that many Americans have found surprising.\n  I would like to contrast a speech President Obama gave 1 year ago \nthis week, 1 year ago yesterday, at the American Medical Association \nmeeting in Chicago. I would like to quote from the speech given by the \nPresident, and then contrast it to regulations that have been sent out \nearlier this week. What a difference a year makes. President Obama \nsaid:\n\n       So let me begin by saying this--\n\n  This was a year ago--\n\n       I know that there are millions of Americans who are content \n     with their health care coverage. They like their plan and \n     they value their relationship with their doctor.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       And that means that no matter how we reform health care we \n     will keep this promise.\n\n[[Page S4955]]\n\n     If you like your doctor, you will be able to keep your \n     doctor. Period.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep \n     your health care plan. Period. No one will take it away no \n     matter what.\n\n  Well, those are very reassuring words to the 170 million people in \nthis country who get their health insurance coverage through their \nemployer at work. There were 170 million people reassured 1 year ago by \nthe words of the President of the United States that if they like what \nthey have, they can keep it.\n  This is the line that the President has continued to repeat. Most \nrecently he gave the same reassurance to the senior citizens of this \ncountry in a townhall meeting he had just a little over a week ago. But \nwhat we are seeing now, instead of allowing Americans to keep their \ndoctors and their health care plans, is another broken promise, a \nbroken promise to the American people.\n  On Friday of last week, the Associated Press reported that 51 \npercent, over half of all Americans, a majority of those 170 million \nwho get their health insurance through work, will no longer necessarily \nbe able to keep the health insurance they have.\n  In the 25 years or so that I have practiced medicine, I know how \nimportant it is, having worked with patients, worked with people, what \nhappens when they lose the coverage or have to change their coverage. \nIt is very distressing. Sometimes it can be disorienting to them as \nthey learn what new coverage they have, what they lost. So people who \nfelt reassured last year by the President's comments are now in a \nsituation where 51 percent of them are going to lose the coverage they \nhave.\n  The Washington Post this week, Tuesday, June 15: The administration \nestimated that by 2013, health plans covering as many as 69 percent of \nemployees could lose protected status. For small employers, the small \nbusinesses of this country, the total could be as high as 80 percent.\n  I mean, could that really be true? I find it astonishing. We have had \ncalls to our office: Is that really true? We have talked to patients \nand people that I have taken care of because I have been back in \nWyoming this past weekend and ran into a number of former patients of \nmine. They said: Is that really going to happen?\n  Let's see what the rules are that came out. These are the rules that \ncame out on Monday. I mean, it is interesting to get rules on health \ncare, and what are the first two lines? Department of the Treasury. \nInternal Revenue Service.\n  The Internal Revenue Service is writing the rules and regulations \ndealing with the health care bill. It goes on with the Department of \nLabor, the Department of Health and Human Services. This is titled, \n``Interim Final Rules For Group Health Plans And Health Insurance \nCoverage.''\n  This is 121 pages. I am not going to go through all of it, but I \nwould like to call your attention to page 54. On page 54 there is a \ntable, and the table is called ``Estimates of the Cumulative Percentage \nof Employer Plans Relinquishing,'' having to give up, ``Their \nGrandfathered Status.''\n  What it means is the percentage of employer plans of people who have \nthe insurance they like they are not going to be able to keep.\n  They have a low-end estimate, a mid-range estimate and a high-end \nestimate of all of the employer plans in the country. It covers 170 \nmillion Americans. It says by the year 2013, just a few years from now, \n51 percent, 51 percent of Americans will lose what they have now. It \ntalks about the high estimate for the small employer plans, 80 percent.\n  So how can that be true? So 80 percent of small employers--that is \nthe lifeblood of our economy, and we are at a point in this country \nwhere we have unemployment at 9.7 percent, and small business is the \nengine, the engine that grows the economy. Seventy percent of all new \njobs in this country are created by small businesses. Yet for people \nwho work in small businesses, it looks like up to 80 percent of them, \nover the next couple of years, are not going to be able to keep the \nhealth insurance they have now.\n  Why? Because the rules and regulations that have come out related to \nthe law that has now been passed, in spite of the President's promise \nright here behind us--you will be able to keep your doctor, period; you \nwill be able to keep your health care plan, period--the American people \nare finding that those words, those words, are not being held out in \nwhat was passed into law and the regulations that have now been \nwritten.\n  Headline, Wednesday, June 16, today, national newspaper: ``So much \nfor `Keeping Your Plan.' ''\n  Now, actually there are some people who can keep their plans--very \nfew.\n  Headline, ``Union Contract Can Exempt Plans From ObamaCare.'' So you \ndo not get to necessarily keep your plan, it says, unless a union \nnegotiated your coverage. The administration has granted a special \nexemption to those, and apparently only those, health care plans, a \nspecial exemption offered by the administration, according to this \narticle, for those whose plans have been negotiated by the unions.\n\n  You do not have to go very far. All you need to do is open a \nnewspaper. This is on Capitol Hill just the other day, Tuesday, June 8. \nIt says, talking about health care, there is a picture of a doctor with \nan eye chart: ``Comprehensive, but Not for All.''\n  ``Health reform ban on annual limits may end up hurting lower wage \nworkers.'' Well, I thought that the whole idea behind this was to help \nadditional workers, to help additional workers get coverage, get care. \nFirst paragraph:\n\n       Part of the health care overhaul due to kick in this \n     September, could end up stripping more than a million people \n     of their insurance coverage, violating a key goal of \n     President Barack Obama's reforms.\n\n  There it is in black and white: ``Violating a key goal of President \nBarack Obama's reforms.'' These are identifiable victims of ObamaCare, \nlosers under ObamaCare. Promises made and promises broken.\n  What about the President's promise on the cost of care, bending the \ncost curve down? Well, yesterday, in The Hill:\n\n       Report projects a rise of 9 percent in employers' health \n     costs in 2011.\n\n  But was it not Obama who said his legislation was going to actually \nallow Americans to have a lowering of their premiums by $2,500 per year \nper family? Well, how does that work with the projected rise in cost? \nSo, once again, the American people heard one thing and now they are \nbeing delivered something very different.\n  That is why I come to the Senate floor today--to say it is time to \nrepeal this legislation and replace it, replace this legislation with \nlegislation that delivers more personal responsibility and more \nopportunities for individual patients, a patient-centered health care \nbill, a bill that allows Americans to buy insurance across State lines. \nWe need a bill that will give more competition and will allow the costs \nto come down, that gives people who own their own health insurance an \nopportunity to get the same tax relief big companies get. That is \nimportant. That will help people.\n  How about a bill that includes a provision to give individual \nincentives to people who take responsibility for their own health care \nand their own health, do things like the people who come to the Wyoming \nHealth Fairs, early detection, early treatment.\n  We know, and I have seen this in my years of practicing medicine, \nabout half of all of the money we spend in this country on health care \nis on just 5 percent of the people. If we can focus on those 5 percent \nand help them with healthy lifestyles and good choices, we can get down \nthe cost of their care.\n  Then we need a bill that deals with lawsuit abuse. That will help \nlower the amount of defensive medicine practiced and help lower the \ncost of care, plus one that allows small businesses to join together \nand then shop much more effectually to buy a lower cost health \ninsurance plan.\n  Well, you can imagine what is happening right now in small businesses \nacross America, as I have just brought to the attention of the Senate. \nWhen 80 percent, up to 80 percent of people with small business health \nplans who are getting their insurance that way, according to the new \nregulations put out by the Internal Revenue Service, as well as the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services, up to 80 percent are not going \nto be able to keep the coverage they now have and now enjoy under their \ncurrent plans come the year 2013.\n\n[[Page S4956]]\n\n  Those are the things that will make a difference. That is why I come \nto the floor today. I offer my second opinion about health care law, \nand now it is the law that I think is going to end up--and the American \npeople understand this, and they see through it--is going to end up \nbeing bad for patients who need care, bad for payers, people paying for \ntheir health care costs, and the taxpayers of this country, as well as \nbad for providers, the nurses and the doctors and the hospitals who \ntake care of those patients.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/16/senate-section/article/S4956-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4956-S4958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       NOMINATION OF ELENA KAGAN\n\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I am pleased to come to the floor today \nwith a few of my women colleagues to discuss the President's nomination \nof Solicitor General Elena Kagan to be an Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court. I am a member of the Judiciary Committee. We are looking \nforward to the hearings coming up in a few weeks. We hope the country \nis watching because this is a very important job and Ms. Kagan is a \nvery impressive person.\n  With that, I turn to the Senator from Michigan, Ms. Stabenow.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Minnesota.\n  We are here to talk about President Obama's nomination of Elena \nKagan. I will come to the floor at a later point to respond to my \nfriend from Wyoming with a different view about health care reform. We \nhave a vote in just a few moments, a very important vote as to whether \nto support the ability of States, in these difficult times, to be able \nto continue health care for people who are out of work and for seniors \nwho are in nursing homes, low-income seniors who find themselves caught \nin the economic crunch. In Michigan, there are 6 individuals out of \nevery 100 who are on Medicaid now or who need to be on Medicaid. The \nupcoming vote will determine whether we place a value on health care, \nplace a value on seniors in nursing homes and people who, because they \nhave lost a job or because of some other situation in this economy, \nfind themselves without health care. I hope colleagues who express \nconcern about people having access to health care will join us in \nvoting yes.\n  I thank the Senator from Minnesota for organizing and bringing us to \nthe floor. I join her in speaking in favor of the President's \nnomination of Elena Kagan to be the next Justice of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  She grew up in a family like so many in Michigan, with parents who \nworked hard for a living so they could provide for their children. Her \nmom was a teacher. Her dad was a tenants lawyer in New York City. She \nsaw firsthand the effects of laws and court decisions on the everyday \nlives of Americans. Throughout her distinguished career, she has \nbrought the lessons she learned from her parents--in her words, \n``service, character and integrity''--to every role she has had.\n  She took those lessons with her to the White House, where she worked \nwith Democrats and Republicans to forge commonsense solutions to issues \nsuch as restricting tobacco companies from targeting ads to children.\n  She took those lessons with her to Harvard, where she became a \nsuccessful and beloved professor. As dean, she worked to engage her \nstudents in service and to honor those who have served. Every year, she \ninvited all of the military veterans on campus to her home for a \nVeterans Day dinner. She reached out to students from all across the \npolitical spectrum and proved to them one-on-one that she was a smart \nand pragmatic leader. Very conservative law students at Harvard tend to \njoin the Federalist Society, while progressive law students are more \nlikely to join the American Constitution Society. The two groups \ndisagree on almost everything. Yet both groups sent letters to the \nJudiciary Committee supporting Elena Kagan's nomination as Solicitor \nGeneral. That is rare in politics and is proof that Elena Kagan is \nrespected for her fairness and impartiality.\n  Besides her parents, perhaps the biggest influence in her life was \nher onetime boss and mentor Justice Thurgood Marshall, who was also the \nSolicitor General before becoming a Supreme Court Justice. She admired \nhis ability, in her words, to understand the way law works ``in \npractice, as well as in the books--of the way in which law acted on \npeople's lives.''\n  In private practice, Elena Kagan represented clients in litigation. \nToday, she represents all of us as the people's lawyer, the Solicitor \nGeneral of the United States. Her job every day is to represent her \nclients, the people of our great country, before the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. As a Justice, she will continue to represent the people. That is \nwhy I urge my colleagues today to join with us in confirming her \nnomination without delay.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am pleased to join my colleagues, \nSenators Stabenow and Klobuchar, in supporting the nomination of Elena \nKagan to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. However, before \naddressing the nomination of Elena Kagan, I wish to echo the remarks of \nSenator Stabenow about the need to look at the legislation that is \ngoing to come before us in a few minutes.\n  My colleague, Senator Barrasso, talked about wanting to help those \npeople who are most in need of health care. One of the best ways we can \ndo that is to pass the legislation pending before this body which \nincludes an extension of Medicaid benefits, which is so important to \nStates and to the people who are most in need, who have the least \nability to get health care. I hope that as our colleagues are thinking \nabout how they can support health care for Americans, they will support \nthis legislation and make sure we extend Medicaid benefits for people \nthroughout the States.\n  Turning to the Elena Kagan nomination, I am extremely pleased that \nPresident Obama has selected a woman with such impressive and unique \ncredentials to serve on the Nation's highest Court. I had the good \nfortune to meet Solicitor General Kagan a number of years ago when both \nof us were at Harvard. I was at the Kennedy School as the director of \nits Institute of Politics, and she had just become dean of the Harvard \nLaw School. It didn't take her very long to get a reputation there as \nsomeone who was loved by the students and the faculty, who was able to \nget everyone to work together. It comes as no surprise to me that she \nhas continued her impressive accomplishments.\n  My favorable impression of Elena Kagan was confirmed after a recent \nmeeting with her in my Senate office, spending more time really looking \nat what her record has been with the law. I wish to focus my remarks \nthis morning on Elena Kagan's record that has prepared her to be a \nJustice.\n  A number of my colleagues from across the aisle have implied or \nstated directly that the Solicitor General lacks sufficient range of \nprofessional experience. A number of Senators are concerned that Elena \nKagan does not have judicial experience. To address this point, it is \nworth noting that 41 of the Court's 111 Justices have joined the Court \nwithout any previous experience as a judge. Among these 41 are some of \nthe most notable jurists of the last century: Justices Louis Brandeis, \nFelix Frankfurter, William Douglas, Byron White, and Lewis Powell. \nChief Justices Harlan Stone, Earl Warren, and William Rehnquist were \nalso chosen for the Court without prior judicial experience. The \nPresidents who nominated these Justices and the Senators who confirmed \nthem were right to recognize that experiences other than being a judge \ncan prepare one to serve on the Supreme Court with distinction. Elena \nKagan certainly has had that experience. She has traveled a path of \nextraordinary accomplishment. I am confident she will continue that \ntrend once she is elevated to the bench.\n  With more than 24 years of legal experience in a range of settings, \nshe will bring a distinct perspective to judging that will serve both \nthe Court and Americans well. Without a doubt, Ms. Kagan has been a \nlifelong student of the Supreme Court. As we heard from Senator \nStabenow, she began her career as a clerk in the chambers of two highly \nregarded jurists, including the\n\n[[Page S4957]]\n\nlegendary Thurgood Marshall. These formative years early in Ms. Kagan's \ncareer instilled in her an appreciation of the impact of judicial \ndecisions on people and gave her an ability to zero in on critical \nfacts and issues in cases.\n\n  After 3 years in private practice in Washington, Ms. Kagan became a \nprofessor of law at the University of Chicago. She focused there on \nscholarship and constitutional law, particularly the first amendment. \nShe quickly became known as a powerful advocate for individual \nconstitutional rights.\n  She served as an Associate White House Counsel and later Deputy \nDirector of the Domestic Policy Council during the Clinton White House. \nThese positions forced Elena Kagan to tackle difficult public policy \nmatters while analyzing the limits of executive branch power.\n  Later, as dean of the Harvard Law School, Ms. Kagan is credited with \nmaking immense progress toward uniting a fractious faculty of very \npowerful opinions and intellects. She built bridges across academic and \npolitical groups.\n  A recent letter from the deans of law schools across the country \ndescribes Ms. Kagan as ``a superb and successful dean'' who ``revealed \na strong and consistent aptitude for forging coalitions that achieved \nsmart and sensible solutions, often in the face of insoluble \nconflict.''\n  Harvard professor Charles Fried captured the thoughts of many of Ms. \nKagan's Harvard colleagues when he described her as someone who had a \n``masterful'' ability to work well with diverse faculty.\n  Ms. Kagan's intellect and work ethic caught the attention of \nPresident Obama when she was tapped to serve as Solicitor General. She \nis the first woman to hold this position which is often referred to as \nthe 10th Justice of the Court. During her tenure, Solicitor General \nKagan has filed 66 briefs and has argued numerous times before the \nCourt. I can't imagine better training for a position on the Court than \nthe experience gained by a Solicitor General. Elena Kagan has publicly \ndemonstrated her ability to critically analyze the law and advocate \nforcefully at the level demanded by our Nation's highest Court.\n  Elena Kagan has dedicated her life to legal study. She has excelled \nas a clerk, a teacher, administrator, counsel, and advocate. I know \nthese experiences have given her a full understanding and appreciation \nof the Supreme Court's role in our democracy. Elena Kagan has built a \ncareer that shows she has the technical skills, the intellectual \naptitude, and the personal judgment to be an extremely effective \nJustice. I look forward to the swift confirmation of a very impressive \nindividual and urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport her nomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank my two colleagues, Senators \nShaheen and Stabenow, for joining me in making open arguments in favor \nof Solicitor General Kagan to be the next Associate Justice of the \nSupreme Court. If Members listened to Senator Shaheen's discussion of \nthe experience of Elena Kagan, something quickly emerged: she has \nalways been on the front line and has not been afraid to get into \nbattle. She is the one who had to go before the Supreme Court and argue \nthe Citizens United case that basically came up with a ruling from the \ncurrent Supreme Court with which I don't agree. The Supreme Court went \nbeyond their bounds in how they interpreted election law, reversing \ndecades of precedent. Yet it was Elena Kagan who was the one willing to \nstand there as Solicitor General and basically say corporations are not \npeople; people are people.\n  I like the thought of someone of her experience--such an intellectual \nheavyweight--getting on the Court to basically match Justice Roberts.\n  As Senator Shaheen has pointed out, she has consensus-building skills \nin addition to that. She is someone who has been able to bring together \npeople of diverse views. With such a divided Court, as we see right \nnow, I think it is going to be very helpful--if she gets through our \nprocess, which I believe she will--to have her on that Court. She also \nis a trailblazer.\n  She was the first woman dean at Harvard Law School in their 186-year \nhistory. In 2009 she became the first woman to serve as Solicitor \nGeneral. As has been pointed out, she has also been a law professor, a \nmember of the White House Counsel's Office, and a domestic policy \nadviser to President Clinton.\n  When I look at her resume, I notice two things: The first is that she \nhas practical experience thinking about the impact of laws and policies \non the lives of ordinary Americans. When you are involved in \nconsidering the nitty-gritty details of policies--as has emerged, as we \nlook at all the thousands and thousands of documents she has given to \nthe Judiciary Committee--she is someone who has been actually involved \nin crafting those ideas, those policies. When you have to figure out, \nas she has, whether to compromise or hold firm on a piece of \nlegislation, you have to know exactly what the consequences of your \nrecommendations will be. You have to think about the lives that will be \nimpacted.\n  The second thing I notice about her resume is that she has a track \nrecord of listening to different viewpoints and bringing people \ntogether--whether it is her legacy of helping to recruit talented \nacademics to Harvard from across the political spectrum or working with \nSenators from both parties on antitobacco legislation.\n  It is worth noting this is a nominee who once got a standing ovation \nfrom the Federalist Society when she spoke to them--that is a \nconservative legal society--during her time as a law school dean. It \nwas not because she agreed with them on every substantive matter. In \nfact, she noted that at the beginning. It was because they respected \nher because she was willing to listen to other viewpoints and bring in \nother viewpoints. We need that kind of consensus builder on the Supreme \nCourt of the United States.\n  Finally, we have to add to her list of achievements that she managed \nto calm the factionalism and frustration for which the law school \nfaculty had previously been known. I can tell you after managing 167 \nlawyers it is not easy, but it is even harder to manage a number of law \nprofessors.\n  What you come up with, when you look at her whole career, is she has \nthe practical experience of reaching out to and working with people who \nhave different beliefs. I think that is exactly what we need on the \nSupreme Court.\n  Some of my colleagues, as has been pointed out, question whether she \nis fit to be a Supreme Court Justice because she has never before been \na judge. Well, right now every single Justice on that Supreme Court has \nbeen a judge. While they may have different backgrounds, they have come \nup through what is called the ``judicial monastery.'' I think the fact \nthat the President has nominated someone who has been on the front \nline, deciding policies but also arguing intricate legal cases, is a \ngood thing.\n  As has been pointed out by Senator Shaheen, I do wonder whether these \nsame colleagues who are objecting on the judicial experience issue \nwould have objected to putting Chief Justice Rehnquist on the Supreme \nCourt or Justice Brandeis or Justice Frankfurter. They did not have any \njudicial experience either.\n  It is worth noting this opinion on the importance of judicial \nexperience is not shared by at least one member of the Supreme Court \nwho believes that may not quite be necessary. In a speech he gave at \nthe end of May, Justice Scalia said he was ``happy to see that this \nlatest nominee is not a federal judge--and not a judge at all.''\n  For historical context, Justice Scalia noted when he first arrived at \nthe Supreme Court in 1986, three of his colleagues had never been a \nFederal judge. Chief Justice Rehnquist came to the bench from the \nOffice of Legal Counsel. Justice Byron White was Deputy Attorney \nGeneral. Justice Lewis Powell was a private lawyer in Richmond. Beyond \nthat, her current job--Solicitor General--as Senator Shaheen noted, is \nactually referred to as ``the tenth Justice'' because it is such an \nimportant position. She represents the people before the Supreme Court. \nThat is incredibly important training for an individual nominated to \nserve on the Supreme Court.\n  It is worth noting that the last Solicitor General who subsequently \nbecame a Supreme Court Justice was none other than Thurgood Marshall--\nElena Kagan's mentor and former boss.\n\n[[Page S4958]]\n\n  So I hope we can put to rest this idea that only judges are qualified \nto be Justices. That is not a standard that we have applied throughout \nhistory, and it is not one we should start applying today.\n  Just think--and I will end with this, Mr. President--how far we have \ncome. When Sandra Day O'Connor graduated from law school 50 years ago, \nthe only offer she got from a law firm was for a position as a legal \nsecretary. Justice Ginsburg faced similar obstacles. When she entered \nHarvard in the 1950s, she was only one of nine women in a class of more \nthan 500, and one professor actually asked her to justify taking a \nplace in that class that could have gone to a man. Later, she was \npassed over for a prestigious clerkship despite her impressive \ncredentials.\n  In the course of the more than two centuries of this great country, \n111 Justices have served on the Supreme Court. Only three have been \nwomen. If confirmed, Ms. Kagan would be the fourth, and for the first \ntime in the history of our country three women would take their places \non the bench when arguments are heard in the fall.\n  I look forward to our Judiciary Committee hearing. I have to tell \nyou, I hope my colleagues listen to what Elena Kagan has to say. When \nshe came before our Judiciary Committee as a nominee for Solicitor \nGeneral, she was very impressive. She got bipartisan support. I would \nlike to see that again.\n  Our job is to look at the qualifications of this nominee. Our job is \nto decide if she is competent. As Senator Graham said during the \nconfirmation hearing for Justice Sotomayor, he may not have picked a \nparticular nominee, he may have supported someone else for President, \nbut in the end, our job is to look at their qualifications and whether \nthey will serve our country well on the Supreme Court.\n  I believe the answer for Elena Kagan will be yes. We are all looking \nforward to the hearings, and I urge my colleagues to come to the \nhearings with an open mind.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/16/senate-section/article/S4958-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4958]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of the House message to accompany H.R. \n4213, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       Motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate \n     amendment to H.R. 4213, an act to amend the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 to extend certain expiring provisions, and for \n     other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Baucus motion to concur in the amendment of the House to \n     the amendment of the Senate to the bill, with Baucus \n     amendment No. 4301 (to the amendment of the House to the \n     amendment of the Senate to the bill), in the nature of a \n     substitute.\n       Reid amendment No. 4344 (to amendment No. 4301), to amend \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend the time for \n     closing on a principal residence eligible for the first-time \n     homebuyer credit.\n       Thune/McConnell amendment No. 4333 (to amendment No. 4301), \n     of a perfecting nature.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, this vote is about jobs--plainly and \nsimply about jobs. Fifteen million Americans are out of work. Fifteen \nmillion Americans need our help.\n  We need to continue our efforts to get Americans back to work. \nCreating jobs has been a top priority. The pending substitute amendment \nto the American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act would help achieve \nthat goal.\n  The amendment would cut taxes for American workers and families by \nmore than $4 billion. The amendment would cut taxes for businesses by \n$18 billion to help them expand and create jobs.\n  The amendment would extend Small Business Administration loan \nprograms to help restore the flow of credit. These programs will help \nsmall businesses to grow and hire new workers. This extension \neliminates fees for certain SBA loans and increases government loan \nguarantees.\n  Since their creation in the Recovery Act, these provisions have \nsupported more than $26 billion in small business lending. They have \nhelped to create or retain more than 650,000 jobs.\n  The amendment would expand community college and career training \ngrants offered through the Trade Adjustment Assistance Program. These \ngrants provide Americans who have lost their jobs through no fault of \ntheir own the opportunity to learn new skills to find good jobs.\n  The amendment would support more than 350,000 jobs for youth ages 14 \nto 24 by expanding successful summer jobs programs created in the \nRecovery Act. This age group has some of the highest unemployment \nlevels. Fully one-quarter of those aged 16 to 19 are unemployed--one-\nquarter.\n  The amendment would extend funding for States to provide wage \nassistance to employers who hire new workers. Wage assistance helps \ncompanies that might not otherwise be able to afford the cost of hiring \nnew workers to create jobs.\n  The amendment would provide targeted, temporary pension relief to \nhelp employers who are struggling in this tough economy to continue to \nfund employee pensions without cutting jobs or restricting new hiring.\n  This amendment is about creating good jobs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I thank the Chair, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment. Let's advance this effort to \ncreate jobs.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, this bill, as it comes forward, spends more \nmoney than we budgeted for and, as a result, it violates the budget. We \nare trying to get some fiscal discipline around here. This would be one \nof the places we should start.\n  So I raise a point of order that the pending amendment offered by the \nSenator from Montana would cause the aggregate level of budget \nauthority and outlays for fiscal year 2010, as set out in the most \nrecently agreed to concurrent resolution on the budget, S. Con. Res. \n13, to be exceeded. Therefore, I raise a point of order under section \n311(a)(2) of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, pursuant to section 904 of the \nCongressional Budget Act of 1974 and section 4(g)(3) of the Statutory \nPay-As-You-Go Act of 2010, I move to waive all applicable sections of \nthose acts and applicable budget resolutions for purposes of the \npending amendment, and I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I ask my friend to modify the consent \nagreement to have the Senate be in recess from 1 p.m. until 2 p.m. \ntoday. We will have a caucus going on at that time.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I so make that request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Cobell Settlement\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, the legislation that is pending and on \nwhich we now have general debate is legislation that is important. I \nknow there has been plenty of discussion about it. I want to discuss \none element of it. The legislation includes provisions to approve the \nCobell settlement. The Cobell settlement is perhaps something which \npeople do not know much about. It is a settlement of a longstanding \nlawsuit that has been winding its way through the Federal courts for 14 \nyears. It is about things that have been done to American Indians that \nare almost unthinkable and for which they have sought redress in the \nFederal courts.\n  Let me describe this, if I may, by using a photograph of a woman. \nThis is a photograph of Mary Fish. By telling you a little about Ms. \nFish, I can describe the problem that the Cobell settlement, which is \nin this underlying legislation, attempts to address.\n  Mary Fish died a few years ago. Mary Fish was an Oklahoma Indian. She \nlived in a very small, humble house with 40 acres. There were six oil \nwells on her land that had been pumping Oklahoma sweet crude for years. \nEven with all of these oil wells pumping on Mary's land, she made only \na few dollars a year from those wells.\n  Why would it be the case that this woman had oil wells on her land, \nlived in a small, little house, had virtually nothing, and got only a \nfew dollars from the oil wells? The problem dates back over 100 years \nwhen the Federal Government divided up Indian tribal lands, and \ndistributed the land in trust to individual Indians, saying: We will \ntake care of your land for you. We will manage it. We will handle it. \nAnd, by the way, we will provide you with the proceeds from leasing on \nthe lands.\n  Almost as soon as this system was set up, the Indian people found \nthat the Federal Government, and all kinds of other manipulators \ninvolved, stole from them, cheated, and looted their lands and trust \naccounts from those lands. The fact is, if you go back 100 years and \ntry to reconnect the trust accounts the Federal Government said they \nwere holding for these Indians--for grazing fees that were paid on the \nIndian lands, for oil that was pumped from Indian lands, for minerals, \nfor agriculture--what you will find is this Federal Government going \nback all those years does not have any records, cannot reconnect, does \nnot have the foggiest idea what happened. In addition, there were a lot \nof unscrupulous people who were stealing, cheating, and looting. That \nis why these American Indians, the first Americans--those who were here \nfirst--14 years ago filed a case in Federal court now called Cobell v. \nSalazar, a case against the Secretary of the Interior.\n  Cobell v. Salazar has languished for 14 years in the Federal court \nsystem. At long last, there has been a negotiated settlement to settle \nthese claims that have existed for a long time. Claims of Indians being \ncheated by a government that, in some cases, was corrupt for over 100 \nyears.\n  That settlement is in the underlying legislation. The settlement was \nnot something the Congress did. The settlement was a settlement between \nthe Department of the Interior, led by Secretary Salazar, and the \nplaintiffs, led by a woman named Elouise Cobell. Recently, the \nplaintiffs and the Department of the Interior reached an agreement--\nfinally reached an agreement--to address this unbelievable set of \nterrible events over the last century that cheated American Indians out \nof what they were owed.\n  My colleague from Wyoming has offered an amendment to change the \nsettlement. My colleague, Senator Barrasso, is someone with whom I work \non the Indian Affairs Committee. I am Chair; he is Vice Chair of the \nCommittee. I have great respect for him. I do not take issue with the \nfact he thinks this settlement, perhaps, could be better. I don't know \nthat. He has some ideas on how it can be changed.\n  The dilemma is that we are not a party to the negotiations to reach \nthat settlement. Perhaps if the Senator would send his recommendations \nto the Secretary of the Interior and the plaintiffs and they sit down \nat a table and decide if they want to renegotiate this or decide that. \nWhether there are other ideas that could or should be added, perhaps \nthat might be beneficial. But if the Congress now decides that this \nsettlement, which is to be paid out of the United States Judgement \nFund, is not something that Congress supports, that it needs to be \nchanged, then I think this settlement will be scuttled, and we will be \nback in the same position we were in.\n  The Federal judge who watched over the negotiations that reached a \nsettlement in the Cobell case set a deadline of 30 days and then a \nsecond deadline and then a third deadline. The Congress missed all of \nthose deadlines--every single one. The Federal judge a few weeks ago \nsaid: I would like to call Members of Congress down to my court to find \nout what on Earth they are doing, what is going on. Why can this \nsettlement not get approved by Congress, because after 14 years, I \nthink the Federal court believed a settlement agreed to by both parties \nwas the appropriate thing to do. Despite this, Congress has missed all \nthe deadlines.\n  In these proceedings we have been considering the Cobell settlement \nwhich is a part of the underlying legislation. I support that \nsettlement. Is it perfect? I don't know. I was not a part of the \nnegotiating team. That was the Interior Department and the plaintiffs, \nthe Native Americans on behalf of the plaintiffs who have been cheated \nover all these years.\n  My colleague Senator Barrasso says the parties themselves made \nchanges to the settlement and so they should not mind a few more \nchanges by the Congress. The difference is who makes the changes. The \nparty to a settlement can make changes by agreement of the parties. But \nif Congress makes changes unilaterally, of course, then Congress risks \nvoiding the entire settlement, which I fear would be the case.\n  Senator Barrasso's amendment would change the settlement and I think \nrisk sending these parties back into endless litigation that has gone \non now for 14 years. I do not think anybody wants that.\n  Senator Barrasso has said his proposed changes are within the \nframework of the settlement. But the administration, Secretary Salazar, \nand others have already sent a letter to the\n\n[[Page S4960]]\n\nCongress saying it believes these changes are material and would, \ntherefore, void the settlement. I do not think any of us would want \nthat to happen.\n  My colleague Senator Barrasso has not said the settlement is \nunreasonable or unjust, only that he wants to improve the settlement. \nWith great respect to my colleague--and I do like him, and we work \ntogether well on a lot of issues--I believe now is not the time to \ndecide after 14 years that this settlement needs improvement.\n  If the changes are within the framework of the settlement, my \nrecommendation is that he meet with the parties who were at the table \nand reached this settlement. If they believe his ideas have some merit, \nmaybe some of them will find their way into the settlement. The \nCongress was not a party to that settlement and should not make \nunilateral changes.\n  I hope very much we can finally resolve more than a century of theft \nand mismanagement through this settlement. When I talked about looting, \nstealing, cheating, and theft, I understand that. I said that \ndeliberately. That is exactly what has happened. Even worse has been \nthe unbelievable mismanagement of those funds that cheated a whole lot \nof people.\n  This is a photograph, as I indicated, of Mary Fish. I said she had \nsix oil wells on her land. She lived in a humble little house and got a \ncouple dollars from them. Somebody else got the money. Who got the \nmoney? What happened to the money from the oil wells on this woman's \nland that led her to die before she had a chance to lead a good life, \nto have the resources that should have been hers?\n  I have another photograph, this woman's name is Susan White Calf. She \nis from the Blackfeet tribe. She is a Blackfeet Indian. She passed away \nin November of 2007. This picture was in 2001. She took this picture \nwith her grandchildren.\n  Mr. President, 2001, by the way, was the same year that the Federal \ncourts found that the Federal Government had broken its trust \nresponsibility to the American Indians by this unbelievable \nmismanagement of Indian trust funds. The Federal Government said: Trust \nus. We will take care of your funds. We will take care of your assets. \nTrust us. The fact is, unbelievable mismanagement, some theft, and some \nlooting occurred.\n  Six years later after 2001, 6 years after the courts found that the \nFederal Government had broken its trust responsibility to American \nIndians, Susie died, still waiting to get the money that was owed her \nfor grazing leases on land she owned. This is money that Susie White \nCalf should have had during her life but did not because the Federal \nGovernment dropped the ball, was guilty of unbelievable mismanagement. \nThis problem of mismanagement goes back well into the 1800s.\n  When you read the stories of how the Indians were cheated and the \nfederal mismanagement, and then take a look at where the records were \nbeing stored. It is unbelievable. You cannot even reconstruct the \nrecords that were stored in rat-infested warehouses. You cannot find \nsome records, and you find others in rat-infested warehouses.\n  I ask unanimous consent to proceed for as much time as I may consume.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will not speak long. Let me continue and \nfinish.\n  When the historic accomplishment occurred of settling this lawsuit \nafter 14 years between the Federal Government and the plaintiffs, when \nthat historic agreement was reached, I was hopeful the Congress would \nmove very quickly and provide the resources, from the Settlement Fund, \nthat are available to make this settlement work.\n  I hope very much, if there is a vote--I don't know there will be a \nvote on the Barrasso amendment--if there is a vote on the Barrasso \namendment, I hope very much my colleagues will oppose it.\n  I say to Senator Barrasso that the ideas, recommendations, and \nthoughts he has about this settlement should be presented to both sides \nwho negotiated the settlement. In fact, if Congress were to \nunilaterally make changes, I think it would void the settlement. Void \nit after 14 long years and a lot of important work that would culminate \nin a settlement that plaintiffs have been waiting for and plaintiffs \nwell deserve.\n  I urge my colleagues, as the Administration has urged, let us not \nunilaterally go outside the settlement that has been structured and \nnegotiated. Let's decide to do what I believe Congress has a \nresponsibility to do.\n  The longer this drags out, the more the American people see what was \ndone to American Indians, the more people see how badly some of these \npeople were cheated. Yes, this woman, who never got her money and died \nlong before that money was ever available. Yes, this woman, who lived \nhumbly all her life with six oil wells on her land and got virtually \nnothing from it. Do we have to continue to talk about these issues, or \nshould we settle this and do what the Federal Government should do: own \nup to its responsibility, say we have done wrong here, say we will fix \nit now, say the trust accounts are going to work the way they should \nwork. But to recompense for past mistakes and for money that was not \ngiven to the first Americans that the Federal Government promised would \nbe theirs, that belonged to them, came from their lands, let's not \ninterrupt that with an amendment on the floor of the Senate on this \nlegislation. Let us instead decide we will ratify this agreement and \nput this behind us.\n  It is a very sad, sorry chapter in the history of this government in \nthe way they have treated American Indians.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the previous \norder regarding debate be extended to 1 p.m. under the same conditions, \nand limited.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Restoring Market Credibility\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I have always believed--and I have spoken \nmany times on the Senate floor--that the two most important things that \nmake America great are democracy and free capital markets.\n  But over the last year, as many of my colleagues are aware, I have \nbecome deeply concerned that the credibility of our stock markets--one \nof our Nation's most precious national treasures--can no longer be \ntaken for granted.\n  On May 6, when the markets yo-yoed up and down, plunging 573 points \nin a mere 5 minutes before recovering 543 points in the next 90 \nseconds--it was nothing less than an embarrassment.\n  The strength of our stock market depends on its ability to establish \nan accurate price for a company's fundamental value that reflects a \nconsensus among buyers and sellers at any given moment.\n  In that capacity, the markets failed, in fact they spectacularly \nfailed, for a harrowing 20-minute time period.\n  In the aftermath of May 6, the integrity of our markets has been \nquestioned, and investor confidence has been shaken.\n  In order to restore market credibility and instill confidence among \nthe investing public, regulators and lawmakers alike must act wisely \nbut urgently to fix the structural schisms that plague today's capital \nmarkets.\n  That is why I am encouraged, and relieved, that Mary Schapiro, the \nChairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission, clearly understands \nwhat is at stake.\n  Testifying before the Senate Subcommittee for Securities, Insurance, \nand Investment on May 20, she said:\n\n       I believe the markets exist for public companies to raise \n     capital, to build businesses, and create jobs, and they exist \n     for investors to support that activity. And those are the \n     number one and number two purposes of markets. And everything \n     else from my perspective has to be put into the context of \n     those two goals.\n\n  At a panel last week in Montreal at the International Organization of \nSecurities Commissions, Chairman Schapiro reiterated that point, saying \nthe SEC needs to . . .\n\n       [E]xplore whether bids and orders should be regulated on \n     speed so there is less incentive to engage in this \n     microsecond arms race\n\n[[Page S4961]]\n\n     that might undermine long-term investors and the market's \n     capital-formation function. The markets have to serve that \n     function for companies to raise money, create jobs and allow \n     the economy to grow . . . We are also looking at whether and \n     to what extent pre-trade price discovery is impaired by \n     the diversion of desirable, marketable order flow from \n     public markets to dark pools.\n\n  I couldn't agree more with Chairman Schapiro.\n  May 6 made clear what many have long claimed: today's overly-\nfragmented marketplace, which seems to favor speed over substance, and \ntrading over investing, may be inhibiting the capital-formation process \nand failing to protect the interests of long-term investors.\n  If that is the case, then regulatory action is needed urgently.\n  Simply put, do stock prices adequately reflect the economics of the \ncompanies they represent?\n  On May 6, when liquidity vanished and established companies like \nAccenture traded briefly for a penny a share, the answer to the \nquestion of whether our markets are performing their central function \nwas clearly no.\n  But rather than an aberration, it appears that the May 6 flash crash \nwas no isolated event.\n  On June 2, we saw yet another ``mini-flash crash'' in the stock of \nDiebold, a technological services company.\n  Prior to 12:22 p.m. that day, Diebold had traded at around $28 per \nshare and within a range of roughly 80 cents.\n  In the next minute, the rug was swept out from under Diebold as \n399,000 shares were traded and Diebold's stock price plunged 35 percent \nto $18.\n  By 12:40, Diebold was once again trading at $28 per share.\n  The sudden decline in price appeared to be in response to news of \nDiebold's settlement with the SEC over fraudulent accounting practices, \nwhich Bloomberg began reporting at 12:25 and Diebold confirmed with a \npress release a little more than an hour later.\n  The SEC should investigate both the manner in which the news broke \nand the trading activity that followed it.\n  In the aftermath of the extreme plunge, questions have been raised \nconcerning the manner in which the SEC filed the complaint, which data \nfeeds first reported it, and the electronic overreaction to the news--\nall of which suggest that the severe volatility in Diebold could have \nbeen largely avoided altogether.\n  The SEC was actually resolving an old investigation with Diebold, the \nsettlement of which had been previously disclosed, and not making any \nnew accusations against the company.\n  But when word of the complaint reached Bloomberg or other sources, it \nled to a ``trigger'' that potentially activated algorithms programmed \nto react immediately to breaking news. This may explain why trading \nactivity in Diebold exploded shortly before the story broke publicly.\n  Notably, the SEC filed the complaint manually at the U.S. Federal \nDistrict Court in DC during market hours rather than using the Public \nAccess to Court Electronic Records--PACER--filing system.\n  Mr. President, regulators should add to their list the need to \nexamine whether the precipitous drop in Diebold stock was the result of \nhigh frequency traders who can subscribe directly to market data and \nnews feeds and perhaps had programmed faulty correlations into their \nalgorithms to react to breaking news events.\n  Indeed, with so much of the marketplace dominated by high frequency \ntraders employing similar strategies, an overreaction by a few \nalgorithms looking to trade instantaneously on the basis of imprecise \ncorrelations could trigger a dramatic plunge.\n  While the algorithms' calculations may be accurate ``most of the \ntime,'' the chaos that ensues when they are not inexcusably undermines \ninvestor confidence.\n  In the Diebold case, once the algorithmic overreaction became clear, \nhumans with actual knowledge of Diebold's true fundamentals quickly \nintervened. It is no surprise, then, that the stock price rebounded so \nquickly.\n  Though volatility has always been present in the markets, we see that \nwithout human judgment the speed of trading can indeed lead to very \nbrief ``bungee jumps'' for individual stocks whenever there is a \nsignificant news event.\n  At the same time, regulators should also consider whether the extreme \nvolatility in Diebold's stock is yet another example of sell orders \nbreaking through a ``razor-thin crust'' of liquidity provided by high-\nfrequency traders.\n  As we saw on May 6, the high-frequency traders who fill the order \nbooks on many market centers provide only ``fleeting'' liquidity, \nparticularly in periods of market stress or uncertainty.\n  This is because many high frequency traders prefer to continuously \nplace and cancel small, rapid-fire orders rather than risk letting \ntheir orders sit on public venues where they would increase order book \ndepth and promote orderly markets.\n  Regardless of what caused Diebold's ``bungee jump'' or the May 6 \nmarket meltdown, we should all agree that such unusual market activity \nstrikes at the very heart of our market's credibility.\n  Even if the SEC's circuit breaker pilot program--which would halt \ntrading for 5 minutes in any S 500 stock that experiences a 10 \npercent price change in the previous 5 minutes--were in place, market \nand stop-loss orders would still remain vulnerable to a 10 percent \ninsta-drop.\n  This situation undermines the confidence of long-term investors.\n  Mr. President, the Diebold incident and other factors from May 6 make \nme concerned about what our markets have become.\n  According to a research group survey of 145 market participants \nconducted in the weeks following May 6, I am not alone.\n  The Executive Summary of the survey results states overall investor \nconfidence in the existing market structure is waning.\n  The summary says:\n\n       Barely half of all participants have at least a high degree \n     of confidence in U.S. equity market structure; The buy side \n     has the least confidence in U.S. equity market structure. \n     This is particularly demoralizing given they are the \n     guardians over much of our nation's equity investments; \n     Participants no longer believe market structure strongly \n     supports an orderly market; Increasingly, market participants \n     believe that the U.S. equity market structure is not a level \n     playing field.\n\n  These results underscore how critical it is for regulators to address \nproblems with the current market structure in order to restore investor \nconfidence and protect the strength and credibility of our capital \nmarkets.\n  Sadly, Mr. President, the fact is that we simply do not have the data \nwe need to assess fully the impact of market structure changes on long-\nterm investors.\n  Indeed, regulators currently lack sufficient information on the \nrouting history of orders--including those that may go through broker-\ndealer internalization venues, other dark pools, and multiple exchanges \nand ECNs before being executed.\n  The SEC also acknowledges it does not have: ``important information \non the time of the trade or the identity of the customer.''\n  As Kevin Cronin, the director of Global Equity Trading at Invesco, a \nretail and institutional investment fund, said at a June 2 SEC \nRoundtable:\n\n       There are dimensions of cost that today we do not have the \n     ability to really understand.\n\n  Accordingly, I have pushed for the SEC to quickly implement tagging \nfor large traders and a consolidated audit trail in order to gain a \nmore granular view of the marketplace.\n  Once the Commission has collected the data, it should improve its \ninternal analytical capabilities while also making the data available \nin masked form to the public, or at least academics and independent \nanalysts, so that objective experts can study market performance \ncomprehensively.\n  I admit there are no easy solutions, Mr. President, but we need to \nstrive to answer the difficult questions or millions of Americans will \neventually lose confidence in our markets and leave what is already \nstarting to look like a ``casino.''\n  In that regard, Chairman Schapiro again appears to be on the right \ntrack. Regulators must consider, as she said, whether high frequency \ntraders should be subject to speed limits and whether deep and valuable \nliquidity is being shielded from the public marketplace.\n  Our markets should not be reduced to a battle of algorithms in which \ncapital formation is an afterthought and long-term investors are \nrelegated to second-tier status, nor should the public ``lit'' markets \nhouse only ``exhaust'' order\n\n[[Page S4962]]\n\nflow that is passed over by those who trade in dark pools.\n  Perhaps high-frequency traders who claim to be ``modern-day market-\nmakers'' should be subject to some quoting obligations like their \ntraditional market-maker predecessors.\n  Setting reasonable speed limits on how quickly such traders can \nwithdraw their bids and offers, as Chairman Schapiro alluded to last \nweek, could help level the playing field and make the markets safer and \nmore stable for all investors.\n  I have also proposed requiring exchanges and market centers to \nallocate costs at least partially based on message traffic share.\n  Cancellations, of course, are not inherently bad--they can enhance \nliquidity by affording automated traders greater flexibility when \nposting quotes.\n  But with as many as 98 percent of orders placed on Nasdaq cancelled \nor otherwise unexecuted on a given trading day, their use is clearly \nexcessive.\n  Those who choke the system with cancellations make the markets less \nefficient for investors. And they should pay the price for the \ninefficiencies they create.\n  Exchanges cater to high frequency traders in a variety of ways, by \nelecting not to charge them for high cancellation rates, and providing \nco-location services for their computers right next to the exchanges' \nown servers.\n  Fortunately, co-location and direct market data feeds appear to be on \nthe regulatory radar--the CFTC proposed a rule last week to ensure \nexchanges provide ``fair access'' for, and increased transparency of, \nco-location services.\n  But new practices that further threaten market integrity have \nrecently come to light.\n  Several market participants, including institutional investment \nadviser Southeastern Asset Management, have said exchanges are \nreleasing private information on investor orders, including details on \nthe total shares an investor has accumulated and other data that could \nbe used by high-frequency traders to trade ahead of investor orders.\n  It is important to remember that these potentially disadvantaged \ninstitutional orders represent the tens of millions of Americans who \ninvest in mutual, pension, and retirement funds.\n  These market practices, among many others, underscore how critical it \nis for regulators to keep pace with market developments. The May 6 \nflash crash and the miniflash crash in Diebold a month later have \nsounded the alarm that the very credibility of our market is at stake. \nWhile regulators must continue to rely on data to drive the rulemaking \nprocess and be mindful of unintended consequences, they cannot delay in \ntackling the problems that leave us vulnerable to another flash crash \ntoday.\n  As an engineer and a graduate of Wharton Business School, I \nunderstand and appreciate as much as anyone the importance of \ninnovation and technological development. I want to make it clear I am \nnot interested in banning high frequency trading or dark pools, nor am \nI advocating a return to the horse-and-buggy system. But new \ntechnologies must operate in a regulatory framework that considers both \npositive and negative consequences. If the public marketplace has been \nreduced to a battle of algorithms in which liquidity is fleeting and \ninaccessible when investors need it the most, and if the deep liquidity \nthat is so critical to establishing accurate prices--particularly \nduring times of market stress--is largely traded in dark pools, that \nmust be carefully but urgently remedied.\n  As John Wooden, the legendary UCLA basketball coach who passed away 2 \nweeks ago, used to say, ``Be quick, but don't hurry.''\n  Be quick, don't hurry.\n  The SEC and CFTC must adopt the same philosophy as they confront the \ngreat challenges before them.\n  ``Be quick, but don't hurry.''\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time \nused during the quorum call be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I understand the time has been divided \nduring this debate until 1 o'clock. Can I learn how much time is \navailable on our side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 15 minutes remaining.\n\n\n                             Gulf Oilspill\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I want to discuss briefly the President's \nremarks last evening to the Nation about the oil spill in the Gulf of \nMexico and the actions that this administration has been doing to \naddress that. I would also like to discuss issues related to BP, the \ncompany that leased the area offshore and drilled the exploratory well \nwhich exploded in the gulf.\n  First of all, I know there is a great deal of anxiety, nervousness \nand anger about all this. I understand all that because all of us are \nfrustrated that the oil continues to flow. It is a mile down beneath \nthe surface of the water, which is known as a deepwater well. All of us \nare frustrated that this spill has not been contained. But the \nPresident did not cause that spill, and the President himself cannot \nfix it.\n  I do know this though. The Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary \nof Energy, and many other senior administration officials have brought \ntogether the best minds in the world as a team to try to evaluate what \nkinds of technologies and actions that can be used to fix that leak and \nstop that gusher. They have consulted many experts. They have consulted \nthe Norwegians who drill in the North Sea in deepwater drilling. They \nhave consulted with many interests. While it is not a case where they \nhave not done everything conceivable to shut down that spill, and I \nthink, as the President suggested last evening, we are beginning to \nmake some good progress.\n  Then the next issue is how do you deal with the impact on the coastal \nregions in the Gulf of Mexico. This is unbelievably devastating to \nthese States. How do you deal with that? As I have indicated, what \nabout the guy who has a fishing boat on the pier. The pier is deserted. \nThe boat sits at the end of the pier. There is no opportunity to fish.\n  And that person has to make a payment on the boat each month. What \nabout that person and what about the tens of thousands of others like \nhim? What about the ecological and environmental damage that has been \ncaused as well? All of those issues are critically important.\n  I appreciate the fact that the President gave a speech to the Nation. \nI think it was important to do that. I also appreciate the fact that \nthis administration was on this very quickly. But it is frustrating for \nthem and for all of us that the leak from that well has not been \nstopped.\n  I do want to mention the issue of BP because the President mentioned \nit last night, and we have talked about it before. BP has said they \nwill stand behind all legitimate claims and reimburse people for those \nimpacts. I said last week--and I know the President has also now said \nit as well. It is one thing to make a pledge but another to follow \nthrough on a commitment. We have heard about pledges before. In the \nExxon Valdez disaster, Exxon made a pledge to pay for the economic and \nother damages but then fought it for 20 years. A whole lot of folks \ndied before they saw the result of what they were promised. So pledges \nare one thing. I want a binding commitment from the responsible party. \nIf BP says they are going to stand behind this--if they do not stand \nbehind this, the taxpayers will eventually end up picking up the tab. \nSo the issue is, if BP says: We pledge this, I say that is fine, let's \nmake it a binding commitment. Put the money in a recovery fund. You can \ncall it what you want--a trust fund, an escrow account, a recovery \nfund. Put the money in there so we know it will\n\n[[Page S4963]]\n\nbe available for use to those who have been impacted. I also think that \nthere needs to be some sort of special master work to find a mechanism \nby which you begin to get the money out to the people who are hurting. \nThat is what needs to be done.\n  There is debate about whether BP should pay a dividend to its \nshareholders that it announced several weeks ago. Of course they should \nnot pay a dividend. There ought to be no dividend at this point. They \nneed to have the money available to recompense all of the damages for \nall of the people and all the natural resource damages that have \noccurred as a result of this devastating gusher a mile under the ocean. \nSo I don't want them to pay a dividend. They shouldn't be talking about \na dividend. All of the discussion ought to be about how much money you \nput in this recovery fund.\n  Thad Allen has written to BP saying: How about some more transparency \nin how your are making decisions to compensate communities and \nindividuals? I know BP has paid some funding to people, but Thad Allen \nhas said: How about some increasing transparency? Let's find out what \nyou are paying, whom you are paying, how you are paying. What is the \ncriteria? How about some transparency here? We shouldn't have to be \nasking those questions. The money ought to be put in a fund, and that \nfund ought to be administered by people who are putting together the \ncriteria by which we address the problems that are being confronted by \npeople all up and down the Gulf Coast. That is what ought to happen.\n  Another company that is responsible here is Transocean. By the way, \nTransocean was the company who BP leased the mobile offshore drilling \nunit from, and they were drilling under contract for BP. They are going \nto have some responsibility as well, I expect.\n  Let me give you a description here because it is so symbolic of what \nis happening too often in this country. Transocean was an American \nheadquartered company, but they moved to Switzerland not too long ago. \nWhy did they move to Switzerland? I assume so they do not have to pay \nAmerican taxes. Go find a tax haven so you do not have pay taxes to the \nUnited States. So they have, as I understand it, about 1,200 employees \nworking in Houston, TX, and about 12 employees in Switzerland. Yet they \ndeclare Switzerland their headquarters.\n  They had a meeting in Switzerland some weeks ago and decided they \nwere going to pay a $1 billion dividend to their shareholders. They \nought not be paying dividends either. They, too, ought to keep this \nfunding available in case it is needed--when it is needed--to be \nhelpful to the people on the Gulf Coast who are seeing these \nunbelievable impacts. So they ought not be paying dividends at all.\n  Again, we should be asking questions about Transocean. Is it a big \ncompany that should have some liability here? I guess so. It operates \n140 mobile offshore drilling units. It is the world's largest offshore \ndrilling contractor. But again I say, as I have said before, why is it \nthat when you pull the pages back and unearth the story, you discover, \nthat this is a company that moved its headquarters for tax purposes? \nThey first went to the Cayman Islands and then went to Switzerland. \nYet, hey have a handful of people in Switzerland and most of the people \nin Texas. Why does it not want to be an American company? I guess to \navoid paying U.S. taxes. Why is it that all these companies want the \nopportunity to utilize all that our country has to offer but none of \nthe obligations to the country? It is unbelievable, to me.\n  But with respect to dividends, I say to BP and Transocean: Don't be \ndoing that. You are going to need that money.\n  Let's make a binding commitment--no more pledges. That old movie, \n``Jerry McGuire,'' where Cuba Gooding, Jr., says, ``Show me the \nmoney''--show me the money. Let's have that money go from a pledge to a \nbinding commitment in a recovery fund, and that will give a whole lot \nof folks who are hurting today some feeling that maybe, just maybe, \nthey are going to get helped.\n  I also wanted to make a couple of other points about how the Senate \naddresses energy and climate change legislation.\n  Last evening, the President talked about the need for Congress to \ntake up energy legislation. I agree with that. The fact is, we passed \nan energy bill out of the Energy Committee last June. I want to debate \nand vote on it on the floor of the Senate.\n  There are all of these questions about energy versus climate change. \nLook, the Energy bill we passed will maximize the production of \nrenewable energy. It will help build the transmission lines, the \ninterstate highway of transmission capability, around our country that \nis necessary so that you can produce energy where the Sun shines and \nthe wind blows and move it to the load centers where it is needed. It \ncan help do all of these things. It includes provisions for building \nefficiency and retrofits. It does a lot of things to reduce carbon.\n  I guess my approach to energy is best described--and I didn't take \nLatin in a high school of nine students in my senior class. But I call \nmy approach ``totus porkus,'' which probably in Latin would mean \nsomething like ``whole hog.'' I think we ought to do everything. Let's \ndo everything and do it well. Let's responsibly produce more oil and \ngas here and do it the right way. Let's maximize wind, solar and other \nrenewable resources. Let's have the first ever renewable energy \nstandard that says we anticipate that 20 percent. We need to get 20 \npercent of all of the electricity produced from renewable sources. \nLet's support biomass and more biofuels. Let's do all of those things \nand do them well, even as we do them differently, including using coal \nby capturing the carbon.\n  By the way, there are a lot of ways to do that. Sandia National \nLaboratories is working on ways to change the way we think about \nCO2. Yes, CO2 is a major problem, but it can also \nbe a product. Why don't you think of this not just as a problem but a \nproduct? What kind of beneficial use can you develop with \nCO2 that turns a problem into an asset?\n  I chair the subcommittee on appropriations that funds the energy \nresearch and development for the Department of Energy. We are doing a \nlot of unbelievable things that take a look at beneficial use of \nCO2. Even as we reduce the emissions into the atmosphere to \ntry to protect this planet, we can find ways to use CO2 in a \nbeneficial way and protect our planet.\n  My point is this about taking up legislation: Some say, well, you \nhave to bring climate change to the floor of the Senate right now. \nLook, I don't think there are 60 votes for a climate change bill. But \nif that is the case, we will see. But at this point, we do know we have \na bipartisan bill on energy legislation from the Senate Energy \nCommittee does all of the right things. We ought to try to reduce our \ndependency on foreign oil and do that soon. We can do that by bringing \nthe Energy bill we have already passed on a bipartisan basis to the \nfloor of the Senate--the sooner the better, in my judgment.\n  I know we are short of time. I know Senator Reid and others--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 10 minutes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. We have all talked about the prospects of debating energy \nlegislation and want to do the right thing. I hope, as the President \nindicated last night, the right thing is to pass good, comprehensive \nenergy legislation that will make us less dependant on foreign oil and \nbegin to address climate change at the same time.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for up \nto 15 minutes as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Gulf Oilspill\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I rise today for the purposes of giving some context \nand commenting in response to the President's speech last night as well \nas to some of my colleagues who have spoken on the need for a \ncomprehensive energy policy as we move forward. But I would like to \nbegin by just reminding us all that today is the 57th day of what may \nprove to be one of the most damaging environmental accidents in our \nNation's history.\n  Fifty-seven days ago, the tragic explosion of the Deepwater Horizon \ntook the lives of 11 men and unleashed an uncontrolled and \nuncontrollable, to date, torrent of oil and gas into the\n\n[[Page S4964]]\n\nGulf of Mexico. It threatens our environment, and it threatens our \neconomy and the wetlands that underpin a way of life, a precious way of \nlife in the gulf region.\n  I have had the--I guess unfortunate opportunity to spend some time \nwith the widows. And I say ``unfortunate'' because I wish I could have \nmet them under different circumstances. But to hear their remembrances \nof their husbands, to hear the way they expressed to me the heartfelt \ncommitment their spouses had to this industry and to their work and \ntheir call for this work to be more safe, for companies to be held \naccountable, but also their call--which I think serves as real \ntestimony on their behalf to the American people--their call for this \ndeepwater industry to continue, was very moving to me and to all people \nwho I think have had the opportunity to meet these young and very \nimpressive women. I was proud to introduce the Senate resolution \nhonoring these men and their families. I wish to thank my colleagues \nfor agreeing to this resolution unanimously.\n  But today I wanted to speak on three important issues relative to \nthis general situation: one, the need for better safety regulations and \nimprovements at MMS; the other, the impacts of this moratoria; and the \ncall for accelerated revenue sharing and an accelerated claims process. \nFirst, let me begin with the need for better safety regulations.\n  There are more than 300,000 men and women who work in the oil and gas \nindustry in Louisiana alone. There are a significant number of them who \nwork offshore and directly support both the offshore and onshore \nindustry. The offshore crewmen know this work can be dangerous. They go \nthrough a variety of safety drills and regulations routinely. And we \nowe it to them to make sure these activities are safer in the future. \nFor this reason, I have fully supported a thorough review of offshore \ndrilling safety standards and have applauded the Department, and \nparticularly Secretary Ken Salazar, for his willingness to clean house \nat the Minerals Management Service.\n  This tragedy brought to light an unhealthy relationship that has \nexisted, unfortunately for many years, between the oil industry and the \nFederal regulators who are called to regulate them, to make sure this \nindustry is safe. That must be changed. The regulators did not have the \nresources to push back. They did not have the expertise.\n  We in Congress bear some responsibility for that. And that did not \nstart under President Obama's administration, but it should end under \nPresident Obama's administration. This Congress systematically \nundermanned and underfunded this important agency by not giving it the \nappropriate attention it needs, and it is our responsibility to fix it.\n  I look forward to meeting with the man whom the President has \nappointed or nominated to head MMS. I will be making my own independent \ndecision of whether he is the right person for this position. Until I \nmeet him and talk with him and understand a little bit more about him, \nI will reserve my judgment.\n  We need a Minerals Management Service that is to be a proud, \ncompetent, and respected industry watchdog. We need the watchdog back. \nWe need the cop back on the beat if we are to ensure that an accident \nof this magnitude never happens again off our shores. As I have said, \nMinerals Management--many of these employees are my constituents. One \nof their main offices is in Metairie, LA. I have been there. I have met \nmany of them, and they are some very good people. But they need to be \nwell managed. They need to be well led. They need to be given the \nresources they need to do the job they can do if that happens.\n  The Coast Guard also has a role to play. We should strengthen the \nCoast Guard's role and make sure that between Interior and the Coast \nGuard, they are getting the job done for the American people.\n  Nobody in the country wants this job done better, nobody wants this \nindustry more safe than the people from Louisiana and Mississippi and \nAlabama and Texas who man these rigs, although, as you know, when you \nwere with me, Mr. President, some of our people said to you in the \nmeeting just last week: We were grateful for the men from Illinois who \ncame down to work on these rigs. So we want people to know we have \npeople from all over the country, from Illinois and Maine who come and \ndo shifts 2 weeks offshore, make a good living for their family, \nsupport their families for years. We want it to be safe for everyone.\n  So I applaud the President and Secretary Salazar for getting MMS back \non the right track. That work needs to be done. As I said, the cop \nneeds to be put back on the beat.\n  Let me speak for a few minutes, though, about this ill-conceived and \narbitrary 6-month moratorium. The effort the President is making to \nensure this terrible tragedy never happens again is commendable. It is \nbeyond aggravating. It is disgusting. It angers us so much to see the \nterrible tragedy unfolding on our televisions and to open newspapers \nacross the land and see the most horrific pictures of wildlife being \naffected, of dolphins and pelicans and birds, precious places to us \nthat we not only work but vacation with our families for many years.\n  It is very hard to look at those pictures. Americans are suffering \nthrough this as we watch this horror movie unfold. But what the \nPresident has done could cause even more economic damage than the spill \nitself, by putting a 6-month moratorium on all rigs drilling below 500 \nfeet.\n  I know we have to make sure these 33 floating rigs that drill in deep \nwater and the other standard platforms that drill between 500 and 1,000 \nfeet are safe. But I wish to say unequivocally and with the support of \nthe vast majority of the people of my State and throughout the gulf, 6 \nmonths is too long. The deepwater industry cannot survive in the gulf \nwith a 6-month pause. This work has to be done more quickly. The \ncommission was announced last month. It was just seated a few days ago. \nThe work is just beginning. There doesn't seem to be a sense of \nurgency. We need a greater sense of urgency to get this work done.\n  I was pleased to hear the President say he has urged them to get \ntheir work done before the 6-month timeframe. That was a slight step in \nthe right direction. But this work has to be done in a much shorter \nperiod than 6 months. These rigs will not stay in the gulf for 6 months \nidling at a cost of $500,000 a day. They can't be fiduciarily \nresponsible to their investors and do that. They have to move to where \nthey can drill. So they will. We have already received signals they \nwill simply pick up and move off the coast of Africa or Brazil or Cuba \nor other places--Venezuela--to drill. They can't sit idly in the gulf. \nWe have to figure out a way to make sure they are safe, that this never \nhappens again, and make sure they don't leave. That is the challenge \nbefore this administration in the next couple of days and weeks, \nstarting with a meeting I will have with Secretary Salazar this \nafternoon with a broad coalition of leaders, both from the private \nsector and the public sector, who are committed to keeping the economy \nof the gulf coast strong. We have to find a way forward that is \nsomewhere between doing nothing and having all of these rigs leave and \nnot come back for several years. That is one of the points on the \nmoratorium.\n  Second, I wish to ask the President for his personal support and the \nsupport of this body to accelerate revenue sharing, or to accelerate \nrevenue sharing to accelerate a large stream of revenue that is \nreliable for the Gulf Coast States to be able to rebuild our barrier \nislands, to rebuild our coast, to sustain this economy and this ecology \nand this environment over the long run so we can produce the oil and \ngas this country desperately needs.\n  Even though this Horizon accident happened 57 days ago, 57 days ago \nthis country was using 20 billion barrels of oil a day. Today, 57 days \nlater, 11 lives lost, the rig at the bottom of the ocean, we are still \nusing 20 billion barrels a day. The President did not say to people \nlast night to park their cars and walk to work. He didn't say that. I \ndidn't hear him say that.\n  We have to understand we have to continue to drill for oil and gas. \nBut when we drill for oil and gas, the taxes that are paid to the \nFederal Government and have been paid over the years to the tune of \n$165 billion to the Federal Government from severances and royalties, \nthat some of that money\n\n[[Page S4965]]\n\ncome back to the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Texas, and, \nyes, even Florida, in my view, even if they decide not to drill. They \nare at risk. They are at the front line. We are not the only coastal \nStates, but we are the frontline coastal States. Those revenues need to \ncome back to us.\n  We passed a bill some years ago, a bill I worked on for 15 years, \ncalled the Landrieu-Domenici Gulf of Mexico Energy Security Act. That \nbill is in effect. But because of concerns about the deficit, because \nof a lack of understanding of the urgency by this Congress and past \nCongresses, that money doesn't come to us until 2017. We can see that \nis too late. We can see it with our own eyes. We can feel it with our \nown heart. We can see it is too late now. We needed that money 20 years \nago. We needed it 5 years ago. We need it today.\n  For any energy bill to pass, with all due respect to my good friend, \nByron Dorgan; with all due respect to Senators who have been leading \nthis energy effort, there will be no energy bill. The gulf coast \nSenators will not allow it. There will be no energy bill of any \nmagnitude without recognizing the vital need for these Gulf Coast \nStates to share appropriately, as interior States share the revenues \nfor drilling. Interior States such as New Mexico, Wyoming, Utah keep 50 \npercent of the taxes. So the State of Wyoming last year got $1 billion. \nWe could clean up a lot of pelicans with $1 billion. Louisiana got \nvirtually nothing.\n  Our people are on the front line with oil washing up to their knees, \nand this Congress basically keeps 100 percent of the money. Those days \nare over. We are going to have some kind of accelerated revenue sharing \nin any energy bill. Gulf coast Senators will not allow a bill to pass \nthis floor without something we believe is fair to our people.\n  The third issue I wish to speak to the President about and to the \nCongress--and the President mentioned it last night, and I am \ngrateful--is an accelerated claims process. These claims are going to \nbe different than any kind of claim process that has been paid, maybe \nsimilar to what happened after Katrina and Rita, as Mississippi and \nLouisiana and Alabama struggled with how to make people whole. This is \ngoing to be a complicated and difficult situation. We have workers who \ncan't work, who were used to making $500 to $1,000 a week, pretty \nfairly decent wages, not great but decent. They have not been able to \nwork for a long time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time of the Senator has expired.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent for 5 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, that is a modest wage and a decent wage. \nBut it gets a lot more complicated than that. There are boat captains \nwho were getting their business back after Katrina and Rita, \nrecreational boat captains, fishing captains. Unlike Florida where \npeople will come to the beach and then they will see a boat charter and \nthey will wander onto the wharf and charter the boat, that does not \nhappen in Louisiana because we don't have many beaches. People call \nfrom Mexico and Canada and all over the country months in advance and \ncharter a specific boat with a specific captain because we have some of \nthe best fishing in the world. They come with their sons and daughters \nand their grandsons and granddaughters. They come down with major \ncorporate groups and do this chartering. These companies make millions \nof dollars a year. They can't work either.\n  This claims process is going to be difficult. We have restaurants in \nNew Orleans that are 70 miles from the gulf. They have had to either \nshut their doors or turn down their number of hours of operating or \ntake things off their menus. I don't know how we will calculate the \neconomic damage to them. This is going to be complicated.\n  We have hotels. We have retirees who own three or four condos. A \nwoman came up to me and said: Mary, my mother is not a business person. \nShe is a retiree. She owns a couple of condos in Florida. That is her \nretirement income. She rents out these condos. She has had all \ncancellations this summer. What am I going to do for her?\n  That is a good question. She will file a claim.\n  From retirees with condos they rent out to supplement their incomes \nto fishing boat captains to hotels to restaurants and to the workers \nthemselves, I am glad the President is taking the bull by the horns \nwith this claims process. I hope he is having a frank discussion with \nTony Hayward at his office today about that to make sure we don't have \none bankruptcy, that we don't have one business, a small business or a \nmedium-size business or a large business that goes bankrupt because of \nBP's gross negligence in the Gulf of Mexico. They have put the industry \nat risk. They have put the gulf coast at risk. That claims process \nneeds to work. We have a great job to do ahead of us.\n  Those are the three points I wished to make. One, we most certainly \nneed to move forward on a balanced energy bill. There will be no energy \nbill; gulf coast Senators will block anything that does not have \nimmediate help for Gulf Coast States. Let my colleagues be on notice. \nWe can debate the rest of the bill, how we move forward, whether we do \nnuclear or a portion of drilling or wind or solar. These Gulf Coast \nStates are on the front lines, and we are going to get justice for them \nin the near future. We are going to accelerate and make the claims \nprocess more robust, and we are going to continue to put pressure on \nthe White House and Secretary Salazar, respectfully, but appropriately, \nto say: Let's get our safety work done in the gulf. We cannot lose this \nindustry. We cannot lose these jobs. Our economy depends on it.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator may proceed.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I recognize this is Republican time, and \nshould a Republican come, I will then yield the floor to that colleague \nof mine.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Burris pertaining to the submission of S. Res. \n559 are printed in today's Record under ``Morning Business.'')\n\n\n                             Gulf Oilspill\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, very briefly, in terms of President \nObama's speech last night on the crisis in the gulf, I just want to let \nit be known for the record that I support our President in that speech \nand every effort he has made in trying to get direction and a solution \nto the problems we are experiencing down on our gulf coast.\n  I find it disheartening and disappointing all these commentators who \nwant to attack our President, want him to be angry, want him to act. I \nhave no idea what they want this man to do. But I know this man is \ndoing all he can for the people of America. I ask those commentators to \nget off of his back, stop attacking the President, who had nothing to \ndo with that problem and is putting everything he has with the \nresources America has to solve this problem.\n  This has never happened before in our history. It is a problem beyond \ncomprehension. Yet, still, these Monday morning quarterbacks sit back \nand criticize and bring out their undocumented types of statements \nabout our President that I just feel emotionally disturbed about.\n  So I say to all Americans, this President is doing all he can to \nsupport this issue we are facing, and you have to deal with BP, you \nhave to deal with Transocean, and you have to deal with Halliburton. \nThose are the ones who are responsible for this problem. Let's go after \nthem. Make them pay. Make them deal with this and get the solution and, \ntherefore, Americans can move forward.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n[[Page S4966]]\n\n  The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I come to the floor today to talk about \nthe crisis we are having in the Gulf of Mexico and how it is impacting \nFlorida, with the worst economic and environmental disaster in our \nNation's history.\n  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to be with the President of the \nUnited States, along with our Governor, Congressman Jeff Miller, and \nother State and local leaders, and we talked to the President about the \noilspill and what needs to be done in order to mitigate the damage that \nis happening to Florida and the other Gulf States.\n  The most important thing I wanted to stress with the President of the \nUnited States is that after capping the well, which is job 1--and we \nhave some confidence and the President reported he hopes by the end of \nthis month at least 90 percent of the oil will be captured from the \nwellhead--but the next most important priority is keeping that oil from \ncoming on shore.\n  Right now, there is a slick of oil that is 2 miles wide and 40 miles \nlong. It is oil that has come up, apparently, off the bottom of the \nocean. There is this ``lava lamp'' effect that is happening now, where \nthe oil, depending upon the heat of the day, is sinking and rising in \nthe ocean. This is part of that plume that British Petroleum said did \nnot exist, and it is a darker and heavier oil than what we have seen \nbefore. This is not merely the sheen that is on the top. That oil is \nright off the shore of Pensacola.\n  We need to make sure that oil does not come ashore, does not come on \nour beaches, does not get into Pensacola Bay, does not go through the \nPerdido Pass, does not get into those wetlands and marshes. The best \nway we can do that is to get more skimmers off the coast of Florida.\n  As of yesterday, there were 32 skimmers off the coast of Florida. \nThat is simply unacceptable. We know from Admiral Allen that there are \n2,000 skimmers in the United States. I brought this point up to the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Maybe all of them are not available to come to Florida. But if 500 of \nthem were available to come to the Gulf of Mexico, that would be a huge \nimprovement. There should not be 32 skimmers off the coast of Florida; \nthere should be hundreds of skimmers, especially with this looming \nthreat of this oil coming ashore.\n  I have asked for weeks that every skimmer that is available in this \ncountry and every skimmer that is available around the world be on its \nway to Florida. I brought up this issue with the President and Admiral \nAllen. Why aren't there more skimmers? I was told that Admiral Allen is \ntrying to get as many as possible.\n  We need a sense of urgency to get those skimmers off our shores.\n  I asked specifically about foreign countries offering aid to bring \ntheir skimmers to Florida and the other Gulf States and I was told that \nwe have help from foreign countries, but yesterday the State Department \nsays that 21 offers from 17 countries to bring help to Florida and the \nother Gulf States have been refused. Which is it? Are they helping or \nare we refusing them? We have to get that communications mishap, that \nmisunderstanding, under control. If the foreign countries want to bring \ntheir skimmers here, we should welcome them, and the other equipment \nthey can bring to help us ameliorate this oil as it comes ashore.\n  I am going to stay laser focused on this. We are going to do a \nskimmer watch. Every day I am here, I am going to come to the floor and \nreport to this Senate, this Congress, and the people of the United \nStates how many skimmers are off the coast of Florida. This is \nsomething the Federal Government should do. Thirty-two skimmers sounds \nas though my buddies and I got some boats out there and did it. It \ndoesn't sound like the Federal Government. The lives of the people of \nFlorida are at stake. Their businesses, their livelihoods are at stake.\n  I was told by the owner of the pier in Pensacola and a lady who \nworked for him that people are coming to the beach in Pensacola to see \nthe beach one last time, as if they were visiting a friend on his or \nher deathbed, because they don't think the beach is ever going to look \nthe same. So they are coming with their cameras and they are bringing \ntheir children and showing them what a snow-white beach looks like \nbecause they don't think they are going to see it again.\n  I have had grown men--men I have known 10, 20 years of my life, \nprofessionals--come up to me with tears in their eyes worrying about \nwhat this is going to mean for Florida. Ninety percent of Floridians \nlive within 10 miles of the coast. People move to Florida because they \nlove the water. We have more recreational boaters and fishermen than \nany other State. We have more coastline than any State in the \ncontinental United States. Only Alaska surpasses us in coastline. We \nhave more beaches than any State in the United States. Water is part of \nour way of life, and we need to see a more robust effort.\n  I am appreciative of the President on this escrow fund he has set up, \nand we have just gotten a report that BP is going to put $20 billion \ninto this escrow account. We have been asking for this since the \nbeginning of May. I am glad the President got it done. While I don't \nalways agree with the President, where credit is due, credit should be \ngiven, and he should be given credit for this and getting it done. We \nneed those dollars to pay claims. We need those dollars because \nFloridians are getting mixed results from BP about paying those claims. \nSo I am appreciative of the President for taking the idea, executing \nit, and getting it done. Now we need to see the same attention to \ndetail and urgency in trying to keep that oil from coming to shore, and \nI look forward to that.\n  We have failed from the beginning to understand the scope of this \nspill. On April 23 we thought there were 200 barrels a day leaking. On \nApril 28 it was moved up to 5,000; May 27, 19,000; June 10, 40,000; \ntoday, 60,000 barrels a day. Sixty thousand barrels a day leaking into \nthe Gulf of Mexico. That is 2\\1/2\\ million gallons per day; to date an \nestimated 146 million gallons. We are eclipsing the Exxon Valdez each \nweek that goes by.\n  We have to stay vigilant. The President must stay involved. I hope he \nwill come back to Florida. We are going to look for him to lead us \nthrough this. No one wants the President to succeed more than I do in \nthis particular matter because it is the livelihood of Floridians. It \nis our economy and it is our environment that is at stake.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bingaman). The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the Thune \namendment.\n  In a few weeks we will celebrate our Nation's birthday. I find it \nironic that 234 years after our forefathers first led the fight for \nindependence with the battle cry of ``no taxation without \nrepresentation,'' I am hearing similar protests from Missourians today. \nTheir frustration is not only understandable, it is warranted.\n  Missourians and, I believe, Americans in every State across our \nNation have said: No more. They have said no to runaway spending. They \nhave said no to more big government policies. Failing to represent \nthese views, the majority in Congress has fallen down on the job.\n  It is no wonder that Americans feel as though Washington is not \nlistening since my friends on the other side of the aisle are asking us \nto ignore our Nation's $13 trillion debt, the largest in our Nation's \nhistory, and pass a bill that would add nearly another $79 billion to \nthe deficit.\n  But there is a better way. There is a more responsible way. My \ncolleague from South Dakota, Senator Thune, has offered a substitute \namendment that is paid for--paid for--cuts the deficit by $68 billion, \nand includes all the major priorities agreed to on a bipartisan basis \nby Democrats and Republicans.\n  In the Thune substitute, of which I am a proud cosponsor, we have a \nreal opportunity to show the American people that we in Washington are \nlistening. We have an opportunity to show the American people we are \nserious about addressing the most severe financial crisis this country \nhas ever faced, and we have an opportunity for a rare moment of \nbipartisanship which, in recent years, has become all too uncommon in \nthis body.\n  As does the proposal from Senator Baucus, the Republican alternative \nextends expiring unemployment benefits\n\n[[Page S4967]]\n\nfor struggling families until November; and as does the Baucus bill, \nthe Republican alternative extends tax breaks to small businesses which \nthey so desperately need to get back on their feet and start creating \njobs. We need to assure them the longstanding tax benefits they depend \non will continue.\n  However, unlike the Baucus bill which the majority is using as a \nvehicle to increase taxes permanently, increase spending and increase \nthe deficit, the Republican alternative cuts taxes even more by an \nadditional $26 billion, cuts spending by over $100 billion and, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, reduces--reduces--the \ndeficit by $68 billion, instead of increasing it.\n  The Thune amendment also stops the cuts to doctors and provides a 2-\npercent increase in Medicare reimbursement payments that go to doctors \nthis year, and an additional 2 percent in 2011 and 2012. That is one \nmore year than the doc fix in the Baucus bill, and it is actually paid \nfor, not put on our children's credit cards.\n  I have heard from doctors across Missouri and they can no longer face \nthe devastating cuts that threaten their livelihood and threaten our \nseniors' access to care. They are telling me they are going to have to \nstop taking Medicare patients, because the way Medicare is implemented \nnow, they only get 80 percent of what it costs them to provide the \nservice and they are saying, We just can't cut any more--we can't take \nany more Medicare patients. Hospitals are saying the same thing. That \nis before the half trillion dollar cut in Medicare reimbursement comes \nin. It perplexes me that the majority has not addressed that problem in \nwhat they told us was a comprehensive health care law.\n  Something else that was largely left out of the new health care bill \nwas malpractice reform. The Thune amendment corrects this oversight and \nenacts comprehensive medical malpractice reform that will save up to \n$49 billion over 10 years.\n  My friend from Montana, Senator Baucus, takes the opposite approach. \nThe bill he and the majority leader are asking us to support increases \nspending by $126 billion, including over $70 billion in new and \npermanent tax increases, and will increase the deficit by $79 billion \nover the next 10 years. The Baucus-Reid bill is exactly the kind of \napproach that history has shown us won't work and the American people \nhave told us they don't want.\n  The American people have had it with Washington-gone-wild policies. \nThey have had enough of the spending, the tax increases, the debt, the \nbailouts, the big government job-killing policies that have been pushed \nthrough Congress and have been supported by the administration. Today, \nthe Republican alternative offers the majority an opportunity to \nreverse course, to end the out-of-control spending and get serious \nabout fiscal responsibility.\n  When facing a crisis, words mean very little. To say you are \nconcerned about the debt while voting to increase it means very little \nto our children and grandchildren who will have that bill on their \ncredit cards and will have to foot the bill in the future. As the old \ncountry and western song goes: We need a little less talk and a lot \nmore action. The Thune amendment offers us a real chance to bring \nsanity back to Washington policies and for Members of this body to show \nthe American people they are serious about meeting needs while also \naddressing our growing deficit.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Thune amendment \nand, after months of ignoring them, finally demonstrate to the American \npeople that, yes, we are listening to them, we are concerned, we are \ngoing to do something about the debt, the deficit, and the other \nproblems this country faces.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/16/senate-section/article/S4967-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  Mr. BOND.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote on the \nAmerican Jobs Act--a critical bill that would create jobs and help \nexpand small businesses. It would close the tax loopholes that allow \nfar too many large corporations to move jobs overseas. In doing so, it \nwould establish, conversely, tax incentives for American small \nbusinesses so they can create jobs in America. We have seen for too \nmany years--and the Presiding Officer, in New Mexico, has seen too many \njobs in Albuquerque, Santa Fe, as I have in Cleveland and other cities, \nmove overseas because of trade agreements and bad tax law.\n  The Senate, we hope, is close to voting on extending unemployment \ninsurance and COBRA subsidies through the extenders bill. Far too many \nRepublicans seem to look at unemployment insurance as welfare. \nUnemployment insurance is what it is called--insurance. When you have a \njob, you pay into the unemployment fund. When you are laid off through \nno fault of your own, you can receive help from that insurance fund. It \nis as simple as that.\n  We cannot forget why we are in this untenable position of needing to \nhelp small businesses and workers and strengthen the public programs \nthat help Americans find new jobs. We are here because of reckless Wall \nStreet practices brought on by unprecedented greed that has created a \ncrippling recession.\n  I rise to discuss the Wall Street reform bill, as it is now being \nnegotiated in the conference committee, for a few moments.\n  Last week, David Wessel noted in the Wall Street Journal--the paper \nof record for finance, if you will--that when surveyed by the \nnewspaper, leading economists suggested the prevailing belief that the \nSenate bill didn't go far enough to address the issue of banks being \ntoo big to fail.\n  During the Senate debate, I put forward a proposal with Senator \nKaufman, of Delaware, that would have addressed the problem by capping \nthe size of megabanks.\n  Evidence backs up what has been abundantly clear in the last 2 years: \nMegabanks pose a greater risk and threat to our economy than smaller \nones because of the heightened volatility of their assets and \nactivities. Only 15 years ago, the largest six banks in the United \nStates--their total assets were added up to be about 17 percent of GDP. \nFifteen years ago, the combined assets of the six largest banks made up \n17 percent of gross domestic product. Today, their combined assets make \nup about 63 percent of the GDP.\n  Our proposal would have limited the size of bank holding companies at \n$1 trillion and investment banks at $400 billion. Mr. President, $1 \ntrillion is $1,000 billion. I can't believe people in\n\n[[Page S4968]]\n\nthis institution would defend, as so many did, that that is not a bank \nthat is too big. Too big to fail, as people as conservative as Alan \nGreenspan, who is as much to blame for all of this--for the \ngovernment's total failure during the Bush years to regulate Wall \nStreet--even he said too big to fail is simply too big. Only from the \nrarefied heights of a glass or ivory tower does $\\1/2\\ trillion appear \ntoo limited. Remember, Lehman Brothers had more than $600 billion in \nassets and liabilities when it failed and sent the markets into a \ntailspin.\n  We can all agree that our financial system should never again be on \nthe brink of total collapse and that taxpayers should never have to \nfoot the bill for the mess created by Wall Street. If we want to \nprevent bailouts, we have to prevent banks from becoming so big that \nbailouts are necessary. Why wouldn't big banks behave in a risky way \nwhen they suspect a bailout will be given? That is why we must not rely \non a reactive approach to risks that can undermine our economy. \nInstead, we must be much more proactive to prevent those risks from \never recurring.\n  On June 3, Richard Fisher, the president of the Dallas Fed, explained \nin an important speech why we need to address the size of the \nmegabanks. He said:\n\n       Ending the existence of ``too big to fail'' institutions is \n     certainly a necessary part of any regulatory reform effort \n     that could succeed in creating a stable financial system. It \n     is the most sound response of all. If we are to neutralize \n     the problem, we must force these institutions to reduce their \n     size.\n\n  This isn't some far-left or far-right economist; this isn't some bomb \nthrower; this is Richard Fisher, the president of the Dallas Fed, \nemphasizing that too big to fail is, in fact, too big.\n  The Brown-Kaufman amendment wasn't adopted into the Wall Street \nreform bill that passed this body. Yet I continue to believe that it is \nessential if we want to prevent giant institutions from driving down \nthe economy. But it is not the only proposal that would address the \ninstability created by the megabanks.\n  There are several other amendments and issues in the House or Senate \nbills that I would briefly like to address.\n  First, the Merkley-Levin amendment ending proprietary trading. \nBecause of Republican obstruction, we were denied the opportunity to \nvote on that proposal to end the reckless Wall Street gambling called \nproprietary trading. Opponents of this, particularly from across the \naisle, went to such great pains to avoid a vote because I think they \nknew it had strong support.\n  The Merkley-Levin amendment would strengthen the Volcker rule in \nSenator Dodd's Wall Street reform bill. It would have barred banks and \ntheir affiliates from engaging in proprietary trading, which, in \nlayman's language, is the ``casino gambling'' that has banks selling \nproducts to clients with one hand, while betting against the products \nand their clients with the other hand. That can happen only on Wall \nStreet.\n  Too many Wall Street banks used their proprietary trading operations \nto get rich at the expense of their own clients. When those risky bets \ngo bad, American taxpayers are footing the bill. Lehman Brothers' risky \nbets led to the largest bankruptcy in our Nation's history. Soon \nthereafter, other Wall Street banks, which also engaged in reckless \nproprietary trading, brought our economy to the brink of collapse. It \nis time for Congress to end this self-serving practice where the \nconflicts of interest are obvious--and dangerous.\n  Second, Senator Lincoln's amendment on derivatives. Remember that the \nfive biggest banks control 97 percent of the banking industry's \nderivatives holdings--five banks, 97 percent. I support Agriculture \nCommittee Chairwoman Lincoln's proposal, which would separate \nderivatives dealing from lending at commercial banks.\n  This provision is important for the same reason as the Merkley-Levin \namendment. Sprawling financial institutions increase their lucrative \noperations at the expense of other more fundamental and traditional \nbanking activities.\n  Right now, megabank speculation is detracting from their primary job: \nconsumer and small business lending. The fact is, too many banks in New \nMexico, Ohio, and all over are simply refusing to lend now. They are \nnot lending the way our economy needs them to do it. This is part of \nthe reason.\n\n  The latest report by the Congressional Oversight Panel of TARP, \nchaired by Elizabeth Warren, looked at how TARP recipients are lending \nto small businesses. It found that between 2008 and 2009, Wall Street \nlending portfolios have shrunk by 4 percent, with their small business \nloan portfolios shrinking by 9 percent. Over the same period, banks' \nsecurities holdings increased by almost 23 percent. Traditional lending \nby the biggest banks, which received 81 percent of government bailout \nfunds, has declined. At the same time, lending to small businesses from \nmedium-size banks, which received 11 percent of the bailout, increased.\n  Taxpayer-funded assistance, in other words, should not support a \nbank's gambling, but it should support sound economic growth.\n  Third, Senator Collins' amendment on capital standards was adopted in \nthe Senate bill. It would require the Nation's largest banks to meet, \nat a minimum, the same capital standards imposed on smaller banks.\n  Under current law, regulators can often permit large financial \ninstitutions to follow more permissive capital standards, while smaller \nbanks are held to a different standard. Capital standards applied \nequally to all banks would help reduce the risk presented by financial \ninstitutions as they grow in size or engage in reckless banking \nbehavior. The principle behind this amendment is sound. Regulators \nshould be empowered to apply and enforce capital standards equally and \nresponsibly--regardless of a bank's size.\n  Fourth, the amendment Representative Paul Kanjorski offered is a \nprovision in the House bill that directs regulators to take action \nagainst any financial company that ``poses a grave threat to the \nfinancial stability or economy of the United States.'' The grave threat \nof a large financial institution results from excessive leverage, \nexposure to other risky institutions, or unstable sources of credit. \nBecause of this provision, Federal regulators could apply stricter \nprudential standards, limit mergers and acquisitions, and force the \nselloff of business units and assets.\n  Finally, there is a provision offered by Jackie Speier in the House \nwhich would impose a statutory 15-to-1 leverage ratio on systemically \nrisky banks. Combining this with Senator Collins' new capital rule is \nessential. We tried something like this amendment as part of our larger \namendment, with Senator Kaufman, in the breaking up of the largest five \nor six or seven banks.\n  Placing limits on these banks' leverage--meaning their assets \nrelative to their debt--is critical to ending taxpayer bailouts. They \ncannot just leverage and leverage, in ratios like Lehman Brothers did, \nat 30 and 40 to 1. Four of the five largest investment banks were \nleveraged 30, 35, or 40 to 1 at the time of the financial crisis. That \nmeans their assets far outbalanced their ability to cover the debt.\n  According to the Kansas City Fed, the 20 biggest banks are more \nhighly leveraged than community banks. Because the megabanks are bigger \nthan ever before, bailing them out would cost taxpayers even more than \nthey paid this time.\n\n  It is unfair. More important, it is dangerous. The current \ndistortions in the market give privileged, large banks a clear funding \nadvantage. Their implicit government backing is worth up to $34 billion \nannually. That is Wall Street welfare where large financial \ninstitutions continue to receive cheaper rates--maybe 75 basis points \nis what most economists say--compared to smaller banks.\n  As the Wall Street reform bill heads into conference, we should not \ndilute it to appease Wall Street. Wall Street lobbyists are all over \nthis institution--all over the House, all over the Senate. They have \nalready had too much impact on this bill. They have had almost total \ninfluence with Republicans. Frankly, they have had too much influence \nwith my political party, too--the Democrats.\n  We should keep our eye on the ball by stopping financial crises \nbefore they start.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S4969]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Elena Kagan Nomination\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I want to speak briefly on the \nPresident's nomination of Elena Kagan to the Supreme Court. The more we \nexamine her record, the more concerns there are that her legal \njudgments might be infected by her very liberal political views.\n  We see strong evidence of that in Ms. Kagan's memos as a clerk on the \nSupreme Court. In her work as Domestic Policy Adviser in the White \nHouse for President Clinton, we see those strong political views. We \nsee strong evidence of this during her time as dean of Harvard Law \nSchool.\n  Perhaps to some in the elite progressive circles of academia it is \nacceptable to discriminate against the patriots who fight and die for \nour freedoms, but the vast majority of Americans, I think, correctly \nknow that such behavior is wrong. It has an arrogance about it and, \nreally, it is not ethical.\n  When Dean Kagan became dean in 2003, she inherited a policy of full, \nequal access for the military. But she reversed that policy in clear \nopen defiance of Federal law. She kicked the military out of the campus \nrecruitment office as our troops, at that very moment, risked their \nlives in two wars overseas.\n  Some have recently attempted to defend this conduct by arguing that \nshe deigned to speak with the student veterans to discuss whether they \nwould coordinate a sort of second-class system for the recruiters who \nwould come on campus to seek young men and women to serve as JAG \nofficers. This all happened after she had defied the law and had shut \ndown those official channels of recruitment at the official recruiting \noffice. But the Harvard Student Veterans Association plainly expressed \nto Ms. Kagan in a letter to the entire law school that they lacked the \nresources to take the place of the campus office now closed to the \nmilitary.\n  The letter reads in part:\n\n       Given our tiny membership, meager budget, and lack of any \n     office space, we possess neither the time nor the resources \n     to routinely schedule campus rooms or advertise extensively \n     for outside organizations, as is the norm for most recruiting \n     events.\n\n  But Ms. Kagan was unmoved. Instead of welcoming the military \nrecruiters on campus, she punished them, relegating them to second-\nclass status, even leading student veterans to arrange recruiter \nmeetings off campus. In fact, Dean Kagan's public comments contributed \nto a hostile on-campus environment for both recruiters and student \nveterans alike. In fact, she said she ``abhorred'' the military's \nrecruitment policy--blaming soldiers for the decisions of lawmakers--\nthe Congress--and the President. She called it a ``moral injustice of \nthe first order,'' and participated in a student protest opposing \nmilitary recruiting on campus.\n  Stunningly, she expressed sympathy for students and faculty for whom \nshe said ``the military's presence on campus feels alienating.'' Those \nalienated by the military's presence were not the ones who needed the \nsympathy, they needed a history lesson. They had the freedom to \ncomplain and protest from the safety of Harvard's campus because of the \nblood and sacrifice of the men and women who wear our uniform.\n  If you talk to student veterans who were on campus during 2004 and \n2005, you will learn many of them felt exploited. Here were people who \nhad just returned from battles in Iraq, dodging enemy gunfire, and they \nwere supposed to quietly hustle the military recruiters through the \nback door and provide political cover for Dean Kagan.\n  In a report for NPR, one student veteran who was there summed it up \nthis way:\n\n       Getting us to carry her water on military recruitment \n     through the back door was a bridge too far. I came to view \n     her as a very smooth political person.\n\n  Ms. Kagan said her mistreatment of the military was justified by her \nview that don't ask, don't tell was a ``moral injustice of the first \norder.'' But don't ask, don't tell was created and implemented by \nPresident Clinton. Where was her outrage during the 5 years she served \nin the Clinton White House? Why would she blame the military? They \ndidn't pass the rule. It was Congress and the President.\n  So Ms. Kagan didn't take a stand in Washington when she was here, \nwhere the policy was adopted, but waited until she got to Harvard and \nthen stood in the way of hard-working military recruiters who had \nnothing to do with establishing the policy.\n  Now information has come to light suggesting that Ms. Kagan may even \nhave been less morally principled in her approach than has been \nportrayed. Around the same time that Dean Kagan was campaigning to \nexclude military recruiters--citing what she saw as the evils of don't \nask, don't tell--Harvard University accepted $20 million from a member \nof the Saudi Royal family to establish a center for ``Islamic Studies'' \nand Sharia law. An Obama State Department report concerning Saudi \nArabia and the Sharia law concept noted:\n\n       Under Shari'a as interpreted in [Saudi Arabia] sexual \n     activity between two persons of the same gender is punishable \n     by death or flogging.\n\n  Ms. Kagan was perfectly willing to obstruct the military, which has \nliberated countless Muslims from the hate and tyranny of Saddam Hussein \nand the Taliban, but it seems she was willing to sit on the sidelines \nas Harvard created a center funded by--and dedicated to--foreign \nleaders presiding over a legal system that would violate what would \nappear to be her position. She fought the ability of our own soldiers \nto access campus resources but not those who spread the oppressive \ntenets of Sharia-type law.\n  Perhaps her response was guided by campus politics, but certainly Ms. \nKagan lacks any experience as a judge or as a lawyer, and not much as a \nscholar of law. She hasn't written much. Much of her career has been \nspent actively engaged in liberal politics not legal practice, and \nthere are serious questions as to whether she would be able to set \naside that political agenda that has defined so much of her career. I \nthink that is the test we try to give a fair evaluation of this \nnominee.\n  So these are important issues, and she will have an opportunity to \ndiscuss her views. I expect many Americans will be listening closely, \nbut it will be important that any nominee to the Supreme Court be able \nto assure with great confidence the American people--and this Senate--\nthat if confirmed, he or she would be faithful to the law, to serve \nunder the Constitution, and not above it, and not have their political \nagenda infect their rulings, which must be nonpolitical.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I appreciate my friend from Alabama wrapping \nup his speech.\n\n\n                     Amendments Nos. 4344 and 4351\n\n  Mr. President, notwithstanding the pendency of a motion to concur, I \nask unanimous consent that it be in order for the Senate to now \nconsider the Reid amendment No. 4344 in its current form and the \nIsakson amendment No. 4351; that the amendments be debated concurrently \nuntil 2:45 p.m.; that at 2:45 p.m., the Senate proceed to vote in \nrelation to the Reid amendment, to be followed by a vote in relation to \nthe Isakson amendment; that each amendment be subject to an affirmative \n60-vote threshold; that if the amendment achieves that threshold, then \nit be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table; \nthat if they do not achieve the threshold, then they be withdrawn; that \nno amendment be in order to either amendment; that if either amendment \nis agreed to, then once the Baucus motion to concur has been made, the \namendment be considered incorporated in the motion to concur.\n  I further ask there be 4 minutes between the two votes equally \ndivided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my friend from Georgia is here, so I will be \nvery quick. In fact, he can take 3 of the 4 minutes between the votes.\n  The home buyer credit has been wildly successful in stimulating home \npurchases. I have heard from a number of Nevadans who have met the \nApril 30 deadline for having a binding contract for a home--and not \nonly Nevadans but all over the country--but are very concerned they \nwill not be able to close their transaction by the end of this month.\n  The failure to meet the June 30 deadline is not the fault of the home \npurchaser. Banks, title companies, and closing agents are swamped as a \nresult of the success of this program. Many home buyers are stuck \nwaiting for banks to make decisions on short sales. Unfortunately, the \nbanks making these decisions feel no sense of urgency, leaving home \nbuyers powerless to meet the current deadlines. They simply don't care, \nas has been shown during this entire period of time. The banks don't \ncare about the home buyers or the homeowners.\n  My amendment extends the deadline for 3 months. This will give the \nhomeowners time and the home buyers time to close their home purchases. \nMy amendment is fully offset by disallowing a tax deduction for \npunitive damages paid in connection with a judgment or settlement.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wanted to take a few minutes today to \nspeak in support of the amendment offered by my dear friend and \ncolleague from Nevada, Harry Reid. I am proud to be cosponsoring this \nimportant amendment. Last November we passed, with bipartisan support, \nan amendment that extended the very successful first time homebuyer tax \ncredit and expanded it to the ``move up buyer.'' My good friend from \nGeorgia, Senator Isakson was instrumental in crafting this extended and \nexpanded tax credit and I want to commend him for all the work he has \ndone on this issue. Under that legislation, which we worked on \ntogether, homebuyers who were eligible for the credit had to sign a \nbinding contract for their new home by April 30 and close by June 30 to \nreceive the credit.\n  As of April, the Internal Revenue Service estimates that 2.6 million \nAmericans have used the credit. The National Realtors Association \nreported that home sales rose by 6 percent between March and April this \nyear as Americans clamored to qualify for the credit. That increase \nmarked the third consecutive month that home sales grew. And that is \nexactly what this legislation was intended to do--spur home sales and \nbring the housing market back to life.\n  There are between 55,000 and 75,000 eligible homebuyers who entered \ninto contracts to purchase a principal residence by April 30, but who \nwill not get the benefit of the homebuyer tax credit because they do \nnot close by June 30. There are a variety of reasons this might occur: \nthe seller is unable to secure a timely approval from their lender for \nsales related to distressed properties; recent natural disasters have \ndamaged the property; or the homebuyer has experienced delays in the \nprocessing of their Federal mortgage program application.\n  This amendment would extend the closing date deadline from June 30 to \nSeptember 30 so that these eligible homebuyers can still claim the \ncredit. I want to make very clear that this amendment does not extend \nthe credit to new applicants--they must still meet all the eligibility \nrequirements and be under contract by April 30. This amendment just \ngives them more time to close the deal.\n  At the end of the day, this amendment is really about fairness for \nthe thousands of homebuyers who might be ineligible for the credit \nsimply because it is taking longer than usual to complete their \npaperwork. It is simply unfair to allow homeowners who played by the \nrules to lose this credit due to administrative challenges beyond their \ncontrol. I also want to note that this provision is fully paid for by \ndenying corporations the ability to deduct punitive damages from their \ntaxable income. Once again, I thank the majority leader and his staff \nfor crafting this fiscally responsible amendment to help homebuyers. I \nurge all my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I will be brief. This deals with two \namendments, and both do the same thing, except for the way in which \nthey are paid for.\n  I appreciate very much Senator Reid's interest in this as the leader. \nI have worked on this issue, as everybody knows, for a long time. We \npassed unanimously in the Senate last year a home buyer tax credit \nwhich ended on April 30 for contract date. Unfortunately, because of \nthe backlog of appraisals and the current FDIC regulation, a lot of \npeople who qualified for the credit are not going to be able to\n\n[[Page S4971]]\n\nclose by the end of June, and they will lose the credit because we put \na June 30 closing date as the deadline for closing the credit earned by \nthe contract of April 30.\n  Both amendments merely move that June 30 date to the end of \nSeptember, which gives another 90 days to close the transaction that \nhas already been under contract for 60 days. It ensures Americans they \nwill get what the Senate promised them in terms of the tax credit, if \nthey in fact performed and qualified prior to April 30.\n  The difference in the two amendments is the pay-for. One is doing \naway with the deductibility of punitive damages, which is Senator \nReid's. The other is mine, which takes it from the unspent $50 billion \nin stimulus money. And the pay-for, by the way, in both cases, is not a \nlot of money in the scheme of things. It is a lot of money to me and \nyou, but it is $140 million and not $50 billion.\n  So I would certainly appreciate support for the Isakson amendment, \nand I appreciate the support of Senators Dodd and Reid. I yield back \nthe remainder of my time, and I ask for the yeas and nays on the Reid \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second? There \nappears to be a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 4344.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, this is a tax credit extension, as with \nthe previous amendment, but with a different pay-for. The previous was \ndeductibility of punitive damages. This one is from the stimulus money. \nBoth accomplish the same thing, which is allowing Americans who \nqualified for the tax credit by contracting by April 30 to close by \nSeptember 30 rather than by June 30. The reason we are pushing it \nforward is because FDIC rules, regulatory rules and appraisal rules, \nare forcing closings taking as long as 120 days. This doesn't give \nanybody a credit who hasn't already earned it. It just allows them to \ntake advantage of it by protracting the closing date so they would have \nenough time to close. I urge a positive vote on the Isakson amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I oppose this amendment. Recovery act \nmoney works. It adds to reducing unemployment. It adds to the economy. \nIt is very productive. It is helpful. It makes no sense to cut back \nrecovery dollars that work, that help our economy. I, therefore, \nstrongly oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. ISAKSON.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 4333\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak on the Thune \namendment. This is the Republican alternative. Of course, we now know \nthe Baucus package did not get the 60 votes required to go forward and, \ntherefore, we are now looking at the Republican substitute and waiting \nfor a new bill to come from Senator Baucus.\n  I think it is so important that our Senate say to the American people\n\n[[Page S4972]]\n\nthat we know the debt being created in this country is unsupportable. \nOur bailouts have skyrocketed, our spending, our borrowing, now \ntaxing--it is more than the American people can stand.\n  Our national debt now tops $13 trillion. Since President Obama took \noffice 18 months ago the debt has grown by over $2.4 trillion. The \nPresident's budget shows there is no end in sight. It doubles the \nnational debt in 5 years and triples it in 10.\n  In order to sustain this current spending level, the Federal \nGovernment is being forced to borrow 40 cents for every dollar it \nspends this year. The Federal Government is spending 67 percent more \nthan it is earning. This is similar to a household that earns $62,000 \nbut spends $105,000.\n  From whom are we borrowing that money? We owe China over $900 \nbillion, Japan nearly $800 billion. Every household in America knows \nwhat it is like to set a budget. They know what the income is, and they \nknow how to stick with it. It involves setting priorities, making tough \ndecisions, and discipline.\n  The bill we are debating on the Senate floor today includes important \npolicies that are national priorities, and I support many of them. \nHowever, it is time that the Federal Government does what every other \nhousehold does; that is, pay for our priorities.\n  Here is what the Thune amendment does. It extends the expiring \nunemployment provisions until November, the expired tax provisions, \nincluding the local and State sales tax deduction through the end of \nthe year. So we know that any of the expired tax cuts that people have \nbeen counting on that have been in place for several years would go \nthrough the end of this year so people would know that is at least one \nstabilizing force on which they can count.\n  It drops the job-killing tax increases in the Baucus substitute. The \nThune amendment proves that government can make the tough choices. The \nThune amendment is paid for. According to CBO, it cuts taxes by $26 \nbillion, it cuts spending by over $100 billion, and it reduces the \ndeficit by $68 billion over the next 10 years. It shows the American \npeople that this Senate is serious about stopping the deficit spending \nwe have seen in the last 18 months.\n  Spending cuts in the Thune amendment: one, it rescinds the \nunobligated stimulus funds; two, it imposes a 5-percent, across-the-\nboard cut in government spending for all Federal agencies except the \nVeterans' Administration and the Department of Defense; three, it \nfreezes for 1 year Federal employee salaries, including, of course, \nCongress. It is very important that our Federal employees have the same \nkinds of restrictions that most Americans are feeling right now. It is \na freeze, not a cut, in Federal employee salaries. It requires the \nselling of $15 billion of unneeded and unused government property.\n  I believe the doctor fix that we have done in a patchwork way year \nafter year since the balanced budget amendment is now another patch.\n  Medicare pays doctors in a fundamentally broken way. It has become an \naccess-to-care crisis for our seniors. Too many seniors are unable to \nfind a doctor who takes Medicare because the Federal Government has \nproven time and again that it is an unreliable business partner. We \nneed a long-term solution so that the best and brightest in our country \nwill choose medicine for their career and will choose to serve Medicare \npatients. Medicare is supposed to make seniors comfortable that they \nwill be able to get medical care, but so many Medicare patients cannot \nfind good doctors; they can't go to the doctors they want to see \nbecause the doctors have just said: I have had enough.\n  In Texas, over 60 percent of our counties are considered health \nprofessional shortage areas. The number of medical school graduates \nchoosing primary care has dropped 50 percent since 1997. Fifteen \nmedical specialties have reported physician workforce shortages, and we \ncould face a physician shortage of more than 150,000 physicians in the \nnext 15 years.\n  The Thune amendment provides over 2 years of a positive update for \nour Medicare physicians paid for by the kind of tort reform that has \nsaved Texas doctors so much. The tort reform has brought down insurance \npremiums in Texas and we have increased our number of doctors since \ntort reform was enacted.\n  We could do the same thing at the Federal level, and then the many \ncounties I hear about from my colleagues all over our country that \ndon't have a primary care physician or don't have an OB-GYN physician \nwould be able to start seeing an influx of medical personnel back into \nthe practice of medicine.\n  We can do something good for America. We can show America that \nCongress understands that this debt is unsustainable, if we pass the \nThune amendment. It is essential that we pass an amendment that will \npay for the extension of unemployment insurance, that will not have any \nmore deficit spending and not increase taxes.\n  We need to continue the cutting of taxes so that our businesses will \nfeel they can hire people, so that we will have an economy that can be \nsustained without sending more and more money to the Federal \nGovernment, which is growing bigger and bigger. We need business to \ngrow, to hire people, to get our economy going again so that all of the \nsectors, including retail as well as manufacturing, will survive in our \ncountry.\n  It is my hope we can pass the Thune amendment. It is fully paid for, \nit will not have deficit spending, and it will cut taxes rather than \nincrease taxes on businesses. That is the alternative that we think is \nimportant for America to see.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest called the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Motion to Concur with Amendment No. 4369\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, pursuant to the previous order, I move to \nconcur in the House amendment to the Senate amendment to the bill with \nan amendment I send to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4369 to the House amendment to the Senate amendment \n     to H.R. 4213.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, this is a new substitute amendment. We \nvoted on an earlier version today. This is a new one. It still \naddresses many of the same issues as the last substitute, but it is \nsmaller. It has fewer dollars involved and it is more paid for. The \nmajority of this amendment is now offset. Most of the dollars spent in \nthis amendment are offset, not by a lot but still the majority--more \nthan half. All of the amendment is offset except for two matters: the \nunemployment insurance and the aid to the States under Medicaid; that \nis, the safety net provisions are not offset--those two. Everything \nelse is offset. That means we do pay for changes to how doctors are \ncompensated under Medicare. That is paid for. We do pay for all the \nchanges to the tax laws. They are paid for as well.\n  We also made changes to the provisions regarding S corporations and \ncarried interest. I will have more to say about those tomorrow, but \nsuffice it to say that the S corp changes address some of the \nadministrative concerns and burdens some Senators had as we were \nattempting to stop the abuses of some professional S corps, the abuses \nthey have been conducting. Frankly, they have been paying themselves a \nvery small salary. These are professional corporations primarily. Then \nthey pay themselves dividends. Because dividends are not wages, they \navoid payroll taxes. They avoid the FICA tax and avoid paying the \nMedicare tax. That is something we are trying to stop. The substitute \nstill addresses that abuse but in a way that is less burdensome to bona \nfide S corporations. The carried interest provisions generally soften \nsome of the provisions that were contained in the substitute.\n\n[[Page S4973]]\n\n  The bottom line is that we listened. Several Senators had some \nconcerns about the earlier substitute. We heard those Senators, and we \nhave adjusted the amendment accordingly.\n  We believe this amendment can provide a path forward. We believe this \namendment can complete our work on this bill. We believe this amendment \ncan help to enact into law help to people who need help, the \nunemployed, and States under Medicaid and also help create jobs our \nconstituents are demanding. The tax provisions will have that effect.\n  I very much hope that when we get to the substitute amendment vote, \nwe will get the necessary votes to pass it. I am looking for something \nabove 60, north of 60, so we can move forward to other measures.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 20 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                            Financial Reform\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, it has only been 2 years since we had an \nextremely painful financial crisis that almost brought down our entire \neconomy.\n  To try to address the root cause of the crisis, we are currently \nnearing completion of a long and arduous process to develop a \ncomprehensive financial reform bill.\n  The world is watching to see how strong a bill this Congress will \nproduce, and we need to show leadership. Yet I fear that instead of \nputting in place strong structural reforms as a model for other \nnations, we are deferring too much to the discretion of regulators who \nhave failed in the past, and to international negotiations--currently \nunderway in Basel, Switzerland--that have all too often resulted in \nglobal standards that were the lowest common denominators.\n  Capital flows easily across borders, and so the United States needs \nto provide leadership and then produce harmonized global standards. \nInstead, I fear we are doing the opposite. We have hollowed out our \nnational response so that we can negotiate with a free hand on the \nglobal stage--after Congress showed the world that we lack the \npolitical resolve to impose hard measures.\n  This is why we have heard a common refrain that statutory \nrequirements on capital or other prudential standards will tie \nregulators' hands during these international negotiations. We heard it \nbefore on the Brown-Kaufman amendment to restrict the size, leverage, \nand risk of our megabanks. Now we hear it on the Collins amendment.\n  Senator Collins's commonsense provision would ensure that bank \nholding companies and systemically significant nonbank financial \ninstitutions are subject to capital and leverage requirements as \nstringent as those that insured depository institutions face under \nexisting prompt corrective action regulations. This provision would \nraise the capital bar for our largest financial institutions, requiring \nthem to hold more committed and reliable forms of capital; namely, \ncommon equity and retained earnings. As my colleagues will recall, it \npassed by a voice vote during the Senate debate.\n  Now there is the threat that the Collins amendment might be \neliminated for the sake of ``international negotiations.'' Mr. \nPresident, I fear this is a recipe for a global race to the bottom for \ntwo reasons: First, a tepid response by the United States may also \nundermine other countries' consideration of tough reform measures. For \nexample, the U.K. is studying whether to break up their megabanks. But \nsome in the U.K. have suggested that since the United States isn't \ntaking this preemptive action, the U.K. would not do it either.\n  Second, some countries' regulators appear to be wedded to the status \nquo, and we are only reinforcing the impression that tough measures are \nnot needed. Remarkably, only weeks before the European Government and \nthe IMF cobbled together an almost $1 trillion bailout of European \nmegabanks, one French Government official stated:\n\n       The situation is completely different here, and the system \n     that was in place has not worked badly and does not need to \n     be overhauled.\n\n  Regulators from Germany, France, and Japan, among others, are opposed \nto having a leverage requirement and a more strict definition of what \nconstitutes capital.\n  Leaving aside the opposition of many countries to the very concept of \na leverage capital requirement, there are those who still indicate that \nthe quantitative requirement must be set through the Basel \nnegotiations. In fact, Treasury Secretary Geithner said:\n\n       By the end of this year, we will negotiate an international \n     consensus on the new ratios.\n\n  Why does it strengthen our negotiating hand for the Congress to have \nfailed to enact hard rules? Moreover, it is tougher to imagine how we \ncan set a number on leverage when we don't even have an agreement on \nhow to measure leverage, since the United States follows GAAP \naccounting standards while the rest of the world follows IFRS. It is \nunlikely we will have uniformity, or even harmonization of those rules, \nfor many years--if we ever will at all. While the accounting standard \nissue is often overlooked, it should go without saying that it is a \nmore basic and first-order problem.\n  Most important, for what are we negotiating? The history of \ninternational capital standards is that of colossal failures--Basel I, \nBasel II, and now Basel III. Instead, we have a sovereign banking \nfailure and should be establishing a sovereign solution.\n  If other countries want to permit banks to become risky and fail--\nsuch as what Europe may be facing due to the European debt crisis--let \nthem learn the hard lessons America has already learned.\n  Let me briefly review the history of the Basel accords, which should \nstiffen the resolve of the conference negotiators to include measures \nthat will prevent another financial crisis caused by U.S. megabanks.\n  The Basel I Accord was a crude apparatus that established numerical \nrequirements for the amount of capital that banks need to set aside \nbased upon how risky the assets on their balance sheets were perceived \nto be. Different types of loans and assets were lumped into risk \nbuckets. Some received lower risk weights, while others received higher \nrisk weights. However, those weightings were arbitrary determinations \nthat did not even take into account basic risks--most notably credit \nrisk--associated with loans and other financial assets that banks hold.\n  Under the Basel I system, a bond issued by a blue chip AAA company \nsuch as Johnson & Johnson would have had a much higher risk weight than \na subprime stated-income loan, a loan to Greece, or a loan to Lehman \nBrothers. Not surprisingly, banks were able to easily game--or \narbitrage--these capital requirements in a way that generally increased \ntheir risk profile. Banks were able to cherry-pick high-risk, and \ntherefore, high-return assets that had low capital requirements because \nof the risk bucket in which they were placed. Banks also got around the \nBasel I requirements by shifting more assets off their balance sheets.\n  The Basel II Accord, which was agreed to in 2004, was the culmination \nof several years of negotiations. While it was intended to address the \nflaws of Basel I by making capital requirements more risk sensitive, it \nactually created bigger problems.\n  Most notably, the accord's complexity and sophistication masked a \nderegulatory philosophy that sought to make determinations on capital \nadequacy dependent on the judgments of rating agencies and, \nincreasingly, the banks' own internal models. By outsourcing their \nregulatory responsibilities to the banks that they were supposed to \nregulate, bank regulators were making an implicit admission that the \nsize and complexity of the megabanks had exceeded their comprehension.\n  Unfortunately, complex capital standards that rely upon banks' own \ninternal models pose serious problems for any democratic nation that \nprizes accountability and transparency, such as the United States. In \nhis book ``Banking on Basel,'' Federal Reserve\n\n[[Page S4974]]\n\nGovernor Daniel Tarullo provides an exhaustive account of the Basel II \ncapital accord that specifically questions the accord's decision to \nbase capital standards on the internal ratings of banks. Tarullo \nindicates that the ``very complexity of the [accord's] approach gives \nbanks more opportunities to manipulate, or make mistakes during, \ncalculation of their capital ratios.''\n  Even more troubling, Governor Tarullo noted it would also be nearly \nimpossible for any independent auditor or examiner to identify failures \nand forbearance on the part of regulators. To that point, he states \n``it may be extremely difficult for an independent entity such as the \nGovernment Accountability Office to reconstruct the series of decisions \nand judgments that went into the creation and supervisory assessment of \nthe credit risk model.'' Given that, how will we in Congress be able to \nhold either the megabanks or their regulators accountable?\n  By virtually all accounts, the Basel II Accord was a complete \nfailure. The Basel Committee itself estimated that it reduced capital \nfor some banks by as much as 29 percent, at a time in which regulators \nshould have been ramping up capital and other prudential requirements \nupon banks.\n  By trying to tie capital requirements to so-called risked-based \nmeasurements, the Federal Reserve--the main driver of the Basel \nprocess--apparently hoped to eliminate the basic leverage requirement. \nIn fact, former Fed Governor Susan Bies told banks that ``the leverage \nratio down the road has got to disappear.'' Fortunately, despite the \nFed's objections, Basel II has not been implemented in the United \nStates, in large part due to concerns that it would disadvantage \nsmaller community banks that did not have the resources and wherewithal \nto make investments in supposedly advanced risk models.\n\n  It was, however, applied to European banks. Unconstrained by a basic \nleverage capital ratio, many of these banks went on to arbitrage the \nBasel requirements by gorging on AAA-rated bonds backed by subprime \nmortgages, not to mention the sovereign debt of highly indebted \nEurozone countries such as Greece and Spain. The result has been \nhundreds of billions of dollars of losses followed by both explicit and \nimplicit bailouts by EU governments.\n  The accord was also effectively applied to investment banks such as \nLehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs, which had precarious and explosive \nbusiness models that utilized overnight funding to finance illiquid \ninventories of assets. These institutions were nominally regulated by \nthe SEC, which had no track record to speak of with respect to ensuring \nthe safety and soundness of financial institutions. The Commission \nallowed these investment banks to leverage a small base of capital over \n40 times--I repeat, over 40 times--into asset holdings that, in some \ncases, exceeded $1 trillion.\n  Of course, in the wake of the most recent crisis, the same failed \nregulators now tell us that, this time, they have learned their lesson \nand will develop a new agreement that will address the deficiencies of \nthe last one. But what reasons do we have for thinking that will be \ntrue?\n  Assistant Treasury Secretary Michael Barr notes that regulators are \nnow pushing for new global capital standards that will be ``more \nrobust, higher and better quality, less pro-cyclical, and include \nglobal agreement on a leverage ratio.'' But the megabanks are already \ndeveloping new ways to arbitrage as well as weaken the global capital \nstandards to which Secretary Barr refers. In other words, they are \nfinding ways to gut and go around the rules before they are even \nfinalized.\n  What is more, many of the regulators involved in the discussions \ninspire little confidence. Christian Noyer, the governor of the Bank of \nFrance and the new chairman of the Bank of International Settlements, \nthe entity that oversees the Basel rulemaking process, indicated, that \nthe new rules ``shouldn't undermine the business model of banks which \nhave perfectly withstood the crisis.'' Given that the same Bank of \nInternational Settlements estimates that eurozone banks have two-thirds \nof the exposures to the most fiscally imperiled European countries--\nGreece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain--it is not clear to which banks \nGovernor Noyer is referring.\n  As the Financial Times notes, France, Germany and Japan are ``more \nattached to the preeminence of the current risk-based approach and \nwants the leverage ratio to have a much less important role in \ngoverning banks' balance sheets.'' In effect, they are pushing for the \nstatus quo of Basel II, which has been an unmitigated disaster. After \nthe multiple trillions of dollars worth of public funds expended on \nmegabank bailouts, it seems amazing that many regulators would like to \nmaintain a system where the largest banks effectively regulate \nthemselves.\n  But U.S. regulators are not immune to the defense of the existing \nregime. As the Wall Street Journal reports, ``some U.S. government \nofficials are fighting what they view as an anti-American proposal that \nwould prevent banks from counting as part of their capital cushion a \nspecific type of security favored by U.S. banks known as a trust-\npreferred security.'' In other words, we have unnamed U.S. regulators \nthat are fighting against Senator Collins' amendment in international \nnegotiations.\n  The current state of international capital negotiations gives little \ncomfort to those who would like to see fundamental structural reforms \nto address the problem of too big to fail.\n  I am in favor of international negotiations to harmonize financial \nregulatory standards. However, these negotiations should not preclude \nthe Congress from setting statutory floors. They should never result in \nthe abdication of our sovereign powers and responsibilities.\n  I, therefore, agree with the sage thoughts of former Federal Reserve \nChairman Paul Volcker when he said that while ``good things may come \nout of the Basel process, ``it is not structural change.'' In his view, \nand in mine, we need to do both.\n  Instead of trusting our financial stability solely to unelected \nfinancial guardians, in this country and abroad, Congress should \nlegislate structural and fundamental reforms that preemptively address \nthe persistent problem of too big to fail. Senator Collins' provision \nis but one example of that. There is also Senator Lincoln's proposal to \nrequire swap dealers to be spun off and separately capitalized from \ninsured depository institutions; a strong Volcker Rule ban on \nproprietary trading at banks, as proposed by Senators Merkley and \nLevin. \n  Without transparency and accountability, a democracy cannot function. \nThat is why we still need the statutory standards on the leverage as \nwell as the size of these megabanks. While some technocrats may say \nthat they are blunt tools, I say that that is precisely the point. They \nwill not only provide a sorely needed gut check that ensures that \nregulators do not miss the forest for the trees when assessing the \ncapital adequacy of a financial institution, they will also provide a \nbasic means to ensure accountability in the performance of government \nofficials.\n  We cannot--we cannot--afford another meltdown and the American \npeople--and, indeed, the rest of the world--are looking to Congress to \ntake steps to ensure that that does not happen. By adopting these \nfundamental reforms and preemptive measures, Congress will go a long \nway towards protecting the American people from future bailouts. It \nwill also be providing global leadership, demonstrating to the rest of \nthe world that fundamental reform of our financial system does not rest \nupon the decisions of unelected technocrats whose grand designs brought \nour financial system to the brink.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise tonight to express my concern \nwith how Congress continues to address this package of so-called \nextenders. This is a debate we have had on multiple occasions this \nyear, and once again we find ourselves discussing how to enact a short-\nterm extension of items such as emergency unemployment benefits, \nreauthorization of the National Flood Insurance Program, the Federal \nMedicaid matching rate, FMAP, and the Medicare doc fix.\n  This is a difficult debate for many of us. Times are tough across the \ncountry, as well as in my home State of Georgia where the unemployment \nrate is 10.4 percent. During a time of economic hardship, I do not \nbelieve we\n\n[[Page S4975]]\n\nshould allow provisions, such as the extension of emergency \nunemployment benefits, to expire. But I do believe that when we extend \nthese programs, we should do so in a responsible fashion. Congress \nshould find a way to pay for those extensions.\n  That is where there is disagreement on this issue--not whether \nCongress should pass an extenders package but whether it should be paid \nfor.\n  Even though the need for these extensions comes as no surprise, we \nagain find ourselves in a position where the majority has proposed \nextending these programs without finding the money to fund them.\n  Just 2 weeks after our Federal debt topped $13 trillion--let me say \nthat one more time; $13 trillion is owed by the United States of \nAmerica today--we are now poised to vote on another proposal that would \nspend money this country simply does not have.\n  That number, $13 trillion, is so big that it is difficult to \ncomprehend. But what it boils down to is $42,000 of debt for every \nsingle citizen of the United States of America.\n  The public debt has risen by $2.4 trillion in the 500 days since the \ncurrent administration took office. That is an average of $4.9 billion \nper day. We are now borrowing 43 cents of every dollar we spend. But \nstill we are continuing to spend.\n  Estimates show that $4.8 trillion of the $9 trillion in debt that \nAmerica will accrue over the next decade will be from interest. That is \n$4.8 trillion that could be better used on national defense or returned \nto taxpayers to pay for other necessities. Instead, future generations \nwill be forced to pay higher taxes to foot the bill for Congress's out-\nof-control spending.\n  With much of our national debt being held by other nations, such as \nChina, this is also an issue of national security. Just as with our \nenergy and food supply, we put our Nation in a more vulnerable position \nwhen we disproportionately rely on other countries.\n  It is a matter of great concern that our Nation is in deep debt to \nforeign countries that often do not share our positions on domestic or \ninternational policy matters. While our global economy ensures that \nthere will be foreign investment in our debt, this sustained, exploding \ndebt guarantees that we provide leverage to our creditors. At some \npoint, we have to say enough is enough and make some tough decisions \nabout spending beyond our means. Again, we can pass an extenders \npackage without recklessly adding to the cost of our Federal debt.\n  Earlier this year, this body voted to give the rule known as pay-go \nthe force of law. And yet virtually every piece of legislation that we \nhave considered between then and now has fallen short of this \nstandard. Talking about fiscal responsibility and restraint while \nspending recklessly is hypocrisy of which the American people will \nsurely take notice, and they have taken notice. States as well are \nbeing left in the fiscal lurch.\n\n  By not shoring up the Federal Medicaid matching rate, my State of \nGeorgia will have a $370.5 million hole in its budget. We have had to \nmake sacrifices at home. My legislature has had to make very difficult, \nhard, and tough decisions with respect to trying to find reductions in \nspending at the State level to come up with a fiscally responsible, and \nbalanced budget that they are required to have under our State \nconstitution.\n  We know States are facing huge challenges, relying as they do on \nmoney promised from the Federal Government. But we all need to keep in \nmind that we are borrowing virtually every cent of that money. It is \ntime we get serious about this Nation's precarious fiscal situation. We \ncan no longer afford to burden our grandchildren with insurmountable \ndebt.\n  Recently, we witnessed what happens when a nation does not live \nwithin its means. The economic crisis in Greece was caused by years of \nunbridled spending and failure to implement fiscal reforms. This \nrecklessness left Greece badly exposed when the global economic \ndownturn appeared. This pattern should serve as a wake-up call to every \none of us that spending must be controlled.\n  Retirement programs such as Medicare and Social Security are on the \nverge of bankruptcy. In March of this year, reports emerged that Social \nSecurity is set to pay out more in benefits than it receives in payroll \ntaxes this year--a threshold the program was not expected to cross \nuntil at least 2016. By some estimates, the program will no longer be \nable to pay retirees full benefits by the year 2037.\n  Instead of trying to place programs such as Social Security on more \nstable footing, we spent more than a year debating a health care bill \nthat will create even more costly entitlement programs, the true price \ntag of which is yet to be seen.\n  The original proposal that was debated and voted on earlier today, \nadvanced by the majority, increased spending by $126 billion, which \nincluded more than $70 billion in new taxes and increased the deficit \nby $79 billion over the next 10 years. Thank goodness the votes were \nnot there to proceed with that underlying bill.\n  Now, according to the chairman of the Finance Committee, we have a \nnew bill. While it is smaller in dollars, according to the comments \nmade by the chairman of the Finance Committee earlier tonight--he says \nalso that the majority of the amendment is offset, which means it is \nstill not paid for.\n  We have an opportunity tomorrow to take a step toward responsibility \nand restraint by paying for this extenders package. I am a cosponsor of \nthe amendment introduced by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune, \nwhich would extend the same programs as the House-passed version of \nthis legislation. But unlike that version, the Thune amendment pays for \nthose programs instead of adding their cost to the Federal debt. It \nalso cuts taxes by $26 billion, cuts spending by more than $100 \nbillion, and, according to the CBO, reduces the deficit by $55 billion. \nIt does this through spending cuts and the use of unobligated stimulus \nfunds.\n  The Thune amendment does away with the harmful tax increases on long-\nterm investment that are part of the underlying bill. These taxes on \ncarried interest would almost certainly serve to discourage capital \ninvestment, increase borrowing costs associated with starting or \ngrowing businesses, and hurt real estate and stock prices, all at a \ntime when our economy is extremely vulnerable. The real estate and \nventure capital arena--two segments of our economy that are vital to \nsustained job growth--would be especially hard hit by these taxes on \nlong-term investments.\n  Many Americans need the programs in this bill to be extended, but we \nmust be sure we extend them in a responsible way, and that is why I \nurge my colleagues to strongly consider the Thune amendment as we \ndebate it tomorrow and vote in favor of the Thune amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, in December of 2008, the Trafficking \nVictims Protection Reauthorization Act became law. The act includes a \nprovision that I put in the bill with Senator Sam Brownback, Republican \nof Kansas, to address the problem of child soldiers, specifically the \nChild Soldier Prevention Act.\n  The goal of this language was simple and straightforward: U.S. \nmilitary assistance should not go to finance the use and exploitation \nof children in armed conflict. The law not only expresses American \nvalues by rejecting any use of child soldiers by foreign governments, \nbut also provides leverage through our Foreign Military Assistance \nProgram to encourage governments to address this heinous practice.\n  Moreover, under the Child Soldiers Accountability Act and Human \nRights Enforcement Act, it is unlawful to knowingly provide material \nsupport to the use of child soldiers. Tragically, according to Amnesty \nInternational, hundreds of thousands of children around the world are \nstill being used as child soldiers. These boys and girls wield \nautomatic weapons on the front lines of combat. They serve as human \nmine detectors. They participate in suicide missions. They carry \nsupplies, they act as spies, messengers, lookouts, and sex slaves. They \nendanger their own health and the lives of others and sacrifice their \nchildhood in the process.\n  As chairman of the Judiciary Committee's Human Rights and the Laws \nSubcommittee, one of the first hearings we held was focused on the \nscourge of child soldiers. We heard moving testimony from a remarkable \nyoung man named Ishmael Beah. Mr. Beah is a former child soldier from \nSierra Leone and author of the best selling book, ``A Long Way Gone: \nMemoirs of a Boy Soldier.''\n  Some Americans may recall this book because it was featured at \nStarbucks for a long period of time. You find it at bookstores as well. \nI will never forget what Mr. Beah told the Human Rights Subcommittee, \nand I want to quote him. Here is what he said:\n\n       When you go home tonight to your children, your cousins, \n     and your grandchildren, and watch them carrying out their \n     various childhood activities, I want you to remember that at \n     that same moment, there are countless children elsewhere who \n     are being killed, injured; exposed to extreme violence and \n     forced to serve in armed groups, including girls who are \n     raped . . . As you watch your loved ones, those children you \n     adore most, ask yourselves whether you would want these kinds \n     of suffering for them. If you don't, then you must stop this \n     from happening to other children around the world whose lives \n     and humanity are as important and of the same value as all \n     children everywhere.\n\n  We have a moral obligation to respond to Mr. Beah's challenge. \nChildren suffer high mortality, disease, and injury rates that are \nhigher in combat situations than adults. The lasting effects of war and \nabuse remain with them long after the shooting stops. Both girls and \nboys are stigmatized and traumatized by their experience, and left with \nneither family connections nor skills to allow them to transition \nsuccessfully to productive adult life.\n  Over the last decade, 2 million children have died in armed \nconflict--10 years, 2 million children died in armed conflict, 6 \nmillion injured.\n  Further troubling is that children have served as soldiers for \ngovernments that have in the past received the assistance of the U.S. \nGovernment. With the passage of the Child Soldier Prevention Act, my \nhope was that this practice would come to an end.\n  Imagine my surprise when I saw on the front page of the New York \nTimes this week that Somalia's transitional federal government, which \nthe U.S. supports financially as part of its larger counterterrorism \nstrategy, is brazenly using child soldiers. Mr. President, I know you \nhave a young son and you probably saw this photograph. But imagine, if \nyou will, two young boys, identified in this photograph in Somalia, 12-\nyear-old Adan Ugas, and 15-year-old Ahmed Hassan, holding automatic \nmilitary weapons and working for the transitional Federal Government of \nSomalia.\n  When I was a little boy, 12, 10, we used to play with guns, but they \nwere all toys. This is the real thing. These are children. As Ishmael \nBeah said: Try to picture your son or daughter in that situation, their \nchildhood robbed and scarred for life from being drawn into horrific \nviolence.\n  The fact that they are working for a military financed by the United \nStates is appalling. In fact, according to human rights groups and the \nUnited Nations, the Somali Government is fielding hundreds of children \non the front lines, some as young as 9 years old. A Somali Government \nofficial quoted in the Times article said: We were trying to find \nanyone who could carry a gun.\n  I read that article. It talked about these little boys who, the guns \nwere so heavy, they were switching the strap from one shoulder to the \nnext. They were talking about these little boys with these automatic \nweapons challenging people in vehicles to stop or they would shoot \nthem.\n  They asked one of these little boys: What do you really love in life? \nHe said: I love my gun. A Somali Government official acknowledged the \nfact that this is happening, an official of a government which we are \nsupporting.\n  I understand Somalia is in a difficult neighborhood in the world, and \none of the most dangerous places. It is trying to emerge from years of \nlawlessness, and the fledgling government does need support. I have met \nwith refugees who have fled the chaos of Somalia in hopes of a better \nlife.\n  In fact, this last Saturday I met with refugees in Chicago from \nSomalia. But the law is clear. American tax dollars must not be used to \nfund the use of child soldiers. Period. I urge the Department of State \nand the Department of Defense to immediately halt the U.S. support for \nany such activities and to work with the Somali Government to terminate \nthe use of child soldiers, and reintegrate these children back into a \nnormal, peaceful family life.\n  I have written our Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, and urged her \nto recognize that though the Somali transitional government is trying \nto bring some measure of stability to their war-torn country, it should \nnot do so on the backs of its most precious commodity, its children, \nand certainly not with the help of American taxpayers.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na letter to Secretary Clinton on this topic.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    June 16, 2010.\n     Secretary of State Hillary Clinton,\n     Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Clinton: I write with great concern over a \n     June 14 report in the New York Times that U.S. military \n     financing to the Somali Transitional Federal Government is \n     being used to pay for the use of child soldiers. Such \n     assistance would appear to be in violation of the Child \n     Soldier Prevention provision of the Trafficking Victims \n     Protection Reauthorization Act of 2008 which prohibits U.S. \n     military assistance to governments of a country that use \n     child soldiers. Moreover, under the Durbin-Coburn Child \n     Soldiers Accountability Act and the Durbin-Coburn Human \n     Rights Enforcement Act, it is unlawful to knowingly provide \n     material support to the use of child soldiers.\n       As you know, the tragic use of child soldiers continues to \n     a problem around the world. Amnesty International estimates \n     that globally more than 250,000 children are fighting in \n     active conflicts. These young boys and girls fight on front \n     lines of combat, serve as human mine detectors, participate \n     in suicide missions, carry supplies, and act as spies, \n     messengers, lookouts, and sex slaves--endangering their \n     health and lives. Quite simply, they are robbed of their \n     childhoods.\n       Furthermore, the lasting effects of war and abuse remain \n     with them for years--too often for a lifetime. Former child \n     soldiers are stigmatized and traumatized by their experience \n     and left with neither family connections nor skills to allow \n     them to transition successfully into productive adult lives. \n     We should be doing everything we can to not only end military \n     support for governments that engage in this troubling \n     practice, but to also\n\n[[Page S4977]]\n\n     help such children reintegrate into their families and \n     society.\n       I recognize that the Somali Transitional Federal Government \n     is trying to bring some measure of stability to that war torn \n     country. However, it should not do so on the backs of its \n     precious children, and certainly not with the help of the \n     American taxpayer.\n       Thank you for looking into this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Richard J.

Mr. President, I will be brief because I see my friend \nfrom Iowa is on the floor here. I want to give him a chance to speak.\n  The Federal Government pays interchange fees when people use credit \nand debit cards to pay for things such as admission to national parks, \ngroceries, at military commissaries, tickets on Amtrak, and copays for \nVA medical services. In fiscal year 2007, our Federal Government paid \n$433 million in credit card fees. The vast majority were interchange \nfees.\n  Last year, the Appropriations Subcommittee on Financial Services and \nGeneral Government, which I chair, asked the Treasury Department to \nlook into how much money taxpayers are paying to credit card companies \nfor the use of credit cards. We got the report this week. It concludes \nthat Treasury could save at least $36 to $39 million a year if it did \nseveral things, such as negotiating the actual interchange rates \ncharged to the Federal Government.\n  We had a hearing today, and an employee of the Department of the \nTreasury came and testified and said the Federal Government of the \nUnited States was unable to negotiate an interchange fee with either \nVisa or MasterCard. The card companies refuse to negotiate. There is $8 \nbillion in economic activity with the Treasury through the credit and \ndebit cards of these two companies. But they refuse to negotiate with \nthe Federal Government.\n  We also learned that one major company, MasterCard, charges an \ninterchange fee of 1.55 percent on every government transaction, plus \n10 cents, while the going rate on an interchange fee for supermarkets \nacross America is 1.27. It turns out that our Federal Government is \npaying more to the credit card companies than supermarkets are paying \nin Illinois, Iowa, or Alaska.\n  You ask yourself: Well, why is that? Is there a high default rate \nfrom the Federal Government? The answer is no. The Federal Government \npays. And yet we are being charged a higher rate. But let me say for a \nmoment, it is not ``we'' who are being charged a higher rate, it is the \ntaxpayers. The taxpayers of this country are subsidizing credit card \ncompanies by paying higher fees than commercial businesses for the use \nof credit cards.\n  It is inexcusable, it is indefensible. You know the debate we had--I \nknow, Mr. President, you recall it personally, a few weeks ago--about \nwhether these credit card companies are going to be held to charging \nreasonable and proportional amounts for the use of debit cards.\n  What we are finding at Amtrak, at the VA, and at commissaries across \nAmerica, is our Federal taxpayers are underwriting these credit card \ncompanies.\n  I tried, when I brought this amendment to the floor of the Senate \nrelative to interchange fees, to do everything in my power to preserve \nthe ability of small banks and credit unions to compete with big banks \nin issuing debit cards. My amendment does nothing to disadvantage those \nsmall financial institutions. We specifically exempted any financial \ninstitution with a value of less than $10 billion. As a result, only 3 \ncredit unions out of 1,000 in America were covered by my amendment, and \nabout 80 or 90 banks out of the 8- or 9,000 in this country.\n  I heard from one of my colleagues on the Senate floor today from the \nMidwest, who said: The credit unions were in last week. They are \nfrightened by your amendment.\n  I said: Are they over $10 billion in value?\n  No, not even close.\n  Well, the amendment doesn't apply to them.\n  They are afraid the big credit card companies, Visa and MasterCard, \nwill reduce their interchange fees on small banks and credit unions if \nthe Durbin amendment passes in the Wall Street reform bill.\n  It is an indication to all of us of the power of these credit card \ncompanies to terrorize credit unions and community banks. They have \nbecome the messengers of the big banks and credit cards to kill the \namendment we passed in the Senate.\n  By exempting 99 percent of banks from debit and interchange \nregulation, my amendment would actually enable these banks to receive \nmore interchange revenue than their big bank competitors. Yet the so-\ncalled Independent Community Bankers of America and the Credit Union \nNational Association oppose the amendment. Why? An article out of \nReuters came out yesterday that makes it plain.\n  The article is titled ``Small Banks Fight Card Fee Limits Despite \nExemption.'' The article says:\n\n       Small banks believe they have no choice but to support Visa \n     and Mastercard in a battle against lawmakers over fees for \n     processing debit card transactions.\n\n  Why do the small banks believe this? The article continues:\n\n       The Durbin amendment explicitly exempts banks with less \n     than $10 billion of assets, so smaller banks in theory should \n     not oppose the law. But the exemption is cold comfort to \n     small banks, which say that whatever the law stipulates, Visa \n     and Mastercard will force them to accept the same fees as \n     larger banks.\n\n  I want to make it clear what I have said before, last week in a \nmeeting of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the Antitrust Division of \nthe Department of Justice testified that they are investigating Visa \nand MasterCard now. Nothing more was said, but they confirmed press \naccounts that that is being done.\n  I think it is long overdue. This duopoly, this power in the market, \nthis ability to terrorize credit unions and small banks is an \nindication of too much power and too little competition. If we truly \nbelieve in a free market and an entrepreneurial society, we have to \nsupport competition. In this case, merchants, businessmen, small banks, \nand small credit unions are being terrorized by these powerful \ninterests.\n  The article quotes Jason Kratovil, vice president of congressional \nrelations for the Independent Community Bankers of America, saying that \n``Visa and MasterCard have `probably not directly' told small banks \nthat they will receive lower fees,'' but that it is ``pretty clear, at \nleast for our guys, that it's going to end up with one rate for all \nissuers.''\n  So Visa and MasterCard are arguing: If we have to lower the \ninterchange fees for the biggest banks in America, then we will lower \nthem for the smallest banks in America--even though they are exempt \nunder the Durbin amendment. Visa has 122 different interchange fees and \nMasterCard well over 100. To argue they can't come up with two \ndifferent interchange fees, that it is impossible, is ridiculous.\n  It is the kind of thing where these credit unions and small banks \nhave been terrorized by Visa and MasterCard. The Independent Community \nBankers say Visa and MasterCard have ``probably not directly'' \nthreatened to voluntarily lower small bank interchange rates, but the \nmessage received was ``pretty clear.'' It is obvious what is going on: \nVisa and MasterCard are making threats if this amendment becomes law, \nthey will use their market power against small banks by voluntarily \nlowering their interchange rates.\n  It is a great tactic that scares the small banks and credit unions \ninto lobbying against the amendment which passed in the Senate. I am \nsure the big banks couldn't have more fun than to watch the smaller \nbanks, exempt under our amendment, do their bidding. The big banks hate \nthe thought of my amendment passing, giving small banks an advantage in \nthe debit card market. The small banks are just being played like \nmarionettes when it comes to their role in this lobbying efforts.\n  I sent the CEOs of Visa and MasterCard a letter and told them this: \nMy amendment protects small banks, but you are threatening to take \nsteps on your own to disadvantage them. If you collude with each other \nor with the big banks to disadvantage small banks, you could run afoul \nof the antitrust laws.\n  Visa and MasterCard wrote back yesterday and said: No, Senator, we\n\n[[Page S4978]]\n\nwouldn't want to do anything to hurt small banks, but the market may \njust force us if your amendment becomes law.\n  This is ridiculous. With Visa and MasterCard having 100 percent of \nthe market for signature debit cards, they are the market. The market \nis going to force them? Guess what. They are the market. They set the \nrules. They fix all the fees now. Small banks and credit unions are so \nafraid of Visa and MasterCard--they are quivering--and their big bank \nallies, they do not believe they can support any regulation of the \ninterchange system no matter how reasonable. Small banks are afraid to \ntake the risk that these giant corporations might decide to wield their \nenormous market power against them.\n  Ironically, that is the world in which small businesses, merchants, \nand other acceptors of payment cards live today. Small businesses have \nno choice today but to accept Visa and MasterCard and the fees and \nrules they establish.\n  Today at my hearing, Wendy Chronister of Springfield, IL, my \nhometown, who is CEO of the Qik-n-EZ convenience stores, about 11 of \nthem in central Illinois, came and testified. I know her family well. \nThey live a few doors away from me. I know her dad who started the \ncompany 40 years ago. She is a spectacular young woman who is the CEO \nof this small company that has these convenience stores.\n  The No. 1 cost in her business is labor, the No. 3 cost is utility \nbills, and the No. 2 cost is interchange fees to Visa and MasterCard. \nThey represent about half of the charges they pay for labor and \nrepresent about twice as much as they pay for utility bills. That is \nhow big a factor this is in a small business. She has no power to \nnegotiate, no power to compete. She is at a loss.\n  She was sitting at the table with a representative of the Federal \nGovernment who said we are in the same boat. We do $8 billion a year \naccepting cards from Visa and MasterCard and cannot get them to \nnegotiate with us a lower interchange fee for the sake of taxpayers and \nreducing the deficit. That is the kind of power they have.\n  I am going to wrap up because I see Senator Grassley is anxious.\n  When I heard this argument today that the Federal Government was \nunable to get Visa and MasterCard to negotiate an interchange fee, they \nare so powerful, these private companies, I had a flashback--a \nflashback to one of my favorite movies of all time. It was released in \nabout 1963 or 1964. It is entitled ``Dr. Strangelove.'' In this movie, \nPeter Sellers played three different roles, and one of the roles was as \na British military officer named Lionel Mandrake. He was at a base \nwhere they thought another world war was about to break out, a nuclear \nconflict. He was trying to find a telephone to call someone in \nWashington to bring an end to this nuclear war. At that point actor \nKeenan Wynn came in playing the role of COL Bat Guano. Sellers said to \nColonel Guano: I need change to make a phone call to Washington to stop \nthis world war.\n  Colonel Guano said: I don't have any change.\n  Peter Sellers said: You shoot up with your gun the Coca-Cola machine, \nand I will take the money out and make the phone call.\n  He said: You want me to shoot up the Coca-Cola machine. I will do it, \nbut you are going to have to answer to Coca-Cola for this.\n  That is what I was reminded of today when I heard that our Federal \nGovernment, with $8 billion in business with Visa and MasterCard, can't \nget them to sit down at the table. That shows the power of these \nprivate companies.\n  What is going on here? This isn't competition. They are not some \nsainted entity. They represent a business, and they are supposed to be \na competitive business with the other credit card companies. But they \nare not. They are dictating fees to small businesses that are hurting, \nreducing their profitability and their employment at a time when we \ndesperately need jobs.\n  Small banks should come to understand the predicament that their \ncolleagues in the small business community face, as both live in a \nworld that is too often run by card networks and big banks. It is time \nfor the interchange system to change. We need to end this system where \nVisa and MasterCard have the market power to set fees and establish \nrules however they want.\n  I extend my apologies to Senator Grassley. If I had known he had to \nleave, I would have wrapped up a lot earlier and saved my comments \nabout ``Dr. Strangelove'' for a later time. I thank him very much. He \nhas been a good friend and patient.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/16/senate-section/article/S4978-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4978-S4979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      AGGRESSIVE OILSPILL RESPONSE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, America is facing a catastrophe in the \ngulf. I rise today to speak about the President's address to our Nation \nlast night and my recent trip to the gulf.\n  I agree with the President that BP must stop the leak, clean up the \noil, and end the economic hurricane they have caused on the gulf coast. \nI agree that BP--not the taxpayers--must be liable for costs of \ncleaning up the mess, for compensating businesses, fisherman and \nfamilies, and for their economic losses. BP must set aside a fund of \n$20 billion or more today that they don't control to pay all economic \nclaims in a fair and timely way.\n  I like that the President focused on the Nation's long range energy \nneeds. We do need to move our energy policy forward. And I am so \npleased the President picked Dr. Don Boesch for the new National \nCommission to prevent and respond to future spills like this one. Dr. \nBoesch has strong ties to Maryland. He has been president of UMD Center \nfor Environmental Science since 1990 and serves as Governor O'Malley's \nscience adviser. He's also a man of Louisiana, born in New Orleans and \na graduate of Tulane. He knows the issues of Louisiana and he's got a \nspecial place in his heart in looking out for Maryland.\n  I also agree with Billy Nungesser, president of Plaquemines Parish, \nLA. He believes we should bring every asset we have to fight this \nthing. The people of Louisiana need to see more action on the ground \nand we can't just rely on BP's word to get the job done.\n  We need to organize and mobilize our own government. Right now we are \nacting like a bureaucracy rather than a fighting force to protect the \nbeaches and the people from the consequences of the oilspill. I hope in \nthe coming days, the President will insist on defining what success is.\n  This administration needs goals and metrics for shore clean up that \nwill be adequate. They must establish a mechanism for monitoring, \noversight and relentless follow-through. Right now, no one but BP knows \nwhat is going on. There has been a lot of reporting on inputs--but not \nenough on outcomes. We need structure for oversight and we need to know \nthe outcomes of our actions.\n  The President also needs to insist on expediting permits. When I was \non the gulf coast last week, I heard from locals that their ideas on \nhow to protect coasts are stuck in bureaucracy. We need to unstick the \nbureaucracy. This is a national emergency that needs an aggressive \nnational response. We are all in this together.\n  I went to the gulf coast as chair of the Commerce, Justice, Science \nAppropriations Subcommittee, which funds the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, NOAA. NOAA is in the gulf right now telling \nus where this oil is going, helping to cleanup the shores and marshes \nand assisting fishermen who are hurting.\n  I also went as the Senator from Maryland. I wanted to talk to \nscientists first hand to find out how the spill could impact Maryland. \nWill it affect our beaches and treasured Chesapeake Bay?\n  Last week, I saw the catastrophe in the gulf. We met the people, we \nsaw the beaches, and we saw the impact on the wildlife. And everywhere \nwe went, we saw oil and the consequences of oil. I spoke to people \nwhose livelihoods depend on the gulf. When we talk about what we saw--\nwords like ``Louisiana,'' ``Grand Isle'' and ``Pelican Island''--I also \nthink of words like ``Ocean City'' and ``Assateague,'' Maryland's own \nbarrier island. What we saw was the good, the bad, and the ugly.\n  First, we met with the people, and I saw just how resilient they are. \nThey have real grit and are determined to do something to save their \ncommunities. We coastal people need to be on their side. We saw \ncommunities where they would ordinarily have thousands of visitors with \nbusy fishing charters.\n\n[[Page S4979]]\n\nNow, it's like a ghost land. The beach looked more like a military base \nthan an ocean resort, with trucks going up and down, carrying booms and \nall kinds of response equipment. And when you go out to sea, on a boat \nor in a helicopter, you see this oil creeping closer and closer to the \nshoreline. We are concerned about the environmental impact, but we are \nalso concerned about the human impact on lives, livelihoods, and \nsafety.\n  Next, we asked--is the oil going to come up the east coast in this \nso-called ``loop current or loop stream?'' We were told the beaches of \nOcean City will be safe. Even in the worst case scenario, the oil won't \nget beyond the Carolinas. Second, we were told that the seafood is \nsafe. It is being inspected locally by NOAA and the FDA, so what is \ncoming to the American marketplace is safe. That's what we were told, \nbut I believe what Ronald Reagan said: ``Trust, but verify.''\n  Maryland's economy is tied to the Louisiana economy. Our seafood \nrestaurants and markets rely on what's caught in the gulf. I am holding \na Maryland delegation meeting to make sure that we bring in ocean \nscientists and seafood inspectors to verify that our Atlantic coast \nbeaches and our Chesapeake Bay will stay oil free and our seafood will \nbe safe to eat.\n  That was the good news. The bad news is BP. The BP people have to fix \nthis. BP is cutting corners, minimizing the situation, and now here we \nare. The oil will continue to gush, and it will gush until August. But \nthe oil coming out of the well will take 6 weeks to get to shore, so we \nare going to feel all of this well into September. And that is the best \ncase scenario.\n  I support our President in calling for an escrow account for BP to \nput $20 billion aside for economic damages. I fear the hoarders will \ntake charge. I fear BP will file for bankruptcy and will want the \ntaxpayers to bail them out. The American taxpayer will not bail out the \noil companies. The oil companies must put aside the money to pay \ndamages and cleanup costs.\n  Our own bureaucracy needs reform. We saw the can-do spirit there \namong the people, but the permit process is slow--whether it is the \nEPA, Corps of Engineers or NOAA. This needs to be reformed. And this \nstuff, called dispersant sounds like if you pour chemicals on the oil \nthe oil will disburse and everything's fine. I am concerned that \ndispersants could be causing more problems than they are solving. I am \nconcerned about the toxic impact on human beings and marine life \ncreating dead zones off the coast of Louisiana.\n  That is why I plan to hold a hearing. To learn more about the effects \nof these dispersants--what do we already know, what do we need to know, \nand what research needs to be done--because I don't want dispersants to \nturn out to be the DDT or Agent Orange of the oilspill. It is our job \nin Congress to push the bureaucracy, to push BP to get the job done and \nprotect the American people.\n  Then, we saw the ugly. The so-called protective booms were \ndysfunctional and in disarray, saturated with sticky smelly oil that \nhad been there for days and no one had come to pick them up or clean \nthem up. They were breaking loose and some washed up in marshes, \ncausing far more damage than the oil. If they couldn't protect the few \nmiles around the pelicans areas, how can they protect the beaches? They \nhave got to do a lot better job. It took four Senators going to \nLouisiana to get the booms cleaned up near Grand Isle.\n  There are no performance standards to make sure BP or the government \nare doing what they say they are doing and that it is working. There \nmust be relentless follow-through by the government. The Coast Guard is \ntreating BP as if it were another government agency, when the Coast \nGuard needs to take BP to task. They need to make sure that they have \nperformance standards and they need to make sure that there is follow-\nthrough.\n  After witnessing the catastrophe in the gulf and seeing the way the \noil is impacting the people, the communities, and the environment, I am \nso glad that we in Maryland opposed offshore drilling. No matter what \nis the energy policy I will always oppose offshore drilling off of the \nMid-Atlantic coast. We can never let what's happening in the gulf \nhappen to any other communities.\n  Our first responsibility will be to the Nation's taxpayers, not to \nthe oil companies. Our second responsibility is to the people of the \ngulf, to do all we can to protect them. We need to make sure that we \ncontain the oil and can clean it up so they can get on with their lives \nand their livelihoods.\n  I was honored to be able to go and represent Marylanders there \nbecause we are coastal people too. When I talked to the people down \nthere who fish and crab, we talked about how we use the same kind of \nbait, we use the same kind of line, the same kind of ways. We cook them \na little bit different--but we eat them all the same. And when they \nheld our hands, they said when you go back to Maryland and Washington, \ndon't ever forget us. And we won't. We are all Americans, we are all \ncoastal people, and we are all in this together.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/16/senate-section/article/S4979-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4979-S4985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 58TH ANNUAL NATIONAL PRAYER BREAKFAST\n\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I had the privilege of co-chairing the \n58th Annual National Prayer Breakfast with Senator Klobuchar. I ask \nunanimous consent that a copy of the transcript of the 2010 National \nPrayer Breakfast proceedings be printed in the Congressional Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     58th National Prayer Breakfast\n\n       Senator Amy Klobuchar: Good morning, everyone. I am Amy \n     Klobuchar, the Senator from Minnesota. Welcome to the 58th \n     annual National Prayer Breakfast. For anyone from warmer \n     climates, we know it is a little snowy, but in Minnesota we \n     would call this, ``fair to partly cloudy.'' What a gathering. \n     This is a very different scene from the first National Prayer \n     Breakfast all the way back in 1952--that was attended only by \n     a couple hundred people and they were all men. And now what \n     we have today is over 3,000 people from all 50 states and \n     over 140 countries. Although the National Prayer Breakfast \n     may look a lot different than it did in 1952, one of the \n     great traditions of this event is that it is bipartisan, as \n     you can see from our head table up here, as well as the fact \n     that we have a Democratic and a Republican co-chair. In that \n     tradition, I am very proud to introduce to you my Republican \n     co-chair and good friend, the Senator from Georgia, Johnny \n     Isakson.\n       Senator Johnny Isakson: Thank you. We do welcome you \n     because what began as a very small group in 1952 has become a \n     group that has influence around the world in countries all \n     over this world. We are so delighted that you traveled near \n     and you travelled far to be a part of the National Prayer \n     Breakfast here in the United States of America. Amy and I are \n     both members of the Senate but one important thing to know is \n     that we alternate years--this happened to be the Senate's \n     year to chair the National Prayer Breakfast. But next year, \n     the House will as well. We do so in partnership, we do so in \n     brotherhood, and we do so in love, and we do so in faith. I \n     now want to begin by introducing my side of the head table, \n     and then Amy will introduce her side of the head table. \n     First, the Vice President of the United States of America, \n     Joe Biden; the Secretary of State of the United States of \n     America, Hillary Rodham Clinton; the distinguished Senator \n     from the state of Utah, Orrin Hatch; the luckiest thing that \n     ever happened to me 41 years ago, my wife, Dianne; the \n     distinguished senior Senator from the state of Oregon, Ron \n     Wyden; the co-chair of the House prayer breakfast, from \n     Missouri, Representative Todd Akin; a lady who has the voice \n     of an angel and later you will hear her sing, God Bless \n     America, Sergeant First Class MaryKay Messenger, the lead \n     vocalist of the United States Military Academy Band; and my, \n     friend and the artist who will sing the closing hymn, Ralph \n     Freeman.\n       Senator Klobuchar: Johnny put the music together this \n     morning and you are going to love it. President Obama and the \n     First Lady will be joining us shortly; His Excellency Jose \n     Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, the Prime Minister of Spain is with \n     us; my husband, John Bessler who made our daughter's lunch at \n     5:30 this morning while I was getting ready for this; Admiral \n     Mike Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; 2007 \n     Heisman Trophy winner, Tim Tebow; the co-chair of the House \n     prayer breakfast, Representative Charlie Wilson of Ohio; and \n     the Heisman Trophy winner of Senate chaplains, Rear Admiral \n     Barry Black.\n       Johnny and I wanted you all to hear this morning from our \n     friend, Senate Chaplain, Barry Black, who like all Senate \n     chaplains since 1789 opens each session of the Senate with a \n     prayer. To me and Johnny, Barry is a friend and a spiritual \n     adviser but he is also an embodiment of the power of faith \n     and discipline and hard work. From his impoverished childhood \n     in Baltimore to his distinguished 27-year career in the U.S. \n     Navy, to his service in the Senate, Chaplain Black's ``only \n     in America'' story, a story he has detailed so eloquently in \n     his book, From the\n\n[[Page S4980]]\n\n     Hood to the Hill, shows us that God has great plans for our \n     lives. It is my pleasure to introduce to you our friend, \n     Chaplain Barry Black, who will lead us in the opening prayer.\n       Rear Admiral Barry Black: Let us lift our hearts in prayer. \n     Lord of life, the giver of every good and perfect gift. You \n     have been our help in ages past and our hope for years to \n     come. Lord, forgive us when we forget that more things are \n     wrought by prayer than this world dreams of. We thank you for \n     this nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the \n     proposition that people possess basic rights that they \n     receive from you. Make us good global neighbors as we \n     remember that righteousness exalts a nation but sin is a \n     reproach to any people. Hear our petitions and use our \n     supplications to change and shape our times according to your \n     plan. May our prayers empower us to trust you more fully, \n     live for you more completely and serve you more willingly. In \n     a special way, smile upon our international guests who have \n     travelled great distances to be with us, give them traveling \n     mercies as they return home. And Lord, shower your favor upon \n     the program participants, especially our primary presenter. \n     May the words of their mouths and the meditations of their \n     hearts bring honor to you. Bless this morning, our food and \n     fellowship. We pray this in the matchless name of Jesus. \n     Amen.\n       Senator Isakson: Would you please welcome to your right, \n     Mr. Robert Fraumann, the most gifted musician the United \n     Methodist Church has ever known and enjoy his mix of \n     Beethoven's ``Fifth Symphony'' and ``How Great Thou Art'' and \n     ``The Warsaw Concerto'' and ``To God Be the Glory.'' Robert \n     Fraumann.\n       Mr. Robert Fraumann: (piano music)\n       Narrator: Ladies and Gentlemen, the President of the United \n     States Barack Obama and the First Lady Michelle Obama.\n       Senator Klobuchar: Welcome, Mr. President, Mrs. Obama. We \n     are so pleased to have you here. I also know there are many \n     members from the House of Representatives. I see Speaker \n     Pelosi. And from the United States Senate and the President's \n     Cabinet--if they could all stand so we could acknowledge you. \n     Thank you. Mr. President, you should know that Johnny, being \n     from Georgia, is really adjusting to the fact that this \n     breakfast had quiche instead of grits. So I really don't know \n     how he is going to explain that when he gets home. And \n     actually, Johnny has been a great pal for me this year as a \n     co-chair of the Senate prayer breakfast and I can tell you \n     that to show his support for his co-chair, he actually \n     supported the Vikings over the Saints in the playoff game. \n     That was a tough game. My fourth quarter prayers made no \n     difference but not even God can overrule a ref's calls.\n       Senator Isakson: You know I ain't real sure it was the \n     refs. It might have been Brett Farve's interception.\n       Senator Klobuchar: Very good.\n       Senator Isakson: We are honored to be here today and I am \n     honored to share with Amy, the co-chairmanship of the Senate \n     prayer breakfast. She thinks getting me to pull for the \n     Vikings was the ultimate reconciliation, not true. Ultimate \n     reconciliation is when Senator Bill Nelson convinced me to \n     invite the quarterback of the Florida Gators, who beat us \n     four successive years at the University of Georgia. Tim, \n     welcome, we are glad to have you. This is a great occasion \n     and we are so delighted and honored that all of you are here \n     today. And I am going to turn it back over to our leader, Amy \n     Klobuchar.\n       Senator Klobuchar: Thank you. Each week Johnny and I and \n     our fellow senators get together for a weekly Senate prayer \n     breakfast. I always come away from it a better person. At our \n     breakfasts, a senator always speaks, sometimes about his or \n     her faith, sometimes about a personal struggle, sometimes \n     about the challenges of forgiveness after a tough political \n     fight. Our prayer breakfasts are always real and refreshingly \n     honest. And just when I am ready to give up on working with \n     maybe a few of my colleagues, it reminds me that we all share \n     a common purpose and a common humanity, and that with faith \n     and forgiveness, we can start anew. Now it is my honor today \n     to introduce Sergeant First Class MaryKay Messenger, the lead \n     vocalist with the United States Military Academy Band. \n     MaryKay first sang with the band in 1980 at the age of \n     twelve. She continued throughout the years as a guest \n     vocalist until she joined the Army in 1996. She has performed \n     throughout the world--everywhere from Beijing to the opening \n     bell of the New York Stock Exchange, from Yankee Stadium to \n     Carnegie Hall. This morning she will be singing ``God Bless \n     America,'' a song composed by Irving Berlin during the First \n     World War while he was serving in a United States Army camp. \n     MaryKay Messenger.\n       Sgt. MaryKay Messenger: [Singing]\n\n     While the storm clouds gather far across the sea,\n     Let us swear allegiance to a land that's free,\n     Let us all be grateful for a land so fair,\n     As we raise our voices in a solemn prayer.\n     God Bless America,\n     Land that I love.\n     Stand beside her, and guide her\n     Through the night with a light from above.\n     From the mountains, to the prairies,\n     To the oceans, white with foam\n     God bless America, My home sweet home.\n     God bless America, My home sweet home.\n\n       Senator Ron Wyden: Good morning, Mr. President, Mrs. Obama, \n     honored guests. It is my privilege to offer a reading from \n     the second book of the Torah, the Book of Exodus. Exodus \n     deals with the formation of the Jewish people into a nation \n     as they make their way from slavery to the Promised Land. \n     There are very important lessons in the passage where Moses' \n     father in law, Jethro, a Midianite priest, guides Moses on \n     the correct way to govern his people.\n       ``Jethro, the priest of Midian, Moses' father-in-law, heard \n     all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, \n     how the Lord had brought Israel out from Egypt.'' Then, later \n     in the passage, ``the next day Moses sat as magistrate among \n     the people while the people stood about Moses from morning \n     until evening. But when Moses' father-in-law saw how much he \n     had to do for the people, he said `What is this thing you are \n     doing to the people? Why do you act alone while all the \n     people stand about you from morning until evening?' Moses \n     replied to his father-in-law, `it is because the people come \n     to me to inquire of God; when they have a dispute, it comes \n     before me and I decide between one person and another and I \n     make known the law and the teachings of God.' But Moses' \n     father-in-law said to him, `the thing you are doing is not \n     right. You will surely wear yourself out and these people as \n     well. For the task is too heavy for you. You cannot do it \n     alone. Now listen to me, I will give you council and God be \n     with you. You represent the people before God. You bring the \n     disputed before God and enjoin upon them before the laws and \n     the teachings and make it known to them, the way they are to \n     go and the practices they are to follow. You shall also seek \n     out from among all of the people capable men who fear God, \n     trustworthy men who spurn ill-gotten gain, set these over \n     them as chiefs of thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens and \n     let them judge the people at all times. Have them bring every \n     major dispute to you but let them decide every minor dispute \n     for themselves. Make it easier for yourself by letting them \n     share the burden with you. If you do this and God commands \n     you, you will be able to bear up and all these people too \n     will go home unwary.' Now Moses heeded his father-in-law and \n     did just as he had said. Moses chose capable men out of all \n     of Israel and appointed them heads over all the people, \n     chiefs of thousands, hundreds, fifties and tens and they \n     judged the people at all times. The difficult matters they \n     would bring to Moses and all the minor matters they would \n     decide themselves. Then Moses bade his father-in-law farewell \n     and he went his way to his own land.''\n       May we all show similar wisdom and be open, open to advice \n     and guidance from any source. Not just within our own group, \n     our own faction, our own tribe, and it is only with that \n     wisdom can we hope to provide just and true leadership.\n       Congressman Charlie Wilson: Good morning Mr. President, \n     Madam Secretary, honored guests. I am Congressman Charlie \n     Wilson from Ohio's sixth district and my co-chair is \n     Congressman Todd Akin of Missouri's second district. We would \n     like to thank the Senate for putting this program together \n     this morning. We know the House is looking forward to putting \n     it together again next year. Todd and I are here together \n     this morning because we are the co-chairs of the House prayer \n     breakfast. Members of Congress from both parties have been \n     meeting for prayer on a weekly basis for more than five \n     decades in the House. We come together in the Capitol dining \n     room every Thursday morning at eight a.m., with no staff, we \n     read a verse of scripture, we pray for the sick and wounded \n     and we offer up a prayer of thanksgiving for our country. We \n     also have a different guest speaker each week who shares \n     their testimony. One week it's a Democrat, the next week it's \n     a Republican. Finally, we close in prayer and we make sure to \n     share that too--one week a Democrat leads the closing prayer, \n     the next a Republican. We never know how many are going to be \n     at our prayer breakfast to attend our weekly gathering. I am \n     happy though to let you know that it has increased \n     considerably this year. Our meeting lasts about an hour and \n     many of us refer to it as the best hour of the week. We hope \n     that you will consider our example and set aside time each \n     week with your colleagues to deepen your relationships and \n     open your mind to God. And now, my co-chair, Todd Akin.\n       Congressman Todd Akin: Good morning, I am Todd Akin from \n     Missouri. The tradition of the Prayer Breakfast goes back to \n     the days of President Eisenhower. Because of the tremendous \n     importance that we place on a personal relationship with God, \n     a personal relationship with Jesus Christ, it is a Christian \n     prayer breakfast. And yet we welcome happily people of all \n     different faiths to join us. Along these lines when we arrive \n     on a Thursday morning and hear a personal testimony, we hear \n     a tremendous diversity in the kinds of stories. For example, \n     we heard this story of a little boy who grows up penniless \n     and orphaned on the streets wondering where the next meal \n     will come from, and how he is led on a journey to the U.S. \n     Congress. We hear another story of a pilot of a small \n     airplane in the fog over the mountains of Germany with little \n     instrumentation and how in answer to prayer, a hole is opened \n     up in the fog showing a landing strip way below--how he dives \n     his airplane through the hole in the fog, lands on the \n     landing strip and the fog closes in around the aircraft. It \n     is from these and other testimonies that Congressmen develop \n     a mutual respect and affection for each other. The statesman \n     William Wilberforce from England had two great aims in his \n     life.\n\n[[Page S4981]]\n\n     The first was to get rid of slavery. The second one was to \n     build civility--that is, a respectful and loving treatment of \n     the different legislators in England. This prayer breakfast \n     that we enjoy every week inspires that civility in an \n     otherwise polarizing political environment, that is why it is \n     the best hour of the week. God bless you.\n       Senator Orrin Hatch: [alarm going off on cell phone] Woops, \n     oh dear.\n       Senator Klobuchar: It's time for your prayer. Is that the \n     alarm for your prayer?\n       Senator Hatch: I never learned how to turn that alarm off. \n     I apologize. Let us pray. Our dear Father in Heaven, as we \n     bow our heads this morning before Thee, we are so grateful \n     for this great nation and for the nations of the world, but \n     especially for the opportunities we have as a nation to bring \n     peace and contentment and tranquility throughout this world. \n     We are grateful for our great leaders and we pray that Thou \n     wilt bless them. We pray that Thou wilt bless our President \n     and our Vice President and their cabinet and all of the \n     leaders throughout the federal government that they might be \n     inspired to lead us to do the things that are righteous in \n     Thy sight that we might be able to be good followers and that \n     we might be able to combine together to do what is right. As \n     Moses' father in law told him, let's share the responsibility \n     and let's work together in the best interest of our country. \n     Let's have bipartisanship reborn again in this great nation. \n     We are so grateful for those who serve in the military who \n     are represented here today and throughout this country. We \n     are grateful for the sacrifices that they undertake on our \n     behalf. We are grateful for those who are in harm's way and \n     pray that Thou wilt pour special blessings upon them, that \n     they might be blessed and protected. And we pray that we \n     might be a nation that will help to bring peace and \n     tranquility throughout the world. We are grateful for all of \n     the food, clothing and shelter that Thou has provided for us. \n     We are grateful for those who serve in governments throughout \n     the states, for the respective state legislatures. And last \n     but not least, we are grateful for the Congress of the United \n     States and we will pray that the Congress might be able to \n     work together as Democrats and Republicans and Independents \n     to serve Thee, to serve our country, to serve our fellow men \n     and women, and to bring peace and contentment to this great \n     nation and throughout the world. We pray at this time for \n     those who are suffering in Haiti and elsewhere throughout the \n     world. We ask you to bless them and help them and help us to \n     do our share in helping throughout this world. We are \n     grateful for the leaders from other countries who are here \n     and we pray Thy blessings upon them. Once again, we ask that \n     you bless our President, Vice President and the leaders of \n     this country. In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.\n       Senator Klobuchar: Thank you very much Senator Hatch. Now \n     to read our next scripture today we are honored to be joined \n     by Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero, who is currently serving his \n     second four year term as the Prime Minister of Spain. Prime \n     Minister Zapatero however, is not just the leader of one very \n     important country, he is also the current Chairman of the \n     European Union. And if that isn't enough, he made a claim to \n     fame as Prime Minister with a cabinet where a majority of his \n     cabinet members are women. I decided to add that. The Prime \n     Minister has also made invaluable contributions to interfaith \n     dialogue and reconciliation in his country, both as an \n     individual and as an elected leader. His personal quest has \n     been to promote peaceful coexistence and tolerance among the \n     religious faiths in his own country and throughout the world. \n     Please join me in welcoming the Prime Minister of Spain, the \n     Chairman of the European Union, His Excellency Jose Luis \n     Rodriguez Zapatero.\n       The Prime Minister of Spain: [Speaking in Spanish]\n       Translator: Mr. President, Members of Congress, ladies and \n     gentlemen, thank you. Thank you for inviting me to \n     participate--on behalf of my country, on behalf of Spain--in \n     one of the American people's most symbolic traditions. And \n     thank you to Senators Klobuchar and Isakson. And please do \n     allow me now to speak to you in Spanish, the language in \n     which people first prayed to the God of the Gospels in this \n     land.\n       No one knows the value of religious freedom better than all \n     of you. Your forbearers fled oppression and so as to never be \n     deprived of their freedom, they founded this country. A \n     nation, the United States of America, born out of democracy; \n     a nation that has never stopped thriving thanks to the \n     strength of that democracy, which abolished slavery, \n     recognized equal voting rights and outlawed discrimination; a \n     nation that has expanded pluralism, tolerance and respect for \n     all choices and beliefs. Admirable feats, admirable in the \n     eyes of a firm believer in democracy, living in one of the \n     oldest nations in the world, Spain. Our nation is also \n     diverse, forged out of diversity and renewed in its \n     diversity. Our nation is as diverse as America. It is the \n     most multi-cultural of the lands of Europe, a Spain that \n     is Celtic, Iberian, Phoenician, Greek, Roman, Jewish, Arab \n     and Christian, especially Christian as defined by the \n     Latin American Author Carlos Fuentes. Our two countries \n     owe much to us that have come to us from abroad. Our \n     countries cannot be understood without them. Without those \n     who throughout history have come to our land and living in \n     our midst have become us, have become what we are.\n       Allow me to read you a Bible passage from Deuteronomy, \n     Chapter 24, ``You should not withhold the wages of poor and \n     needy laborers whether other Israelites or aliens who reside \n     in your land or in one of your towns. You shall pay them \n     their wages daily before sunset because they are poor and \n     their livelihood depends on them.''\n       Let us be concerned with integrating those who have come to \n     work and live in our countries in our midst. Let us also be \n     concerned with all of those whom we cannot welcome amongst us \n     and who are suffering from hunger and extreme poverty in so \n     many places around the world, such as those living in Haiti \n     and whose misfortune has moved us to offer up all our efforts \n     of solidarity; a solidarity which reconciles us with our \n     human condition, with our vulnerability and our fraternity \n     and which should never wane. Furthermore, I would like to \n     proclaim my deep commitment to those men and women who in our \n     societies in these difficult times are suffering the scarcity \n     of jobs. They should all know that as government leaders, \n     this task is our paramount concern. No other task is more \n     binding to us than that of fostering job creation. Today, it \n     is my plea that we also advocate the right of all persons \n     anywhere in the world to moral autonomy, to their quest for \n     that which is good. Today, it is my plea that we advocate the \n     freedom of all to live their own lives, to live with their \n     loved one and to build and nurture their family environment. \n     This is worthy of respect.\n       Freedom, civic truth, the truth common to us all, it is \n     what makes us true, genuine, authentic human beings, because \n     freedom enables each of us to look destiny in the eye and \n     seek our own truth. But tolerance is so much more than \n     accepting the other. It is discovering, knowing, \n     acknowledging the other. Ignorance of the other is at the \n     root of all conflicts that threaten human kind and endanger \n     our future. Ignorance breeds hate. Harmony is founded on \n     knowledge--so is peace. Even in the past, Spain was a model \n     of peaceful coexistence among the three religions of the \n     Book--Judaism, Christianity and Islam. And today in the \n     world, Spain defends religious tolerance and respect for \n     difference, dialogue, peaceful coexistence of cultures, the \n     alliance of civilizations. We do so with as much conviction \n     as we reject excluding statements of moral superiority, \n     absolutism, and uncompromising fundamentalism. The United \n     States knows, as does Spain, that the spurious use of \n     religious faith to justify violence can be hugely \n     destructive. And what better occasion than this prayer \n     breakfast to commemorate together, to honor together, our \n     victims of terrorism. Because it also together that we defend \n     freedom wherever it is threatened.\n       Mr. President, members of Congress, ladies and gentlemen, \n     be it with a lofty dimension or a civic one, freedom is \n     always the foundation of hope, of hope in the future, for \n     liberty as for honor says Don Quixote in the masterpiece \n     written in Spanish, ``One can rightfully risk one's life, yet \n     captivity is the worst evil that can befall men.'' Liberty is \n     one of the most precious gifts heaven has bestowed upon man \n     that this gift may continue blessing America and all people's \n     on earth. Thank you very much. [Applause]\n       Senator Isakson: Prime Minister Zapatero, thank you for \n     those meaningful and inspirational words. We are delighted to \n     have you in America today and we appreciate your friendship \n     very much. You know every day when I find those special few \n     moments to pause and meditate and pray for the things I am \n     thankful for, the very first prayer is for the men and women \n     who serve us in harm's way in our armed forces around the \n     world. For I know they not only serve the United States, but \n     they serve peace, freedom and democracy of all nations around \n     the world. And it is my pleasure now to introduce the leader \n     of the United States' military, the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff, Admiral Michael Mullen.\n       Admiral Michael Mullen: Thank you. Good morning Mr. \n     President, Mrs. Obama, Vice President Biden, Secretary \n     Clinton, other distinguished heads of state and distinguished \n     visitors, ladies and gentlemen. I am deeply honored to be \n     here and to have this opportunity. I have been asked this \n     morning to offer a prayer for world leaders. When my wife, \n     Deborah, informed me that one of the leaders I would be \n     praying for was probably me, something I hadn't really \n     considered, I actually started taking this very serious. I am \n     also mindful that there is more than one higher power in the \n     room today, no offense, Mr. Vice President. Now, before I ask \n     you all to join me in prayer I would like to tell a little \n     story. It is about an Army platoon leader in the Korean War. \n     He and his men fell into an ambush one day out on patrol and \n     found themselves surrounded by enemy soldiers. They hunkered \n     down in a small clearing, making the best of what little \n     cover they could find and tried desperately to hold on \n     against what seemed to be terrible odds. Every now and then, \n     the platoon sergeant noticed that his young lieutenant would \n     dash behind a big rock and sit for a minute or two and then \n     dash back out and start issuing new commands: ``move here, \n     move there, shift your fire high, shift it low.'' The barrage \n     of orders seemed to come almost as fast as the enemy bullets \n     themselves. After an hour or so, while suffering only a few \n     casualties, the platoon had chased off their attackers and \n     began to safely make their way back to base. On the walk \n     back, the sergeant approached the lieutenant and asked him: \n     ``Exactly what were you doing behind that rock, sir?'' The \n     officer grinned a little, sighed, his shoulders sank, he said \n     ``I needed\n\n[[Page S4982]]\n\n     time to think, to adjust so I kept asking myself three \n     questions: What am I doing? What am I not doing? And how can \n     I make up the difference?'' Now, I do not know if that story \n     is really true or not--I am told that it is. I really like \n     it, because it illustrates perfectly the deepest challenge of \n     leadership during difficult times--that of self reflection \n     and sober analysis. Even in the heat of battle, perhaps \n     especially in the heat of battle, we must find the time to \n     think, to adjust, and to improve our situation. After more \n     than four decades in uniform in peace and in war, it has been \n     my experience that people are guided best not by their \n     instincts but by their reason. That leaders are most \n     effective not when they rule passionately but when they \n     decide dispassionately. As St. Thomas Aquinas once said, ``A \n     man has free choice only to the extent that he is rational.'' \n     And so in these dangerous, difficult and immensely \n     challenging times, when our young troops fight two wars \n     overseas while their loved ones back home fight to keep their \n     families together, when everything from the economy to the \n     environment instills fear and uncertainty, let us exercise \n     our own free choice. Let us lead rationally and calmly. Let \n     us take the time to ask ourselves: What are we doing? What \n     are we not doing? And how can we make up the difference? We \n     may not always like the answers--I know I seldom do--but we \n     can always learn from having posed the questions.\n       And now, please bow your heads and join me in prayer. \n     Father in Heaven, we gather today to ask your blessing over \n     the lives and decisions of those who lead us around the \n     world. Theirs is a mighty task and a noble calling, for upon \n     their shoulders rest the hopes and dreams of billions of \n     people, not only of this generation but of future generations \n     who know us not. May you guide them in that pursuit, oh Lord, \n     give them the faith to seek your guidance, the wisdom to make \n     the right decisions and the character to see those \n     decisions through. Help them choose love over hate, \n     courage over fear, principle over expediency. Let them \n     always seek concord and peace and to remember that the \n     best leader is a good and humble servant. Encourage them, \n     Father, to seek your council as Solomon himself did in 1 \n     Kings, chapter 3, saying to you: ``but I am only a little \n     child and do not know how to carry out my duties. So give \n     me a discerning heart to govern your people and to \n     distinguish between right and wrong.'' May you bless us \n     all Lord, your children, and give our leaders that same \n     discerning heart. Help us always to distinguish between \n     right and wrong and to serve others before ourselves. This \n     we pray, in Thy name, Amen.\n       Senator Klobuchar: Thank you very much, Admiral Mullen. It \n     is now my great honor to introduce our keynote speaker, \n     Secretary of State, Hillary Rodham Clinton. She is an \n     incredibly accomplished woman whose life has been shaped by \n     the deep and abiding faith she was blessed to receive during \n     her childhood in suburban Chicago. Faith was always central \n     to Hillary Clinton's family. Her mother taught Sunday school \n     and made sure that her daughter and sons were there the \n     moment the church doors opened. In high school, she was \n     deeply influenced by her youth minister who taught her about \n     faith in action. On one memorable evening at age fourteen, \n     her church youth group went to hear a speech by Reverend \n     Martin Luther King, a transformative experience that inspires \n     her today. As a successful attorney and the First Lady of \n     Arkansas, her faith inspired her to be a forceful advocate \n     for disadvantaged children and families. As our nation's \n     First Lady, her faith led her to be a champion for health \n     care reform and for human rights, especially for women around \n     the world. As I have learned from people who were here at \n     this prayer breakfast long before me, Hillary Clinton and her \n     husband, President Bill Clinton, were always generous with \n     their time at this prayer breakfast. As a Senator from New \n     York, Senator Clinton's faith sustained as she became a \n     highly respected legislator who always did her homework. And \n     after a long and bruising presidential campaign in which she \n     shattered the glass ceiling for national women candidates \n     forever, she was asked by President Obama to serve as \n     Secretary of State. She could have so easily said ``no'' and \n     stayed as the powerhouse she was in the Senate, instead, she \n     once again answered the call to serve. She didn't flinch, she \n     didn't hesitate. And in the words of Isaiah, she said, ``Send \n     me.'' From the sands of the Mideast, to the capitals of \n     Europe, to the devastation in Haiti, she has shown America's \n     strength and commitment to the world. Please join me in \n     welcoming, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.\n       Secretary of State Hillary Clinton: Thank you. Thank you. \n     Thank you very much. I have to begin by saying that I am not \n     Bono. Those of you who were here when he was, I apologize \n     beforehand. But it is a great pleasure to be with you and to \n     be here with President and Mrs. Obama, to be with Vice \n     President Biden, with Chairman Mullen, with certainly our \n     hosts today, my former colleagues and friends, Senators \n     Johnny Isakson and Amy Klobuchar. And to be with so many \n     distinguished guests and visitors who have come from all over \n     our country and indeed from all over the world.\n       I have attended this prayer breakfast every year since \n     1993, and I have always found it to be a gathering that \n     inspires and motivates me. Now today, our minds are still \n     filled with the images of the tragedy of Haiti where faith is \n     being tested daily in food lines and makeshift hospitals, in \n     tent cities where there are not only so many suffering people \n     but so many vanished dreams.\n       When I think about the horrible catastrophe that has struck \n     Haiti, I am both saddened but also spurred. This is a moment \n     that has already been embraced by people of faith from \n     everywhere. I thank Prime Minister Zapatero for his country's \n     response and commitment. Because in the days since the \n     earthquake, we have seen the world and the world's faithful \n     spring into action on behalf of those suffering. President \n     Obama has put our country on the leading edge of making sure \n     that we do all we can to help alleviate not only the \n     immediate suffering, but to assist in the rebuilding and \n     recovery. So many countries have answered the call, and so \n     many churches, synagogues, mosques and temples have brought \n     their own people together. And even with modern technology \n     through Facebook and telethons and text messages and Twitter, \n     there has been an overwhelming global response. But of \n     course, there is so much more to be done.\n       When I think about being here with all of you today, there \n     are so many subjects to talk about. You have already heard, \n     both in prayer and in Scripture reading and in Prime Minister \n     Zapatero's remarks, a number of messages. But let me be both \n     personal and speak from my unique perspective now as \n     Secretary of State. I have been here as a First Lady. I have \n     been here as a senator, and now I am here as a Secretary of \n     State. I have heard heartfelt descriptions of personal faith \n     journeys. I have heard impassioned pleas for feeding the \n     hungry and helping the poor, caring for the sick. I have \n     heard speeches about promoting understanding among people of \n     different faiths. I have met hundreds of visitors from \n     countries across the globe. I have seen the leaders of my own \n     country come here amidst the crises of the time and, for at \n     least a morning, put away political and ideological \n     differences. And I have watched and I have listened to three \n     presidents, each a man of faith, speak from their hearts, \n     both sharing their own feelings about being in a position \n     that has almost intolerably impossible burdens to bear, and \n     appealing often, either explicitly or implicitly, for an end \n     to the increasing smallness, irrelevancy, even meanness, of \n     our own political culture. My own heart has been touched and \n     occasionally pierced by the words I have heard and often my \n     spirit has been lifted by the musicians and the singers who \n     have shared their gifts in praising the Lord with us. And \n     during difficult and painful times, my faith has been \n     strengthened by the personal connections that I have \n     experienced with people who, by the calculus of politics, \n     were on the opposite side of me on the basis of issues or \n     partisanship.\n       After my very first prayer breakfast, a bipartisan group of \n     women asked me to join them for lunch and told me that they \n     were forming a prayer group. And these prayer partners prayed \n     for me. They prayed for me during some very challenging \n     times. They came to see me in the White House. They kept in \n     touch with me and some still do today. And they gave me a \n     handmade book with messages, quotes, and Scripture to sustain \n     me. And of all the thousands of gifts that I have received in \n     the White House, I have a special affection for this one. \n     Because in addition to the tangible gift of the book, it \n     contained 12 intangible gifts, 12 gifts of discernment, \n     peace, compassion, faith, fellowship, vision, forgiveness, \n     grace, wisdom, love, joy, and courage. And I have had many \n     occasions to pull out that book and to look at it and to try, \n     Chairman Mullen, to figure out how to close the gap of what I \n     am feeling and doing with what I know I should be feeling and \n     doing. As a person of faith, it is a constant struggle, \n     particularly in the political arena, to close that gap that \n     each of us faces.\n       In February of 1994, the speaker here was Mother Theresa. \n     She gave, as everyone who remembers that occasion will \n     certainly recall, a strong address against abortion. And then \n     she asked to see me. And I thought, ``Oh, dear.'' And after \n     the breakfast we went behind that curtain and we sat on \n     folding chairs, and I remember being struck by how small she \n     was and how powerful her hands were, despite her size, and \n     that she was wearing sandals in February in Washington.\n       We began to talk and she told me that she knew that we had \n     a shared conviction about adoption being vastly better as a \n     choice for unplanned or unwanted babies. And she asked me--or \n     more properly, she directed me--to work with her to create a \n     home for such babies here in Washington. I know that we often \n     picture, as we are growing up, God as a man with a white \n     beard. But that day, I felt like I had been ordered, and that \n     the message was coming not just through this diminutive woman \n     but from some place far beyond.\n       So, I started to work. And it took a while because we had \n     to cut through all the red tape. We had to get all of the \n     approvals. I thought it would be easier than it turned out to \n     be. She proved herself to be the most relentless lobbyist I \n     have ever encountered. She could not get a job in your White \n     House, Mr. President. She never let up. She called me from \n     India, she called me from Vietnam, she wrote me letters and \n     it was always: ``When is the house going to open? How much \n     more can be done--quickly?''\n       Finally, the moment came: June 1995 and the Mother Theresa \n     Home for Infant Children opened. She flew in from Kolkata to \n     attend the opening and, like a happy child, she gripped my \n     arm and led me around, looking\n\n[[Page S4983]]\n\n     at the bassinets and the pretty painted colors on the wall, \n     and just beaming about what this meant for children and their \n     futures.\n       A few years later, I attended her funeral in Kolkata, where \n     I saw presidents and prime ministers, royalty and street \n     beggars pay her homage. And after the service, her successor, \n     Sister Nirmala, the leader of the Missionary of Charity, \n     invited me to come to the Mother House. I was deeply touched. \n     When I arrived, I realized I was one of only a very few \n     outsiders. And I was directed into a whitewashed room where \n     the casket had already arrived. And we stood around with the \n     nuns, with the candles on the walls flickering, and prayed \n     for this extraordinary woman. And then Sister Nirmala asked \n     me to offer a prayer. I felt both inadequate and deeply \n     honored, just as I do today.\n       And in the tradition of prayer breakfast speakers, let me \n     share a few matters that reflect how I came on my own faith \n     journey, and how I think about the responsibilities that \n     President Obama and his administration and our government \n     face today. As Amy said, I grew up in the Methodist Church. \n     On both sides of my father's family, the Rodhams and the \n     Joneses; they came from mining towns. And they claimed, going \n     back many years, to have actually been converted by John and \n     Charles Wesley. And, of course, Methodists--we are \n     methodical. It was a particularly good religion for me. And \n     part of it is a commitment to living out your faith. We \n     believe that faith without works may not be dead, but it is \n     hard to discern from time to time. John Wesley had this \n     simple rule which I carry around with me as I travel: ``Do \n     all the good you can by all the means you can and by all the \n     ways you can and all the places you can at all the times you \n     can to all the people you can, as long as ever you can.'' \n     That is a tall order. And of course, one of the interpretive \n     problems with it is, who defines good? What are we actually \n     called to do, and how do we stay humble enough, obedient \n     enough, to ask ourselves, ``Am I really doing what I am \n     called to do?'' It was a good rule to be raised by and it was \n     certainly a good rule for my mother and father to discipline \n     us by. And I think it is a good rule to live by, with the \n     appropriate dose of humility. Our world is an imperfect one \n     filled with imperfect people, so we constantly struggle to \n     meet our own spiritual goals. But John Wesley's teachings, \n     and the teachings of my church, particularly during my \n     childhood and teenage years, gave me the impetus to believe \n     that I did have a responsibility. It meant not sitting on the \n     sidelines, but being in the arena. And it meant constantly \n     working to try to fulfill the lessons that I absorbed as a \n     child. It is not easy. We are here today because we are all \n     seekers, and we can all look around our own lives and the \n     lives of those whom we know and see everyone falling so \n     short.\n       As we look around the world, there are so many problems and \n     challenges that people of faith are attempting to address--or \n     should be. We can recite those places where human beings are \n     mired in the past--their hatreds, their differences--where \n     governments refuse to speak to other governments, where the \n     progress of entire nations is undermined because isolation \n     and insularity seem less risky than cooperation and \n     collaboration, where all too often it is religion that is the \n     force that drives and sustains division rather than being the \n     healing balm. These patterns persist despite the overwhelming \n     evidence that more good will comes from suspending old \n     animosities and preconceptions, from engaging others in \n     dialogue, from remembering the cardinal rules found in all of \n     the world's major religions.\n       Last October, I visited Belfast once again, 11 years after \n     the signing of the Good Friday agreement, a place where being \n     a Protestant or a Catholic determined where you lived, often \n     where you worked, whether you were a friend or an enemy, a \n     threat or a target. Yet over time, as the body count grew, \n     the bonds of common humanity became more powerful than the \n     differences fueled by ancient wrongs. So bullets have been \n     traded for ballots--as we meet this morning, both communities \n     are attempting to hammer out a final agreement on the yet \n     unresolved issues between them. And they are discovering anew \n     what the Scripture urges us: ``Let us not become weary in \n     doing good, for at the proper time we will reap a harvest if \n     we do not give up.'' Even in places where God's presence and \n     promise seems fleeting and unfulfilled or completely absent, \n     the power of one person's faith and the determination to act \n     can help lead a nation out of darkness.\n       Some of you may have seen the film, ``Pray the Devil Back \n     to Hell.'' It is the story of a Liberian woman who was tired \n     of the conflict and the killing and the fear that had gripped \n     her country for years. So she went to her church and she \n     prayed for an end to the civil war. And she organized other \n     women at her church, and then at other churches, then at the \n     mosques. Soon thousands of women became a mass movement, \n     rising up and praying for a peace, and working to bring it \n     about that finally, finally ended the conflict.\n       And yet, the devil must have left Liberia and taken up \n     residence in Congo. When I was in the Democratic Republic of \n     Congo this summer, the contrasts were so overwhelmingly \n     tragic--a country the size of Western Europe, rich in \n     minerals and natural resources, where 5.4 million people have \n     been killed in the most deadly conflict since World War II; \n     where 1,100 women and girls are raped every month; where the \n     life expectancy is 46 and dropping; where poverty, starvation \n     and all of the ills that stalk the human race are in \n     abundance. When I traveled to Goma, I saw in a single day the \n     best and the worst of humanity. I met with women who had been \n     savaged and brutalized physically and emotionally, victims of \n     gender and sexual-based violence in a place where law, custom \n     and even faith did little to protect them. But I also saw \n     courageous women who, by faith, went back in to the bush to \n     find those who, like them, had been violently attacked. I saw \n     the doctors and the nurses who were helping to heal the \n     wounds, and I saw so many who were there because their faith \n     led them to it.\n       As we look at the world today and we reflect on the \n     overwhelming response--of the outpouring of generosity--to \n     what happened in Haiti, I am reminded of a story of Elijah. \n     After he goes to Mount Horeb, we read that he faced ``a great \n     wind, so strong that it was splitting mountains and \n     breaking rocks in pieces before the Lord, but the Lord was \n     not in the wind; and after the wind, an earthquake, but \n     the Lord was not in the earthquake; and after the \n     earthquake, a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire; and \n     after the fire, a sound of sheer silence--a still small \n     voice.'' It was then that Elijah heard the voice of the \n     Lord. It is often when we are only quiet enough to listen, \n     that we do as well. It is something we can do at any time, \n     without a disaster or a catastrophe provoking it. It \n     shouldn't take that.\n       But the teachings of every religion call us to care for the \n     poor, tell us to visit the orphans and widows, to be generous \n     and charitable, to alleviate suffering. All religions have \n     their version of the Golden Rule and direct us to love our \n     neighbor and welcome the stranger and visit the prisoner. But \n     how often in the midst of our own lives do we respond to \n     that? All of these holy texts, all of this religious wisdom \n     from these very different faiths, call on us to act out of \n     love. In politics, we sometimes talk about message \n     discipline--making sure everyone uses the same set of talking \n     points. Well, whoever was in charge of message discipline on \n     these issues for every religion certainly knew what they were \n     doing. Regardless of our differences, we all got the same \n     talking points and the same marching orders. So the charge is \n     a personal one. Yet across the world, we see organized \n     religion standing in the way of faith, perverting love, \n     undermining that message. Sometimes it is easier to see the \n     far away than the here at home. But religion, cloaked in \n     naked power lust, is used to justify horrific violence, \n     attacks on homes, markets, schools, volleyball games, \n     churches, mosques, synagogues, temples. From Iraq to Pakistan \n     and Afghanistan to Nigeria and the Middle East, religion is \n     used as a club to deny the human rights of girls and women, \n     from the Gulf to Africa to Asia, and to discriminate, even \n     advocating the execution of gays and lesbians. Religion is \n     used to enshrine in law intolerance of free expression and \n     peaceful protest. Iran is now detaining people and executing \n     people under a new crime--waging war against God. That seems \n     to be a rather dramatic identity crisis.\n       So in the Obama Administration, we are working to bridge \n     religious divides. We are taking on violations of human \n     rights perpetrated in the name of religion. And we invite \n     members of Congress and clergy and active citizens like all \n     of you here to join us. Of course, we are supporting the \n     peace processes from Northern Ireland to the Middle East, and \n     of course we are following up on the President's historic \n     speech at Cairo with outreach efforts to Muslims and \n     promoting interfaith dialogue, and of course we are \n     condemning the repression in Iran. But we are also standing \n     up for girls and for women, who too often in the name of \n     religion, are denied their basic human rights. And we are \n     standing up for gays and lesbians who deserve to be treated \n     as full human beings. And we are also making it clear to \n     countries and leaders that these are priorities of the United \n     States. Every time I travel, I raise the plight of girls and \n     women, and make it clear that we expect to see changes. And I \n     recently called President Museveni, whom I have known through \n     the prayer breakfast, and expressed the strongest concerns \n     about a law being considered in the parliament of Uganda.\n       We are committed, not only to reaching out and speaking up \n     about the perversion of religion, and in particularly the use \n     of it to promote and justify terrorism, but also seeking to \n     find common ground. We are working with Muslim nations to \n     come up with an appropriate way of demonstrating criticism of \n     religious intolerance without stepping over into the area of \n     freedom of religion, or non-religion, and expression. So \n     there is much to be done, and there are a lot of challenging \n     opportunities for each of us as we leave this prayer \n     breakfast, this 58th prayer breakfast.\n       In 1975, my husband and I, who had gotten married in \n     October, and we were both teaching at the University of \n     Arkansas Law School in beautiful Fayetteville, Arkansas--we \n     got married on a Saturday and went back to work on a Monday. \n     So around Christmastime, we decided that we should go \n     somewhere and celebrate, take a honeymoon. And my late father \n     said, ``Well, that's a great idea, we'll come too.'' And \n     indeed Bill and I and my entire family went to Acapulco. We \n     had a great time, but it wasn't exactly a honeymoon. So when \n     we got back, Bill was talking to one of his friends who was \n     then working in Haiti, and his friend said, ``Well, why don't \n     you come see me? This is the most interesting country. Come \n     and take some time.'' So indeed, we did. So we were there\n\n[[Page S4984]]\n\n     over the New Year's holidays. And I remember visiting the \n     cathedral in Port-au-Prince, in the midst of, at that time, \n     so much fear from the regime of the Duvaliers, and so much \n     poverty, there was this cathedral that had stood there and \n     served as a beacon of hope and faith. After the earthquake, I \n     was looking at some of our pictures from the disaster, and I \n     saw the total destruction of the cathedral. It was just a \n     heart rending moment. And yet, I also saw men and women \n     helping one another, digging through the rubble, dancing and \n     singing in the makeshift communities that they were building \n     up. And I thought again that as the Scripture reminds us, \n     ``Though the mountains be shaken and the hills be removed, \n     yet my unfailing love for you will not be shaken nor my \n     covenant of peace be removed.''\n       As the memory of this crisis fades, as the news cameras \n     move on to the next very dramatic incident, let us pray that \n     we can sustain the force and the feeling that we find in our \n     hearts and in our faith in the aftermath of such tragedies. \n     Let us pray that we will all continue to be our brothers' and \n     sisters' keepers. Let us pray that amid our differences we \n     can continue to see the power of faith not only to make us \n     whole as individuals, to provide personal salvation, but to \n     make us a greater whole and a greater force for good on \n     behalf of all creation. So let us do all the good that we \n     can, by all the means we can, in all the ways we can, in all \n     the places we can, to all the people we can, as long as ever \n     we can. God Bless you.\n       Senator Isakson: Thank you, Secretary Clinton, for your \n     words of inspiration and for the magnificent job you do as \n     the Secretary of State for our nation. I now have the high \n     honor and distinct privilege of introducing the President of \n     the United States--that is no easy task. Have you ever tried \n     introducing somebody that is known to everybody on the \n     planet? It is hard to find something unique and \n     inspirational. Everyone knows of the historic impact of \n     Barack Obama's election to the Presidency of the United \n     States. We all marvel at his oratory skills and his ability \n     to communicate, and we all know his energy is boundless. We \n     also know that his audacity of hope has given hope to \n     millions of people around the world, to aspire to the highest \n     of achievement in their life. But it was his State of the \n     Union that inspired me as to what I would say, because I \n     listened when he asked us to seek those things that we have \n     in common, not those things that divide us. And then I \n     realized it, Mr. President, you and I share one unique \n     characteristic in common--we married way over our heads. With \n     a magnificent First Lady like Michelle Obama, I felt it only \n     appropriate that I would introduce you today, sir, as the \n     husband of the dynamic First Lady of the United States of \n     America, President Barack Obama.\n       The President: Thank you. Thank you very much. Please be \n     seated.\n       Thank you so much. Heads of State, Cabinet members, my \n     outstanding Vice President, members of Congress, religious \n     leaders, distinguished guests, Admiral Mullen--it's good to \n     see all of you. Let me begin by acknowledging the co-chairs \n     of this breakfast, Senators Isakson and Klobuchar, who embody \n     the sense of fellowship at the heart of this gathering. They \n     are two of my favorite senators. Let me also acknowledge \n     the director of my Faith-based Office, Joshua DuBois, who \n     is here. He's doing great work.\n       I want to commend Secretary Hillary Clinton on her \n     outstanding remarks and her outstanding leadership at the \n     State Department. She is doing good every day. I am \n     especially pleased to see my dear friend, Prime Minister \n     Zapatero, and I want him to relay America's greetings to the \n     people of Spain. And Johnny, you are right, I am deeply \n     blessed, and I thank God every day for being married to \n     Michelle Obama.\n       I am privileged to join you once again as my predecessors \n     have for over half a century. Like them, I come here to speak \n     about the ways my faith informs who I am--as a President and \n     as a person. But I am also here for the same reason that all \n     of you are, for we all share recognition--one as old as \n     time--that a willingness to believe, an openness to grace, a \n     commitment to prayer can bring sustenance to our lives.\n       There is, of course, a need for prayer even in times of joy \n     and peace and prosperity. Perhaps especially in such times \n     prayer is needed--to guard against pride and to guard against \n     complacency. But rightly or wrongly, most of us are inclined \n     to seek out the divine not in the moment when the Lord makes \n     his face shine upon us but in the moment when God's grace can \n     seem farthest away.\n       Last month, God's grace, God's mercy, seemed far away from \n     our neighbors in Haiti. And yet I believe that grace was not \n     absent in the midst of tragedy. It was heard in prayers and \n     hymns that broke the silence of an earthquake's wake. It was \n     witnessed among parishioners of churches that stood no more, \n     a road side congregation holding bibles in their laps. It was \n     felt in the presence of relief workers and medics, \n     translators, service men and women bringing food and water \n     and aid to the injured.\n       One such translator was an American of Haitian decent, \n     representative of the extraordinary work that our men and \n     women in uniform do all around the world--Navy Corpsman \n     Christopher Brossard. And lying on a gurney aboard the USNS \n     Comfort, a woman asked Christopher: ``Where do you come from? \n     What country? After my operation,'' she said, ``I will pray \n     for that country.'' And in Creole, Corpsman Brossard \n     responded, ``Etazini.'' The United States of America.\n       God's grace, and the compassion and decency of the American \n     people is expressed through the men and women like Corpsman \n     Brossard. It is expressed through the efforts of our Armed \n     Forces; through the efforts of our entire government; through \n     similar efforts from Spain and other countries around the \n     world. It is also, as Secretary Clinton said, expressed \n     through multiple faith-based efforts. By Evangelicals at \n     World Relief. By the American Jewish World Service. By Hindu \n     temples, and mainline Protestants, Catholic Relief Services, \n     African-American churches, the United Sikhs. By Americans of \n     every faith, and no faith, uniting around a common purpose, a \n     higher purpose.\n       It's inspiring. This is what we do, as Americans, in times \n     of trouble. We unite, recognizing that such crises call on \n     all of us to act, recognizing that there but for the grace of \n     God go I, recognizing that life's most sacred \n     responsibility--one affirmed, as Hillary said, by all of the \n     world's great religions--is to sacrifice something of \n     ourselves for a person in need.\n       Sadly, though, that spirit is too often absent when \n     tackling the long-term, but no less profound issues facing \n     our country and the world. Too often, that spirit is missing \n     without the spectacular tragedy--the 9/11 or the Katrina, the \n     earthquake or the tsunami--that can shake us out of \n     complacency. We become numb to the day-to-day crises, the \n     slow-moving tragedies of children without food and men \n     without shelter and families without health care. We become \n     absorbed with our abstract arguments, our ideological \n     disputes, our contests for power. And in this Tower of Babel, \n     we lose the sound of God's voice.\n       Now, for those of us here in Washington, let's acknowledge \n     that democracy has always been messy. Let's not be overly \n     nostalgic. Divisions are hardly new in this country. \n     Arguments about the proper role of government, the \n     relationship between liberty and equality, our obligations to \n     our fellow citizens--these things have been with us since our \n     founding. And I am profoundly mindful that a loyal \n     opposition, a vigorous back and forth, a skepticism of power, \n     all of that is what makes our democracy work.\n       And we have seen actually some improvement in some \n     circumstances. We haven't seen any canings on the floor of \n     the Senate any time recently. So we shouldn't over-\n     romanticize the past. But there is a sense that something is \n     different now; that something is broken; that those of us in \n     Washington are not serving the people as well as we should. \n     At times, it seems like we are unable to listen to one \n     another; to have at once a serious and civil debate. And this \n     erosion of civility in the public square sows division and \n     distrust among our citizens. It poisons the well of public \n     opinion. It leaves each side little room to negotiate with \n     the other. It makes politics an all-or-nothing sport, where \n     one side is either always right or always wrong when, in \n     reality, neither side has a monopoly on truth. And then we \n     lose sight of the children without food and the men without \n     shelter and the families without health care.\n       Empowered by faith, consistently, prayerfully, we need to \n     find our way back to civility. That begins with stepping out \n     of our comfort zones in an effort to bridge divisions. We see \n     that in many conservative pastors who are helping lead the \n     way to fix our broken immigration system. It's not what would \n     be expected from them, and yet they recognize, in those \n     immigrant families, the face of God. We see that in the \n     Evangelical leaders who are rallying their congregations to \n     protect our planet. We see it in the increasing recognition \n     among progressives that government cannot solve all of our \n     problems, and that talking about values like responsible \n     fatherhood and healthy marriage are integral to any anti-\n     poverty agenda. Stretching out of our dogmas, our prescribed \n     roles along the political spectrum, that can help us regain a \n     sense of civility.\n       Civility also requires relearning how to disagree without \n     being disagreeable; understanding as President Kennedy said, \n     that ``civility is not a sign of weakness.'' Now, I am the \n     first to confess that I am not always right. Michelle will \n     testify to that. But surely you can question my policies \n     without questioning my faith, or, for that matter, my \n     citizenship.\n       Challenging each other's ideas can renew our democracy. But \n     when we challenge each other's motives, it becomes harder to \n     see what we hold in common. We forget that we share in some \n     deep level the same dreams--even when we don't share the same \n     plans on how to fulfill them.\n       We may disagree about the best way to reform our health \n     care system, but surely we can agree that no one ought to go \n     broke when they get sick in the richest nation on Earth. We \n     can take different approaches to ending inequality, but \n     surely we can agree on the need to lift our children out \n     of ignorance; to lift our neighbors from poverty. We may \n     disagree about gay marriage, but surely we can agree that \n     it is unconscionable to target gays and lesbians for who \n     they are--whether it is here in the United States or, as \n     Hillary mentioned, more extremely in odious laws that are \n     being proposed most recently in Uganda.\n       Surely, we can agree to find common ground when possible, \n     parting ways when necessary. But in doing so, let us be \n     guided by our faith, and by prayer. For while prayer can buck \n     us up when we are down, keep us calm in a storm; while prayer \n     can stiffen our\n\n[[Page S4985]]\n\n     spines to surmount an obstacle--and I assure you I'm praying \n     a lot these days--prayer can also do something else. It can \n     touch our hearts with humility. It can fill us with a spirit \n     of brotherhood. It can remind us that each of us are children \n     of an awesome and loving God.\n       Through faith, but not through faith alone, we can unite \n     people to serve the common good. And that's why my Office of \n     Faith-Based and Neighborhood Partnerships has been working so \n     hard since I announced it here last year. We have slashed red \n     tape and built effective partnerships on a range of uses, \n     from promoting fatherhood here at home, to spearheading \n     inter-faith cooperation abroad. And through that office, we \n     have turned the faith based initiative around to find common \n     ground among people of all beliefs, allowing them to make an \n     impact that is civil and respectful of difference and focused \n     on what matters most.\n       It is this spirit of civility that we are called to take up \n     when we leave here today. That is what I am praying for. I \n     know in difficult times like these--when people are \n     frustrated, when pundits start shouting and politicians start \n     calling each other names--it can seem like a return to \n     civility is not possible, like the very idea is a relic of \n     some bygone era. The word itself seems quaint--civility.\n       But let us remember those who came before; those who \n     believed in the brotherhood of man even when such a faith was \n     tested. Remember Dr. Martin Luther King. Not long after an \n     explosion ripped through his front porch, his wife and infant \n     daughter inside, he rose to that pulpit in Montgomery and \n     said, ``Love is the only force capable of transforming an \n     enemy into a friend.''\n       In the eyes of those who denied his humanity, he saw the \n     face of God.\n       Remember Abraham Lincoln. On the eve of the Civil War, with \n     states seceding and forces gathering, with a nation divided \n     half slave half free, he rose to deliver his first inaugural \n     and said, ``We are not enemies but friends . . . Though \n     passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of \n     affection.''\n       Even in the eyes of Confederate soldiers, he saw the face \n     of God.\n       Remember William Wilberforce, whose Christian faith led him \n     to seek slavery's abolition in Britain. He was vilified, \n     derided, attacked; but he called for ``lessening prejudices \n     and conciliating good-will, and thereby making way for the \n     less obstructed progress of truth.''\n       In the eyes of those who sought to silence a nation's \n     conscience, he saw the face of God.\n       Yes, there are crimes of conscience that call us to action. \n     Yes, there are causes that move our hearts and offenses that \n     stir our souls. But progress does not come when we demonize \n     opponents. It is not born in righteous spite. Progress comes \n     when we open our hearts, when we extend our hands, when we \n     recognize our common humanity. Progress comes when we look \n     into the eyes of another and see the face of God. That we \n     might do so--that we will do so all the time, not just some \n     of the time--is my fervent prayer for the nation and the \n     world.\n       Thank you, God bless you, and God bless the United States \n     of America.\n       Senator Isakson: Thank you so much, Mr. President, for your \n     leadership and your words of faith. We are now in for a \n     magnificent treat. Ralph Freeman founded Song Sermon \n     Ministries years ago, has sung on continents around the world \n     and throughout the United States. Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. \n     Ralph Freeman.\n     Mr. Ralph Freeman: [Singing]\n     We believe in the Father who created all that is\n     And we believe the universe and all there is His\n     As a loving Heavenly Father he yearned to save us all\n     To lift us from the fall--we believe\n\n     We believe in Jesus, the Father's only son\n     Existing uncreated before time had begun\n     A sacrifice for sin, he died then he rose again\n     To ransom sinful man--we believe.\n\n     We believe in the Spirit who makes believers one\n     Our hearts are filled with His presence\n     The Comforter has come\n     The kingdom unfolds in His plan\n     Unhindered by quarrels of man\n     His church upheld by his hands--we believe\n\n     Though the Earth be removed\n     And time be no more\n     These truths are secure God's words shall endure\n     Whatever may change, these things for sure--we believe.\n\n     So if the mountains are cast down into the plains\n     When the kingdoms all crumble, this one remains\n     Our faith is not subject to seasons of man\n     With our fathers we proclaim\n     We believe our Lord will come as He said\n     The land and the sea will give up their dead\n     His children will reign with Him as their head\n     We believe\n     We believe\n\n       Senator Klobuchar: What an amazing song. Thank you so much \n     and the President wanted me to let you know he only had to \n     leave early so it makes it easier for you all to get out of \n     here. But we want to thank you for such a beautiful morning, \n     something we will never forget and we have one last prayer, a \n     closing prayer and Johnny will introduce our speaker.\n       Senator Isakson: My favorite verse in the Bible is in the \n     first book of Thessalonians, the 5th chapter, the 16th and \n     17th verses--``Rejoice evermore.'' And certainly after this \n     morning's message from Secretary of State Clinton and the \n     gifted musicians that we heard from, Ralph Freeman, Bob \n     Fraumann and MaryKay Messenger, we have had a reason to \n     rejoice this morning. But in addition, the second verse says \n     ``Pray without ceasing,'' and I can not think of a more \n     appropriate person to close today than the young man of great \n     gift and talent on the gridiron, who lives his faith and \n     ministers around the world sharing with others. A role model \n     for the youth of America, the University of Florida \n     quarterback, the Heisman Trophy Winner, Mr. Tim Tebow.\n       Mr. Tim Tebow: It is actually rather incredible that a \n     Georgia Bulldog would invite a Florida Gator. So you can \n     actually see the hand of God here today already. Madam \n     Secretary, Senators, distinguished guests, thank you so much \n     for this opportunity. Now if you would, please bow your heads \n     and pray with me right now.\n       Dear Jesus, thank you for this day. Thank you for bringing \n     together so many people that have a platform to influence \n     people for you. Lord, as we disperse today let us be united \n     in love, hope and peace. Lord, let us come together as one \n     and break down all the barriers in between us that separate \n     us. Lord, you came to seek and save those who were lost and \n     we thank you for that. Lord, we don't know what the future \n     holds but we know who holds the future and in that there is \n     peace and in that there is comfort and in that there is hope. \n     Lord, we pray for the people all over the world who are \n     hurting right now, Lord. And the first thing that comes to \n     mind is James 1, verses 2 through 4, ``Consider all joy my \n     brethren when you encounter various trials, knowing that the \n     testing of your faith produces endurance and let endurance \n     have its perfect result, that you may be perfect and \n     complete, lacking in nothing.'' And we pray for the people in \n     Haiti right now, Lord, that you make them perfect and \n     complete because you love them and you have a plan for their \n     lives, just like you do with our lives right now. So my \n     prayer is as we leave today, we are united as one because of \n     you. We love you and thank you. In Jesus' name, Amen.\n       Senator Isakson: Thank you for attending. We look forward \n     to seeing you at the 59th Prayer Breakfast next year.\n       Senator Klobuchar: Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/16/senate-section/article/S4985-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                      Specialist William C.

Mr. President, I wish to recognize a community in \nNorth Dakota celebrating its 125th anniversary. On June 25 through 27, \nthe residents of Wyndmere will gather to celebrate their community's \nhistory and founding.\n  In 1883, when North Dakota was just part of the Dakota territories, \nthe city of Wyndmere was founded. It was named after Windermere Lake in \nWestmorelandshire, England, which derived from the combination of \n``wynd,'' meaning a narrow lane, and ``mere,'' a pool or lake. The post \noffice was established in 1884, and the Soo Line railroad crossed \nthrough town in 1888. The town flourished and became known as the Corn \nCapital of North Dakota.\n  The city was named a boom town in 1903 with multiple banks, \nphysicians, blacksmith shops, jewelry stores, newspapers, and other \nbusinesses signaling its prosperity. Today, the city of Wyndmere and \nits residents are lucky to live with America's countryside in their \nbackyard. With Sheyenne National Grasslands to enjoy, it is no surprise \nto find such a happy community. Wyndmere will celebrate its \nquasquicentennial with activities including an all school reunion and a \nparade.\n  I ask the Senate to join me in congratulating Wyndmere, ND, and its \nresidents on their first 125 years and in wishing them well in the \nfuture. By honoring Wyndmere and all the other historic small towns of \nNorth Dakota, we keep the great tradition of the pioneering frontier \nspirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Wyndmere that \nhave helped to shape this country into what it is today, which is why \nthe community of Wyndmere is deserving of our recognition.\n  Wyndmere has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/16/senate-section/article/S4986-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING JOHN W. DOUGLAS\n\n Mr. DODD. Mr. President, today I wish to honor the life and \ncareer of John Woolman Douglas, who passed away on June 6, 2010, at the \nage of 88.\n  We are all familiar with the images of the 1963 civil rights march, \nwhich took place here in Washington, DC, and is still one of the \nlargest demonstrations of its kind in the Nation's history. It was \nduring this march, in front of the Lincoln Memorial, with the National \nMall flooded with demonstrators, that Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. \ndelivered his iconic ``I Have a Dream'' speech.\n  The images of that day, and of Dr. King's speech, have left an \nindelible mark on U.S. history. These events are remembered as some of \nthe most important moments in the struggle against racial \ndiscrimination. They are also remembered as a nonviolent and hopeful \naffair--a stark contrast to the violence which characterized earlier \ndemonstrations in the deep south.\n  Much of the credit for the success of this historic event goes to the \ntireless work of an Assistant Attorney General at the Justice \nDepartment. His name was John Douglas. As the head of the Justice \nDepartment's Civil Rights Division, Douglas was charged by President \nKennedy with the responsibility for the logistics and security of the \nmarch. For five weeks in the summer of 1963, he worked tirelessly with \nlocal law enforcement, the march's organizers, and the city of \nWashington to ensure a peaceful, effective demonstration.\n  Though his efforts went largely unnoticed to most Americans, it was \nvital to the success of this iconic event. It was also a testament to \nMr. Douglas's personal belief in ensuring that the laws of our nation \nprotect and promote the civil rights of all citizens.\n  His commitment to the rule of law, and to the advancement of basic \nhuman and civil rights in the United States and across the globe, \nhelped John Douglas find himself at the forefront of some of the most \nsignificant moments of the 20th century--events that helped shape that \ncentury into one of progress and promise.\n  The son of the late U.S. Senator Paul Douglas, John was a 1943 \ngraduate of Princeton University. After serving in the Navy during \nWorld War II as an officer on a PT boat in the Pacific, he enrolled at \nYale Law School, in my home State of Connecticut. In 1948, he went on \nto London as a Rhodes Scholar and returned to clerk for Supreme Court \nJustice Harold Burton. He then embarked upon a career in private law \npractice and in government, during which he sought to advance the cause \nof justice both at home and abroad.\n  In 1962, Douglas was one of four men who negotiated the release of \nmore than 1,000 anti-communist prisoners, captured and held by Cuban \nleader Fidel Castro after the Bay of Pigs invasion. He then served in \nthe Kennedy Justice Department, where he was Assistant Attorney General \nuntil leaving to help his father run his final campaign for U.S. Senate \nin 1966.\n  Upon returning to private practice, he served as cochairman of the \nLawyer's Committee for Civil Rights Under Law. In 1970, he learned that \nschools in the South were still placing black students in separate \nclasses and preventing them from participating in after school \nactivities. Under his direction dozens of volunteers travelled to the \nSouth to assist in taking legal action to stop these injustices. \nThroughout the 1970s and 80s, he continued working actively on civil \nrights issues, serving as the cochairman of the Washington Lawyers' \nCommittee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs, and also as president of \nthe National Legal Aid and Defender Association.\n  Internationally, Mr. Douglas worked to advance human rights through \nthe development of democracy across the globe. In 1985, he traveled to \nSouth Africa, where he demonstrated against apartheid. He then returned \nto that nation as an official election observer in 1994--the year that \nNelson Mandela was elected as President of South Africa in the first \nmulti-racial election in that nation's history. He also served as an \nelection monitor in the African nation of Namibia on three occasions in \nthe 1980s and 1990s.\n  When he saw the rule of law warped into the tool of oppressive \nregimes, John Douglas stood courageously on the side of justice and \nhuman rights. As chairman of the Carnegie Endowment for International \nPeace from 1978 to 1986, he advocated for international arms controls. \nHe also travelled to Chile in 1986 to protest the violent, oppressive \nregime of General Augusto Pinochet.\n  Clearly, he knew, just as my father Thomas Dodd, one of the lead \nprosecutors of the Nuremberg trials did, that the law is humanity's \nstrongest and noblest weapon against tyranny and oppression. This is a \nfundamental value that John Douglas truly took to heart, and throughout \nhis career he fought for the rule of law over the rule of the mob both \nat home and abroad.\n  His contributions to the advancement of these principles shall never \nbe forgotten, and I extend my deepest condolences to his family for \ntheir loss.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/16/senate-section/article/S4986-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4986-S4987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO DR. JEFF KIMPEL\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, when a tornado or severe weather \nevent\n\n[[Page S4987]]\n\nthreatens the lives and property of our citizens across the country, \nfew know that a hard-working, unsung hero is directing the National \nSevere Storms Laboratory in Norman, OK, to provide advanced weather \nforecasting on these threats. Our friend and colleague, Dr. Jeff \nKimpel, Director of the NSSL, is retiring after 13 years of Federal \nservice as the Director of the National Severe Storms Laboratory in \nNorman, OK. He will be sorely missed.\n  As my colleagues in the Senate know, the NSSL is best known for \ndeveloping Doppler weather radar technology that led to the \nestablishment of the national NEXRAD network consisting of more than \n150 radar systems. During Dr. Kimpel's watch, NSSL performed the \nscientific and technological research that upgraded the NEXRADs from \nproprietary to open systems, added superresolution capability and \ndesigned dual-polarization upgrades. Dual-polarization will \nsignificantly increase the accuracy of rainfall estimates, delineate \nrain from snow, and provide an estimate of hail size. Since its \ninstallation, the NEXRAD program has reduced tornado-related deaths by \n45 percent and personal injuries by 40 percent.\n  Under Dr. Kimpel's leadership, NSSL established strong programs in \nshort-term cloud-resolving, numerical forecast models that are designed \nto yield estimates of hazardous weather events including tornadoes, \nwindstorms, lightning, hail, and heavy precipitation. He championed \nradar-based rainfall analyses for flash flood and river forecasting. He \nwas instrumental in establishing support for new facilities for NSSL \nthat led to the eventual construction of the magnificent National \nWeather Center building shared with the National Weather Service and \nthe University of Oklahoma Meteorology Program. He supported NSSL \nscientists and equipment to participate in 17 national and \ninternational field studies including the high profile Verification of \nthe Origin of Tornadoes Experiment.\n  While Dr. Kimpel served as Director, NSSL scientists published over \n600 archival, refereed journal articles, obtained 3 patents, and \nparticipated in 4 Cooperative Research and Development Agreements with \nprivate companies. NSSL employees achieved many honors and recognitions \nduring his tenure including a NSSL affiliate being elected to the \nNational Academy of Sciences, a senior researcher being elected to the \nNational Academy of Engineering, and two junior colleagues being \ninvited to the White House as winners of the Presidential Early Career \nAward for Scientists and Engineers.\n  Dr. Kimpel's legacy at NSSL will be his establishment of far-reaching \nresearch programs designed to vastly improve weather and water warnings \nand forecasts. He worked tirelessly to launch the Multifunction Phased \nArray Radar initiative as a possible eventual replacement for NEXRAD. \nHe worked with the NWS Storm Prediction Center and the Norman Weather \nForecast Office to establish the Hazardous Weather Testbed to \naccelerate the transition of new science into operational warning and \nforecasting decision processes. He worked with others to support the \nWarn-on-Forecast initiative that envisions a time when severe weather \nwarnings will be issued using numerical guidance in addition to the \npresent method of detecting precursors or the event itself. Dr. Kimpel \nexpanded NSSL's radar-based flash flood forecasting and water \nmanagement programs into coastal areas where inundation from land-\nfalling tropical storms and hurricanes is possible.\n  Prior to becoming the Director of NSSL, Dr. Kimpel served in the U.S. \nAir Force, including a tour in Vietnam for which he was awarded the \nBronze Star. He earned his graduate degrees at the University of \nWisconsin before joining the meteorology faculty at the University of \nOklahoma. He achieved the rank of full professor and held a number of \nadministrative positions including dean of the College of Geosciences \nand provost and senior vice president of the Norman Campus. He was \nnamed a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society, is a certified, \nconsulting meteorologist, and was elected president of the AMS in 2000. \nHe chaired both the National Science Foundation's Advisory Committee \nfor Atmospheric Sciences and the Board of Trustees of the University \nCorporation for the Atmospheric Sciences. Dr. Kimpel plans on remaining \nin Norman and spending more time with his five children and two \ngrandchildren.\n  Is there an unsung hero protecting Americans? Yes--that hero to all \nof us is Dr. Jeff Kimpel. We wish him well in his future pursuits, and \nall of us continue to support those research and day-to-day operations \nhe has championed at the NSSL in severe weather detection, research, \nand forecasting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/16/senate-section/article/S4987-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO BOBBY SOUTHARD\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

FAUST ALVAREZ\n\n Mr. TESTER. Mr. President, today I announce to the Senate that \nafter 24 years as chief of staff for the VA Montana Health Care System, \nDr. Faust M. Alvarez, MD, has decided to retire. Dr. Alvarez was \nappointed chief of staff in August 1986 and continued in that position \nuntil April 30, 2010. He began his career as a staff physician at Fort \nHarrison Medical Center in 1984. Prior to joining the VA system he was \nengaged in private practice in the city of Helena for 12 years. During \nthis time he founded and directed the first Montana hemodialysis unit \nand renal program at St. Peter's Hospital.\n  When Dr. Alvarez became the chief of staff at the VA, he sought to \nprovide Montana's veterans with a high quality standard of care, and to \nprovide easier access to medical services. These were challenging goals \ngiven that the VA Montana Health Care System has only one hospital and \nMontana is the fourth largest State geographically. Furthermore Montana \nhas the second largest per capita veteran populations in the country. \nThrough hard work and dedication, he and his staff have achieved these \ngoals and have made the VA Montana Health Care System what it is today.\n  In 1988 Dr. Alvarez began expanding services for veterans by creating \nsatellite clinics. The first clinics were opened in Anaconda and \nKalispell. Today the VA Montana Health Care System has a presence in \nevery major city in the state through 12 satellite outpatient \nfacilities. Three of these facilities have telemedicine access and more \nare to be activated.\n  Through Dr. Alvarez's leadership and the hard working personnel of VA \nMontana, the VA Montana Medical System has been recognized on numerous \noccasions for its quality medical services. In 2005 the VA Montana was \nselected as the Nation's VA hospital of the year. Dr. Alvarez believes \nthat Montana's veterans should expect and receive the highest quality \nmedical care and services, and he has strived to ensure this \nexpectation is met. By hiring board certified medical personnel, \nacquiring new state of the art equipment and incorporating current \nmedical trends into the provision of healthcare services at VA Montana, \nDr. Alvarez, and his staff, have made the VA Montana Health Care System \nthe facility of choice for veterans across the State.\n  I thank Dr. Alvarez for his dedicated years of service. We are all \nproud of his accomplishments at VA Montana and the positive affect that \nthe VA has had across the State during his tenure.

A bill to support the establishmeht and operation of \nTeachers Professional Development Institutes; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, \nalong with my friend and colleague, the senior Senator from \nConnecticut, Mr. Dodd, that will strengthen the content knowledge and \ninstructional skills of our present K-12 teacher workforce and thus \nultimately raise student achievement.\n  The Teachers Professional Development Institutes Act would establish \neight new Teachers Professional Development Institutes throughout the \nnation each year over the next 5 years based on the model which has \nbeen operating at Yale University for over 30 years. Every Teachers \nInstitute would consist of a partnership between an institution of \nhigher education and the local public school system in which a \nsignificant proportion of the students come from low-income households. \nThese Institutes will strengthen the present teacher workforce by \ngiving each participant an opportunity to gain more sophisticated \ncontent knowledge and a chance to develop curriculum units with other \ncolleagues that can be directly applied in their classrooms. We know \nthat teachers gain confidence and enthusiasm when they have a deeper \nunderstanding of the subject matter that they teach and this translates \ninto higher expectations for their students and an increase in student \nachievement.\n  The Teachers Professional Development Institutes are based on the \nYale-New Haven Teachers Institute model that has been in existence \nsince 1978. For over 30 years, the Institute has offered, 5 or 6 13-\nsession seminars each year, led by Yale faculty, on topics that \nteachers have selected to enhance their mastery of the specific subject \narea that they teach. The subject selection process begins with \nrepresentatives from the Institutes soliciting ideas from \nteachers throughout the school district for topics on which teachers \nfeel they need to have additional preparation, topics that will assist \nthem in preparing materials they need for their students, and topics \nthat will assist them in addressing the standards that the school \ndistrict requires. As a consensus emerges about desired seminar \nsubjects, the Institute director identifies university faculty members \nwith the appropriate expertise, interest and desire to lead the \nseminar. University faculty members, especially those who have led \nInstitute seminars before, may sometimes suggest seminars they would \nlike to lead, and these ideas are circulated by the representatives as \nwell. The final decisions on which seminar topics are offered are \nultimately made by the teachers who participate. In this way, the \nofferings are designed to respond to what teachers believe is needed \nand useful for both themselves and their students.\n\n  The cooperative nature of the Institute seminar planning process \nensures\n\n[[Page S4992]]\n\nits success. Institutes offer seminars and relevant materials on topics \nteachers have identified and feel are needed for their own preparation, \nas well as what they know will motivate and engage their students. \nTeachers enthusiastically take part in rigorous seminars they have \nrequested, and practice using the materials they have obtained and \ndeveloped. This helps ensure that the experience not only increases \ntheir preparation in the subjects they are assigned to teach, but also \ntheir participation in an Institute seminar gives them immediate hands-\non active learning materials that can be used in the classroom. In \nshort, by allowing teachers to determine the seminar subjects and \nproviding them the resources to develop relevant curricula for their \nclassroom and their students, the Institutes empower teachers.\n  The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute conducted a National \nDemonstration Project from 1999-2002 that showed that similar \nInstitutes could be created rapidly at diverse sites with large \nconcentrations of disadvantaged students. After 2 years of research and \nplanning, and based on the success of that Project, the Institute in \n2005 launched the Yale National Initiative to strengthen teaching in \npublic schools, a long-term endeavor to assist with the establishment \nof Teachers Institutes of this specific type in most states. As a \nresult, new Institutes already have been established in Philadelphia, \nPennsylvania, and Charlotte, North Carolina; and Institutes are \ncurrently being planned for New Castle County, Delaware, and San \nFrancisco, California.\n\n  The teachers surveyed for the National Demonstration Project reported \nthat student motivation, student interest, and student mastery were \nhigher during the Institute-developed unit than during other work. \nSubsequently, the findings of a 2009 Report on Teachers Institute \nExperiences found that teachers participated out of desires to obtain \ncurricula which suited their needs, increased subject mastery, and \nmotivated students. Mr. President, 96 percent of the teachers rated the \nInstitute seminars as useful, partly due to the reported increase in \nknowledge and in raising expectations of their students.\n  A retrospective study showed that over a 5-year period Teachers \nInstitute participants were almost twice as likely as non-participants \nto remain teaching in the district five years later. Research has shown \nthat longevity in a district is associated with teaching effectiveness.\n  Many agree that teacher quality is the single most important school-\nrelated factor in determining student achievement. High-quality teacher \nprofessional development programs that focus on subject and pedagogy \nknowledge are a proven method for enhancing the effectiveness of a \nteacher in the classroom. A recent review of professional development \nstudies by the Department of Education's Institute of Education \nSciences found that ``teachers who receive substantial professional \ndevelopment--an average of 49 hours in the nine studies--can boost \ntheir students' achievement by about 21 percentile points.''\n  The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute model enhances teachers' basic \nwriting, math, and presentation skills. It increases expectations of \nstudent achievement and enthusiasm for teaching while developing skills \nfor motivating students. These are key features that research suggests \nare effective in producing gains in both teacher knowledge and practice \nand student achievement. The Teachers Institutes accomplish student \nachievement gains through a proven approach distinguished from both \nconventional professional development offerings of school districts and \nfrom traditional continuing education and outreach programs of colleges \nand universities.\n  Education Secretary Arne Duncan said recently, ``The more we can \nprovide high-quality professional development, so that teachers have \ndeep content knowledge, there are huge benefits. . . . So whether it's \npartnerships with universities and higher ed institutions, to create \nthose meaningful professional development opportunities and really \ncreate those content-rich environments that students desperately need, \nthat is absolutely critically important.''\n  This is precisely what the Teachers Professional Development \nInstitutes Act strives to accomplish. The need for effective teachers \nwith deep content knowledge is most apparent and urgent in schools and \nschool districts that enroll a high proportion of students from low-\nincome families, exactly the schools and school districts that Teachers \nInstitutes serve.\n  The Yale-New Haven Teachers Institute has already proven to be a \nsuccessful model for teacher professional development as demonstrated \nby the high caliber curriculum unit plans that teacher participants \nhave developed and placed on the web, and by the evaluations that \nsupport the conclusion that virtually all the teacher participants felt \nsubstantially strengthened in their mastery of content knowledge and \ntheir teaching skills. The finding that Institute participants were \nalmost twice as likely as non-participants to remain in teaching in \nhigh-need schools is especially encouraging. Our proposal would open \nthis opportunity to many more teachers in high-need schools throughout \nthe Nation.\n  I urge my colleagues to act favorably on this measure.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3498\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to require \nfiduciaries of individuals receiving benefits under laws administered \nby the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to authorize the Secretary to \nobtain financial records with respect to such individuals for purposes \nof administering such laws, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I introduce legislation that would provide VA with \nthe means to better protect those VA beneficiaries who have \nfidicuiaries appointed to look after their affairs. This\n\n[[Page S4994]]\n\nbill would improve oversight of fiduciaries by authorizing VA to access \nrecords at financial institutions for up to 3 years.\n  Under current law, VA has a 3-month time limit on the authorization \nto view financial records maintained by a fiduciary, a time period \nwhich has proven to be inadequate. In addition, VA lacks the authority \nto compel a fiduciary to provide a Social Security number or other \nidentifying information needed to track financial records.\n  The legislation I am introducing today is modeled on Social Security \nlaws and procedures. It will help VA ensure that veterans' monies are \nnot being misused. It would allow VA to require that any person \nappointed or recognized by VA as a fiduciary be required to sign an \nauthorization for release of records which would be in effect for up to \n3 years. If a fiduciary refuses to sign or revokes an authorization, VA \nwould be authorized to remove the fiduciary.\n  The Committee held a hearing on pending legislation on May 19, 2010, \nand witnesses from The American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars \nspoke on the need to strengthen VA's oversight of fiduciaries.\n  I urge our colleagues to support this bill to protect VA \nbeneficiaries who need assistance with financial management.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3499\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Ms. MURKOWSKI (for herself and Mr. Begich) submitted an \namendment intended to be proposed by her to the bill H.R. 4213, to \namend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend certain expiring \nprovisions, and for other purposes; which was ordered to lie on the \ntable; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n         TITLE VIII--ALASKA COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT QUOTA PROGRAM\n\n     SEC. 801. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Western Alaska Community \n     Development Organizations Tax Relief Act''.\n\n     SEC. 802. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) In 1990, Congress established a Joint Federal-State \n     Commission on Policies and Programs Affecting Alaska Natives \n     to investigate economic and social conditions in rural Alaska \n     communities that are Native villages for the purposes of the \n     Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act; the Commission reported \n     very high unemployment and widespread poverty.\n       (2) In 1992, the United States Secretary of Commerce \n     approved Amendment 18 to the Bering Sea and Aleutian Island \n     (BSAI) Fishery Management Plan creating the Western Alaska \n     Community Development Quota (CDQ) Program to promote the \n     economic development of the 65 villages of the western Alaska \n     region which were organized as six coalitions.\n       (3) In 1994, the Commission recommended to Congress that it \n     amend the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Act to codify the establishment of the CDQ Program \n     and expand the program to include all commercial fisheries \n     that are conducted in the Bering Sea-Aleutian Islands \n     Management Area.\n\n[[Page S4997]]\n\n       (4) In 1996, Congress implemented the recommendation of the \n     Commission by enacting section 305(i)(1) of the Magnuson-\n     Stevens Fishery Conservation and Management Act subparagraph \n     (A) of which established the western Alaska community \n     development program--\n       (A) to provide eligible western Alaska villages with the \n     opportunity to participate and invest in fisheries in the \n     Bering Sea and Aleutian Islands Management Area;\n       (B) to support economic development in western Alaska;\n       (C) to alleviate poverty and provide economic and social \n     benefits for residents of western Alaska; and\n       (D) to achieve sustainable and diversified local economies \n     in western Alaska.\n       (5) In 2006, Congress, in section 416 of the Conference \n     Report to Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of \n     2006, stated its intent that ``all activities of the CDQ \n     groups continue to be considered tax-exempt (as has been the \n     practice since the program's inception in 1992) so that the \n     six CDQ groups can more readily address the pressing economic \n     needs of the region''.\n       (6) The original six coalitions organized as six \n     corporations and are recognized as tax-exempt under either \n     section 501(c)(3) or section 501(c)(4) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986.\n       (7) Today, the six CDQ organizations are making important \n     and ongoing contributions to the economic development and the \n     alleviation of poverty in the western Alaska region \n     consistent with the purposes Congress has established for the \n     CDQ Program. As the program was intended, the organizations \n     have become bona fide participants in the BSAI commercial \n     fisheries. The CDQ organizations are using the revenue that \n     their participation generates to create employment and \n     economic development opportunities that would have been \n     impossible in western Alaska prior to the CDQ Program.\n       (8) The CDQ organizations have paid, and will continue to \n     pay, income tax on income generated from their activities and \n     investments outside of the BSAI area.\n       (9) Excluding income generated from the CDQ organizations' \n     fishery-related activities and investments inside the BSAI \n     area from unrelated business taxable income is consistent \n     with the intent of Congress.\n\n     SEC. 803.

Such excluded income received after the date of the \n     enactment of this paragraph shall be reported by such entity \n     on the annual return required under section 6033 and in any \n     annual report required under section 305(i)(1)(F)(ii) of such \n     Act (16 U.S.C. 1855(i)(1)(F)(ii)).''.\n       (2) Effective date.--The amendment made by paragraph (1) \n     shall apply to income received before, on, or after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act.\n       (b) Application to Certain Wholly Owned Subsidiaries.--If \n     the assets of a trade or business described in section \n     512(b)(20) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (as added by \n     subsection (a)(1)) of any subsidiary wholly owned by a \n     Community Development Quota entity identified in section \n     305(i)(1)(D) of the Magnuson-Stevens Fishery Conservation and \n     Management Act (16 U.S.C. 1855(i)(1)(D) are transferred to \n     such entity (including in liquidation of such subsidiary) not \n     later than 18 months after the date of the enactment of this \n     Act--\n       (1) no gain resulting from such transfer shall be \n     recognized to either such subsidiary or such entity under \n     such Code, and\n       (2) all income derived by such subsidiary from such \n     transferred trade or business shall be exempt from taxation \n     under such Code.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 4368.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this part to implement \n     reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care \n     liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. _13.

Mr. President, this joint resolution recognizes the 60th \nanniversary of the outbreak of the Korean war, as well as honoring the \nstrong friendship between the United States and the Republic of Korea.\n  June 25 is a very important day, not only in Korean history, but also \nin U.S. history. On that day 60 years ago, Communist troops from the \nSoviet-occupied north crossed the invisible border at the 38th parallel \nto invade their free brethren to the south--killing thousands of \ncivilians and forcing streams of refugees to flee their advance.\n  Under the leadership of President Harry S. Truman, the United States \nresponded to its first military challenge of the Cold War by \ndispatching U.S. forces to lead 15 other countries of a United Nations \nforce to defend against the spread of communism. President Truman made \nhis commitment to the war very clear:\n\n       In the simplest terms, what we are doing in Korea is this: \n     We are trying to prevent a third world war. . . . If history \n     has taught us anything, it is that aggression anywhere in the \n     world is a threat to peace everywhere in the world. When that \n     aggression is supported by the cruel and selfish rulers of a \n     powerful nation who are bent on conquest, it becomes a clear \n     and present danger to the security and independence of every \n     free nation.\n\n  During the 3 years of the Korean war, 5.7 million Americans answered \nthe call to duty, and almost 1.8 million of these men and women \ndeployed across the Pacific to serve in some of the most harsh and \nunforgiving conditions along the rugged peninsula, in the skies above \nthe Yalu River, on carriers and other surface ships at sea, or from \nstaging and support areas in Japan. By the official cease fire on July \n27, 1953, 54,246 American servicemen and servicewomen had sacrificed \ntheir lives to defeat Korean and Chinese Communist troops and push them \nnorth of what is known as the Demilitarized Zone. Since then, a \nstalemate has existed on the Korean Peninsula, with the United States \nsupporting a free and prosperous Republic of Korea, while keeping a \nwary eye on the brutally repressive regime across the border. In the \nlast 60 years, there have been several confrontational episodes and \npotential flashpoints between the two Koreas, and events of the last \nfew weeks show us that the conflict continues today.\n  Although we are hopeful that the swell of military action 60 years \nago will be the most profound fighting in the Korean war, North Korea \nhas shown a propensity to provoke its sister country in the South. This \nis clearly evident in the brutal murder of 46 South Korean sailors of \nthe South Korean Navy ship, the Cheowan, on May 20. Compelling evidence \npoints toward North Korean culpability in this latest episode. Such an \nact of aggression only serves to underscore and reaffirm the importance \nof the alliance between the United States and the Republic of Korea.\n  Today, U.S. Forces Korea--the combined American air, ground, and \nnaval forces of roughly 28,500 American servicemembers--still stand \nready to assist in the safety and security of South Korea near the \nDemilitarized Zone, DMZ, and throughout the rest of the peninsula below \nthe 38th Parallel.\n  This mutual and enduring friendship has been in evidence since \nSeptember 11, 2001. South Korea has been an able and willing ally in \nthe global war on terror, dispatching the 100th Engineer Group and \n924th Medical Group to both Iraq and Afghanistan. Their forces have \nbeen integral in providing humanitarian and medical aid to soldiers and \ncivilians alike, as well as working to rebuild infrastructure in \nAfghanistan and Iraq.\n  I ask all of my esteemed colleagues to stand with me and pass this \njoint resolution, to not only commemorate the 60th anniversary of the \nbeginning of the Korean war and properly honor those Americans who \nserved proudly in that conflict, but also to recognize the continued \nresilience and vibrancy of the alliance between our nations.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The joint resolution (S.J.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of S. Res. 559, submitted \nearlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 559) observing the historical \n     significance of Juneteenth Independence Day.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, on a hot day in the summer of 1776, \ndelegates from across the American Colonies gathered in Philadelphia to \ncast off the yoke of tyranny and assert the fundamental right of self-\ngovernment.\n  At that moment, when our Republic was born, our Founders ratified a \ndocument unique in human history which contained the landmark words:\n\n       We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are \n     created equal.\n\n  This simple creed became the justification of a great Revolutionary \nWar, which gave rise to the thriving democracy we inhabit today. That \nis why we celebrate every Fourth of July as Independence Day--because \nof the principles laid out in that remarkable Declaration.\n  But, tragically, for almost a century after that document was \nratified, the equality of all men remained an unfulfilled promise. It \nbegan to seem that the Declaration of Independence defined our \naspirations rather than our core beliefs.\n  Slavery, brutal and unjust, remained legal throughout the majority of \nthe 19th century and helped set the stage for the bloodiest war we have \never known. But, as President Lincoln had dearly hoped, out of that \nterrible violence was born a new and more complete freedom--a freedom \nthat wiped out the scourge of slavery once and for all and realized the \npromise our Founding Fathers documented for all Americans.\n  That is why, on Saturday, many in this country observe another \nindependence day known as Juneteenth. Slavery ended in the Confederate \nStates of America when President Lincoln signed the Emancipation \nProclamation on January 1, 1863. But many slaves did not learn of their \nfreedom until much later.\n  Finally, on June 19, 1865--more than 2 years after the Emancipation \nProclamation--Union soldiers led by Major General Gordon Granger \narrived in Galveston, TX. They brought news that must have been almost \nunbelievable to all who heard it. The Civil War was over, they \nannounced, and all slaves were free.\n  From that day on, former slaves in the Southwest celebrated June 19 \nas the anniversary of their emancipation. That is why I have submitted \nthis resolution observing the historical significance of this date--\nJuneteenth Independence Day.\n  Over the past 145 years, Juneteenth celebrations have been held to \nhonor African-American freedom. But this date has come to hold even \ngreater significance. Throughout the world, Juneteenth celebrations \nlift the spirit of freedom and rail against the forces of oppression. \nAt long last, this day is beginning to be recognized as both a national \nevent and a global celebration.\n  But just as the Fourth of July marks the beginning of a journey that \ncontinues even today, we must not forget that the long march to freedom \nthat started on June 19, 1865, is far from over.\n  Our country has made great strides in the century and a half since \nslavery was abolished, but deep wounds are slow to heal. We will never \nbe able to rewrite this terrible history. But we can, and we must, do \neverything we can to rise above it--to seek constructive solutions to \nthe problems that time alone cannot wash away, problems that still \naffect the African-American community on a daily basis, from \ndiscrimination, to crime, to health care disparities, to unemployment, \nto substance abuse, and so on.\n  So let's pay tribute to the suffering of our forefathers by seeking \njustice for our children. Let's remember our past by looking to our \nfuture and confronting these problems with bold, new solutions.\n  This is a day for all of us to stand together and lift up the \nliberties we hold so dear--a day to look forward, to look ahead to \ntomorrow, and continue the fight for freedom and equality.\n  So I ask my colleagues to stand with me. I ask them to support my \nresolution observing the historical significance of Juneteenth \nIndependence Day. I invite them to share the joy of those who greeted \nUnion soldiers in Galveston more than 140 years ago.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise to highlight the \ncelebration of Juneteenth throughout my State of Colorado.\n  One hundred forty-five years ago, Black slaves in Galveston, TX, \nheard the contents of ``General Order No. 3,'' which proclaimed their \nfreedom from slavery. Though the announcement in Galveston in 1865 came \nover 2 years after President Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation, for \nthe first time, Black slaves learned of their freedom from a shameful \npolicy of early America that threatened the wellbeing of the entire \nUnion. June 19, 1865, was a joyous day for these men, women and \nchildren and has since become a day of reflection and celebration as \nthe day when Lincoln's words in the Emancipation Proclamation were \nfinally realized. As African Americans migrated west and out of Texas, \nthey carried with them the memories and message they had heard on that \ngreat day in June.\n  Communities in Colorado come together every year to continue a \ntradition that highlights a notable turning point in our country's \nhistory; a point at which our country's hard fought efforts to empower \na segment of America's population materialized. Today, just as before, \nthis community has continued to make powerful and positive \ncontributions to our common quality of life. That is why it is no \nsurprise to me that this tradition carries on. In Colorado, citizens of \nvarious backgrounds gather in Pueblo, Colorado Springs, Denver and in \nthe backyards of communities across our State to celebrate Juneteenth.\n  I am particularly proud to mention that in Pueblo, CO, they are \ncelebrating the 30th anniversary of their first official Juneteenth \ncelebration with the theme ``Growing the Community.'' And just as in \nColorado Springs, Denver and other places across the State, it is an \nevent that shares this history and time of reflection with the entire \ncommunity.\n  To all my fellow Coloradans who will gather this June 19 to celebrate \nan important event in America's history, I wish you a safe and joyous \noccasion. And I am proud that you continue to instill a sense of \nhistory and community that provides rich cultural and historical \nknowledge of our country's fight to ensure freedom for all.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements related to the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the legislative business before the \nSenate deals with the so-called tax extenders. These extenders, as \nimportant as they are, represent only a small portion of the time-\nsensitive tax legislative business that needs to be completed.\n  I have a chart that I have used the last few days illustrating the \nstatus of several pieces of absolutely must-do tax legislation.\n  Earlier this week, I discussed the lack of action on this year's \nalternative minimum tax. I refer to that as an AMT patch. In a day or \ntwo, I will discuss the failure of Congress to act on the bipartisan \n2001 and 2003 marginal rate cuts and Family Tax Relief Act.\n  This evening, I want to discuss the lack of action on estate tax \nreform.\n  Most of my colleagues know this about me--for as many years as I have \nbeen a representative of the people of Iowa, I have never believed that \ndeath--a person dying--should be a taxable event.\n  Taxing people's assets upon their death is plain wrong, and their \nheirs should not be forced to sell a single asset in order to meet this \narbitrary tax due date caused by death.\n  Company assets should not have to be sold to pay taxes. The market, \nin fact, should determine when things are bought and sold because that \nis the very best measurement when a willing buyer meets a willing \nseller and they agree on a price and a time when a company should be \nsold. In other words, if you have to do it because somebody died, a \nfire-sale approach probably does not determine the true value of that \nproperty and, consequently, less money to the heirs and even less tax \nmoney coming in.\n  That is where I come from. We ought to repeal the death tax. But that \nis not political reality. The political reality is that there are not \n60 votes in the Senate for that policy. Unfortunately, while repeal is \nthe law of the land today, in a few months the law will take a sharp \nturn in the other direction--a wrong direction.\n  Under current law, in 2011, we will once again have an estate tax due \nand owing within 9 months of death of 55 percent and even in some cases \n60 percent. That is not right. We force many unwilling sellers to have \nto deal with a very willing shark of a buyer waiting in the murky \nwaters of tax uncertainty.\n  Some people wonder why I care so much about this issue. Pundits might \nsay that Iowa is poor compared to places such as New York City and that \nland and companies are not worth much.\n  Much of the press attention has been paid to what the current law \ndoes this year. For instance, the New York Times printed an article on \nhow the current law repeal of the estate tax applies to a Texas \nbillionaire who died a few weeks ago.\n  We are almost half a year away from a tax policy that a supermajority \nof Senators say they do not support. Yet we are stuck in a mud hole. \nThis time-sensitive issue has taken a back seat in this body to \neverything else.\n  My colleagues may not know that Iowa has 99 counties, and I have \nvisited each of the 99 counties every year for the last 29 years to \nhold town meetings and to get people's opinions. Let me give a couple \nexamples I have learned of why I think this issue of doing something \nquickly about the estate tax is a very important issue and a very \ntimely issue.\n  I want to talk about some people who live in Iowa. Not only do they \nlive in Iowa, they have devoted their entire life for multiple \ngenerations to build businesses and create good jobs for the people of \nrural Iowa.\n  Over 44 years ago, Eugene and Mary Sukup started a grain handling and \nstorage manufacturing company in Sheffield, IA. Today, the Sukups and \ntheir two sons and their families are still headquartered in Sheffield, \nIA, population of a whopping 990 people, about 300 more than the town \nin which I live. They employ over 300 people from five different \ncounties in good-paying jobs with a good retirement plan.\n  In fact, the original employee team that started with them almost 40 \nyears ago is still there today and, in many cases, the next generation \nhas also joined the team.\n  This chart depicts one of the main products they make and sell. For \ncity folks who are watching, this piece of equipment is a building \ncalled a grain bin. I have some grain bins such as this on my family \nfarm that my son Robin operates.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a short history \nof the innovative efforts of the Sukup family.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Sukup Manufacturing Co is a family-owned and operated \n     company located in Sheffield, Iowa--right in the heart of \n     Midwest farmland. The company manufactures a full line of \n     grain storage, drying and handling equipment, as well as a \n     line of implements.\n\n[[Page S5048]]\n\n       The Sukup Grain Handling and Storage Solutions line \n     includes grain bins for both on-farm and commercial storage, \n     grain dryers for on-farm and commercial operations, axial and \n     centrifugal fans and heaters, stirring machines, unloading \n     equipment, bin floors and supports, drive-over hoppers, grain \n     spreaders and Airway' Tubes. The implement line \n     includes cultivators, flail shredders, a wild game food plot \n     planter and grain drills.\n       Sukup's focus in manufacturing has been to hire local, \n     reliable employees and provide them with top quality tools \n     with which to do their jobs. Sukup has made a considerable \n     investment in manufacturing technologies. The manufacturing \n     facilities in Sheffield house a number of welding robots, \n     Computer Numeric Control (CNC) Machining Center, CNC Punching \n     Centers, Mazak Lasers, and numerous roll forming machines. \n     The company also utilizes progressive dies to speed \n     production of high-usage parts. Sukup's bin production line \n     is the most advanced and efficient in the industry. When \n     Sukup entered the bin manufacturing business, they had the \n     bin sidewall sheet and roof sheet lines built to their strict \n     specifications by the leader in roll forming equipment. These \n     machines are computer-controlled and maintain extremely tight \n     tolerances that make Sukup Bins the best fitting and easiest \n     to put together in the industry.\n       Ultimately, the key to Sukup Manufacturing Co's success has \n     been its innovative ideas that have resulted in over 70 U.S. \n     patents. Sukup Manufacturing Co currently produces a broad \n     line of grain handling and storage systems as well as \n     innovative tillage equipment. Sukup is a market leader with \n     many of their products holding either the number one or \n     number two spot in terms of market share for their respective \n     product categories. In addition, Sukup products are sold not \n     only throughout the U.S., but also in over 50 foreign \n     countries.\n       One of the other factors in Sukup Manufacturing Co's \n     success is their long-term employees. Nearly 30% of their \n     full-time employees have been with the company for more than \n     10 years. Sukup equipment is built by people who understand \n     their jobs and the important role they play in producing a \n     successful product. In the past, to reward their employees \n     for their dedication, Sukup has invited employees with 10 \n     years of full-time employment with Sukup on a 7-day trip to \n     the Hawaiian islands with their spouse. It is a great \n     opportunity for co-workers to relax and get to know each \n     other away from the workplace, which leads to tighter bonds \n     when they return to their positions within the company.\n       If you're ever in the Sheffield, Iowa area (approx. 100 \n     miles north of Des Moines or 150 miles south of Minneapolis, \n     just off of 1-35), stop in for a visit. We'll be more than \n     happy to give you a tour of our facilities and introduce you \n     to some of our employees. We're sure you'll be impressed by \n     what you see.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, in addition, they have facilities in six \nother States also contributing to those States' rural economies, such \nas Defiance, OH, Jonesboro, AR, Arcola, IL, Aurora, NE, and Watertown, \nSD--places where good jobs and hard work that is not flashy and does \nnot make the scandal page of the big city newspapers are valued in \nthose towns as important places of employment and contribute to the \neconomy, places where people invest in the local economy and contribute \nas good citizens to community improvement and betterment.\n  They used to call these kinds of folks the ``pillars of the \ncommunity,'' in old-fashioned terms. But in today's economy, these are \nfolks devoted to American values and small town America. They may sell \ntheir products all over the United States. They also sell their \nproducts--would you believe it--all over the world. But you know what, \nthey manufacture those products right there in that small community of \nSheffield, IA. As a family farmer, the Sukups have been successful \nbecause they make a great product, and this is one of their products.\n  I wish to move on to another little Iowa town, somewhat larger than \nSheffield, the town of Shenandoah. That is where Lloyd Inc. is located. \nShenandoah is a community of almost 5,000 people--4,944 to be precise. \nOur colleague Senator Ensign is the lone practitioner of animal \nmedicine in the Senate. He might be familiar with the products that \nLloyd Inc. in Shenandoah, IA, puts out.\n  It, too, is not a flashy company. They started making animal dietary \nmixes in 1958, and now they are a significant provider of veterinary \ndrugs. The chart depicts one of Lloyd Inc.'s products. These are \ndifferent animals. I am not going to go into too much detail about \nthem.\n  Eugene Lloyd is a doctor of veterinary medicine. He is the CEO of the \ncompany. Dr. Lloyd has told me the company has never let go of any \nemployees due to poor business cycles.\n  Lloyd Inc. employs well over 90 well-educated people in this \ncommunity of Shenandoah in southwest Iowa. The company has also \nprovided generous health care and retirement plans to their employees, \nand as I said, in rural America, those benefits are very important.\n  Finally, both the company and Dr. Lloyd and his family have given \ngenerously throughout the years to educational scholarships, \nunrestricted grants to Dr. Lloyd's and his wife's alma mater, and \nprovided financial and product support to address disasters, both \nlocally and internationally.\n  Unfortunately, even after vigilant estate planning, these two \nfamilies, the Lloyd and the Sukup family-owned companies will be facing \na very large combined estate tax bill. That bill could total tens of \nmillions of dollars between the two companies. That is tens of millions \nof dollars that will leave the State of Iowa. These companies might \nface a fire sale, and so often in this circumstance a company is sold \nto someone with no interest or no desire to maintain the current \nlocation or contributions to the community.\n  There are two companies, two towns, six counties, four families, and \nhundreds of employees, and all will be hurt if we do not do something \nabout the death tax. Businesses will be sold, locations will be shut \ndown, real people will lose good jobs. The State of Iowa will lose tens \nof millions of dollars of hard capital invested for over 90 years \nbetween these two companies. I barely even mentioned how much salary, \nretirement plans, and charitable contributions they have made to those \nlittle Iowa communities.\n  The multinational or foreign companies will come calling. They will \nbe circling these home-grown businesses. Trust me, they will. We have \nseen it before. Perhaps they will be accompanied by sharpie hedge-fund \ntypes from big cities, such as New York, Boston or Chicago. They will \ngo to places such as Sheffield and Shenandoah, but they will not go \nthere to live. When they arrive we will have no one else to blame but \nus, right here in the Congress, for letting these family-owned \ncompanies committed to the community go away.\n  The punitive death tax policy passionately pushed by my liberal \nfriends will have greased the skids. It will have killed the local \nroots of these successful small town businesses. All of us from rural \nAmerica are trying to battle what is called out-migration. If we leave \nthe death tax in place in its punitive form, in 2011 it will take away \njobs, businesses, and people out of rural America. That is why I care \nabout this death tax debate: because of real people in real Iowa \ncommunities invested in expanding in those rural counties.\n  It is strange, in New York City, how many multimillionaires live in \nany one block in Manhattan. But those so-called multimillionaires seem \na little different when you check out the Iowa corn crop or you sit \ntogether at church or at a grandson's baseball game. They are, as the \npopular book says, ``The Millionaire Next Door.'' They are the pillars \nwho help hold up all those 99 counties that I visit every year.\n  I know these are not the kinds of stories that make the front pages \nof our big city newspapers. When family businesses are sold and shut \ndown or move out of the State or even move out of the United States, it \ncertainly makes the front pages of the newspapers that I really care \nabout. So when you hear about the number of estates affected, keep in \nmind to some extent that statistic is only a snapshot. The estate tax \nreturn is filed by the representative of a dead person. Those \nstatistics so often dwelled on by many of the proponents of the death \ntax do not capture the full picture. The statistic is only a look at \nthe dead person who owned the business or farm. It does not take into \naccount the dead person's family, the dead person's employees, the dead \nperson's neighbors. All of those folks are affected if the death tax \nburdens that family's business or farm and causes it to move on to some \nother owner and maybe out of the community.\n  There seems to be a strategy by the bicameral Democratic leadership \nto slow-walk a resolution of this vexing problem. The slow-walk \nstrategy will leave the American people with the current law, and that \ncurrent law is $1 million compared to the zero today or what we could \nhave as a compromise between the House and Senate: $3.5 million on the \none hand, $5 million on the other.\n\n[[Page S5049]]\n\n  The junior Senator from Vermont as always is passionate and \ntransparent about what he thinks and believes. He has said we should \nretain current law. His position is that $253 billion in revenue gained \nfrom current law is better spent by those of us in Washington, no doubt \nspent on what the junior Senator believes are valuable programs, \nprobably some programs that I support.\n  Should his view prevail, however, we will see the essence of the \neconomic policy of the Democratic leadership over the past 18 months. \nIt will be another income redistribution policy. The President defined \nit a couple of years ago. It will be a program designed to ``spread the \nwealth around.'' More taxes for those who have saved and sacrificed \nduring life, more spending on those who are demanding ever more \ngenerous tax-funded subsidies. That is basically what redistribution is \nall about. It is about folks in this city of Washington ``spreading the \nwealth around.''\n  I have heard rumors and read press reports that indicate that various \nSenators have a lot of company in the House and Senate Democratic \ncaucuses. For instance, maybe the position taken by the Senator from \nVermont might have that support. But those who share his view or views \nlike that have not been as transparent as the junior Senator from \nVermont, who is very transparent. You know exactly where he stands, and \nthat is an honorable position for any Senator to take. I say that even \nthough I disagree with him some.\n  The number of quiet supporters of the junior Senator from Vermont may \nbe high enough to prevent the Democratic leadership from allowing a \nclean vote on a bipartisan compromise. I believe that bipartisan \ncompromise is one of a $5 million exemption and a 35-percent tax rate \ncompared to the $3.5 million and 45 percent tax rate in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  The American people need to hear some data about how current law will \napply when it goes to that million-dollar exemption. They need to know \nwhere the revenue will come from. So we always go, around this Senate, \nto the Joint Committee on Taxation. That is a nonpartisan official \ncongressional scorekeeper on the issue of taxes--and all taxes. We need \nto also know about the number of affected estates.\n  Under current law it will be at least--can you believe it--at least \n10 times higher than what it would be under the Lincoln-Kyl bipartisan \ncompromise that I just described, the compromise that would cap the \ndeath tax rate at 35 percent. It would also provide that unified credit \nequivalent amount of about $5 million.\n  So here is that data from that nonpartisan Joint Committee on \nTaxation that you see right here. We are going to talk about current \nlaw, which is the tax law that is right now going to take effect in \n2011 if we do not do anything. That is going to arrive in just a little \nover 6 months.\n  Under current law, 44,000 estates will be taxable. Under the Lincoln-\nKyl compromise, 4,000 estates would be taxable. You can see here, for \nthe year 2011, Lincoln-Kyl, 4,000; current law, with a $1 million \nexemption, 44,400 estates. That is quite a big difference.\n  It means that current law, the path on which we seem to be slow-\nwalking, means 10 times the number of estates will be hit by the tax. \nThe Lincoln-Kyl compromise means that only the top 10 percent, the \nwealthiest estates, will be hit by the death tax.\n  If you project that out, as this chart does, 8 years of current law \nover the 10 years, you will find that roughly 616,000 estates will be \ntaxed over that period, and under the Lincoln-Kyl compromise, roughly \n54,000 estates would be taxable over that period of time.\n  To give everyone a bit of perspective, I wish to share some Iowa farm \ndata. It is from the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Under current law, \nin a bit over 6 months, with the $1 million exemption that is on the \nlaw now taking place, the line between a taxable farm and nontaxable \nfarm will be that $1 million.\n  The U.S. Department of Agriculture reports that there were 92,800 \nfarms covering 86 percent of Iowa in 2007. In 2007, the average Iowa \nfarm was 331 acres. According to a survey conducted by Iowa State \nUniversity in 2009, the average acre was worth $3,371. That means that \na farm the size of the 2007 Iowa average, at average 2009 prices in \nIowa, is going to be worth $1,446,801. In 2007, there were 19,302 Iowa \nfarms with 500 or more acres worth at least $2.1 million at average \n2009 prices. Now, keep in mind that farmers sometimes carry debt. That \nwould reduce the value of the farm. But, on the other hand, farmers \nhave other farm-related assets, such as the farm machinery to operate \nit, that are not included in the figures I just cited.\n  This data shows that the current-law estate tax could hit many Iowa \nfarmers. For those folks working the lands, this is an unwelcome \ncertainty. As I indicated earlier, the tax is an impediment to passing \non the family business--in this case, the family farm. Current-law \ndeath taxes, quietly supported by, apparently, many Members on the \nother side--and that is that $1 million figure--will act as an \nincentive to break down many family farms and small businesses. These \nfamily farms and small businesses form the economic backbone of their \nhard-working heartland communities.\n  What amazes me is the zeal by some to use tax policy to inflict this \nkind of damage on family farms and small businesses such as the two I \npointed out in Shenandoah, IA, and Sheffield, IA. All of this is \nsomehow supposed to fund an ever-expanding set of Federal benefits to \nmany who do not pay any income tax. The signal sent is that those who \nwork hard, save, and want to pass something on to their family exist \nsolely to fund these bloated Federal programs. So why work hard? Why \nsave? Why not work less? Why not go into debt and live beyond your \nmeans? In the end, the government levels everyone out at death by, as \nthe President said, ``spreading the wealth around.''\n  I have not touched on the damage being inflicted now by our inaction \non estate tax reform. At every townhall, I hear from folks--in fact, I \njust finished a half hour monthly television program I do back in the \nState of Iowa. And one of the callers called in: When are you going to \ndo something about the estate tax? Kind of embarrassing to tell him. I \ntold him to watch my speech that I was going to give just as soon as \nthe program is over. So here I am. But everybody at my townhalls--I \nhear from folks who ask these kinds of questions. They ask: What is the \nlaw going to be? Will it be retroactive? When will the Congress address \nthis action? Why delay?\n  Recently, I received a letter that was signed by 750 Iowa attorneys \nasking for a resolution of this issue. At a time when families are \ndealing with the emotional and financial stress of the death of a \nfamily member, why do we add this additional confusion and anxiety for \nthe family or for a counselor who cannot even advise his clients on \nwhat they should do in planning an estate?\n  I am afraid I do not have a good answer for these folks, just as a \nfew minutes ago on my television program I did not have an answer for \nthat person who called in from Pocahontas, IA, wanting to know what we \nare going to do about this. But we do need to get an answer. Hopefully, \nit is one that will be bipartisan, such as Lincoln-Kyl, and limits the \nreach of the death tax to at least the top 10 percent of the wealthiest \nestates. At the very least, we owe the American people an open and \nintellectually honest debate and votes up or down on a very fair \npolicy.\n  Resolving the estate tax nightmare with real reform is time-sensitive \ntax legislation business.
