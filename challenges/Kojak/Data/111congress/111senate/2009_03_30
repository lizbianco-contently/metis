Mr. President, 8 years ago, President Bush inherited from \nPresident Clinton a prosperous and a very strong nation with a \ntremendously powerful, growing economy. Our unemployment rate was at an \nexceptionally low rate of just over 4 percent. We had a budget surplus \nof about $130 billion. We were actually paying down the debt. For 3 \nyears, we paid down the debt by about half a trillion dollars.\n  President Bush and congressional Republicans inherited an economy \nthat was growing and lifting all Americans along with the growing \neconomy. Then Bush, Cheney, and the congressional Republicans set about \ndismantling the foundation of prosperity that built up over the years. \nThey slashed taxes for the super-rich based on the long-discredited \ntheory that these dollars would trickle down to the middle class and \npoor. They repealed or ignored oversight laws meant to protect our \nfinancial markets from manipulation and excess. They borrowed hundreds \nof billions of dollars to fight a war in Iraq marred by waste, fraud, \nand abuse. It took all of their 8 years in power, but George Bush, Dick \nCheney, and Republican allies here not only reversed the prosperity \nthey inherited but set us on the course of the worst economic crisis \nsince the Great Depression.\n  This January, President Obama inherited from President Bush an \nunemployment rate above 7 percent, and climbing, a Republican deficit \nof nearly $500 billion, and a national debt twice the level it was when \nhe took office. In the first weeks of his term, President Obama has \nshown exactly why our country entrusted him with the Presidency during \nthis hour of crisis. We inherited a Republican deficit of half a \ntrillion dollars. But with calm and determined leadership, President \nObama proposed an economic recovery plan that is now beginning to stem \nthe tide of job loss--especially jobs--and create new opportunity for \nworkers and small businesses in every corner of our country. He \nproposed a budget that focuses on long-term prosperity, in addition to \nnear-term recovery, by lowering taxes for working people, laying the \ngroundwork for cutting the Republican deficit in half, and investing in \nrenewable energy, health care, and education.\n  Over the past weeks, Members of Congress have taken a close look at \nthe President's budget and considered their own proposals to strengthen \nit further. As usual, Chairman Conrad has done an outstanding job. He \nhas brought Democrats and Republicans into the budget process and \nconsidered all proposals with equal weight. That is how we will \napproach this week ahead.\n  A piece of legislation this important to America's future requires us \nto move forward in a serious, productive, and inclusive manner. \nDemocrats have maintained all year that the best solutions to the \nchallenges we face come\n\n[[Page S3942]]\n\nwhen both parties seek and find common ground. The minority can play a \nmajor role in this process but only if they offer solutions, not sound \nbites.\n  We all recognize that reversing 8 years of Republican deficits and \nfiscal irresponsibility will take time. It will not happen overnight. \nWe may not know exactly when the recession will end, but I am confident \nthat passing the budget will hasten the day when recovery begins.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I have spoken to the two managers of the \nbill. As soon as Senator McConnell comes to the floor, they will turn \nthe floor over to him. He is coming, but he was detained on the way. So \nif the two managers will go ahead and start the bill, and when Senator \nMcConnell gets to the floor, he has a statement he wants to make, and \nthat will start the time counting.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, Americans have serious concerns about \nthis budget and the massive amount of spending, taxing, and borrowing \nit calls for right in the middle of a recession. They are also \nincreasingly concerned that Democratic leaders in Washington seem to be \nless and less straightforward about what we are actually doing here on \nCapitol Hill.\n  Americans were upset to learn that a provision was quietly dropped \nfrom the stimulus bill that would have kept taxpayer dollars from going \nto executives at failed financial firms. But they were equally upset at \nhow those bonuses came about--the language blocking them was quietly \nstripped from the bill in a closed conference room somewhere in the \nCapitol without anybody looking.\n  A few days after that, openness took another holiday on Capitol Hill \nwhen Democratic leaders announced new budget gimmicks that had the \neffect of concealing the true long-term costs of the administration's \n$3.6 trillion budget. And now questions about diminishing transparency \nrelate to the budget itself--a budget that almost makes the trillion-\ndollar stimulus bill look fiscally responsible by comparison.\n  Everyone knows that the national debt is already too high and that \nthis budget would cause that debt to balloon even more--doubling in 5 \nyears and tripling in 10. Yet, even with all that borrowing, the \nadministration still will not have enough money to pay for the massive \nexpansion of Government outlined in this budget. In order to cover the \ncost, they propose two things: a tax on income that hits small business \nvery hard and a new national energy tax that would hit every American \nhousehold and business.\n  But the Democratic budget writers had a problem: This new energy tax \nis deeply unpopular, and it is a serious job killer. According to some \nestimates, this tax could cost every American household up to $3,100 a \nyear just for doing the same things people have always done, such as \nturning on the lights and doing the laundry. It is also a tax on all \neconomic activity, from factory floors to front offices. This tax won't \njust hit American households, it will cost us jobs.\n  Another problem was that virtually all Republicans and a lot of \nDemocrats agree with most Americans that this new national energy tax \nis a terrible idea and that we can't afford it. Yet, without this tax, \nthere is just no other way for Democratic leaders to pay for all the \nnew Government programs the administration wants. The solution to the \nproblem was this: Democratic budget writers decided to use a rule that \nallows them to fast track legislation down the road, including \npotentially the new energy tax, without any input from Democrats and \nRepublicans who either have serious concerns about this tax or who \noppose it altogether.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee argues that this version of the \nbudget resolution doesn't allow this avenue for fast tracking \nlegislation on an energy tax, and that may be so. But we also know two \nthings: First, the language House budget writers have used in their \nbudget resolution leaves the door wide open to include the energy tax, \nand the Democrats need this tax as a slush fund to pay for all the new \nprograms the budget creates.\n  Some still argue that this fast-track process won't be used for the \nenergy tax. They must not be paying attention to the administration's \nbudget director, who says fast tracking the energy tax isn't off the \ntable. And they must not have been paying attention to our friend the \nmajority leader, who, to his credit, has been quite candid about the \nfact that the amount of money the administration needs for its health \ncare proposals is almost exactly what the administration says it can \nraise from a national energy tax. Americans don't need another $3,100 \nadded to their tax bill.\n  And just as worrisome is the method being used to ram this tax \nthrough Congress: lay the groundwork, keep it quiet, and rush it \nthrough with as little transparency and as little debate as possible.\n  If there is anything we have learned over the past few weeks, it is \nthat the American people want more people watching the store, not \nfewer. If the bonuses taught us anything at all, it is that Americans \nthink we should take more time, not less, when considering how to spend \ntheir money. If Democratic leaders intend to pay for all the \nadministration's programs with a new energy tax, they should say so \nnow, bring it to the full Senate, and let the people decide. Anything \nless on a policy shift of this magnitude betrays a troubling lack of \nstraightforwardness about the Democrats' plan for imposing a massive \nnew tax on the American people and American businesses.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the use of \ncalculators be permitted on the floor during consideration of the \nbudget resolution.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I know my colleague, Senator Gregg, the \nranking member, has a statement he would like to make, and so I will \nwithhold for his statement.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of the Senator \nfrom North Dakota, who is always extraordinarily courteous, \nprofessional, and generous. Before we begin the specific debate on the \nissue of the budget, which obviously we both have to be here for--and I \nknow he has a lot of things going on in North Dakota with the \nflooding--I would like to make a few remarks off topic.\n  (The further remarks of Mr. Gregg and Mr. Conrad are printed in \ntoday's Record under ``Morning Business.'')\n\n[[Page S3943]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I speak to the matter now before us on the \nfloor of the Senate, the budget.\n  I would like to start by pointing out what this President has \ninherited because this President, who has only been in office a few \nmonths, has inherited a series of crises almost unparalleled in our \ncountry's history. You think about it. Not only does he have a fiscal \ncrisis, he has a housing crisis, he has a financial crisis, he has two \nwars, and he has a legacy of debt that is truly stunning.\n  The debt more than doubled in the previous 8 years, the foreign \nholdings of U.S. debt tripled in the previous 8 years, and the \nPresident inherited an economy in recession for more than a year, an \neconomy which contracted by more than 6 percent in the last quarter of \nlast year. Of course, when that happens, deficit and debt soar. That is \nprecisely what has happened. In the last years, the deficit and debt \nhave skyrocketed. So this President walks into a very challenging \nsituation.\n  This shows what happened to just the Federal debt in the past years. \nIt went from $5.8 trillion to over $12 trillion. The way we do it, we \ndon't hold Presidents responsible for their first year because they are \ninheriting a situation. We don't hold George Bush responsible for the \nfirst year he was in office. He was working off the previous \nPresident's budget. And we do not hold this President responsible for \nthe first year because he inherits the previous President's budget. But \nthis is what happened in the previous 8 years: more than doubling of \nthe debt. Perhaps even more alarming, there was a tripling of foreign-\nheld debt.\n  President Bush, as we can see by this chart--it took 42 Presidents \n224 years to build up $1 trillion of foreign-held debt. President Bush, \nduring his period, ran up more than $2 trillion of foreign holdings of \nU.S. debt. Last year alone when we went to finance our debt, 68 percent \nof the funding came from foreign entities.\n  Some say that is a sign of strength. I don't share that view. To have \nthe Chinese be our biggest financier, to have Japan be No. 2, to have \nthem financing 68 percent of our newly issued debt--I don't think that \nis a sign of strength. I think it is a sign of vulnerability.\n  Not only did President Obama inherit those very tough fiscal \nsituations, he also inherited a country facing very dire economic \nconditions, with over 3.3 million private sector jobs lost in the last \n6 months alone.\n  You can see, going back to September, 300,000 jobs were lost. That \njumped up to almost 400,000 in October of 2008; in November of 2008, \nover 600,000 jobs lost. Then it approached almost 700,000 in December \nof 2008. In January of 2009 there were nearly 700,000 jobs lost; in \nFebruary of 2009, another almost 700,000 jobs lost.\n  We see the unemployment rate rose very dramatically, starting back in \nMarch of 2007, when it was just at about 4.4 percent. Then it started \nskyrocketing back in March of 2008. You can see it took off at a very \nrapid rate to a level of 8.1 percent in February of 2009.\n  This is much more than numbers on a poster. These are real people \nlosing their jobs--meaning their ability to hold on to their homes was \nthreatened, meaning their ability to provide for their families was \ndiminished. These people are wondering what comes next for them; what \nare we going to do that is going to make a difference in their lives.\n  We also see economic growth contracted very dramatically from the \nthird quarter of 2008, when there was a negative one-half of 1 percent \nof growth, to the fourth quarter of 2008 where the economy contracted \nat a rate of over 6 percent. That is the worst economic performance in \ndecades.\n  That is the situation this President inherited. But it is more than \nthat. He is inheriting record deficits; a doubling of the national \ndebt; the worst recession since the Great Depression; financial market \nand housing crises, as I indicated; 3.3 million jobs lost in the last 6 \nmonths; and on top of that, ongoing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  I have often thought of the crushing responsibility on the shoulders \nof this President, but he is equal to it. I can say, in meeting after \nmeeting I have had with him, one of the things that has always appealed \nto me about Barack Obama, now President Obama--not only is he a very \nsmart person, but he is remarkably calm.\n  Even in the face of great crisis, this President maintains a coolness \nunder fire. I find it very appealing and very reassuring that with all \nof these crises he is absolutely calm and he is very clear thinking. \nThat is what we need at this time.\n  So when the President came with major priorities in his budget, I \nthink many across America thought, those are exactly the right \npriorities. He is talking about reducing our dependence on foreign \nenergy, one of his three key priorities; excellence in education. If we \ndo not have the best education in the world, we are not going to be the \nstrongest country in the world; for very large major health care \nreform, because I think everyone understands that is the 800-pound \ngorilla. That is the thing that could swamp the boat, because we are \nspending $1 of every $6 in this economy on health care, and we are \nheaded for more than $1 of every $3 in this economy going to health \ncare if we stay on the current trend line. Clearly that is \nunsustainable and the President has called for major health care \nreform.\n  A continuation of middle-class tax cuts, the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. \nThe President added additional middle-class tax cuts in his budget. All \nthe while the President called for these major initiatives, but to do \nit and cut the deficit in half over the 5 years. We have tried our \nlevel best to meet the President's major priorities, understanding that \nwe were going to have to make some changes, because the Congressional \nBudget Office, who did their forecast of revenue available, had done \ntheir forecast several months after the President's forecast was done. \nIn the meantime, the situation, as I have already shown, had \ndeteriorated. So we were left with a circumstance in which we had $2.3 \ntrillion less to write a budget than did the President when he wrote \nhis.\n  When I say $2.3 trillion, I want to emphasize that. I am not talking \nabout ``million,'' I am not talking about ``billion,'' I am talking \nabout ``trillions'' of dollars. Trillions of dollars. A trillion \ndollars is 1,000 billion dollars; 1,000 billion dollars.\n  So when we say $2.3 trillion was lost in the forecast of revenue \navailable, that is a big deal. I was given the responsibility of \ntelling the President that we were faced with that very changed \ncircumstance, because the Congressional Budget Office does not report \nto the President, it reports to the Congress. So when we learned of \nthis very significant change, I and Chairman Spratt, the chairman of \nthe Budget Committee in the House, were given the responsibility to \nmeet with the President and to inform him of these very significant \nchanges.\n  As you can imagine, the President was not very happy. But I can tell \nyou he is a realist, and he understood immediately the implications. He \nunderstood immediately that we would have to make some changes in his \nbudget. But he asked us to preserve his key priorities, and that is \nwhat we have attempted to do.\n  Again, we need to reduce our dependence on foreign energy. I think \neveryone knows, or nearly everyone, that this is one of the major \nfundamental threats to the United States. Our dependence on foreign \nenergy, back in 1985, we imported 27 percent of the oil we use. By \n2008, that had increased to 57 percent of the oil we are using being \nimported from abroad, much of it from unstable parts of the world, some \nof them not very friendly to the United States.\n  So this poses a fundamental long-term economic and security threat to \nour country. The President has rightly identified, even though the \npressure is off right now because oil prices are way down, that this is \nsomething we have got to face up to if we are going to have a strong \nAmerica in the future.\n  So in this budget we have responded with a reserve fund that reduces \ndependence on foreign energy, creates green jobs, helps preserve the \nenvironment, and helps with high home energy costs. We do it through a \nreserve fund to accommodate legislation, to invest in clean energy, and \naddress global climate change.\n  We also provide the President's level of discretionary funding for \nthe Department of Energy for the year. We\n\n[[Page S3944]]\n\nbuild on the economic recovery package investments in renewable energy, \nefficiency, and conservation, low-carbon coal technology, and \nmodernizing the electric grid. That process had been started in the \neconomic recovery package. It is in the budget; critically important to \nthe economic future of the country.\n  In terms of a focus on excellence in education, there are lots of \nwarning signs out there that we are starting to lose the battle to be \nthe best educated people in the world. But what are the indications? \nHere is just one. We are now dramatically lagging China in producing \nengineers. You can see, in 1985, each of our countries produced about \nthe same number of engineers. We produced, each of us, about 75,000 \nengineers.\n  But look at what has happened since in the United States. The number \nof engineers we are producing has declined to about 65,000. Look at \nwhat has happened in China. They have increased from about 75,000 to \nmore than 440,000 engineers. Now, why is that important? I think we \nknow it is important because you have got to have engineers if you are \ngoing to be building a strong infrastructure. If you do not have a \nstrong infrastructure, you do not have a strong base for competition in \nthis globalized world economy.\n  We have done everything we can to capture the President's priority of \nemphasizing excellence in education. We generate economic growth and \njobs, prepare the workforce to meet the global economy, make college \nmore affordable, and improve student achievement. We do it with a \nhigher education reserve fund.\n  To facilitate the President's student aid increases, we extend the \nsimplified college tax credit providing up to $2,500 a year, and we \nalso focus on the President's requested level of $5,550 for Pell grants \nand fully fund his education priorities, such as early education.\n  Now, I was raised by my grandparents. My grandmother was a \nschoolteacher. She was five feet tall. We called her Little Chief. We \ncalled her Little Chief because she commanded respect. And in our \nfamily, she would tell us there are three priorities: Education is No. \n1. Education is No. 2. And education is No. 3.\n  I tell you, we got the message, my generation. I have 13 cousins. \nEvery one got advanced degrees. We were not a family of any special \nmeans, a middle-class family. But we understood that education was the \nway to secure a better future. She made it very clear to us that was \nthe expectation. We need to reemphasize excellence in education in this \ncountry.\n  But we also face an enormous challenge in health care. As I indicated \nin my opening remarks, $1 in every $6 in this economy is going for \nhealth care. This chart shows 16 percent of our GDP, and we have just \ngotten updated numbers that show now we are over 17 percent of our \ngross domestic product going to health care. If we stay on the current \ntrend line, by 2050, 37 percent of our gross domestic product will be \ngoing for health care. That is utterly unsustainable. It is the biggest \nthreat to our long-term deficits and debt. It is the biggest threat to \nour economic competitive position. It is the biggest threat to the \neconomic viabilities of families and companies and communities. So this \nis something that must be addressed.\n  President Obama has called for major health care reform, and we have \nsought to preserve that priority in the budget resolution. We invest in \nhealth care in an attempt to bend the health care cost curve to save \nmoney, reduce long-term costs, reduce the buildup of deficits and debt, \nalso to improve health, to expand coverage, to increase research, and \npromote food and drug safety.\n  We do it in three fundamental ways. First, a reserve fund to \naccommodate the President's initiative to reform the health care \nsystem. What does a reserve fund mean? It means simply this: The \ncommittees of jurisdiction are given full flexibility to write \nlegislation to accomplish the President's goals. But they have certain \nrequirements, and the requirement is that they pay for what they \nproduce, that it be deficit neutral.\n  The administration has said all along, that is their intention, and \nwe try to match that intention in this budget. The reserve fund also \naddresses Medicare physician payments. It is already scheduled in law \nthat doctors will take very significant reductions. We do not want to \nsee that happen. So, again, we are saying to the committees of \njurisdiction: Fix it and pay for it. Fix it and pay for it, because we \ncannot add to the deficit and debt to do it.\n  Finally, we continue to invest in key health care programs such as \nthe National Institutes of Health and the Food and Drug Administration.\n  On defense, which is always of great interest in terms of a budget \nresolution, we actually provided $45 billion more in funding for \ndefense than President Bush's final defense plan. You can see the final \ndefense plan of President Bush is this red block. The hatch lines here \nare the additional funding we have provided over the years 2010 to \n2013, because that is as far as the Bush defense plan goes. We provided \n$45 billion more. Frankly, President Obama came forward and said: Look, \nlet us more honestly account for war costs than has previously been \ndone. In the previous administration, all too often they did not put in \nthe budget funding for war. This President did, and we do in the budget \nresolution.\n  Now, the President also gave us a charge to cut the deficit by more \nthan half over the 5 years of the budget resolution. You can see that \nwe have done, that this year we project the deficit at $1.7 trillion \nunder this budget resolution, and we step it down every year. We will \nreduce it by $500 billion the first year, by $300 billion the second \nyear, by another $300 billion the third year, by a little bit the \nfourth year, and by another about $60 billion the final year, to get \ndown to $508 billion. That is a reduction of more than two-thirds over \nthe 5 years, as a share of gross domestic product, which is what the \neconomists like to look at, because that takes out the effect of \ninflation.\n  You can see we are reducing the deficits from 12.2 percent of gross \ndomestic product in 2009, down to less than 3 percent in 2014. That is \nthe magic goal, less than 3 percent of gross domestic product. Because \nat that level the economists tell us you stabilize the growth of the \ndebt. That is the goal the President set, getting down to 3 percent of \nGDP or less in a deficit in the fifth year, and we beat that goal by a \nlittle bit.\n  There has been a lot of talk about the spending in this budget \nresolution. I want to make clear here is what happens. The spending \nagain is a share of gross domestic product. Again the economists say \nthat is the most fair comparison over time because it takes out the \neffect of inflation. You can see in 2009, we are spending 27.6 percent \nof GDP in this budget. That is a very high level historically. And, of \ncourse, the reason for it is the tremendous economic downturn, the need \nto provide stimulus to the economy, to provide lift. So spending is at \na high level as a share of the gross domestic product in 2009.\n  You can see each and every year we step it down until 2012, and then \nbasically it stays at that level for 2013, 2014, at about 22 percent of \nGDP. So we are going from 27.6 percent of GDP this year to 24.5 percent \nin 2010, down to 23.3 in 2011, and then basically stabilize at 22 \npercent of GDP through 2014, again getting down to our target of a \ndeficit of less than 3 percent of GDP in the fifth year.\n  Again, on spending, to go into some additional detail, breaking down \ndiscretionary spending, as you know, in the budget we have mandatory \nspending, things such as Social Security and Medicare. Those are \nmandatory programs, mandatory in the sense that if you qualify, the \nFederal Government pays for what you have coming. Discretionary \nprograms are programs that are open for the Appropriations Committee to \nadjust every year. If we look at the discretionary side of our budget, \nwe can see, on defense, we are providing the full request by the \nPresident, a 3.8-percent increase. Internationally, we are not \nproviding the President's full request because of the diminished \nresources available to us. So we cut the President's request by $4 \nbillion. We are still providing an increase of almost 18 percent. Why \nare we giving such a large increase to international accounts? The \nreason is quite simple. We are engaged in two wars.\n\n  The Secretary of State called me the weekend before this weekend at \nhome. The Secretary of Defense called me at\n\n[[Page S3945]]\n\nhome. Both delivered the same message. They were a little unhappy, \ndisappointed that I was cutting international accounts by $4 billion \nfrom the President's request. They emphasized the importance of these \nincreases because what has been done before is to make supplemental \nrequests outside the budget. This President said no more of that. We \nare going to be direct. We are going to be open in the money we are \nrequesting. These funds are needed to deal with Iraq and Afghanistan \nand Pakistan and other threats we are facing around the world.\n  Interestingly, I have never before, in my 22 years in the Budget \nCommittee, had the Secretary of Defense call me to support the budget \nfor the State Department. Why would the Secretary of Defense call me \nand ask me to increase what I have provided for in the international \naccounts? He told me: There is a lot that is being spent out of the \nDefense Department budget that should be spent out of the State \nDepartment budget for activities in Afghanistan and Iraq. President \nObama has put those categories of spending where they belong, and it \nought to be supported. Of course, I have great respect for them both. I \nhad to tell them: When you lose $2.3 trillion, you have to make a lot \nof changes to make it add up. So I felt compelled to reduce these \naccounts from the President's request.\n  Domestic spending, we increase by 6 percent. The President asked for \nmore in that category. Again, we simply could not make the numbers work \nwithout making reductions.\n  So the total in this area, $1.03 trillion, is from last year. This \nyear it is $1.08 trillion, for a combined increase in discretionary \nspending of 5.3 percent. We can see on nondefense discretionary, that \ncombines international and domestic, we are giving a 7-percent \nincrease. The President asked for over 10 percent. Again, I know there \nare people who are disappointed. I am sorry, but my responsibility is \nto deal with the reality with which I am presented. The reality I was \npresented with was $2.3 trillion less in revenue. I have had to make \nreductions in the discretionary accounts. I have had to make reductions \nin mandatory accounts. I have had to make changes on the tax side of \nthe ledger in order to get the deficit down to a sustainable level.\n  Revenue changes in the budget resolution: I have heard some say we \nhave all these tax increases. That is not what the Congressional Budget \nOffice says, when they look at my budget and look at all the proposals \nand compare it to current law. They conclude that I am providing $825 \nbillion of tax reduction. That is a different story than we hear coming \nfrom some quarters. That is not my claim. This is what the \nCongressional Budget Office finds when they look at my budget and \ncompare it to current law. Why the difference? First, we have extended \nall the middle-class tax relief provided in 2001 and 2003; \nspecifically, the 10-percent bracket, the child tax credit, the \nmarriage penalty relief. All that is continued in this budget, as well \nas education incentives. On top of that, alternative minimum tax reform \ncosts $216 billion to prevent 24 million Americans from being subjected \nto the alternative minimum tax. We also have estate tax reform; estate \ntax reform at $3.5 million an individual, $7 million a couple. Those \npeople who have estates of less than that amount will pay zero in \nestate tax. Over 99 percent of the estates in America will pay zero, \nnothing, not a penny. That is a reform that needed to be made. It is \nincluded in this budget. The President called for it, and we have \nadopted it.\n  We also have a series of business provisions and the so-called tax \nextenders, things that need to be adjusted every year. We do it in this \nbudget for a subtotal of tax relief of $958 billion. We have an offset \nto that, certain loophole closures, shutting down abusive tax havens, \nabusive tax shelters, offshore tax dodges that will raise $133 billion \nfor total tax cuts of $825 billion.\n  In the President's budget, he has recommended that we not continue \nall the tax relief contained in the 2001 and 2003 acts for people \nearning over $250,000 a year. We have adopted that recommendation in \nthis budget. All of the middle-class tax relief from 2001 and 2003 is \nhere. It is funded. It is provided for.\n  In addition, the President called for additional tax reductions for \nmiddle-class people, the so-called make work pay provisions. Two years \nof that is already funded in the economic recovery package. So that \nwill continue for the next 2 years. The President wanted to make that \nprogram permanent. Again, we could not do that in light of the new \nforecast. So we have provided that those make work pay provisions can \nbe extended, if they are paid for. They will continue for the next 2 \nyears, but after that, if they were to be extended, they would have to \nbe paid for.\n  We also provide for important budget enforcement in the budget \nresolution. We have discretionary caps for 2009 and 2010. We maintain a \nstrong pay-go rule. We have a point of order against long-term deficit \nincreases, a point of order against short-term deficit increases. We \nallow reconciliation for deficit reduction only, which was the original \npurpose of reconciliation. We provide a point of order against \nmandatory spending on an appropriations bill; no backdoor stuff that \nused to go on, people raiding the Federal Treasury by coming in here \nand changing mandatory spending on an appropriations bill.\n  The budget resolution also addresses our long-term fiscal challenges \nin these ways. No. 1, we have the health reform reserve fund. That is \nabsolutely the key element to dealing with our long-term buildup of \ndeficits and debt. That is the part of our spending that is absolutely \nout of control. The only way to get it back under control is \nfundamental health care reform which is provided for in this budget on \na deficit-neutral basis. We also have program integrity initiatives to \ncrack down on waste, fraud and abuse and a long-term deficit increase \npoint of order to require 60 votes to increase the deficit long term.\n  President Obama has said this about the need for further work on our \nlong-term fiscal situation. Let me be clear: The first 5 years--this \nbudget is a 5-year budget--we do quite a good job, a credible job of \ngetting the deficit down. We reduce it by more than two-thirds. We get \nit down to less than 3 percent of GDP. But the second 5 years of the \nPresident's plan, even if we extended our budget for 5 years, is going \nto require much more effort. We are on an unsustainable course for the \nlong term. In the next 5 years, I think we have done a credible job of \nmoving in the right direction, reducing the deficit by two-thirds. But \nbeyond the 5 years, we have big problems on the horizon.\n  The start in this budget to deal with it is health care reform \nbecause it is the 800-pound gorilla. But it is going to take more than \nthat. It is also going to take tax reform because we have a tax system \nthat is hemorrhaging to these offshore tax havens, abusive tax shelters \nand, frankly, a system that is very inefficient at collecting the \nrevenue that is due. If we collected the money that is due under the \ncurrent Tax Code, we would have no structural deficit. We wouldn't need \nany tax increase. If we just collected the money that is due under the \ncurrent tax levels, we would have no structural deficit. The problem \nis, we aren't collecting the money that is due under the current code. \nWe are only collecting about 75 percent of what is due. A big reason \nfor that is the explosion of offshore tax havens, abusive tax shelters, \nthe tax gap. All those things are rendering the tax system very \nineffective.\n  The President recognizes the need for further action to address the \nlong-term fiscal imbalance as well. He said:\n\n       Now, I want to be very clear. While we are making important \n     progress towards fiscal responsibility this year, in this \n     budget, this is just the beginning. In the coming years, \n     we'll be forced to make more tough choices, and do much more \n     to address our long-term challenges.\n\n  That is the truth. We are going to have to do much more in those \nyears beyond the 5 years of this budget.\n  Finally, I would like to address the question of a 5-year budget \nversus a 10-year budget. The President sent us a 10-year budget. We \nhave written a 5-year budget. Some have said that is an attempt to \nconceal the effect of the second 5 years. The President sent us a 10-\nyear budget. It has been fully scored by the Congressional Budget \nOffice. There is no hiding of anything. The President provided us a 10-\nyear budget. I was critical of the previous administration for not \nproviding a 10-year budget because I was concerned they\n\n[[Page S3946]]\n\nwere hiding the effect of their tax cuts in the second 5 years. This \nPresident has made no attempt to conceal his 10-year plan. He sent it \nto us. It has been scored by the Congressional Budget Office. We know \nwhat it is.\n\n  But Congress, when it writes budgets, has almost always written a 5-\nyear budget. In fact, of the 34 budgets Congress has written under the \nBudget Act, 30 have been 5-year budgets. Why? Because the projections \nfor year 6 through year 10, the projections for revenues and \nexpenditures for years 6 through 10, have been woefully inaccurate. \nThey have been notoriously unreliable. But never have I seen them more \nunreliable than right now. That's because of the extraordinary \nuncertainty we're facing in the near term. Inaccuracies in the \nforecasts for the next several years will compound into huge \ndifferences in years 6 through 10.\n  So we wrote a 5-year budget that fully discloses the spending and \nrevenue for the 5 years. We did not write a 10-year budget. Congress \nalmost never has. But the President did. And the President's 10-year \nplan is fully disclosed.\n  We have done our level best to make changes that were necessary in \nwhat the President sent us in order to address his key priorities and \nat the same time to reduce the deficit in the way that he called for \nand to reach a deficit that was less than 3 percent of GDP in the fifth \nyear.\n  I am proud of what we have done. Is it a perfect document? The work \nof men and women is never perfect. We are flawed. I will confess to \nthat. To me, the greatest flaw is we still have not fully coped with \nthe long-term deficit and debt challenge to this country. Much more \nwill have to be done.\n  Senator Gregg and I have one proposal. We have a proposal for a task \nforce that would require Members of Congress and the administration--16 \nof them--to be given a responsibility to come up with a plan to get our \nlong-term deficit and debt condition in order. If 12 of the 16 could \nagree, that plan would come to Congress for a vote.\n  I believe it is going to take some special effort, some special \nstructure to deal with these long-term deficits and debt threats. I \nwant to say for myself, I do believe the long-term debt accumulation \ndoes fundamentally threaten the economic security of America. While we \nhave a good start in this first 5 years, much more must be done.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for this time.\n  I will yield the floor.\n  Before I do it, I thank Senator Gregg, the ranking member of the \nBudget Committee. There are many policy issues that divide us. There \nare some where we are joined at the hip. But Senator Gregg has been a \nthorough professional in all of the work of the Budget Committee this \nyear. His staff is outstanding as well. I recognize Senator Gregg as \nsomebody who has credibility. He may say some things that are somewhat \nuncharitable about the budget I am presenting today. I understand that. \nThat is his job. He has strong feelings, and I applaud him for them \nbecause that is what we need. If everybody in the room thinks the same \nthing, nobody is thinking very much. I will tell you one thing, Senator \nGregg is thinking. He cares deeply about the economic future of this \ncountry, and he is doing his level best to get us on a path that makes \nmore sense. I applaud him for it. But I would be remiss if I did not \nrecognize the professionalism and leadership he has exhibited in the \nwork of the Budget Committee this year. In no way does that mean he \nendorses this plan. He will make very clear he does not. He strongly \ndisagrees, as is his right. But I do want to recognize the very good \nworking relationship we enjoy.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Akaka). The Senator from North Dakota, Mr. \nConrad, yields the floor.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me first thank the chairman for his generous comments, and let me \nsecond those relative to himself and his staff.\n  We obviously have a deep difference of opinion as to the best way to \nproceed relative to shepherding the financial house of our Nation, and \nespecially specifically relative to this budget that has been sent to \nus by this President. But I have an immense amount of respect for him \nand his staff, who are professional and extremely courteous, and we \nhave a great personal and working relationship, which actually makes \nthe job much more enjoyable as a result of that.\n  And, of course, we send to North Dakota our deep concerns about what \nthey are going through with the floods. I know the Senator was out \nthere this weekend supporting the folks who are working so hard to try \nto protect their communities--an amazing story: 80,000 volunteers in a \ntown of 90,000. It is very impressive. Let's hope the waters recede \nbefore they do any more damage.\n  I should mention that UNH beat North Dakota in the hockey game this \nweekend in the NCAA. I noticed my colleague from North Dakota did not \nactually mention that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, if I could say, our hockey team lost to \nhis hockey team in the last one-tenth of 1 second. I say to the \nSenator, our Congressman in North Dakota said: We don't want the flood \nfight to have the same outcome.\n  Mr. GREGG. Nor do we.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We don't want to have won this right to the end and then \nlose it at the end. So even the hockey game has provided inspiration \nfor the flood fight. We wish we had won the hockey game, but it is most \nimportant that we win the flood fight.\n  Mr. GREGG. It was an exciting game, and North Dakota played \nextraordinarily well.\n  Mr. President, we do differ on this budget. The budget that has been \nproposed by the President of the United States has essentially been \ngiven its stamp of approval by what has been brought forward by the \nSenator from North Dakota. There are virtually no differences. As \nDirector Orszag said, they are 98 percent the same, and they are.\n  This budget, in our opinion, represents a clear and present danger to \nthe financial health of our Nation and to the financial security of our \nchildren. It is a budget which spends far too much money, taxes far too \nmuch, and borrows an extraordinary amount--it is clearly far too much. \nIt basically repeals the essential laws of common sense--the essential \nlaws of common sense--that say you cannot simply keep spending at a \nrate that you cannot afford to pay for forever and not have to suffer \nas a society, and suffer significantly.\n  Margaret Thatcher sort of captured the tempo of this budget. To \nparaphrase her, she might have said about this budget: The problem with \nthe Obama budget is that at some point you run out of money.\n  If you follow the proposals of this budget, you are going to run out \nof money sooner rather than later. In order to understand this budget, \nyou have to understand the dramatic nature of this budget. \nHistorically, when we have debated budgets in this body, they have been \nimportant because they obviously represent guideposts for our Congress, \nbut they have not been a philosophical document that has redirected the \nNation fundamentally.\n  On the part of the President--I give him credit that he is not trying \nto hide this--his budget openly attempts to redirect the Government of \nthe United States and move it significantly, dramatically to the left, \nexpanding the role of the Government in all sorts of areas, expanding \nthe cost of Government in a historic way, and expanding the burden of \nthe Government in the area of taxes and in the area of borrowing in a \nway which we have never contemplated as a nation.\n  To try to put it into perspective, under the budget prepared by the \nPresident and sent up here--and it is essentially the same as the \nbudget we are receiving from the Senate Democrats today--the \nPresident's budget doubles the national debt in 5 years. That is pretty \nbad. Then it triples the national debt in 10 years. And that \nis intolerable.\n\n  Now, I have tried to figure out how you explain to people what $1 \ntrillion or what $15 trillion is or what $17 trillion is. It is very \nhard. Conceptually, it is extraordinarily difficult to get your hands \naround what $1 trillion is.\n  As you can see, I had this chart made up when the original estimate \nwas $15 trillion--it went up to $17 trillion--to\n\n[[Page S3947]]\n\nshow the number of zeros here. It is a staggering amount of money that \nis being added to the Federal debt. You have to ask yourself: Who is \ngoing to pay all this money? This is real money. It has been spent on \nprograms the President wants. Who is going to pay it all? Who is going \nto pay $15 trillion--with all of these zeros?\n  Well, unfortunately, our children and our children's children get \nthat debt. It gets put on their backs. At the end of the President's \nbudget, the average household in this country will owe $130,000 in debt \nfor the Federal Government--$130,000. They will have an interest \npayment on this debt--the average household--of over $6,000. So the \ndebt they are getting may actually exceed the value of their house.\n  Put another way--which was first coined by my esteemed chairman--he \ndesigned this wall of debt. This is the wall of debt, as shown on this \nchart. This is what the Federal debt does over the period of the Obama \nbudget. It goes straight up. It is a massive wall of debt, which is an \nincredible burden on our Nation, and really an unacceptable burden if \nyou are going to be accurate about it.\n  To try to put it in a more understandable term, as shown on this \nchart: This is a picture of President Obama, of course, on the right \nside of the chart. On the left side of the chart are pictures of all \nthe Presidents we have had in our Nation since our Nation began 232 \nyears ago, starting with George Washington and going through George W. \nBush.\n  In that period, from George Washington through people such as \nMadison, Adams, Lincoln, Grant, Hayes, Wilson, Roosevelt the first, \nRoosevelt the second, Truman--in this period from George Washington all \nthe way through George W. Bush, we have accumulated about $5.8 trillion \nof national debt. That is how much those Presidents added to our \nnational debt.\n  Within the first 5 years of this Presidency, President Obama will add \nmore debt on the backs of our people and our Nation than all these \nPresidents put together. Within 5 years, he will have taken the total \ndebt put on the backs of Americans and doubled it since the country \nbegan--a staggering fact.\n  Now, does this have to happen, the addition of all this debt because \nof the fact that he has inherited a terrible situation? And he has, and \nwe all admit to that; this economy is in a very difficult way. No, it \ndoes not. Yes, in the short term there has to be a government that is \nrun at a deficit in a very significant way in order to try to get the \neconomy going because we all understand the Federal Government is, \nright now, the only liquid entity around here. So the money is being \npumped into the economy to try to give it some lift.\n  But this recession is not going to go on forever. We are a resilient \nnation. We will recover from this recession. It will be over hopefully \nsooner rather than later. But it certainly is not going to run that \nmuch longer in the terms of this Presidency. Certainly, by the midterm \nof this Presidency, we should be out of this recession.\n  So you would presume--you would presume--at that point, say, in 2011 \nor 2012 at the latest, the spending of the Government and the deficit \nof the Government would start to come under control, that there would \nbe some attempts to bring it down and manage it in a more historic way.\n  Unfortunately, that does not happen under this budget. What the \nPresident is proposing is that we continue to grow the size of \nGovernment at an extraordinary rate, independent of whether we are in a \nrecession. The average deficit over the term of this President's budget \nis $1 trillion a year--$1 trillion a year. That is a staggering number. \nTo put it in a historical context, that adds up to about 5 to 6 percent \nof gross domestic product, and historically the deficit has been about \n2 percent of gross domestic product. At the end of this Presidency, the \npublic debt, which is what people own outside the Government, will be \n80 percent of the productivity of the country--80 percent of the \nproductivity of the country. What does that mean, 80 percent of the \nproductivity of the country? Well, historically, the public debt has \nbeen about 40 percent of the productivity of the country, but under \nthis President, he is going to take that public debt very quickly up to \n60 percent, then to 70 percent, and then, by the end of the period of \nthe budget proposed, it will be at 80 percent. That is such a high \nnumber, when you couple it with the deficits of $1 trillion a year, \nthat you get to a point where it is simply not sustainable. That is why \nthis budget is a clear and present danger to the fiscal health of this \nNation and to the opportunities of our children. In fact, ironically, \nif the United States were to try to seek membership into the European \nUnion--which, of course, we have no interest in doing, but those are \nall industrialized nations and they do have a standard for operating \ntheir governments in a responsible way. The standard of the European \nUnion is, public debt can't exceed 60 percent of Gross Domestic \nProduct, that deficits can't exceed 3 percent of GDP. We will be twice \nthat number, and it is not sustainable.\n\n  Now, did this have to happen? Did the President have to run up these \ndebts? If we had stayed on a pure glidepath and done nothing--in other \nwords, operated the Government as it is--as it is--this blue line would \nbe the cost of the Government. We would actually almost be in balance \nby the year 2018. That is current law. Now, CBO uses very arcane rules \nas to how it builds a baseline, but it is the baseline that we \ndetermine as a Congress to use. I wouldn't accept that baseline as a \nrecipe for future policy because there are some tax increases in there \nI don't like, but even if you were to factor out the tax increases, the \nline would come in the middle here. The reason this goes up so \nsignificantly, the reason President Obama's budget goes up so \nsignificantly in its deficits is because they propose a radical \nincrease in spending. It is pretty much that simple. It is not about \neconomics or taxes; it is about spending. Essentially, the President's \nproposal is to incredibly increase the size of the Federal Government \nand the amount it spends, not only in the short run, which we all \naccept is necessary--although it has been poorly handled relative to \nthe stimulus bill; worse than poorly handled, it has been a waste of \nmoney relative to the stimulus bill--but this is the spike in spending \nto reflect the deficit and the attempt to address it through the \nstimulus bill. But look here: After we are out of the recession in the \nyear 2011, the line keeps on going way up--way up--to 25 percent of GDP \nby the end of this budget.\n  Well, you say, what does that mean, 25 percent of GDP. Well, how big \na government is relative to the productivity of the economy defines how \nproductive the economy will be. You can't have a productive economy if \nthe Government is taking out all the money. It doesn't work very well. \nHistorically, we as a country have tried to keep--and this is the black \nline here, and you will see it has been very level ever since the year \n1958--this is the average, this black line, of how much spending the \nGovernment has done. It is around 20 percent of GDP, the product of the \nUnited States. Under the Obama years, as proposed by President Obama, \nthat is going to be increased at a staggering rate--huge increases in \nspending.\n  President Obama is not trying to hide this. He has not tried to be--\nhe has been very open about it. He said, to paraphrase him, \nessentially: I believe we create more prosperity by expanding the size \nof Government in a number of areas. In fact, if you listen to the \nSenator from North Dakota, he listed all these areas they are going to \nexplode the size of Government in, moving it dramatically to the left, \nand increasing it at an incredible rate. In the budget document he \nsent, he said exactly that. He said: At this particular moment, \nGovernment must lead the way in providing the short-term boost \nnecessary to lift us from a recession that is severe and lay the \nfoundation for prosperity.\n  He went on to say he intended to do this by spending a great deal of \nmoney on his priorities, which were clean energy, education, health \ncare, and new infrastructure. However, he doesn't stop spending the \nmoney after this recessionary period; he keeps it going into the \noutyears at a rate which is not sustainable. It is simply not \nsustainable. You can't take the money from the productive side--from \nthe people who are working and producing jobs and taking risks and \ngoing out there and actually producing wealth for this Nation, in the \nsense that they are actually producing something we have to\n\n[[Page S3948]]\n\nsell and use in trade and basically create jobs as a result of that--\nyou can't take the money from them and move it over to the Government \nat a rate that exceeds the historical norm at this level and expect you \nare going to be able to maintain prosperity for the years to come. It \ndoesn't work. It does not work. As Margaret Thatcher says, you \neventually run out of money.\n  The effect of this massive increase in spending is a massive increase \nin debt. This is the national debt, publicly held debt, which I \ndiscussed before, as a percentage of GDP. It averages about 36 percent \nsince 1958. That is the black line right here. It has been up, it has \nbeen down, but that is the average. Under President Obama's plan, it \ngoes straight through the roof, and this, I say to my colleagues, is \nthe threat. This is the threat. This is the clear and present danger to \nour people, to our Nation, and to our children's future, because when \nyou get debt up to that level, you are not able to function as a \ngovernment. People get concerned about buying your bonds and buying \nyour dollars and using your currency.\n  You don't have to listen to me to find out that is the case. The \nChinese Government has made that very clear, and they happen to be the \nbiggest holder of our dollars. In fact, the chairman is always talking \nabout how outrageous it is that the Chinese own so much of our debt. \nWell, they own it because they considered it to be a good investment, \nand if they didn't own it, we would be paying a lot more in interest \npayments and in taxes in this country and our dollar would be less \nvaluable. But Mr. Zhou, the governor of the central bank in China, has \nsaid he is getting concerned about this crisis and about the value of \nour dollar. The Premier of China said: ``We lent such huge funds to the \nUnited States and, of course, we are concerned about the security of \nour assets.''\n  Well, it is disconcerting and obviously not very nice to find out for \nus as a nation--one that has always considered itself to be a \nreasonably independent and strong Nation, the most independent and \nstrongest in the world--that the Premier of China, who owns most of our \ndebt outside the United States, is worried about it.\n  Why is he worried about it? Why are the Chinese worried about it? Why \nare the other nations which buy our debt worried about it? Because they \nlook at this line, they look at this budget. This isn't done in a \nvacuum. They know what this budget proposes. The President's budget \nproposes massive increases in spending but absolutely no fiscal \ndiscipline. It has discretionary spending jumping by $1.4 trillion--\ntrillion--it has mandatory spending, a net mandatory spending increase, \nas it was sent up here, of $1.1 trillion, and it has zero savings in \nthe core accounts, which are mandatory accounts. That leads to these \nmassive debts.\n  It also has, interestingly enough, $1.5 trillion in new taxes. Now, \nthat is a pretty staggering figure in and of itself, $1.5 trillion. I \nwas entertained to hear my colleague from North Dakota say: Well, \nactually, we get a tax cut in this bill. That is going to come as a \nreal surprise to all the people whose taxes are going to go up very \nsignificantly as a result of this budget. For small business people, \ntaxes are going to go up dramatically as a result of this budget. \nPeople who take charitable deductions and homeowner deductions in the \nhigher brackets, their taxes are going to go up, which will probably \naffect charitable giving under this bill.\n  But the most insidious tax proposed in this budget is something \neuphemistically called a carbon tax. Well, what is a carbon tax? That \nis a way to bury a term so you never understand what they are doing.\n  A carbon tax is literally a new national sales tax on your electric \nbills, a brand new national sales tax. We don't have a national sales \ntax in this country. What is being proposed in this budget by this \nPresident is a brand new national sales tax on your electric bill. So \nevery time you hit your light switch in your house, you are going to \nget hit with a new tax--a sales tax--and it is a big one. It is a big \none. The White House sent this specious estimate of it. They said it \nwas $646 billion, but that was low-balling the number. MIT, which \ndoesn't have a dog in this fight, took a look at a similar proposal, \nalong with a number of other groups, and they said it would actually \ngenerate over $300 billion in new taxes every year. It works out to \nabout $3,000 per household. So everybody living in America today who \nhas an electric bill or other energy bills, as a result of this new \nnational sales tax, if the President gets what he wants, is going to \npay $3,000 more in taxes a year, on average, for their energy bills. \nThat is a huge tax, and it is an incredibly regressive tax. I saw this \nchart that the chairman brought up, saying we are going to create green \njobs. That is all about this energy tax, by the way. That is akin to \ncalling it a carbon tax; they are going to call it creating green jobs. \nWhat are they going to call the jobs they are sending overseas? Because \nindustries in this country, which have to use a lot of electricity--\nthose are the hard-core industries that we still have in this country--\ncan no longer compete because they got hit with this massive increase \nin taxes on their energy production and use. What are they going to \ncall those jobs? Green jobs sent overseas? The simple fact is, this \ntype of tax increase is incredibly regressive. Sales taxes are \nregressive by definition, but a sales tax that is targeted on the \nproductive side of the ledger, as this one is, is exceptionally \nregressive, as is the dramatic increases in taxes on small businesses \nin this country.\n\n  Now, my colleague has said a number of things about how their budget \nis different from the President's. It is a little bit different, but it \nis 98 percent the same, and that is the score. I think I have a chart \nwhich reflects that. This is the difference between the two budgets. \nThey are identical on discretionary for all intents and purposes, \nidentical on outlays, identical on revenues. Interestingly enough, \nhowever, CBO came back and gave us--CBO is the Congressional Budget \nOffice--an honest evaluation of the President's budget, and some of the \nthings they said, which hopefully scared a few people around here, were \nthat the President's budget increased deficit spending by $9.2 trillion \nover 10 years, $2.3 trillion more than what the President had told us; \nthat on an annual basis, it averages out to a budget deficit of about \n$1 trillion a year, and that the percent of public debt jumps, as I \nhave mentioned, but it needs to be reemphasized that it jumps from what \nit is today to 80 percent of GDP. The deficits jump to 5 or 6 percent \nof GDP.\n\n  The administration has had both the Treasury Secretary and the OMB \nDirector up here over the years--the OMB Director has been coming up \nhere for years but the Treasury Secretary just recently--testifying \nthat the deficits in excess of 3 percent weren't sustainable. They said \nthat; we didn't say that.\n  So when CBO honestly evaluated their budget and did things such as \nactually calculate the fact that there was 8.1 percent unemployment, \nand it is probably going to go up and, as the President said, the top \nrate would be 8.1 percent, but we weren't there yet--when CBO put the \nreal numbers onto the President's numbers and got these massive \nincreases in spending and in debt, well, these folks decided that we \ncannot have that. They wanted to get that back down to 3 percent. Did \nthey do it by reducing spending or reducing any of the President's \nspending initiatives? No. Zero. Do you know how they did it? They did \nit by playing the old-fashioned games around here of smoke and mirrors \nand hiding the ball, saying one thing but meaning another.\n  The President, to his credit, and to the credit of Mr. Orszag, was \nforthright in their budget, which was probably as close to an honest \nstatement--with exception of the defense number--of what was really \nhappening here relative to spending and what was going to happen as we \nhave had in a long time. I congratulated them for that and still do. \nBut we went backward with this proposal from the Democratic leadership. \nSo that they could get it below 3 percent as a percentage of GDP and \nget their deficit and debt numbers down, they left out of their budget \n$1.1 trillion of spending and taxes that President Obama had in his. \nThey are not different, so it is just games. They didn't score their \nbudget correctly or honestly or straightforward. Their budget becomes \nthe ``tax too much, spend too much, borrow too much, and now hide too \nmuch'' budget. At least the President's budget wasn't a ``hide too \nmuch'' budget, although his defense number has serious problems\n\n[[Page S3949]]\n\nwith it. At least he didn't take $1.1 trillion in very illusory action, \nmoving the shell around so that you cannot find the real numbers, \nclaiming they made real savings in those accounts. It is actually just \npretty ridiculous to take that step backward.\n  Of course, they now claim that they cut the deficit in half. Now, \nthat is where we depart from common sense. There are a lot of things on \nwhich they tried to repeal the law of common sense in their budget, but \nthis is the most outrageous. First, they increased the deficit fivefold \nand then they reduce it back to half of that and then claim they are \ncutting the deficit in half. That is like taking six steps back, three \nsteps forward, and saying you are making progress. You are not making \nany progress. They are so far out of whack with what has been the \nhistorical norm that it is not even acceptable. The deficit they ended \nup with after taking six steps back and three steps forward is still in \nthe 4-percent range. It is still throwing debt on the books at a rate \nyou cannot afford, and it is absurd to claim that is fiscally \nresponsible.\n  Well, before I get into what we would do, I will mention a couple of \ngimmicks that are played here because they are beyond the shell game \ngimmick, which is pretty outrageous--moving around $1.1 trillion so \nthey don't have to put it on the budget. They take it off budget, \nessentially, so they can look as if they are doing better than the \nPresident, even though they have the exact same policies and numbers as \nthe President, for all intents and purposes.\n  They do a couple other things. They have reserve funds--lots of them. \nThis is a way to make like you are doing something that is fiscally \nresponsible by saying: You cannot spend this money unless you can pay \nfor it. The only problem is that they make the reserve funds in the \nmost critical area--specifically, health care, which we all know we are \ngoing to want to address this year. They create this incredible \nactivity. They put into place a health care reserve fund, which means \nthey are going to rewrite the policy of health care for this country. \nEvery part of this Nation is going to be affected.\n  You heard the chairman say that 17 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct in this country is involved in health care. The purpose of this \nproposal--the health care reserve fund--is to address that 17 percent. \nThere is virtually nothing in this country that isn't affected by that. \nEither everyone is directly affected or a member of their family is or \ntheir job is.\n  There is a rule here called pay-go, which has become the mantra of \nthe other side of the aisle about how they are going to be fiscally \ndisciplined. I never heard anyone from the Democratic party or the \nCongress, including the President when he was running for President and \nrunning for Senate, fail to talk about how they were going to use pay-\ngo to discipline the Federal Government because it implies that they \nare going to pay for what they are doing. It is a great term, by the \nway. The only problem is, they don't ever use it. They claim they are \ngoing to do it, but they never do. I call it ``Swiss cheese-go'' \nbecause there are so many holes in it. In the last 3 years, when the \nDemocrats ran the Congress, they avoided pay-go in the amount of $341 \nbillion in spending.\n  This health care trust fund is a brazen act of putting a hole in pay-\ngo. Up front, they say we are not going to apply pay-go to health care \nreform. Pay-go has a rule that says that in the first 6 years you have \nto meet it, and the second 5 years you have to meet it. No, we are not \ngoing to do that; we are going to be able to spend it over 11 years \nbefore you have to meet the pay-go rules. Why don't you just give it up \nand say we are not going to discipline ourselves. There is no pay-go \nrule, and it is a problem.\n  The second gimmick that really concerns me--it is more than a \ngimmick--is a big-time exercise of threatening the prerogative of the \nSenate and the constitutional purpose of the Senate, which is the use \nof reconciliation. This is a term of art, and nobody outside the \nCongress really understands it. Essentially, reconciliation was put \ninto the budget process when the budget was created for the purpose of \nmaking sure that what the budget said should be spent or should be \ntaxed actually occurs, so that there was a procedure to reconcile--to \nsay to committees if they exceeded a certain amount of spending and it \nwasn't inside the budget: You must change that spending; if your tax \npolicy created more of a deficit, you must change that tax policy. It \nis a procedure which, over the years, has evolved. It has been used \naggressively by both President Clinton and President Bush to pursue \npolicies that already exist or to adjust policies that already exist--\nwhether it happens to be already existing laws on welfare or existing \nlaws on tax policy. Yes, it has been used effectively and aggressively \nin those areas. But it has never been used to create a brand new policy \non something that has as dramatic and all-encompassing and pervasive \neffect on the American public as to change the entire health care \nsystem or something like that. It has never been used to create out of \nwhole cloth, ab initio, a brand new major tax system, such as a \nnational sales tax on electric bills, and its use is solely a purpose \nof the Senate. The House doesn't need reconciliation.\n  How does reconciliation work? It basically eliminates the prerogative \nof the Senate to amend the bill. The greatest prerogative of the Senate \nis that we have the right to debate, to discuss, and to amend \nlegislation. The House doesn't have that right. The House has something \ncalled a Rules Committee, and it is under the control of the Speaker. \nThe membership of the Rules Committee is made up 2 to 1, plus 1, so the \nSpeaker could never lose a vote in the Rules Committee. The Rules \nCommittee sets out for the House of Representatives when a bill comes \nto the floor--no matter the policy of the bill--and that you will have \nthis many hours of debate and they will allow this many amendments and \nhere is what they are. They can run through a bill in a half hour if \nthey want. That is the way the House has functioned for years. It is \nthe way the House was supposed to function when it was set up \nconstitutionally. The Senate, on the other hand, has no such rule. When \na bill is brought to the floor of the Senate, it is open for debate, \ndiscussion, and amendment. If you can get 60 votes, you can get it off \nthe floor.\n  The budget sets up a process to allow the Senate to function more \nlike the House. The budget is on the floor for 50 hours of debate. \nAmendments are allowed--any amendment, really, but at some point people \nrun out of energy and stop offering amendments--and there has to be a \nvote.\n  In order to reconcile parts of the budget, the reconciliation system \nwas set up where there is 20 hours of debate and virtually no \namendments because they would have to be germane, and that is a high \nstandard to meet here.\n  So the reconciliation situation is that it allows you to basically \nram through the Senate--as you would through the House--a bill without \namendment, discussion, debate, or amendments. It is a huge weapon. If \nused incorrectly, it fundamentally undermines the constitutional \npurpose of the Senate. It turns the Senate into the House of \nRepresentatives and makes us a body in which amendments are not allowed \nand debate doesn't occur, of any significance. It has a truly \ndebilitating effect on the idea that you will have a body in this \nconstitutionally structured Government of economics and balances where \ndebate occurs vociferously and aggressively and where problems can be \naired out in a more timely and orderly manner than occurs in the House \nof Representatives. So it should never be used to ab initio create a \nmassive, new program, such as a tax on everyone's electric bill. It \nshould never be used for the purpose of undertaking a major policy \nevent, such as rewriting the health care of the United States, which \nwill affect everybody.\n  To the chairman's credit, he doesn't have it in this bill. He \nunderstands that. He has spoken out fairly effectively on this point--\nprobably more concisely and effectively than I have spoken on it. But \nthe House of Representatives has put reconciliation instructions in. \nWhat earthly reason could there be for the House of Representatives to \nput reconciliation instructions in their bill? They don't need it; they \nhave a Rules Committee.\n  It is obvious. This is a game, a very dangerous game. The House puts \nin\n\n[[Page S3950]]\n\nreconciliation instructions but the Senate doesn't put it in because \nthe leadership knows that maybe it cannot get that across the floor and \ndoesn't want a vote on such a thing. So they can take it to conference \nand, much to nobody's surprise, the conference budget comes back with \nreconciliation instructions, which control activities on the Senate \nfloor.\n  It is totally inappropriate that the House should be dictating to the \nSenate how we are going to legislate and structure our debate system \nhere on the floor and try to make us into the House of Representatives. \nIt is unconscionable in the context of the constitutional structure of \nour Government. Yet that is the game that is being played here, and it \nis a cynical game. It is totally wrong. If for no other reason, \neveryone in this body should not vote for a budget that has \nreconciliation in it.\n  On our side of the aisle, we think we can do better. I have talked at \nsome length about the clear and present danger this budget represents \nto our children because of the massive increase in debt. We don't think \nthat has to be the course of action. You don't have to run the spending \nof the United States up to 23 percent of GDP, which this chart \nreflects, way above 25 actually, way above the historical norm. That is \nnot necessary. Short-term spending may be necessary for this \nsignificant problem we have with the recession, but you do not have to \ntake the Government and expand it radically, move it to the left, and \nspend money on what these groups are and constituencies are at this \nrate. The Government should live within the basic historic norm of 20 \npercent of GDP as part of its spending. That is where we part ways \nphilosophically.\n\n  The President genuinely believes, and the party passing this budget, \nthe Democratic Party, generally believes you create prosperity--and the \nPresident said it; he used those terms--you create prosperity by \nexpanding the Government significantly in these different areas of \nsocial interest. You do not if you are spending up those areas so much \nthat people cannot afford it.\n  It does not happen that way. The way you create prosperity is by \nkeeping Government at an affordable level, doing what it is supposed to \ndo while you give individuals the ability to go out and be productive, \ntake risks, and create jobs. That is a difference of philosophy here.\n  When the President proposed in his budget the way he is going to \naddress health care, where we presently spend 17 percent of our gross \nnational product on health care right now--that is 5 to 6 percentage \npoints more than the next closest industrialized nation, so there is a \nhuge amount of money being spent on health care--he proposes we explode \nthat spending by another $1.2 trillion. We don't have to. We can get \nevery American insurance, and good insurance, without radically \nincreasing the amount we are spending on health care. We can do it by \nmore effectively spending the money we already have in the health care \nsystem.\n  If you are spending 17 percent of the gross domestic product on \nhealth care, you do not have to take it up to 18, 19, 20 percent. In \nfact, if you do, you are probably not getting much efficiency out of \nit. Rather, spend more efficiently the money you are already spending.\n  We believe as a party that everybody has a right to decent health \ncare insurance, and we also believe as a party we can do that within \nthe context of the money that is already available by being more \nefficient, by giving people more choices, and by not putting the \nGovernment between patients and their doctors. We do not believe in \nnationalizing the health care system, which is basically what these \nnumbers are, the stalking horse for, that the President is proposing.\n  In the area of energy, the President's answer to energy is that you \nput in place a new national sales tax, as I have mentioned before, on \nevery electric bill in this country, everybody's electric bill, so that \nwhen you turn on your light switch you get hit with a new sales tax. \nThat is probably not going to produce a whole lot of energy. It is \ngoing to probably undermine the productivity of our economy, and it \ncertainly is going to ship a lot of jobs offshore.\n  The way to produce a better energy policy is to look in an \nenvironmentally sound way for more American supply and you can conserve \nmore energy. So we drill, and we can drill in an environmentally sound \nway in identified offshore areas and produce more American energy. You \ncreate more powerplants through using nuclear power, a totally clean \nform of energy from the standpoint of pollution to our air. You use \nwind, solar, and other alternatives, but you acknowledge the fact that \nyou cannot possibly get to the goal we have to get to, which is enough \nenergy to continue to maintain our international competitiveness as a \nnation and continue our prosperity as a nation, if we are just using \nsolar and wind.\n  Solar and wind make up 2 percent of our national energy supply. If \nyou triple it, you only get 6 percent, and tripling it would be a \nlittle difficult because there are a lot of people who do not want \nwindmills in front of their houses, whereas nuclear can be expanded, \nwhereas we can drill and find more American energy more effectively, \nwhereas we can use oil shale, which we have more of than Saudi Arabia \nhas oil, to produce energy more effectively, and we can be more \nconservation minded, and there is agreement on that, obviously, on both \nsides of the aisle. But you do not accomplish this by sticking the \nAmerican people with a brand new national sales tax.\n  In the area of cost discipline, clearly we do not have to run up \nspending at these rates. We should bring them back down, and the way \nyou bring them back down is by addressing entitlement spending.\n  This budget that was sent up by the President of the United States, \nwho claims he is interested in fiscal responsibility--although, \nobviously, it is sorely tested by the numbers in this budget, these \ntrillions of dollars of new debt--does not, on net, reduce the \nentitlement accounts. He does suggest that Part D premiums be paid for \nin part by wealthy people. I agree with that. We have actually offered \nthat amendment on our side of the aisle for the last 2 years under this \nDemocratic Congress and were beaten every year on that proposal. I am \nglad the President is on our side this time. Maybe we will be able to \nadopt it. It is called the Ensign amendment.\n  The fact is, unless you have a comprehensive approach to disciplining \nentitlement spending so it is affordable, and we continue to deliver \nreasonably good quality care and support to senior citizens, we are not \ngoing to get these spending issues under control. You cannot kick this \ncan down the road, as the President has said. You have to start, and \nthe President has not started now. This budget has nothing in it to \nthat effect.\n  In one other area where we would do something significantly different \nis defense. This budget basically assumes a declining funding of \ndefense for the next 10 years that is significantly less than what is \npresently funded as a percentage of GDP.\n  We are at war. I wish al-Qaida was going to go away. I wish these \nfolks who represent such a huge and immediate threat to us, especially \nif they get their hands on a weapon of mass destruction, did not exist, \nbut they do. They do exist, and they are a threat--a very significant \nthreat. We cannot confront them through goodwill because they are not \ninterested in goodwill. We have to confront them with a military that \nis properly funded, properly cared for, and properly armed. That, \nunfortunately, takes money.\n  The first obligation, the first absolutely most important obligation \nof the Federal Government is national defense. Yet this budget, first, \ndoes not include sufficient funding for the President's war costs and, \nsecond, as a practical matter, it simply assumes that you can run the \nmilitary on the cheap, I guess, and that is a big mistake.\n  We do have differences, as Chairman Conrad has said, over how this \nbudget is structured. They come back to this very core issue of debt, \nof what we are leaving our children, what we are passing on to our \nchildren. It is simply not right for one generation to give another \ngeneration less than what we received from our parents.\n  We, as a nation, have always--always--had the older generation pass \nto the younger generation a better, stronger, and more prosperous \nnation. Yet we are now on a pathway, if this budget is followed \nforward, where the debt and the deficits will be so high\n\n[[Page S3951]]\n\nthat our children will not be able to have as good a life as we have \nhad. The cost of maintaining this Government will so burden them their \nability to finance a home, buy a home, send their kids to college, or \njust live a lifestyle that is something of the level and enjoyment and \nprosperity that we have had will be seriously--seriously--threatened. \nIt is not fair to do that, not fair for one generation to do that to \nanother generation. Yet the numbers do not lie.\n  I understand the Democrats did not want to show us the second 5 years \nof the budget. They hid it, along with a lot of other things they hid, \nin this budget, but the President showed us the second 5 years of the \nbudget. Every American should take pause because when you see the debt \ngo up by $9.2 trillion, when you see the public debt ratio to GDP go to \n80 percent, when you see deficits annually of $1 trillion a year on \naverage for as far as you can see, when you see a deficit rate of 5 to \n6 percent of GDP, you are talking about a country which is headed \ntoward a fiscal crisis the likes of which we probably have not seen \nsince the Great Depression. It is a country which cannot afford its \nGovernment. It is a nation that will be passing on to its children \nsignificantly less than was passed on to us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Lieberman). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that for the \nremainder of this debate on the budget over the next 50 hours, the time \nbe equally divided under a quorum call.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I would like to come back to the argument \nI continue to hear advanced--that because we have gone from the 10-year \nbudget the President proposed to a 5-year budget, something is being \nhidden. I don't believe anything is being hidden from anyone.\n  Of the 34 budgets the Congress of the United States has done since \nthe Budget Act, 30 of them were 5-year budgets--30 of the 34. Only four \nwere 10-year budgets. The reason Congress has tended to do 5-year \nbudgets--not just tended to but overwhelmingly has done 5-year \nbudgets--is that the outyear forecasts are notoriously unreliable; \nnotoriously.\n\n  Some have said I criticized the previous administration for not doing \na 10-year budget. Indeed, I did--because I believed they were trying to \nhide the effect of their tax cuts in the second 5 years. But this \nadministration did not do a 5-year budget. This administration did a \n10-year budget. There is nothing hidden. It is all out there for \nanybody to see. The Congressional Budget Office has scored the \nPresident's 10-year budget. Some of us have expressed concern about the \nsecond 5 years.\n  People get in a habit around here and they get used to doing \nsomething a certain way, they get used to criticizing budgets a certain \nway so they keep doing it. It was legitimate to criticize the previous \nadministration for not doing a 10-year budget. It was legitimate to \nsuggest they might have something to hide. But this administration did \na 10-year budget. We in Congress--remember, ultimately the budget is a \ncongressional act. The President does not have to sign it. It does not \nbecome law. Congress has almost always done a 5-year budget; 30 of the \n34 budgets written under the Budget Act have been 5-year budgets, \nincluding the last 5, including 2 in which Senator Gregg was the \nchairman. Again, it has been done that way, number one, because the \noutyear forecasts have been notoriously unreliable and, number two, \nbecause we do a budget every year.\n  In fact, there is some question whether a 5-year budget is required \nbecause we are going to do a new budget every year. So what matters the \nmost in any budget is the first year.\n  But I did wish to address that because I see this criticism. I saw it \nin the David Broder column. I have immense respect for him. I saw it in \nthe David Rogers column. I have immense respect for him. But I don't \nthink the criticism applies in this particular situation. Nobody has \nbeen more clear, publicly or privately, than I have that the second 5 \nyears of the Obama budget raises a real concern about the \nsustainability of our fiscal direction.\n  Let me just say, if you took my budget, which is a 5-year budget, the \nbudget that came out of the Budget Committee, and extended it for 10 \nyears, you would see dramatically lower deficits and debt than in the \nPresident's budget. In fact, I believe the first 5 years we have saved \n$600 billion from the President's proposal. In the second 5 years the \ntotal savings--for the 10 years, if we extended our budget 5 years, \nwould be over $2 trillion. That is just in the nature of the beast. You \nknow, the savings grow over time. We have put in $600 billion of \nsavings in the first 5 years.\n  With respect to the question of spending, we are only increasing \ndomestic spending--and that includes defense, that includes \ninternational, and that includes domestic spending in the appropriated \naccounts--5.3 percent. That is a modest number. Some of our friends on \nthe other side want to absolutely freeze spending. I say to them I \nthink that would be a serious mistake in an economic downturn, to \nabsolutely freeze spending. In this situation, where the economy is \ncontracting sharply, consumers cannot fill in the gap. They are tapped \nout, and they are worrying about losing their jobs. Companies cannot \nfill in the gap because they, too, are threatened. The only entity with \nresources to step in, to fill the breach, is the Federal Government.\n  One of the things we learned in the Great Depression was that \nprofound mistake that was made was not necessarily on the fiscal policy \nside--although that didn't help--but the biggest mistake was on the \nmonetary policy side controlled by the Federal Reserve. They did not \nexpand the money supply. They did not provide liquidity to prevent the \ncontraction from deepening, from growing, and from becoming far more \ndestructive.\n  Thank goodness we have learned. That is not what is happening here. \nThe Federal Reserve is providing liquidity, and that is on the monetary \nside. On the fiscal policy side, we did pass a large stimulus package--\nas imperfect as it was. We provided a large stimulus package to help \nfill in some of the gap between where the economy should be and where \nit is, the gap that was exacerbated by a more than 6-percent \ncontraction in the economy in the fourth quarter of last year.\n  I believe we are doing many of the right things--again, however \nimperfectly. If I were able to design the stimulus package, I must say \nit would have been much different. I would have put much more money \ninto infrastructure. I believe that would have been a better way to \nstimulate the economy. Even so, there was substantial infrastructure in \nthe stimulus package. Not as much as I would have preferred but, \nnonetheless, a significant amount. Additionally, I think the Federal \nReserve is going in the right direction with respect to the policies it \nis pursuing in terms of providing liquidity and credit.\n  When we talk about Hoover economics that our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle embraced back in the 1930s, the fundamental \nassumption was that markets were self correcting. That is what Hoover \neconomics was founded upon, the notion that the Federal Reserve did not \nneed to take countercyclical action and that the Federal Government did \nnot need to take countercyclical actions in terms of helping people who \nwere unemployed. Hoover opposed providing that kind of Federal \nGovernment assistance.\n  Today we know that such assistance actually one of the most \nstimulative things you can do because that money gets into the economic \nbloodstream very quickly. It gives lift to the economy, it reduces the \nsize of the contraction, it reduces job loss, it reduces\n\n[[Page S3952]]\n\nmore and more homes going into foreclosure because people can't pay \ntheir mortgage, it reduces the vicious cycle that can suck down an \neconomy.\n  I just wish to be clear. When we have been critical of their stance \nagainst stimulus, their stance against doing the things that are being \ndone by the Fed, they have this mantra they chant. Too much spending--\nlet me look at our budget in terms of spending. In the short term, yes, \nspending increases because you are countering the cycle of the economy, \nso we are up to 27 percent of GDP in spending this year. But then we \nstep it down to 22 percent of GDP, of gross domestic product, by the \nfifth year. So that is going in the right direction--even for our \nfriends on the other side.\n  They say too much taxes. Let me remind them, in the President's \nproposal, on a net basis, according to the Congressional Budget Office, \nhis budget cuts taxes $2.2 trillion. That is a 10-year budget. Our \nbudget on a 5-year basis cuts taxes $825 billion, on a net basis. Yes, \nthere are some tax increases on those of us who are high-income \nearners. Yes, we have our taxes increased somewhat. But on an overall \nbasis, the President's budget has significant tax cuts from current \nlaw, as does the budget that is before us now.\n  Third, they say too much debt. Look, I am in agreement with them. But \nwhere were they in the good times during the Bush administration, when \nthey doubled the debt of this country? They doubled the debt of this \ncountry when economic times were relatively good--until the end of the \nBush administration when the economy collapsed. That is what this \nPresident inherited. He inherited an economy that was in full collapse: \nIt declined 6 percent in the last quarter of last year; an economy that \nwas in free fall; an economy with a housing crisis, a financial crisis, \na banking crisis, and a fiscal crisis.\n  I say to my friends on the other side, it was their policies that put \nus in the soup. It was their policies of doubling the debt, of tripling \nforeign holdings of U.S. debt, that put us in this ditch. Now this \nPresident has to try to clean up the mess and part of cleaning up the \nmess is higher deficits and debt in the short term. That is \nunavoidable. That was already happening in a very dramatic way before \nthis President ever took office. He inherited a deficit. If he had done \nnothing, he would have inherited a deficit this year of $1.3 trillion. \nThat is after our friends on other side had already doubled the debt \nover the previous 8 years, and, worse, tripled foreign holdings of U.S. \ndebt. Now we have China as the biggest creditor and our friends here \nsay: Gee, China might not continue to finance our debt.\n  My friends, where were you? I warned about that starting in 2001. \nAnybody can review the record. You can go back and look at what I said \non the public record over and over and over, that we were headed for \nbig problems financing our debt. The party on the other side did not \nseem to respond.\n  Now, all of a sudden, they are concerned about the debt they have \npassed on to this President. That is not fair. I am plenty willing to \nsay, as I have said publicly, the second 5 years of the Obama budget \nneeds a lot more work. We are going to have to do a lot more to keep \nthe deficit going down. But the first 5 years is a good start for the \nPresident's budget and ours is even somewhat better. In fairness to \nhim, we had to make additional adjustments in his budget because the \nCongressional Budget Office said we lost $2.3 trillion in revenue--$2.3 \ntrillion from the forecast the President was working off of that was \nmade some time earlier.\n  I hope, in this debate, we do not try to lay at the desk of this \nPresident, who has been in office less than 3 months, disasters he \ninherited. No. No, we are not going to let that happen. That is not \ngoing to go unconfronted because that is not fair. This President \nwalked into more crises than I can think of confronting any President, \ngoing back to Franklin Delano Roosevelt--a housing crisis deeply \nunderway before he ever took office, a banking crisis deeply underway \nbefore he ever took office, a financial crisis deeply underway before \nhe ever took office. So let us be fair in this debate and discussion \nabout where responsibility lies.\n  Barack Obama, President Obama did not create any of these problems. \nHe has been asked to clean up the mess and an incredible mess it is.\n  One other point I wish to make, and a place where I do strongly agree \nwith Senator Gregg, is the need to do much more for the long term. That \nis why he and I have proposed a 16-member task force given the \nresponsibility and the authority to come up with a plan. If 12 of the \n16 could agree, that plan would come to the floor for a vote because I \ndo not believe we are going to get through this without special \nmeasures and special procedures and a process to take on this long-term \ndebt bomb that overhangs our country. But let's be fair about who is \nresponsible for building the foundation of this mess. It does not lie \nat the feet of President Obama.\n  I see the Senator from Alaska. Is the Senator seeking time?\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. I am, in morning business.\n  Mr. CONRAD. This would be a perfect time. I would be happy to yield \nthe floor and give her an opportunity. While the Senator is getting \nready, she has, as the Chair knows, has had a skiing accident. We are \nglad to see she is up and ambulatory and here at work. We are delighted \nshe is back.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I think we will soon see that the Senator from \nAlaska is not only ambulatory but her vocabulary is working quite well.\n  The Chair recognizes the Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                         Mount Redoubt Eruption\n\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, today I am rising to talk about an \nissue that has captivated my constituents in the State of Alaska. We \nhave got a mountain that is erupting. Mount Redoubt, which is located \nabout 150 miles southwest of Anchorage, our largest community, has been \nmore than active in the past week or so generating a great deal of \npress, a great deal of interest, and a considerable amount of impact in \nmy State. So I wanted to take a few minutes this afternoon to talk \nabout what is happening up North, talk a little bit about the \nimportance of volcano monitoring.\n  I think we are all aware that there have been some recent comments \nmade about Federal spending for volcano monitoring, and the suggestion \nthat perhaps this might be wasteful money in that we do not have any \nneed to be monitoring volcanos.\n  I can assure you that monitoring volcanos is critically important to \nthe Nation, to the world, and particularly to Alaska right now, where, \nas I say, we are being held hostage by a volcano.\n  A little bit of a personal note here. This afternoon--my boys' spring \nbreak concluded last evening. We have been up in the State enjoying \nspring skiing. And they are grounded by Mount Redoubt. They may be home \nWednesday evening. Now, others might think this is a bad thing, but for \nthese young pages here this morning, when you are 17 and you are shut \nout of school for an additional 3 days after spring break concludes, \nand you have to stay in Alaska and keep skiing, maybe the volcano is \nnot a bad thing.\n  But there is a very serious aspect to what we are talking about. \nMount Redoubt has erupted 17 times now since March 22. And when it was \ninitially under watch, you would see the steam and the haze coming off \nthe volcano. But then we started to see some pretty significant \neruptions, eruptions that would go 65,000 feet up into the air.\n  This is a picture of Mount Redoubt. This was actually taken back in \n1989, the last time Mount Redoubt was active. But what happens is these \nplumes go straight up into the air, get caught by the jet stream at 40- \nor 65,000 feet, and then that ash is dispersed throughout the State.\n  What we have been seeing up North this week, and actually for about \nthe past 10 days, is the cancellation of air flights, complete closure \nof the Anchorage International Airport over the weekend. Alaska \nAirlines alone has canceled about 230 flights. It has affected about \n10,000 passengers, including my boys.\n  What is happening as a result of this volcano does become quite \npersonal. We have school districts down in the southern part of the \nState where they have experienced the ash fall-out, where the students \nhave dust masks, respirator masks so they are not breathing the ash \nthat is coming through.\n\n[[Page S3953]]\n\n  Home Depot made a point of staying open 24 hours a day so people \ncould get the masks, the ventilator masks, get tape to put around their \nwindows, around the doors, because this ash, this particulate is so \nfine that it comes underneath and into your home, it gunks up your \ncomputers, it clogs your car engine.\n  It is most worrisome, most threatening, though, with airplane \nengines, the ash itself, this particulate that is like ground-up stone \nand has this very debilitating effect of messing up your engine. So \nwhat is happening is at the airports, the engines of the airplanes, if \nthey are not inside, which we do not have the capacity for, are being \nwrapped in Saran Wrap--more sophisticated than Saran Wrap but having to \nbe wrapped. Our military at Elmendorf and Ft. Richardson is looking to \nrelocate their assets, so that these very fine precision aircraft are \nnot in harm's way.\n  A lot is happening as a result of this volcano and the series of \neruptions. The volcanoes in Alaska make up well over three-quarters of \nU.S. volcanoes that have erupted in the last 200 years. About 50 \nvolcanic eruptions occur around the world every year. This is according \nto USGS. It seems like a high number, but most of them are not \neruptions that make much in terms of headlines.\n  The United States ranks third, behind Indonesia and Japan, in the \nnumber of historically active volcanoes. That is why it is so very \nimportant to fund volcano monitoring, which in Alaska is through the \nAlaska Volcano Observatory. The AVO, as I call it, is one of five \nvolcano observatories in the United States. It is a joint program of \nthe USGS, the United States Geologic Service, the Geophysical Institute \nof the University of Alaska-Fairbanks, and the State of Alaska Division \nof Geological and Geophysical Surveys. The AVO is unique in the United \nStates, and probably in the world, in that it is a thoroughly \ncollaborative undertaking of Federal scientists, State scientists, \nuniversity faculty, and students.\n  AVO was formed in 1988, after an eruption of Mt. Augustine, and uses \nFederal, State, and university resources to monitor and study Alaska's \nhazardous volcanoes, to predict, to give that early warning, and record \neruptive activity, and also to mitigate volcanic hazards to life and \nproperty.\n  Alaska has over 30 active volcanoes that are currently being \nmonitored by the AVO. There is no other observatory in the world that \neven comes close to that. The AVO also analyzes available satellite \ndata twice daily from thermal anomalies and ash plumes at about 80 \nvolcanoes in the North Pacific. Russian volcanos frequently put ash \ninto areas where the United States has aviation safety \nresponsibilities. Alaska's active volcanoes also offer superb \nopportunities for basic scientific investigation of volcanic processes. \nAn important component of AVO's program is to conduct research at \nselected volcanic centers.\n  Now, I mentioned the hazard to air traffic. I think it is important \nfor people to understand that when we are talking about volcanic ash \nbeing in the air and being distributed, it is not just something that \nis dirty and an annoyance, but it has the potential to be life \nthreatening and absolutely deadly. If the jet engines ingest the \nvolcanic ash, the potential for catastrophe is very real.\n  Back in 1989, December 15 of 1989, there was a Boeing 747 flying \nabout 150 miles northeast of Anchorage and it went through the ash \nplume that had erupted from the Redoubt volcano. It was flying at night \nso they could not see they were flying into an ash cloud.\n  We did not have the monitoring process, so the pilots were flying on \nthrough and it sucked in the ash at--I am not entirely certain what \naltitude they were flying when they first encountered the ash--but the \nplane, with 231 passengers aboard, lost more than 10,000 feet \nelevation. All four engines lost power. And they went down 10,000 feet. \nThat is about 2 miles.\n  Now, we do a lot of flying around here. Next time you are up in that \nairplane, look down and think about losing all of the power in your 747 \nand falling out of the sky almost 2 miles before these incredibly \nskilled pilots are able to restart the engines.\n  They were able to land the airplane safely, no lives lost, but I \ncannot imagine what it would have been like to have been a passenger on \nthat jet aircraft. The airplane suffered about $80 million in damage. \nAll four of those engines were shot. And, again, the good news out of \nthe story is that there was no loss of life.\n  The FAA estimates, based on information provided by the FAA, that \nmore than 80,000 large aircraft per year and 30,000 people per day are \nin the skies over and potentially downwind of many of Alaska's \nvolcanoes, mostly on the heavily traveled great circle routes between \nEurope and North America and Asia. It is along this route, which \ncoincidentally follows the northern portion of the Pacific Ring of \nFire, that there are over 100 volcanoes capable of depositing ash into \nthe flight path. Some are in Japan, many are in Russia, but about half \nof them are in Alaska. And by analyzing the satellite imagery and \nworking with the National Weather Service to predict where the winds \nwill carry the ash, AVO assists the FAA in warning aircraft of areas to \navoid.\n\n  Volcanic eruptions from Cook Inlet volcanoes--these are right around \nthe south central area: Spurr, Redoubt, Iliamna, and Augustine--can \nhave severe impacts, as these volcanoes are nearest Anchorage, which is \nobviously our largest population center.\n  Back in 1989, when Redoubt blew before, I was working in an office, \nand essentially we were shut down because the ventilation system needed \nto be turned off, computers needed to be turned off and covered. The \nimpacts economically and in all ways are very real.\n  The last major series of eruptions of Mt. Redoubt were in 1989 and \n1990. These eruptions totaled 23. So right now with Redoubt we are \nalready up to 17. The 23 that took place in 1989 occurred over a 6-\nmonth period. We are seeing 17 eruptions over a period of about 10 \ndays.\n  These eruptions seriously affected the population, commerce, and oil \nproduction throughout Cook Inlet and air traffic about as far away as \nthe State of Texas. Total estimated economic costs were about $160 \nmillion, making this eruption of Redoubt the second most costly in U.S. \nhistory after Mount St. Helens. It had significant impact on the \naviation and oil industries as well as on the people of the Kenai \nPeninsula.\n  As mentioned, this volcanic ash is fine bits of abrasive glass that \ncan damage lungs, it can damage vehicles, electronic equipment. Right \nnow, as we speak, in the area just outside of Anchorage, at Mount \nAlyeska, where I was a couple of weeks ago, we are hosting the U.S. \nNational Ski Championships. We have got some of the country's finest \nathletes who are performing on that hill. They cannot race if they are \nbreathing in this volcanic particulate.\n  The Redoubt eruption also damaged five commercial jetliners. This was \nagain back in 1989. It caused several days' worth of airport closures \nand airline cancellations in Anchorage and on the Kenai Peninsula. \nDrifting ash clouds disrupted air traffic as far away as Texas.\n  International volcano monitoring is also a role of the Federal \nGovernment. It helped, very likely, to save many lives, and significant \nmoney, in the case of the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the \nPhilippines, where the United States had military bases at the time.\n  The eruption back in 1991 lasted more than 10 hours and sent a cloud \nof ash as high as 22 miles into the area that grew to more than 300 \nmiles across.\n  The USGS spent less than $1.5 million monitoring the volcano and was \nable to warn of the impending eruption which allowed the authorities to \nevacuate residents, as well as aircraft and other equipment from U.S. \nbases there. The USGS estimates that the efforts saved thousands of \nlives and prevented property losses of at least $250 million.\n  It is not enough, though, to justify a program by identifying a \ndanger. The more important question is whether something can be done to \nreduce the impact of a volcanic eruption in terms of property damage \nand loss of life. That means getting people out of harm's way by \nproviding advanced warning. That is exactly what the USGS Volcano \nHazards Program seeks to do through the existing volcano observatories \nin the United States. Some\n\n[[Page S3954]]\n\nmay say there is an abundance of caution going on right now by shutting \ndown the airport, by cancelling flights, by diverting flights. But as a \nmother whose sons are there and going to be relying on air travel, I \nwant to make sure that we err on the side of caution.\n  I want to make sure we are using those scientists who will tell us \nexactly when it is safe to be back up flying.\n  The advances made in monitoring can now provide much more accurate \nand timely predictions of eruptions. Back in 1989, AVO was only able to \nprovide a few days' warning before Mount Redoubt erupted. This year, \nthey began to detect activity and notified the public a couple months \nbefore it eventually erupted. The biggest challenge remains finding an \nadequate and stable source of funding. The USGS Volcano Hazards Program \nhas been constantly underfunded. Both USGS and the FAA provide funding, \nbut it is not enough to manage all of the observatories or provide for \nan expansion of the system to cover increased monitoring and volcano \nresearch.\n  It is because of inadequate funding and the critical importance of \nthis program that I intend to introduce a bill that will provide \nfunding stability volcano monitoring needs. This program shows that \nwith a modest investment, a very large benefit can be produced in \nreducing the impacts of catastrophic events. My legislation will \nestablish a national volcano early warning and monitoring system within \nthe United States Geological Survey to monitor, warn, and protect \ncitizens from undue and avoidable harm from volcanic activity. USGS \nwill coordinate a management plan with other relevant Federal \ndepartments, including the Department of Transportation, FAA, the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Department of \nHomeland Security, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The \nlegislation authorizes appropriations annually to the Department of \nInterior to carry out the act.\n  I appreciate the attention given me on this issue this afternoon. As \nI mentioned, all eyes are upon the State of Alaska right now as we \nwatch this volcano, but this is not the only one we are actively \nmonitoring and watching. We want to make sure that not only the \nresidents of the State of Alaska are provided a level of safety through \nmonitoring and warning but any of those who may be endangered because \nof Mother Nature doing what Mother Nature does on a very unpredictable \ntrajectory. So what we are attempting by introduction of legislation to \nestablish the national volcano early warning and monitoring system is \ngood, and I look forward to having the support of my colleagues on this \nvery important matter.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Webb). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I wish to go back for a moment to the \nquestion of a 10-year budget versus a 5-year budget, because I have \nheard so many questions raised about why we did a 5-year budget rather \nthan a 10.\n  Again, the Congress has done 34 budgets under the Budget Act, 30 of \nwhich have been 5-year budgets. A key reason has been that the longer \nterm forecasts are notoriously unreliable. CBO said the current \nforecast ``has greater than normal uncertainty.''\n\n       CBO'S current forecast, particularly for the near term, is \n     subject to a greater than normal degree of uncertainty . . . \n     Both the magnitude of the contractionary forces operating in \n     the economy and the magnitude of the government's actions to \n     stabilize the financial system and stimulate economic growth \n     are outside the range of recent experience.\n\n  The Federal Reserve Chairman, Mr. Bernanke, said the economic outlook \nis subject to considerable uncertainty.\n\n       This outlook for economic activity is subject to \n     considerable uncertainty . . . One risk arises from the \n     global nature of the slowdown.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       If actions taken by the Administration, the Congress, and \n     the Federal Reserve are successful in restoring some measure \n     of financial stability--and only if that is the case--there \n     is a reasonable prospect the current recession will end in \n     2009 and that 2010 will be a year of recovery.\n\n  Again, very small differences have very big effects over time.\n  Senator Gregg himself said in March of this year:\n\n       Ten-year forecasts are very much a guess . . .\n\n  That is why almost every time the Congress does a 5-year budget \nrather than a 10-year budget. In fact, the last five budgets done by \nCongress, including three under Republican chairmen, have been 5-year \nbudgets.\n  Now, there has been some suggestion by columnists that doing a 5-year \nbudget suggests you are hiding something. Again, I want to emphasize, \nPresident Obama came forward with a 10-year budget that has been fully \nscored. Nothing is being hidden from anybody. That score is out there. \nIt is available. It is public. So there is nothing being hidden. And \nCongress has almost always done 5-year budgets just because of the \nextraordinary uncertainty of those outyears.\n  I also want to say, for a moment, those who argue that this budget \nhas too much spending are up against the factual record. The factual \nrecord is that in this year, the spending will be 28 percent of gross \ndomestic product. We bring that down very sharply in the first 3 years. \nWe get it down to 22 percent of GDP by 2012. Again, there is a deficit \nin the fifth year of less than 3 percent of GDP, which the economists \ntell us is critical to having a sustainable debt.\n  Let me say my own view. I believe we have to do better than that. I \nbelieve we have to do better than that. I believe the outyears under \nany of the budgets are unsustainable. I believe we have to have some \nspecial process such as the one Senator Gregg and I have proposed, and \nI am completely open to other suggestions about how we deal with the \nentitlement reform and the tax reform we so badly need.\n  I see our colleague, Senator McCain, is now in the Chamber. We \nadvised his office we would like to get him in at about this hour, so I \nwould be happy to take a break and give Senator McCain a shot at this.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank my friend from North Dakota, and I \nthank him for his hard work under very difficult circumstances.\n  Obviously, the debate begins on the budget resolution for fiscal year \n2010. Like the President's plan, the measure offered amounts, in all \ncandor, to generational theft. It increases spending by $225 billion \nover current levels, raises at least $361 billion in taxes, and borrows \n$1.1 trillion more than what we expect to borrow under current law.\n  But unlike the President's plan, the resolution budgets for 5 years. \nNow, I would like to say, in deference to my friend from North Dakota \nand members of the Budget Committee, I am aware that in previous years \na 5-year budget process has been generally the way to do business. \nThere are years where we have used 10 years. The President's budget was \n10 years. In these difficult times, given the circumstances under which \nwe are laboring, I think we do a disservice to not do a 10-year budget. \nSo budgeting for only a 5-year period in many respects hides the costly \nexpansion of Government that is sure to take place after 2014.\n  As we go through this debate--and I notice the Senator from North \nDakota has many charts--I will be bringing forward some charts that \nshow the dramatic expansion in cost for a whole variety of reasons, \nincluding demographics and more and more baby boomers retiring, which, \nas the President's chief budget person, Mr. Orszag, has stated, is \n``not sustainable.''\n  The Senate owes it to the American taxpayer, in my view, to produce a \n10-year budget that shows the unsustainable fiscal path we are on and \nthe terrible burden we are passing on to future generations because of \nthe explosive debt it produces.\n  The Senator from North Dakota, the distinguished chairman of the \nBudget Committee, just mentioned a proposal for a commission for reform \nof Social Security and Medicare, and I agree with him. But I would also \nargue that on the issue of Social Security we could all sit down in a \nmatter of hours and address the issue of Social Security. We know the \nfactors that are involved. We know what the costs are.\n\n[[Page S3955]]\n\nWe know the fixes that basically are necessary. And it would have to be \ndone in the spirit of compromise, as Tip O'Neill and former President \nReagan did way back in 1983, the last time there was any significant \nreform to Social Security. Medicare and Medicaid and health care is \nobviously a much more complicated issue.\n  In an op-ed entitled ``Hiding a Mountain Of Debt'' from yesterday's \nWashington Post, David Broder, who, in my view, is perhaps the most \nrespected columnist in America in many ways, and certainly the most \nexperienced, wrote:\n\n       [T]he Democratic Congress is about to perform a cover-up on \n     the most serious threat to America's economic future. . . .\n       The Congressional Budget Office sketched the dimensions of \n     the problem on March 20, and Congress reacted with shock.

Broder)\n\n       With a bit of bookkeeping legerdemain borrowed from the \n     Bush administration, the Democratic Congress is about to \n     perform a cover-up on the most serious threat to America's \n     economic future.\n       That threat is not the severe recession, tough as that is \n     for the families and businesses struggling to make ends meet. \n     In time, the recession will end, and last week's stock market \n     performance hinted that we may not have to wait years for the \n     recovery to begin.\n       The real threat is the monstrous debt resulting from the \n     slump in revenue and the staggering sums being committed by \n     Washington to rescuing embattled banks and homeowners--and \n     the absence of any serious strategy for paying it all back.\n       The Congressional Budget Office sketched the dimensions of \n     the problem on March 20, and Congress reacted with shock. The \n     CBO said that over the next 10 years, current policies would \n     add a staggering $9.3 trillion to the national debt--one-\n     third more than President Obama had estimated by using much \n     more optimistic assumptions about future economic growth.\n       As far as the eye could see, the CBO said, the debt would \n     continue to grow by about $1 trillion a year because of a \n     structural deficit between the spending rate, averaging 23 \n     percent of gross domestic product, and federal revenue at 19 \n     percent.\n       The ever-growing national debt will require ever-larger \n     annual interest payments, with much of that money going \n     overseas to China, Japan and other countries that have been \n     buying our bonds.\n       Reacting to this scary prospect, the House and Senate \n     budget committees took the paring knife to some of Obama's \n     spending proposals and tax cuts last week. But many of the \n     proposed savings look more like bookkeeping gimmicks than \n     realistic cutbacks. The budget resolutions assume, for \n     example, that no more money will be needed this year to bail \n     out foundering businesses or pump up consumer demand, even \n     though estimates of those needs start at $250 billion and go \n     up by giant steps.\n       Republicans on the budget committees offered cuts that were \n     larger and, in some but not all instances, more realistic.\n       But the main device the Democratic budgeteers employed was \n     simply to shrink the budget ``window'' from 10 years to five. \n     Instantly, $5 trillion in debt disappeared from view, along \n     with the worry that long after the recession is past, the \n     structural deficit would continue to blight the future of \n     young working families.\n       The Democrats did not invent this gimmick. They borrowed it \n     from George W. Bush, who turned to it as soon as his \n     inherited budget surpluses withered with the tax cuts and \n     recession of 2001-02. But Obama had promised a more honest \n     budget and said that this meant looking at the long-term \n     consequences of today's tax and spending decisions.\n       There are plenty of people in Congress for whom the CBO \n     report was no surprise, and some of them have proposed a \n     solution that would confront this reality. Kent Conrad, the \n     chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, and Judd Gregg, its \n     ranking Republican, have offered a bill to create a \n     bipartisan commission to examine every aspect of the budget--\n     taxes, defense and domestic spending, and, especially, \n     Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. Congress would be \n     required to vote promptly, up or down, on its \n     recommendations, or come up with an alternative that would \n     achieve at least as much in savings.\n       In the House, Democrat Jim Cooper of Tennessee and \n     Republican Frank Wolf of Virginia have been pressing a \n     similar proposal but have been regularly thwarted.\n       The roadblock in chief is Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the \n     House. She has made it clear that her main goal is to protect \n     Social Security and Medicare from any significant reforms. \n     Pelosi has not forgotten how Democrats benefited from the \n     2005-06 fight against Bush's effort to change Social \n     Security. Her party, which had lost elections in 2000, 2002 \n     and 2004, found its voice and its rallying cry to ``Save \n     Social Security,'' and Pelosi is not about to allow any \n     bipartisan commission to take that issue away from her \n     control.\n       The price for her obduracy is being paid in the rigging of \n     the budget process. The larger price will be paid by your \n     children and grandchildren, who will inherit a future-\n     blighting mountain of debt.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. What does the President's budget do? It doubles the \npublic debt in 5 years and nearly triples it in 10 years. As a \nconsequence, beginning in 2019, the Government will spend more on \ninterest than on the defense of our Nation. That is $806 billion on \ninterest, $720 billion on defense. That is eight times more than we \nwill spend on education and eight times more than we will spend on \ntransportation. The budget proposals offered by the President and the \nSenate Democrats put us on an unsustainable fiscal path and will pass \non to future generations an unprecedented level of debt they will never \nbe able to afford.\n  We should not take lightly the significant impact our mounting debt \nhas on our future financial stability and security. Currently, China \nowns nearly $2 trillion of our debt, and because of the global economic \ndownturn, the Chinese are now focused on pumping their money into their \nown economy. I believe one of my colleagues said it best when he \nwarned: ``The only thing worse than China holding so much of our debt, \nis China declining to finance any more of our debt.''\n  Buying our national debt is no longer a very attractive investment \nfor the Chinese and, given the explosion of debt currently envisioned \nin the President's budget, an even less inviting one in the future. We \nsee evidence of this approaching predicament brought on by their well-\nfounded concerns about the dollar's declining value and in China's \nrecent suggestion that the world should consider a new international \ncurrency to replace the dollar.\n  Here are some cold, hard facts: Our current national debt is $10.7 \ntrillion. The projected deficit for 2009 is $1.7 trillion. The total \ncost of the stimulus bill enacted last month is over $1.1 trillion. We \ngave the Troubled Asset Relief Program, known as TARP, $700 billion, \nbut everyone expects the administration will request up to an \nadditional $750 billion or more. President Obama recently signed an \nOmnibus appropriations bill totaling $410 billion. The Federal Reserve \nrecently pumped another $1.2 trillion into our markets, and the \nPresident has submitted a budget request of $3.6 trillion.\n  Just today, we have decided we will keep General Motors and Chrysler \nalive, when General Motors and Chrysler should go to a prepackaged \nbankruptcy. They could enter bankruptcy, change the parameters on which \nthey are doing business, and emerge as more competitive and efficient \nautomobile manufacturing corporations that could compete with \nautomobile manufacturing here in the United States, only they are not \nlocated in Michigan, they are located in other States. So instead of \nsending General Motors and Chrysler into the prepackaged bankruptcy \nthey deserve, we now have taken the unprecedented step of firing the \nCEO of General Motors--a remarkable move by the Federal Government, I \nthink unprecedented in the history of this country. What does the \nsignal send to other corporations and financial institutions about \nwhether the Federal Government will decide to fire them as well?\n  But the fundamental issue here is, who is too big to fail? Who is too \nbig to fail in America? And what do I tell the businessperson in \nPhoenix, AZ, who is\n\n[[Page S3956]]\n\nabout to have to close their doors because they do not have the \nfinancing and they have not been bailed out? Who is too big to fail and \nwho is too small to survive? That is why we have seen an outpouring and \noutrage over the bonuses paid to executives of financial institutions \nthat they neither deserve nor warrant.\n  The President's budget numbers are simply staggering. On average, he \nadds $1 trillion to the debt every year for the next 10 years. He \nproduces deficits totaling $9.2 trillion over this period, taking \nspending from 20 percent of GDP up to 25 percent of GDP. The deficit \nfor fiscal year 2009 will be more than three times the previous record \nof the biggest deficit. The President's budget also contains $1.4 \ntrillion in tax increases. It resurrects the death tax and, even at \nthis critical time, discourages investment in our economy by raising \nthe top rate on capital gains and dividends by one-third.\n  If the CBO-projected deficits in the budget's outyears prove close to \naccurate, by 2019 Americans would owe a debt that is over 80 percent of \nour gross domestic product--the highest level since 1948--and double \nour debt's current share of gross domestic product. It would create \nmore debt than under every President from George Washington to George \nW. Bush combined. As others have already warned, the Nation would be \nbankrupt, and the America our children and grandchildren inherit would \nbe, for the first time in history, a land of limited opportunities.\n  Beyond the serious ramifications of the budget numbers, we also need \nto be concerned about the very real fight we face over reconciliation. \nThe House has included reconciliation instructions for both health care \nand education. The administration has been clear that it wants climate \nchange added to the reconciliation measures.\n  I recently read where the administration is considering declaring \ngreenhouse gases a health risk. Just 2 weeks ago, the EPA delivered \ndocuments to the White House stating findings that global warming \nthreatens both public health and welfare. If this declaration is made, \nnone of us should be surprised to see changes to environmental law used \nas an opening to fund universal health care.\n  I fully recognize that Republicans have in the past engaged in using \nreconciliation to further the party's agenda. It was wrong then. I wish \nit had not been done. And I hope and I wish it would not be done now. \nBut the groundwork has been laid. I think this would be a grave \nmistake. We should be working on the most pressing issues in a \nbipartisan, thoughtful manner.\n  We are in the midst of a severe recession. The U.S. Labor Department \nannounced that employers cut another 651,000 jobs in February, raising \nthe unemployment rate to 8.1 percent, the highest since 1983. These \nstatistics are dire and argue for Government's intervention to \nstimulate the economy. However, it would be an appalling dereliction of \nduty to use the crisis caused by the global credit crunch, as some \nmembers of the administration have suggested, to excuse profligate \nspending that would not hasten economic growth and that puts the United \nStates on an accelerated path to bankruptcy.\n\n  I believe the President's budget has fallen prey to the siren song of \nshort-term expediency. It is bad economics. The antiquated U.S. Code \nhas driven an increasing number of businesses--especially small, \ndynamic startup ventures--to file their taxes as individuals. Nearly \none-half of Americans work in businesses with fewer than 50 employees, \nand we should focus on keeping those jobs and creating more of them. \nWhile the administration argues that a minuscule number of businesses \nare affected by its proposed tax increases, a majority of small \nbusiness income will be hit by them. Jobs are where the money is, and \nincreasing taxes on jobs endangers the recovery.\n  It is a misguided policy toward fairness. Rising inequality is a 30-\nyear process with its roots in skills and education--not tax policy.\n  Lastly, insulating 95 percent of voters from the consequences of \ntheir electoral decisions is dangerous for a democracy. It is also \nmisleading. Does anyone really believe we can expand all nondefense \nspending to a record share of GDP, reform the health care system that \nis one-sixth of the economy, reinvent the energy portfolio that powers \nour lives, and drive next-generation broadband to every home, while \ncutting taxes for 95 percent of Americans? It doesn't add up, it won't \nadd up, and it won't last.\n  I fully recognize tough choices need to be made in order to get our \ncountry back on course. It is like the old saying, ``Everyone wants to \ngo to heaven, but no one wants to die.'' Except in Washington, it would \nbe, everyone wants fiscal prosperity, but no one wants to force the \nbelt tightening.\n  For two centuries, Americans have worked hard so their children could \nhave better lives and greater opportunity. Do we really want to reverse \nthat order by having our children work hard so we don't have to make \nhard economic choices now?\n  The Federal budget must address the most pressing issues facing our \nNation. Among those priorities are keeping Americans safe and the \nNation secure, enhancing economic growth and raising standards of \nliving, reducing the burden of debt for the next generation, reforming \nour health care system, and shifting to a cleaner, more secure energy \nportfolio. The budget must also ensure that taxpayers' dollars are \nmanaged in the most fiscally responsible manner by targeting resources \nto priorities, spending no more than needed, eliminating waste and \nspecial interest projects, and holding the Government accountable to \nthe taxpayer.\n  We are obviously living in perilous economic times, but with resolute \naction and clarity of vision, we can emerge from this period with \nstrong job growth, rising incomes, restored confidence, and the ability \nto meet our patriotic obligation of passing to the next generation the \nopportunity to make their lives safer, more prosperous, and more \nenriching than our own. We are in a financial crisis, a housing crisis, \nand a consumer-led recession. Why, then, does the President's budget \nenvision borrowing trillions of dollars for new initiatives in \neducation and health care, energy, the environment, transportation, and \ntechnology without any spending discipline or offsets?\n  Of course, those programs sound appealing, but whether you support or \noppose those long-term goals, addressing our most important and \nimmediate problems should be our urgent priority. We have not devoted \nresources to the right problems. We have left our principles behind as \nwe deliver check after Treasury check, and we will not be able to \ncontinue down this road.\n  I hope again that we, on both sides of the aisle, can sit down \ntogether for a change and work out a bipartisan agreement. I believe \nwith the right kind of preparation and the right kind of work, we could \nhave come up with a budget proposal that took into consideration the \nconcerns of those of us on this side of the aisle. As with the stimulus \npackage, as with the omnibus bill, as with SCHIP, and with other issues \nthat have come before this body, there has not been what the American \npeople want so badly for us to do, and that is to sit down and work \ntogether and come up with a common recipe for the common challenges we \nface that affect all Americans, whether they be Republican or Democrat.\n  Again, I regret that this budget, after our usual national--well, I \nwon't go into it, but the budget vote-arama, that this budget will go \ndown, will be passed largely on party lines. I regret that. We will \nhave time in the future, as we are facing other issues such as health \ncare reform, issues of climate change and others--energy independence--\nthat we should be able to sit down together. So far we haven't. I wish \nwe had.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator for his observations \non the budget. I do wish to indicate the budget before us is different \nthan the budget the President sent us. First of all, the Senator \nmentioned reconciliation instructions. We have no reconciliation \ninstructions in this budget--not on health care, not on climate change, \nnot on education. My own belief is that was never the purpose of \nreconciliation. Reconciliation was really designed to be for deficit--\n--\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n\n[[Page S3957]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Does the Senator really believe that reconciliation will \nnot be part of the final budget resolution?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Well, I would say this to the Senator: I don't know, but \nI know it is not part of this resolution, and that was rather intense \ndebate, as my colleague can imagine. I have said publicly and privately \nwhat I believe. I don't believe reconciliation was ever intended for \nthe purpose of writing this kind of substantive reform legislation such \nas health care reform, such as climate change.\n  As people get into how reconciliation actually works, I think they \nare going to be a lot less eager to pursue it. If I could just give two \nexamples.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, would the Senator yield for another \nquestion?\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I am sure one of the things my distinguished colleague is \nreferring to is that after 10 years, whatever the reconciliation would \nthen expire. But I also would again question whether the Senator is \naware that it is accepted as common knowledge that there will be \nreconciliation in this budget resolution when it is finally passed, \nwhether it contains health care reform, education reform, and/or \nclimate change.\n  I do acknowledge, again, before my friend answers, that Republicans \nbegan this, and it was the wrong thing to do. It was the wrong thing to \ndo. Sometimes you reap what you sow. So I fully acknowledge that.\n  However, I think to address an issue as serious as health care reform \nin America, to put it on a budget resolution would be a very serious \nbreach of the customary way the Senate addresses these issues. I thank \nthe distinguished chairman of the Budget Committee for his hard work on \nthis issue for many years.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator. I would just say I am going to argue \nstrenuously against it in conference committee. The Senator asked me \nwhat will be the result. I don't know. Am I going to be able to prevail \nin the conference committee on this matter? I don't know. But I really \ndo think--I hope colleagues who think reconciliation is the answer will \nthink very carefully about how it actually works.\n  Anything in reconciliation, first of all, is subject to the Byrd \nrule. The Byrd rule says any legislative proposal that does not score, \nthat doesn't cost money or save money, is subject to automatic strike. \nAny provision that the score is only incidental to the policy change is \nsubject to automatic strike.\n  Our distinguished Parliamentarian has said, if you try to write major \nlegislation in reconciliation, you will be left with Swiss cheese. So I \nhope people are thinking about that. I know there are attractive \nfeatures of reconciliation, and it is true I think Republicans abused \nit in writing the tax reductions because I deeply believe \nreconciliation was only intended for deficit reduction. So I think it \nwas wrong to have been applied solely for tax reduction during the \nyears the Republicans were in control. I don't think two wrongs make a \nright. I don't think we should do it for substantive legislation that \nis really not deficit reduction legislation.\n  One other thing I wish to say--and I hope people are thinking very \ncarefully about this. The way reconciliation works is there is only one \ninstruction for revenue, one instruction for spending, one instruction \nfor debt in a year. So if you are going to put all of these provisions \ntogether, you are going to have education, you are going to have health \ncare reform. You may well have to do those in one bill--in one bill. \nNow, are we really going to do that? Are we going to have education \nreform and health care reform put in one legislative vehicle? I think \nwe better think very carefully about that. So I thank the Senator from \nArizona for his observations.\n\n  I do wish to stress that the budget we have before us is \nsubstantially different than the budget the President sent, and there \nis a simple reason for that. We have $2.3 trillion less over 10 years \nto write this budget. This is a 5-year budget, so we made $608 billion \nin changes. In spending alone on the discretionary side, we have \nreduced discretionary spending over 5 years by $160 billion--$160 \nbillion. We have changed the mandatory side of the equation by $240 \nbillion. We have changed the revenue line by almost $160 billion. So I \nhope as people look at this budget, they will recognize substantial \nchanges have been made in light of the new forecast. We have attempted \nto be responsible, and we have gotten the deficit down by two-thirds by \nthe fifth year and less than 3 percent of GDP, which is what all the \neconomists say is necessary to stabilize the debt.\n  My own strong belief is we need to do even better than that in the \nsecond 5 years in light of the retirement of the baby boomers and in \nlight of this enormous debt that has been stacked up. Again, that did \nnot happen--it was not the fault of President Barack Obama. He \ninherited a colossal debt. He inherited a colossal fiscal crisis, \nfinancial crisis, housing crisis. It wasn't his fault. He didn't create \nit. He is in on the cleanup crew.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The minority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, first, let me say the job the chairman of the \nBudget Committee has is very difficult. I think I can speak for \nvirtually everybody on our side of the aisle when I say there is a lot \nof respect for the way he has approached this job, especially this \nyear. I, for one, appreciate the comments about the difficulty with the \ndeficits and with the application of reconciliation. I think the \nchairman is exactly right. There are a lot of issues with \nreconciliation, and if it is to be used for the purpose as he \nidentified it, if what Republicans did was wrong, then as lawyers say: \na fortiori, this would be wrong, meaning it is even more the case \nbecause this would be policy that doesn't even relate specifically to \ntaxes, except indirectly.\n  So I certainly hope the chairman can be successful in his efforts to \nremove or to ensure that reconciliation instructions are not included \nas a part of this budget. From my standpoint, primarily because that \nwould effectively take Republicans out of the ball game in terms of \nhelping to write new health care and environmental and energy and \neducation policy, that should better be done on a bipartisan basis, or \nat least to the extent possible on a bipartisan basis. That would be \nvery difficult to do if reconciliation got involved. So I appreciate \nhis efforts in that regard.\n  I wish to begin by quoting a statement that President Obama made at a \nrecent press conference:\n\n       The best way to bring our deficit down in the long run is . \n     . . with a budget that leads to economic growth by moving \n     from an era of borrow and spend to one where we save and \n     invest.\n\n  That is true. I think it is too bad that the President's budget \ndoesn't meet the test he laid out. It borrows and spends more than any \nprevious budget, and its new taxes will retard economic \ngrowth, especially at a time when the stock markets are unsteady, \nconsumers are wary, and unemployment continues to rise, the President's \nbudget should not propose unprecedented spending increases, huge tax \nincreases on individuals, businesses, and families, and deficits as far \nas the eye can see.\n\n  This is not an era of new responsibility. Simply put, the budget \nspends too much, it taxes too much, and it borrows too much.\n  First, with regard to spending, we need to remember that middle-class \nfamilies and small businesses are making sacrifices and tradeoffs in \ntheir own budgets every day. But not in Washington. The Federal \nGovernment continues to spend trillions of taxpayer dollars on bailouts \nand new Government programs. This $3.9 trillion budget continues \nbusiness as usual, making no hard choices about how to rein in out-of-\ncontrol Government spending. It also marks a nearly 20-percent growth \nin nondefense Federal spending since the end of 2008. This budget is so \nbig that, according to the Heritage Foundation estimates, 250,000 new \nFederal bureaucrats may be required to spend it all.\n  Nor is there any intention of cutting back. This budget does not \ncontemplate one-time investments followed by years of reduced spending. \nInstead, billions in new outlays will continue indefinitely. So it is \nnot just about massive spending but about the permanent accruement of \npower in Washington. As the Wall Street Journal recently editorialized:\n\n       With [his] fiscal 2010 budget proposal, President Obama is \n     attempting not merely\n\n[[Page S3958]]\n\n     to expand the role of the Federal Government, but to put it \n     in such a dominant position that its power can never be \n     rolled back.\n\n  Don't be fooled by the word ``investments.'' The lion's share of this \nnew spending is not what a well-run business or IRS would count as an \n``investment,'' such as equipment or other tangible assets. Most of the \nnew spending would be for services where long-term value is difficult \nto measure.\n  Going to the item of taxes, President Obama said he will cut taxes \nfor 95 percent of Americans. But his budget would raise taxes by $1.4 \ntrillion over 10 years. It not only lets some of the existing tax cuts \nexpire--thus raising taxes--but it implements a new $646 billion energy \ntax that will impact every American household, regardless of income, \nand is estimated to increase energy costs for every family by $3,168 \nannually. It is described as a ``downpayment,'' meaning there is more \nto come.\n  This tax is touted as a way to curb greenhouse gas emissions, but \nthere is no way around the fact that it will be a tax on virtually all \neconomic activity, since almost every aspect of our daily lives \nrequires energy from fossil fuels. I recall candidate Obama telling the \nSan Francisco Chronicle that ``under my plan of a cap and trade system, \nelectricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.'' Is this what we need \nor want--especially in a time of recession?\n  It is also important to understand that existing expiring income tax \nrelief for individuals is not a new tax cut. When an Arizona family \nthinks of a tax cut, it assumes it will pay less in taxes from one year \nto the next. The administration claims that if you don't pay more in \ntaxes, you are receiving a tax cut. This difference, to borrow a phrase \nfrom Mark Twain, is like the difference between lightning and a \nlightning bug.\n  The budget also increases taxes on half of small businesses with 20 \nor more employees. So far, during this recession, small businesses have \ncreated all of the net new jobs. Why is this tax a good idea?\n  We are straying too far from the principle that the purpose of taxes \nis to pay for the costs of Government in a way that does the least \ndamage to the economy. Hippocrates' oath for his medical students to \n``first, do no harm'' should also apply to fiscal policy. This budget \nwill not lead to economic recovery. What, in these times, could be more \nimportant?\n  Finally, as to borrowing, there is the deficit. Last year, the \ndeficit was $459 billion. The Congressional Budget Office now projects \na $1.669 trillion deficit in 2009. In 5 years, this budget will double \nthe public debt. In 10 years, it will triple the public debt. After \nbottoming out at $658 billion in 2012--a level still more than 40 \npercent above the highest deficit during George W. Bush's Presidency--\nthe Congressional Budget Office projects the deficit to increase to \n$9.2 trillion in 2019, an astounding 82.4 percent of GDP. It also \ncreates more debt than the combined debt under every President since \nGeorge Washington. Think of that. That is not sustainable, as even the \nPresident's OMB Director, Peter Orszag, has said.\n  Let's not forget the finance charges. Beginning in 2012, and every \nyear thereafter, the Government will spend more than $1 billion per day \non finance charges to holders of U.S. debt. How will this impact the \naverage American family? Federal spending on finance charges for our \nGovernment's debt will be about $1,500 per household for 2009. Under \nPresident Obama's budget, this number soars to nearly $5,700 per \nhousehold by 2019. What happened to his plan to ``spend wisely''?\n  This excessive borrowing increases our dependence on creditors in \ncountries such as China and Japan. These two countries now hold more \nthan a third of our foreign debt. Other countries hold more than half \nof America's total publicly held debt. When other countries hold a \nlarge amount of our debt, they also have leverage to influence our \ncurrency, trade, and even our national security policies.\n  The final point I want to make relates to what I regard as class \nwarfare. I am struck by the language of the budget, starting this class \nwarfare in America. Page 5 of the budget reads:\n\n       While middle-class families have been playing by the rules, \n     living up to their responsibilities as neighbors and \n     citizens, those at the commanding heights of our economy have \n     not.\n\n  Is this true? Is it true that everyone in the upper brackets has not \nlived up to their responsibilities or played by the rules? Many of your \nfamily physicians, for example, fall into the category of top earners--\nafter years of training and mountains of debt from student loans and \nround-the-clock work hours, on call for you and me. Are they guilty of \nnot living up to their responsibilities or playing by the rules? That \nis what the President's budget says.\n  Most high-income people work pretty hard. They contribute to the \neconomy, give to charity, and pay a lot in taxes. The budget complains \nthat the top 1 percent of earners now holds 22 percent of the Nation's \nincome. But it fails to recognize that they also pay 40 percent of all \nFederal income taxes.\n  As Daniel Heninger recently wrote in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       What is becoming clearer as [President Obama's] presidency \n     unfolds is that something deeper is underway here than merely \n     using higher taxes to fund his policy goals in health, \n     education, and energy . . . . The rancorous language used to \n     describe these taxpayers makes it clear that they will be \n     made to ``pay for'' the fact of their wealth--no matter how \n     many of them have worked honestly and honorably to produce \n     it. No Democratic President in 60 years has been this \n     explicit.\n\n  Republicans want to work with the President to get the economy back \non track. But the massive amounts of spending, taxing, and borrowing in \nthis budget will hinder an economic recovery. In times such as these, \nwe have to focus on growing our economy, not growing the Government.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, let's see what we start with \nwhen we start to draw a budget. In this current fiscal year, there is \ngoing to be a deficit of $1.7 trillion; that is, Federal revenues are \ngoing to be less than Federal expenditures by $1.7 trillion.\n  Why did that occur? It occurred for a number of reasons over the last \nseveral years and budgets that were developed that caused the Federal \nGovernment to have a huge deficit. On top of that, you have a declining \neconomy with the tax receipts of the Federal Government, because of the \ndeclining economy going south. As a result, what you have is an ever-\nexpanding deficit because expenditures are going up in times of a down \neconomy, particularly with regard to the stimulus bill and with regard \nto the completion of the appropriations bill for this current fiscal \nyear. All of that spending, with the declining revenues, based on past \npractices, has brought us to this point. So we inherit a deep hole from \nwhich we start.\n  The question is, how do we get out of that hole and, at the same \ntime, how do we stimulate the economy in order that we can get our \neconomic engine running again and get America moving again? I think the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Conrad, has done a magnificent job \nin his mark that takes this present $1.7 trillion deficit in this year, \n2009, downward, or increasing the margin to a narrow margin by which \nthe Federal revenues are exceeded by the Federal expenditures and puts \nthat on a path to where you bring the Federal deficit down to less than \n3 percent of gross domestic product 5 years out.\n  What this budget document does is take us from a position of $1.7 \ntrillion in this year, and then, over the next 5 years, takes it down \nto a position that is about $500 billion--still a huge deficit, but \nwhen you compare it to $1.7 trillion or compare it to the fact that all \nof the economists will testify that any deficit within the range of 3 \npercent is an acceptable deficit to keep the economy going and, in \nfact, the deficit 5 years away is less than 3 percent--it is 2.9 \npercent--then you should have a budget document that puts us on a path \nfor economic recovery.\n  I have heard all of these comments about how this budget is spend, \nspend, spend, and how this is going to run us into bankruptcy, and all \nthat. Well, consider a few facts. First, there is a series of reserve \nfunds for necessary legislation that we want to achieve, such as \nreforming the health care system. Unless we can get a health care \nreform enacted into law, we will have very little chance of getting our \narms around an exploding budget in the future, because you have to rein \nin these health care costs. So a series of reserve funds is set up in \nthe budget.\n\n[[Page S3959]]\n\n  Some would say that is budgetary sleight of hand, until you get into \nthe details of the budget and find out that these reserve funds have to \nbe fiscally or financially neutral and, if they are not, the budget law \nof the velvet hammer is enacted to come down that any exceeding of a \nbudget-neutral reserve fund has the consequence that the expenditures \nin that reserve fund have to be paid for.\n  In other words, the hammer is there if you are not going to produce--\nin this case we are talking about health care reform--a package over 5 \nyears--and in this case I think it is 10 years--then the hammer of the \nBudget Act comes down and says not only is that not allowed, you have \nto bring up a tax revenue in order to pay for whatever the expenditures \nin that reserve fund are.\n  Other reserve funds have to be budget neutral. Clean energy and \npreserving the environment, higher education, child nutrition, and \nWomen, Infants, and Children, infrastructure investments, economic \nstabilization and growth, America's veterans and the wounded \nservicemembers, the judgeships, reforming defense acquisition, \ninvestments in local governments, and strengthening the Food and Drug \nAdministration--each one of them is a reserve fund that has to be paid \nfor. They have to be budget neutral under this budget we are going to \npass. If they are not, the hammer of the budget law comes down on them \nso that not only can you not enact that particular reserve legislation, \nbut, in fact, if you go over it, you have to provide for the Federal \nrevenues that will pay for it. I think we have an enforceable document.\n  I will make one other point and that is that out of this 5-year \nbudget, this document slashes some $800 billion of spending and tax \nrelief, tax cuts from the President's budget--$800 billion. Most of \nthat is slashing spending. Some of that is an elimination of some of \nthe President's tax cuts.\n  The net effect is, it has, over 5 years, a reduction of the deficit \nby $800 billion. That is moving in a conservative fiscal direction. \nPeople are wondering: Did the Budget Committee do anything with the \nPresident's budget? Mr. President, $800 billion is a significant \namount. But that is 5 years. When we project this budget out over 10 \nyears, how much is slashed? It is a whopping $2.7 trillion in the \nPresident's 10-year budget projections.\n  I think it is clear by these numbers that this is a much more \nmoderate or conservative approach to spending and tax policy, and with \nthe hammer, the enforcement mechanism of the budget law governing these \ndifferent trust funds--important legislation that we want to enact--we \nhave a manageable way to take us from fiscal recklessness, where we are \nnow with a $1.7 trillion deficit, to a manageable 2.9 percent of GDP 5 \nyears from now and a deficit that is approximately $500 billion.\n  It would be nice if, over the course of those 5 years, we could move \nback into balance. It would have been nice, 8 years ago when we had a \nsurplus, had we not enacted the budgets that were enacted back then \nthat took us from a position of surplus, to have used that surplus to \npay down the national debt. Instead, a course of action was enacted \nthat took us to huge budget deficits, where we find ourselves today. \nTherefore, we have a situation that is very difficult.\n  To maintain the amount of stimulus in the economy to keep us on a \nstabilized economic road to the future, this budget is about the best \nwe can have. Concurrently, if proposals by the Treasury Department to \nget the banks lending again are starting to work in the economy with a \nstabilized and moderate approach to budgeting, then we will start to \nsee our economy come back to life. It is my hope that this is the \ncommonsense kind of budget blueprint we need going forth for the next 5 \nyears.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, we have heard a lot of concern this \nafternoon about deficits and debt and spending from our colleagues on \nthe other side. I wish to remind them of a little of the history of \nwhat brought us here. This is what happened with spending when they \nwere in charge--spending about doubled in the Bush administration. Of \ncourse, we know the debt more than doubled, and we are left with an \nocean of red ink.\n  That is what this administration inherited. This wasn't President \nObama's doing. This is what he walked into. Here is what happened to \nthe debt and the deficit under the previous administration. They \nactually inherited substantial surpluses, which they rapidly turned \ninto record deficits and then plunged the thing right off the cliff. If \nwe are going to be fair about how we got here, I think the other side \nis going to have to accept an awful lot of responsibility. Here is what \nhappened to the debt--it more than doubled, from $5.8 trillion in 2001 \nto $12.1 trillion in 2009.\n  Senator Gregg, the ranking Republican on the committee, said: I am \nwilling to accept this short-term deficit number, not debate it, \nbecause we are in a recession and it is necessary for the Government to \nstep in and be aggressive, and the Government is the last source of \nliquidity. So you can argue that this number, although horribly large, \nis something we will simply have to live with.\n  That is the ranking member of the Budget Committee. Look, I think he \nis entirely right. The hard reality is we have no choice but to accept, \nin the short-term, these large deficits as the Government seeks to \nprovide liquidity to prevent an all-out collapse. But over time, this \nbudget brings the spending down. I am not talking about the President's \nbudget now. I am talking about the budget I have presented here. We \ntake the budget--total discretionary spending--from 9.5 percent of GDP \nin 2010 down to 7.3 percent of GDP in the fifth year.\n  When you distinguish between defense and nondefense discretionary, \nwhat you see is that I am bringing them both down at about an \nequivalent rate. So defense, in 2010, will be 4.8 percent of GDP; at \nthe end of the 5 years of this budget, it will be down to 3.7 percent \nof GDP. Similarly, nondefense discretionary will be 4.7 percent of GDP \nin 2010, and we take that to 3.6 percent of GDP in 2014.\n  On the discretionary accounts, which is about one-third of all \nFederal spending, on the discretionary accounts, both defense and \nnondefense, I am bringing them both down as a share of our national \nincome and doing it in about the same proportion.\n  We are doing that because, look, we don't have a lot of options. When \nthe President wrote his budget, he had $2.3 trillion more in revenue \nthan we have. Now, he did his budget some time earlier, and the \nforecasts were more robust. Once CBO did their more recent forecast, \n$2.3 trillion was gone. That requires a response, if we are also going \nto answer the President's charge to dramatically bring down the \ndeficit, and we have also done that--from $1.7 trillion in 2009 to just \nover $500 billion in 2014. That is a reduction of more than two-thirds \nin the deficit of the United States.\n  Of course, economists like to measure it in terms of a percentage of \ngross domestic product rather than dollar terms because that adjusts \nfor inflation. But look what we have done in that way: We have gone \nfrom 12.2 percent of GDP in 2009 to less than 3 percent as a deficit \nand share of the economy in 2014--again, more than a two-thirds \nreduction--and we get below the magic 3 percent, which is where most \neconomists say we stabilize the growth of the debt.\n  I am quite proud of what this budget has accomplished in the 5 years \nof its term. I am the first to acknowledge that when Senator Gregg \nstands and says we are not doing enough about the second 5 years, sign \nme up. I agree with him entirely. Certainly, the President's budget has \nfar more debt and deficit in the second 5 years than ours, if you \nextended our policies. But I would say that either one of them doesn't \ndo enough for the second 5 years. We have to do much more. That is why \nSenator Gregg and I have proposed a special procedure to give 16 \nMembers the responsibility to come up with a plan, and if 12 of the 16 \nagree, then that plan would come to Congress for a vote.\n\n[[Page S3960]]\n\n  Now, we changed the President's budget over the first 5 years by $608 \nbillion. That is a lot of money. Madam President, 30 percent of it is \non the revenue side, 31 percent on the discretionary spending. In other \nwords, we reduced the President's spending by $167 billion over the \nnext 5 years. Anybody who doesn't think that is a big deal, come to my \noffice and listen to the phone calls.\n\n  The mandatory spending we reduced by 39 percent of the total $608 \nbillion we changed from the President's budget. So we distributed the \npain about equally. We did it on a proportionate basis.\n  Mandatory spending is the biggest part of the budget, so they took \nmore of the reduction. Discretionary spending and revenue were done of \nabout equal proportion. We tried to be fair. We didn't go to just one \ncommittee of jurisdiction, or two committees, and say: You take the \nwhole burden of making these changes. We went to everybody, and we \nsaid, you know, we have to share the pain and we have to share it \nequally.\n  Again, on the question of spending in the budget that is before us--I \nam not talking about the President's budget. The President's budget is \nnot before us; the budget the Budget Committee has is before this body, \nthe budget that we are going to vote on, which nobody, it seems, wants \nto talk about. They want to talk about some other budget. But they \ndon't have a budget of their own.\n  If our budget is so bad, where is their budget? They don't even have \na budget. So if our budget is so bad, where is their budget? We don't \nsee their budget. I just say this: On nondefense discretionary the \naverage annual increase under the budget resolution is 2.5 percent. \nSome say we ought to just freeze it. I don't think that would be very \nwise to do. That wouldn't even offset inflation. But this is a pretty \ntough budget that is before us. I want my colleagues to know, \nnondefense discretionary spending is increased over the life of this \nbudget on average 2.5 percent.\n  Let's go to that final slide, if we could.\n  Where are the increases in the nondefense discretionary accounts \nunder this budget resolution? You can see, here is where they are. The \nbiggest chunk is defense. More than one-third of the increase is in \nnational defense. That is in part because the President, instead of \nhiding the costs of the war, has put the costs of the war in the \nbudget. That is what we have done. So if you look at the nondefense \ndiscretionary increase under the budget resolution, one-third is \ndefense.\n  Madam President, 14 percent is international and 10 percent is for \nour veterans. We have given the biggest increase for veterans health \ncare ever--and deservedly so. They have suffered the wounds of war and \nthey deserve to have those wounds treated and they deserve to be \ntreated with respect when they come home. So 10 percent of the increase \nis there. Ten percent is education, 10 percent is income security, 8 \npercent is the census.\n  One-twelfth of the increase is the census that has to be done every \n10 years. That is an extraordinary expense, but here it is. We have to \ndeal with it and we do. Natural resources and environment are 6 \npercent, transportation is 3 percent, and ``other'' is 2 percent.\n  The discretionary increase comes in those categories. I hope my \ncolleagues, as they discuss the budget, deal with the budget that is \nbefore us. It is substantially different than the budget the President \nsent us because, again, when the President wrote his budget he had $2.3 \ntrillion more in revenue over 10 years than we do under the new scoring \nthat was done just before we concluded work on this budget.\n  I think the American people would expect us to make changes when the \nfacts change. When the revenue changes dramatically I think they would \nexpect us to make adjustments, and that is what we have tried to do.\n  I am quite proud of this budget document that we have produced, this \noutline for the country, because we have done our level best to keep \nfaith with the priorities established by the President. He said to me, \nwhen I told him we were going to lose $2 trillion--he said: Look, do \neverything you can to preserve my priorities. He said, No. 1: Please do \neverything you can to make sure we can reduce our dependence on foreign \nenergy. That is not just the President's priority, that is the priority \nof the American people.\n  No. 2, he said: Do your level best to preserve my priority by \nfocusing on excellence in education because if we are not the best \neducated, we are not going to be the strongest country on Earth very \nlong--and we have done that in this budget.\n  No. 3, he said: Please preserve my priority on major health care \nreform because that is the place that is going to take us over the \ncliff, in terms of our long-term economic future. That is the thing \nthat is burdening families and businesses and taxpayers, so please do \neverything you can to preserve my key priorities, and do it in the \ncontext of dramatically reducing the budget deficit.\n  We have done that in this budget. We have preserved his priorities on \nreducing dependence on foreign energy, on excellence in education, on \nmajor health care reform. We provided reserve funds, deficit neutral \nreserve funds for each one of those categories, and we have reduced the \ndeficit by two-thirds. We have gotten it down to 3 percent of GDP, \nwhich was his charge to us. We have done it all, even though we faced a \ndramatic reduction in revenue available to us.\n  Does that mean we could just copy the President's budget? Obviously \nnot. We had to make adjustments, and we made $608 billion of \nadjustments over the first 5 years. I believe that was necessary and \nappropriate and prudent, and I hope we can hold onto those changes as \nwe go through the markup. I am already hearing there are people who \nwant to come here and increase the spending. I have already heard \npeople are going to offer amendments to take away some of these \nadjustments. I am told Republicans and Democrats are meeting right now, \nthis afternoon, to figure out how to come in and change this budget, to \nraise the spending. I am told there are a lot of Members represented at \nthis meeting.\n  Let me send a word to them: Change this at your peril. We have \ncarefully crafted this package to be able to win majority support. I \nthink you better think very carefully about changing what we have \nbrought to the floor because you might move it in your direction--more \nspending--only to wind up with a defeat on final passage of this \nbudget. I hope those who are meeting will think very carefully about \ncoming to the floor and trying to increase the spending in this \nresolution.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, we are awaiting a speaker, but while we \nawait the speaker, who is on his way--I think Senator Specter is \ncoming--I want to respond to a couple of points by the Senator from \nNorth Dakota.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire is recognized.\n  Mr. GREGG. He quoted me, with a huge chart--I always appreciate that, \nget my name out there; my eloquence is once again reestablished--but it \nis regrettable that he didn't continue the quote. The point I made in \nthat was that in the short term there is a necessity to spend money \nbecause the Government is the last source of liquidity right now, and \nwe need that in order to try to get the economy going. But what is \ninexcusable about this budget is that in the years 2011, 2012, and \nbeyond spending continues. It goes down from 28 percent to 23 percent \nand then it starts to go back up to 23, 24, 25 percent of gross \ndomestic product. It is spending done entirely by deficits--an average \nof trillion-dollar deficits over the next 10 years under the \nPresident's budget.\n  The point is, of course, you may have to spend now. We do have to \nspend now. The spending is not done that well. It was a total \nmisappropriation of money. The stimulus bill was just walking around \nmoney for different interest groups in which the appropriators happen \nto have a vested interest. Legitimate. Most of them were very nice \ngroups. But most of them didn't stimulate the economy. But after the \nstimulus event is over and the recession has abated, to continue this \nlevel of spending is unconscionable. It creates a debt that our \nchildren will have to bear, a debt that is unfair to pass on to them.\n  My point, of course, is, as we move into the out-years we have to try \nto rein in spending, try to control spending because the issue is \nspending. That\n\n[[Page S3961]]\n\nis the bottom line. The problem is spending.\n  So you have this budget that has been proposed which is dramatically \nincreasing the size of the Government intentionally. The President said \nhe wants to do that. He said: I intend to create prosperity by \nexpanding the size of the Government. He does it through creating a \nmassive amount of debt--$9.2 trillion of new debt over the next \n10 years, running the size of the debt as a burden on our economy up to \n80 percent of gross domestic product--which is not sustainable and \nwhich will basically throw us into a situation where our children will \nnot be able to afford the Government that is being passed on to them.\n\n  So when the Senator quotes me--and I appreciate him quoting me--I \nwish he would continue the sentence or continue the paragraph or the \nthought because it is the rest of the thought where the issue lies. The \nissue doesn't lie in the short term; the issue lies in the long term. \nThe issue lies in what we are passing on to our children. The issue \nlies in the fact that under this budget, as brought to us, the debt and \nthe deficit are exploding at a rate that no country can support. None. \nIt creates financial hardship for this Nation if we continue down this \npath.\n  On another point, the Senator from North Dakota continues to bring up \nthese charts about how they are bringing their deficit down below 3 \npercent, and the President has his up at 4.5 percent. The 4.5 percent \nis not sustainable. Everybody agrees with that. And 3 percent of the \ngross domestic product is barely sustainable.\n  How do they get there? They get there by simply using the old-\nfashioned shell game around here, which has been used for years, which \nis not putting on the budget that which we absolutely know is going to \noccur. At least the President had the decency and forthrightness to put \ninto his budget these things we absolutely know are going to be spent \non.\n  They claim with these reserve funds: ``Oh, we are responsible by \ndoing reserve funds.'' That is a totally disingenuous statement. The \nPresident knows these reserve funds are not legitimate, and that is why \nhe didn't use them. He put it in the doctor's fix and scored it. They \nput in a doctor's fix and don't score $90 billion, approximately. It is \na significant amount.\n  The President said we are not going to have AMT; we are going to have \na permanent fix on AMT. For 3 years this budget that is brought to us \ndoesn't score AMT as revenues, but for the last 2 years it scores it as \nrevenues. Why do they take these revenues even though we know we are \nnot going to get them? So they can make their numbers look better, get \nbelow this 3 percent level, which is just a game.\n  Health care: The President in his budget says health care in his \nreform is going to cost about $400 billion over these first 5 years. Is \nany of that in this budget? None of it. A reserve fund, which is not \neven subject to pay-go, is used in order to mask that number. That \nhelps to get below the 3 percent.\n  I mean, it is the use of the old gimmicks, the things which we at \nleast respect the President for having come forward and saying: They \nare gimmicks, and therefore I am not going to use them. So just lay the \nPresident's numbers over this budget, and you get the exact same \nbudget. When Peter Orszag, Director of the OMB, said there is 98 \npercent identity between these budgets, he was right and the practical \neffect was right.\n  The budget that was brought to the Senate floor is a profligate \nbudget. It is a budget which basically goes out and spends at a level \nof 22 percent of gross domestic product for as far as the eye can see \nand generates revenues of 18 percent, 18.5 percent if they are lucky. \nThat is after they raise taxes on the alleged wealthy--the small \nbusinesspeople of this country, the people who create the jobs--after \nthey have hammered the small businesspeople who create jobs with a $1.4 \ntrillion tax increase, hit us with a national sales tax on our electric \nbills, taking all that money and not using it to reduce the deficit at \nall, just use it to expand spending--after they have done all that, \nthey have this huge gap which runs up debt, debt which is going to be \nunsustainable and unaffordable for our children.\n  It is certainly not appropriate. But at least the President was \nhonest about it and straightforward and did not use a bunch of gimmicks \nto try to hide it so we could have an open and fair debate about it.\n  Unfortunately, that is not the case in the budget that is brought \nforward here. It is a budget which uses these games. Games which for a \nlong time, have been used too often. I probably used a few of them when \nI was chairman.\n  But it is about time, since we have a President who is willing to \ncome forward and say: This is the way it should be done, that we follow \nhis lead and at least have the integrity to say he was right when he \nwas transparent.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, let me be very clear. I absolutely \nreject the notion that the budget the Budget Committee has brought \nbefore this body has gimmicks or is misleading in any way.\n  I tell you what we do. We say things have to be paid for. Let's talk \nabout the reserve funds that were just criticized. The reserve funds \nfor health care, for energy, and education have a condition attached. \nThe condition is, if the committees of jurisdiction come forward with \nlegislation, they have to pay for them. That is the gimmick.\n  In Washington, things are so screwed up they think if you require \nsomething to be paid for, it is a gimmick. I do not think it is a \ngimmick to require things to be paid for. We should have been doing \nthat a long time ago.\n  No. 2, he referenced the docs fix. The docs fix is this. Under \ncurrent law, doctors who treat Medicare patients are going to have a \ncut. The President said: No, they are not going to have a cut. We will \nput it in the budget. But he had no offset for it. We are saying: No, \nwe do not want the docs who treat Medicare patients to get a cut \neither. But, committees, if you produce the savings necessary to do \nthat, we will not have the docs cut. You know what. That is what we \nhave been doing.\n  I am on the Finance Committee. We have been assuring that the doctors \nwho treat Medicare patients do not take the cuts that are in the law. \nBut we have paid for it. That is what this budget does. It says to the \nFinance Committee: Do not cut the docs, but pay for it. Do not just put \nit on the budget, and do not worry about sticking it on the debt.\n  I am proud of that. That is exactly what we should have done.\n  On the alternative minimum tax, we say, for the next 3 years, when we \nare in a time of economic weakness and vulnerability, you can fix the \nalternative minimum tax that will otherwise affect 24 million Americans \nup from 4 million today. We say: No, do not let them get hit with more \ntaxes at a time of economic weakness. But beyond the 3 years, if we are \ngoing to fix the alternative minimum tax--and indeed we should--pay for \nit. Pay for it.\n  That is what this budget says. That is no gimmick. That is being \nresponsible.\n  On health care, the reserve fund says: Yes, we should have major \nhealth care reform. But pay for it. So the administration has said, it \nis their intention to pay for it. That is the intention in this budget, \nthat it be paid for.\n  Let me be clear. These reserve funds, the ones triggered in the \nlegislation are paid for. They call that a gimmick. I call it \nresponsible. I know it is a new concept in this town.\n  Most people here, I have to tell you, our friends on the other side, \ntheir record is not pretty. When they were in charge, they doubled the \ndebt. They were for every tax cut and every spending initiative. The \nresult is they exploded the debt, doubled the debt of this country, \ntripled foreign holdings of debt. We are saying: No, we are not going \nto continue on that path. We insist on a trajectory that dramatically \nbrings down the deficit. That means we have to insist that all these \ngood things get offset, get paid for.\n  Now, the argument on the other side is, it will not happen. Not going \nto happen. We are not going to pay for things. Well, shame on us. Shame \non us if we do not. Shame on us if we do not pay for the doc fix. We \nhave been paying for it. Why all of a sudden do we say we cannot?\n  The alternative minimum tax. I will be the first one to say we have \nnot been\n\n[[Page S3962]]\n\npaying for that, against my votes, because I do not want the \nalternative minimum tax to be imposed. But it ought to be offset so it \ndoes not add to the deficit.\n  The same is true on energy. We should have significant energy \nlegislation to reduce our dependence on foreign oil. But we ought to \npay for it. I was part of a group called the Gang of 10--5 Democrats, 5 \nRepublicans--who became the Group of 20--10 Democrats and 10 \nRepublicans.\n  We came forward with major energy legislation to reduce our \ndependence on foreign energy, but we paid for it. We provided the \noffsets so it did not add to the deficit or the debt. I hope very much \nthat is the principle we adopt.\n  I yield the floor and look forward to my able colleague's rejoinder.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Not to belabor the point, but if they are so devoid of \ngimmicks, why did they waive their own pay-go rule in the health care \nreserve fund? I mean, on the face of it, they lost the argument. It is \ntheir budget. It takes the pay-go rule and emasculates it, and it is \ntheir pay-go rule. They are not making them subject to their own rules \nof fiscal enforcement in their own budget.\n  So, yes, gimmicks are replete. That is just one of them. The \nalternative minimum tax, that is a gimmick. They know they are not \ngoing to get the revenues from AMT. They score the revenue numbers from \nAMT in the last 2 years. That is a total gimmick. Everybody knows that \nis a gimmick here. We do not account for TARP II. Now, maybe they are \nnot going to support their President on TARP II. They do not account \nfor it, so I guess they figure the President does not need anymore \nmoney for assisting the financial stress the country is under; the \nPresident does. We do not account for it.\n  Disaster costs. How do you eliminate disaster costs in the budget and \nclaim it is not a gimmick? We all know there are disasters to fund. My \ngoodness gracious. Clearly, there are disasters that are going to \nrequire significant funding. In an attempt to be forthright on that, \nthe President put in a number. Taken out of this budget. Why? Because \nthey wanted to get under this number, 3 percent.\n  Nothing to do with whether disasters are going to occur or not occur \nover the next 5 years or whether we are going to spend money on them \nover the next 5 years. It was purely an accounting gimmick, nothing \nmore, nothing less than an accounting gimmick.\n  Health care reform. The President's own budget scores it at $372 \nbillion. Do you think this Congress is going to step up and say to the \nPresident: Oh, we are going to pay for this, even though you do not \nthink we should pay for it. I doubt that. I mean, another gimmick. The \nPresident was at least forthright and said it was going to cost $372 \nbillion, and he put it in his budget. Why are they not paying for it on \nthe other side, not because they do not think it is not going to be \nthere, this cost, but because they want to get under this 3 percent.\n  Interest. My goodness. How do you gimmick interest? Well, they did \nit. They are not accounting for the interest, which these expenditures \nobviously incur. Interest is a pretty stable number. You are either \ngoing to get it and have to pay for it or you are not. The fact is, the \ngoal was to look better than the President, even when you were doing \nexactly what the President wanted you to do.\n  It is pretty hard to come here with a straight face and claim your \nnumber is significantly different than the President's. It would be \nnice if it were. I wish it were. I wish it were. But it is not. What it \nall leads to is a massive amount of debt--a massive amount of debt. \nEven 3 percent is not sustainable. But, certainly, the real number, \nwhich is 4 to 5 percent, is clearly not sustainable. Even 60 percent, \nis not sustainable, which is the number they claim they get to. I mean, \nthat is not sustainable. That is not an acceptable number, and, in \nfact, would not even get you into the European Union, it is so \nunsustainable.\n  But it is not the real number, 80 percent is the number, 80 percent \nof public debt to GDP. That is the projected number.\n  So these numbers are staggering. They should give everyone pause and \ncause them to say: What are we doing here? What are we doing to our \nkids? To our Nation? Are we going to hand them off to a country that is \nso deeply in debt, that is running up debt at such a significant rate, \nor are we going to try to kid our kids and say: Oh, well, you know, \nwe--those numbers are not real. You are not going to get stuck with \nthese numbers and this amount of debt.\n  We know we are going to stick them with these numbers and this amount \nof debt. I hear all about this--we have all heard this almost \ninterminably now: Well, the last administration did this, and the last \nadministration did that. I would point out that this Congress was \ncontrolled by the Democratic Party for the last 2 years.\n  So it was not just the Republican President, it was the Democratic \nCongress that was spending money. I have never been one to be very--to \nhave defended the last President on the issue of spending because I \nthought the Presidency did not do a very good job on spending. I voted \nagainst most of the things that were passed around here that spent \nmoney.\n  The Part D premium, which was the worst example, $8 trillion unfunded \nliability. The agriculture bill, massive expansion, inappropriate. \nDone. Highway bill. Massive expenditure, $26 billion dollars of \nearmarks.\n  So, yes, there was failure to discipline the budget on the spending \nside of the ledger in the last Presidency. But there was an accomplice \naround here. It was called the Democratic Congress. Now, regrettably, \nwe have a President who said very openly, he is going to spend money, \nand a lot of it, to promote prosperity by expanding the size of \nGovernment on all these different accounts which he deems to be worthy.\n  I imagine they are worthy. The only problem is we cannot afford them \nas a culture or as a government because the cost to our children will \nbe a debt they cannot bear. You can try to pass a budget that covers \nthat up through games and darts and gimmicks and shell games and \nvarious little exercises in redoing the accounting rules, such as \nchanging pay-go.\n  But in the end, we all know what it is going to lead to, which is a \ndeficit and a debt that is not sustainable and a nation put at risk as \na result of that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, again, there are not gimmicks here. \nThere are requirements to pay for things. I know that seems like a \ngimmick to some because they are not used to paying for anything in \nthis town. But that is what this budget says ought to be the operative \nprinciple: You start paying for things. If you want to have the doc \nfix, and I do, you pay for it.\n  That is what we have been doing in the Finance Committee. We have \nbeen paying for it. The President sent a budget that says you don't \nhave to. But then we lost $2.3 trillion. So we are back to saying: Yes, \nyou have to pay for it.\n  The alternative minimum tax for 3 years, when the economy is down, we \nsay: No, do not raise revenues some other place to offset that because \nthat would not make good economic sense at a time of weakness.\n  But when the economy recovers, offset the costs. That is exactly what \nwe are going to have to do to get the books back in balance around \nhere. The President put into his budget over $200 billion for disasters \nover the next 10 years.\n  The Congressional Budget Office would not score it. They say it is \ntoo speculative. Nobody at this point can tell you what the disasters \nare going to be. Look, I am especially sensitive to this. I have a \nmajor disaster going on in my State right now. I would love to put the \nmoney in. But there is not a soul on Earth who can tell you how much it \nis going to be at this point in time. We do not know if the levees are \ngoing to hold or if they are going to break.\n  To put in a number that has no relationship to any reality, that is \nhonest accounting? I appreciate the President's attempt, but the \nCongressional Budget Office would not score one thin dime of it because \nthey said it is too speculative.\n  I find it so curious. The other side complains all the time about \n``too\n\n[[Page S3963]]\n\nmuch spending, too much debt.'' You do something to reduce spending in \nthe budget I have offered--we cut the President's budget on domestic \ndiscretionary spending by over $160 billion--and now they complain \nabout that.\n  I do not know how you ever get to the end without insisting that \nthings get paid for and reducing spending and trying to get in place an \noverall fiscal condition that puts you on the right glidepath.\n  Now, the gentleman says you do not get to 3 percent of GDP because \nyou have these reserve funds.\n  The reserve funds require, before anything happens, that the reserve \nfunds be deficit neutral. That is a condition, a requirement. So, yes, \nyou do get to 3 percent of GDP on the deficit, because we are not going \nto release those reserve funds, and I am the one who has been given the \nresponsibility to decide whether they are released. We have put in a \ncondition, and I can't release them if they are not paid for. \nHallelujah, let's start paying for things around here.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition to comment on \nthe issue of reconciliation which may, according to some speculation, \nseek to deal with substantive legislative proposals such as health care \nor perhaps even education or perhaps even global warming. I believe any \nsuch effort would be a colossal mistake, to try to change Senate \nprocedures to deal with such substantive measures on a legislative \nvehicle which will take 51 votes instead of allowing for the customary \nSenate debate which could be cut off only by 60 votes.\n  In this Chamber, we had a fierce debate in 2005, where the Democrats \nwere lined up on filibustering President Bush's nominees for the \nFederal courts. Republicans were threatening a so-called nuclear or \nconstitutional option. At that time the Democrats were utilizing the \ntime-honored process of continuing the debate unless Republicans had 60 \nvotes to invoke cloture and cut off debate, which Republicans did not \nhave. The partisan feelings got so high that there was a plan devised \nwhere the system could be short cut, have a ruling of the Chair and \nhave a motion to overrule the ruling of the Chair, have it decided by \n51 votes. Fortunately, that did not occur.\n  Historically, as I spoke at some length on the issue at that time, \nthe filibuster, the extended debate in the Senate, had guaranteed \njudicial independence in the impeachment proceeding of Justice Chase in \nabout 1805, and saved the independence of the Presidency in the \nimpeachment of Andrew Johnson in 1868. So that issue was avoided.\n  Now we have what may well be an effort to circumvent the 60-vote \nrule. The unique feature of the Senate, which has frequently been \ncalled the world's greatest deliberative body, is that any Senator can \noffer virtually any amendment on virtually any bill at virtually any \ntime. That plus extended debate gives this Chamber the opportunity to \nacquaint people with serious problems and to build up public demand one \nway or another. That is an expression of speech and persuasion in a \nsetting where there is opportunity to advance the public good. If we \nstart to shortcut that procedure and undertake major legislative change \non items such as health care or global warming or education, we will \ndestroy a most precious aspect of Senate procedure.\n  According to the Congressional Research Service, reconciliation ``was \ncreated as part of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974 as a way to \nassure compliance with the direct spending revenue and the debt limit \nlevels set forth in the budget resolution agreed to by Congress.''\n  The rules governing consideration in the Senate limit debate to 20 \nhours and, when all amendments are considered, the bill then moves on \nto a final vote. The House Resolution this year instructs the Energy \nand Commerce Committee and the Committee on Ways and Means to produce \nlegislation on ``Health Care Reform'' and for the Education and Labor \nCommittee to produce legislation on ``Investing in Education.'' These \ncommittees could produce legislation on other subjects within their \njurisdiction, including climate change.\n\n  Senator Byrd, in a speech on February 12, 2009, at hearings entitled \n``Senate Procedures for Consideration of the Budget Resolution/\nReconciliation,'' had this to say--and we all know and prize Senator \nByrd's erudition as the leading Senate scholar and spokesman and also \nthe author of the Budget Act of 1974. This is what Senator Byrd said:\n\n       I can say with confidence that the process the Senate \n     utilizes today hardly resembles the process envisioned in \n     1974. Today the reconciliation process serves as a reminder \n     of how well-intentioned changes to the Senate rules can \n     threaten the institution in unforeseen ways. Reconciliation \n     can be used by a determined majority to circumvent the \n     regular rules of the Senate in order to advance partisan \n     legislation.\n\n  Senator Byrd decried and protested loudly and effectively against \nthat process. Earlier this month, March 12, 33 Senators, including 8 \nDemocrats led by Senator Byrd, wrote to the Budget Committee Chairman \nand Ranking Member to ``oppose using the budget reconciliation process \nto expedite passage of climate legislation.''\n  The letter stated:\n\n       Legislation so far-reaching should be fully vetted and give \n     appropriate time for debate, something the budget resolution \n     process does not allow. Using this procedure would circumvent \n     normal Senate practice and be inconsistent with the \n     Administration's stated goals of bipartisanship, cooperation, \n     and openness.\n\n  I think it worthwhile to focus for a moment on what President Obama \nhas emphasized in an effort to get bipartisanship, cooperation, and \nopenness. There are those of us on this side of the aisle who have \ncooperated. I think it fair to say that to misuse the reconciliation \nprocess would be a very strong blow against bipartisanship and \ncooperation. Obviously, it would impede future activity by the Obama \nadministration in reaching across the aisle to get necessary Republican \nvotes.\n  Senator Byrd went on to say:\n\n       I was one of the authors of the legislation that created \n     the budget reconciliation process in 1974, and I am certain \n     that putting health care reform and climate change \n     legislation on a freight train through Congress is an outrage \n     that must be resisted.\n\n  Pretty strong words, ``freight train'' and ``outrage.''\n  There are eight Senators on the letter to the Chairman and Ranking \nMember. I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2009.\n     Hon. Kent Conrad,\n     Chairman, Committee on Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Budget, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC\n       Dear Chairman Conrad and Ranking Member Gregg: We oppose \n     using the budget reconciliation process to expedite passage \n     of climate legislation.\n       Enactment of a cap-and-trade regime is likely to influence \n     nearly every feature of the U.S. economy. Legislation so far-\n     reaching should be fully vetted and given appropriate time \n     for debate, something the budget reconciliation process does \n     not allow. Using this procedure would circumvent normal \n     Senate practice and would be inconsistent with the \n     Administration's stated goals of bipartisanship, cooperation, \n     and openness.\n       We commend you for holding the recent hearing. entitled \n     ``Procedures for Consideration of the Budget Resolution/\n     Reconciliation,'' which discussed important recommendations \n     for the upcoming budget debate. Maintaining integrity in the \n     budget process is critical to safeguarding the fiscal health \n     of the United States in these challenging times.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mike Johanns; Robert C. Byrd; David Vitter; Blanche L. \n           Lincoln; George V. Voinovich; Carl Levin; Johnny \n           Isakson; Evan Bayh; Kit Bond; Mary Landrieu; James E. \n           Risch; E.

One other Senator has been quoted, one other Democratic \nSenator, in Politico last Tuesday, March 24, as warning that the \ncircumvention of regular order could do ``serious damage to our \nbipartisan effort.''\n\n[[Page S3964]]\n\n  We have the statement of Chairman Conrad in the March 26 article in \nthe New York Times stating:\n\n       I don't believe reconciliation was ever intended for this \n     purpose. It doesn't work well for writing major, substantive \n     legislation.\n\n  Senator Baucus, chairman of the Finance Committee, has been very \noutspoken in his opposition. I will quote him as follows from the Hill \non March 26:\n\n       ``Reconciliation would hurt healthcare reform, it would \n     make it partisan, it would hurt, it would stymie it, it would \n     make it very partisan.'' The reconciliation route is not \n     designed to deal with measures such as health care. \n     ``Healthcare reform is so large, you're going to have many \n     provisions that are not directly related to revenue or \n     directly related to spending.''\n\n  The article goes on to point out that Senator Baucus also said that \nputting health care reform under budget reconciliation would require \nthat it be sunset after 5 years. Senator Baucus said:\n\n       It has to be term-limited five years; that's nuts.\n\n  Those are his words. Senator Baucus also said that the only way to \npass ``sustainable'' health care reform would be to attract Republican \nsupport with which reconciliation protection would not be necessary.\n  Taking the eight Senators who signed the letter of March 12, adding \nthe Senator identified in Politico from which I quoted, plus Senator \nBaucus and Senator Conrad, adding those to the 41 Republican Senators \nwho would likely be against misusing the reconciliation process--I \ndon't speak for all of the other 40, but I think that is a fair \ninference--would be 52. That would present finding 50 Senators, plus \nthe Vice President, if he chose to cast the 51st vote, so that the \nreconciliation process would not be possible.\n  It is important that all colleagues focus on this issue \ninstitutionally and how important it is. Whenever you cite numbers, \nthere will always be slippage, but when you have the kind of strong \nlanguage I have referred to today, there is strong reason that we \nshould not have 51 votes somehow created in this body to misuse the \nreconciliation process.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from \nNew Mexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Thank you, Madam President.\n  I thank the chairman for his excellent presentation today on the \nbudget. I have been listening to a lot of this debate, and one of the \nthings we all know is that a budget reflects our values. The President \nand the chairman of the Budget Committee have talked about how the four \nmajor things we are trying to do in this budget are health care, \neducation, energy, and global warming, and also reducing the deficit.\n  I have seen over the years the chairman work on deficit reduction, \nand I know this bill is a very serious bill in terms of moving us \ntoward that goal, as the President has said, over 4 years to try to get \nthis budget under control. I certainly appreciate his hard work.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Udall of New Mexico pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 743 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, from Senator Gregg's time, I yield 15 \nminutes to the distinguished Senator from Utah, Mr. Hatch.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to express my deep concern \nabout the tax increases--both explicit and hidden--in President Obama's \nbudget and in the Democratic budget resolution before us today.\n  Erwin Griswold, the former Solicitor General under President Lyndon \nBaines Johnson, and also President Richard M. Nixon, once said:\n\n       We have long had death and taxes as the two standards of \n     inevitability. But there are those who believe that death is \n     the preferable of the two. At least, as one man said, there's \n     one advantage about death; it doesn't get worse every time \n     Congress meets.\n\n  Unfortunately, this budget would lead to taxes getting worse. In \nfact, they would get much worse, and not just for the so-called well-\noff and well-connected, as the budget refers to those who are targeted \nfor explicit tax increases.\n  The title of President Obama's budget is ``An Era of Responsibility--\nRenewing America's Promise.'' However, this budget is irresponsible as \nto its implications for the next generations.\n  As I have mentioned before many times on this floor, I have 6 \nchildren, 23 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren, and I am very \nconcerned about their future and the future of all of our families \nthroughout America, just as all of our colleagues are concerned about \ntheir posterity as well.\n  When I think about responsibility and the promise of America, I think \nabout these next generations, both in my family and in the families of \nmy constituents, and others, of course. This is why I am so concerned \nabout this budget, and especially the tax burden this budget would \nplace on the next generations of my fellow Utahans and all Americans.\n  This budget includes a number of tax increases, but I want to focus \non just three of the major ones that would particularly affect these \nnext generations.\n  Now, the Obama ``tax-orama:'' There will be a tax hike on America's \nindustrial output and energy, a tax hike on America's job creation, and \na tax hike on America's competitiveness.\n  During his address to Congress last month, President Obama promised:\n\n       [I]f your family earns less than $250,000 a year, you will \n     not see your taxes increased a single dime. I repeat: not one \n     single dime.\n\n  That is what he said. We have heard this promise before. However, \nfrom his first days in office, the President has proposed raising taxes \nand the cost of living on lower income wage earners, as well as on all \nAmericans.\n  Now, how? Through the trillion-dollar-plus cap-and-trade climate \nchange legislation that President Obama is proposing. This proposal, if \nenacted, would force energy and industrial companies throughout America \nto either pass these gargantuan costs on to their customers and \nemployees or go out of business.\n  This tax on America's industrial output and energy is not even called \na tax in the President's budget. Instead, it is referred to as \n``climate revenues.'' However, we should not let that fool us. As the \nold saying goes: If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it is \na duck. This tax, estimated to total between $1.2 trillion and $1.9 \ntrillion over the next 10 years, would be by far the largest tax \nincrease in the history of the world.\n  It is true these new taxes might not be paid directly to the IRS or \nbe withheld from workers' paychecks. Instead, they would be much more \ninsidious. They would show up in the form of higher utility bills, \nhigher costs for consumer goods, lost jobs, and a lower standard of \nliving for everyone.\n  This tax hike on America's industrial output and energy--just think \nabout it, called cap and trade--they refer to as ``climate revenues.'' \nPotentially, it is a $1.9 trillion tax on energy costs and an increase \nin the cost of living.\n  Well, the nasty thing about them is the American family may not even \nknow how much they are paying--just that their standard of living has \ngone down.\n  The administration tries to tell us lower income Americans will be \nheld harmless because the revenues from this new tax will be used to \ncompensate them. Now, we have seen this type of compensation already \nfrom this administration, particularly in the stimulus bill.\n  If you look back to last year, before a Senate Finance Committee \nhearing, Peter Orszag, then CBO Director and now President Obama's \nDirector of the Office of Management and Budget, admitted:\n\n       Under a cap-and-trade program, firms would not ultimately \n     bear most of the costs of the allowances but instead would \n     pass them along to their customers in the form of higher \n     prices.\n\n  That was before the Senate Finance Committee on which I sit, on April \n28, 2008. That is what OMB Director Orszag said about cap and trade.\n  Well, passing these costs on to consumers is bad enough and will \ncause a\n\n[[Page S3965]]\n\ngreat deal of hardship to families and to the economy, but my question \nis, what happens if the firms are not able to pass these costs on to \ntheir customers? The answer is, they will go out of business and jobs \nwill be lost. Either way the American family loses under this proposal.\n  As I mentioned, the President's budget says Americans will be \ncompensated for these higher prices. However, I think a better word for \nthe kind of compensation this budget has in mind is ``income \nredistribution:'' Let's take from those who have and give to those who \nhave not. It is the same philosophy that brought us tax cuts for people \nwho do not pay taxes.\n  Well, I suggest in the name of responsibility that if we want to \nraise taxes on Americans, let's do it in a straightforward way, where \nit is visible and does less damage. Raising taxes on anyone at this \ntime of extreme economic vulnerability is a mistake, but this proposal \ndoes exactly what the President promised never to do and then excuses \nit by saying this is not a tax. Now, that is a bunch of hooey.\n  This new tax on America's industrial output and energy would be a \ncolossal error and could cripple the ability of the next generations to \nreach, let alone exceed, the standard of living we now enjoy. This \nwould be a tragedy because seeing our children and grandchildren do \nbetter than we have done is the real promise of America.\n  If this new tax on our industrial output and energy were the extent \nof the tax increases the President's budget proposes, it would be bad \nenough. Unfortunately, there is more bad news. The budget goes so far \nas to undermine and weaken the so-called stimulus bill enacted in \nFebruary by calling for an increase in taxes that will affect job \ncreation.\n  As we all know, the goal of all of our colleagues is to save or \ncreate millions of jobs. The explicit tax increases called for in the \nbudget, however, would take away the very means for the private sector \nto perform this job creation. It would do this through increases in \ntaxes on capital gains taxes, dividends, carried interest, and by \nraising the top individual rates where most small business income is \ntaxed.\n  Just ask any small business owner who reports his or her business \nincome on their own tax returns, as most do, and they will tell you if \nyou increase taxes for the top two rates, then they will be forced to \neither reduce salaries or put a freeze on new hires. With nearly \n200,000 small businesses in Utah, I do not think Utah can generate \nsubstantial job growth if small businesses face these tax increases. \nThe same is true for other States. Two-thirds of jobs and small \nbusinesses are in firms with employees numbering between 20 and 499. \nThese small businesses are the ones owned by individuals and taxed as \nindividuals who would be targeted by President Obama's tax increases. \nThe Small Business Administration tells us that 70 percent of new jobs \neach year are created by small businesses. Why in the world would we \nwant to harm the ability of America's job-creation engine--small \nbusinesses--to help us create or save the jobs we so badly need right \nnow? This is sheer folly.\n\n  Time and time again, research has shown that decreasing taxes on \nsmall businesses increases employment and raises wages. On the other \nhand, increasing taxes on small businesses hinders investment, \nincluding employment. Research by the Tax Foundation shows that raising \nthe marginal tax rate by 5 percentage points reduces the percentage of \nentrepreneurs who invest by 10.4 percent and lowers their average \ninvestment by 9.9 percent. Reducing the tax rate from 39.6 percent to \n33.2 percent increases the likelihood of hiring by 12 percent and \nraises the median wage for those hired employees by 3.2 percent.\n  These tax increases, which target the so-called wealthy, will miss \nthe mark and hurt everyone, particularly those who lose their jobs or \nwho do not get the job that might have been. The tax hike on America's \njob creation: two-thirds of small business jobs are targeted by \nPresident Obama's tax increases. Seventy percent of all new jobs each \nyear are created by small businesses. These tax increases are going to \nhinder job growth.\n  Tragically, there is even more in this budget that would attack our \nability to create jobs. The third leg of this assault is on America's \ncompetitiveness in a global economy. Beyond strengthening job growth \nfor small businesses, we must also create an environment that \nencourages companies to invest in the United States as well as to \nexpand worldwide to meet growing opportunities. Academic scholarship \nhas shown that domestic companies that invest overseas strengthen their \nemployment at home.\n  Unfortunately, we are moving in the wrong direction already. \nAccording to last year's listings of the world's largest companies, the \nso-called Global 500, only 8 of the top 25 corporations in the world \nwere headquartered in the United States. Forty years ago, almost all of \nthe top 25 were headquartered in America and were American firms.\n  This trend has a significant impact on jobs and the economy in the \nUnited States. Just this past month, several energy companies have \nannounced plans to move to Switzerland because of that country's low \ncorporate tax. To be frank, after looking at President Obama's budget \nproposal, I do not blame them. Such a move could become a matter of \ncorporate survival if we are not careful. In fact, our system of \nworldwide taxation, coupled with one of the highest tax rates in the \nworld, is enough to cause any firm to think twice about locating its \nworldwide headquarters here. And this is before the changes included in \nthe Obama budget, which make the business landscape far less friendly.\n  How are we supposed to be globally competitive when we have the \nsecond highest corporate tax rate in the world? Our corporate tax rate \nis currently at 35 percent, second only to Japan's, with the average \nglobal corporate tax rate around 26 percent. It is no wonder that many \ncompanies in the United States are looking elsewhere. These are tax \nhikes on America's global competitiveness. Think about that. Domestic \ncompanies that invest overseas strengthen their employment at home. The \nUnited States is one of the few major nations to tax companies on \nworldwide income. The average global corporate tax rate here is 35 \npercent. We are the second highest in the world, second only to Japan.\n  The President believes our Tax Code includes incentives for U.S. \nbusinesses to ship jobs overseas, and the budget includes vaguely \ndefined proposals that would supposedly put an end to this practice. \nHowever, the evidence shows that our tax laws do not lead to U.S. job \nloss but to increases in U.S. employment when companies invest \noverseas.\n  In summary, the Obama budget for fiscal year 2010, along with the \nbudget resolution before us today, is a three-pronged assault on \nAmerican job creation through new taxes on America's industrial output \nand energy, tax increases on America's job creation for small \nbusinesses, and tax increases on America's competitiveness. This \nassault is a huge contradiction to the stated goals of the President to \ncreate or save 4 million jobs. I know he is sincere and believes he can \ndo that, but not with this budget. While it is true that most of these \ntax increases will not hit until 2011, this is likely to be just as \ndangerous a time for these job-killing tax hikes as 2009 would be. Most \neconomists believe that if we are lucky, we will just be beginning to \nrecover from this ugly recession in 2011. Instead of these antigrowth \npolicies, we should be enacting policies of support, investment, and \ngrowth.\n  The great American satirist Ambrose Bierce once described \nresponsibility as:\n\n       A detachable burden easily shifted to the shoulders of God, \n     Fate, Fortune, Luck, or one's neighbor. In the days of \n     astrology it was customary to unload responsibility upon a \n     star.\n\n  In President Obama's budget titled the ``Era of Responsibility,'' \nPresident Obama is attempting to unload responsibility on future \ngenerations. This is the wrong way to go. I hope we can make some \nchanges to the budget this week that will help us grow the economy \ninstead of growing the size of the Government. A stronger economy is \nthe best legacy we can leave to the next generation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, just one part of what the Senator has \nsaid do I wish to seek to clarify, and that is that while the United \nStates does have\n\n[[Page S3966]]\n\nthe second highest stated corporate rate, we have one of the lowest \neffective corporate rates in the industrialized world. The reason for \nthe difference is all the exemptions and exclusions that exist in our \ncode for corporate rates. So while we do have the second highest \npublished or nominal rate for corporate taxes, if you look at all of \nthe industrialized countries in the world and what their effective \ncorporate tax rate is, you find that ours is well below average.\n  Now, that doesn't mean we shouldn't have tax reform because many of \nus believe we need thoroughgoing tax reform, but I think there is a \ncertain amount of confusion about the difference between our statutory \nrates and our effective rates.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, if the Senator will yield on that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to.\n  Mr. HATCH. I understand the nominal rate argument. The problem is \nthat we are talking about taxing the corporate profits that are earned \noverseas. No other major industrialized nation in the world does that. \nIf they do that, they make us globally uncompetitive.\n  In just the last couple of weeks, I have been trying to raise money \nfor the National Republican Senatorial Committee. As I have called \naround, it is amazing to me how many corporate executives have said to \nme: We love this country. We want our companies to grow in this \ncountry. We want to be able to stay here.\n  Some of them are second-generation folks. But I have had a number of \nthem say that if we do some of the corporate tax changes and some of \nthe tax expenses that are assessed in this bill, they will move. One in \nparticular said: I am going to have to move my company to Switzerland \nbecause we will not be competitive if that particular budget passes.\n  Now, I believe we can make arguments that the nominal rate may be \nsomething that must be considered, and I think it should, but I don't \nthink you can argue against the fact that we are doing some very stupid \nthings in this budget. Frankly, in the end, we might wind up having a \nlot more difficulty and we may lose even more of our major businesses \nbecause to be competitive they will move, and a lot of them have \nalready moved.\n\n  So let's wake up around here and let's realize that--look, I respect \nthe distinguished Senator from North Dakota. He has one of the tougher \njobs--he and our colleague, the Senator from New Hampshire, Judd Gregg, \nhave one of the tougher jobs in the history of the country. Doing these \nbudgets is very difficult with some of the problems we have. But I have \nlisted three things that are going to sock corporate America like you \ncan't believe. Frankly, one of them is the third point on the prong, \nand that is taxing corporate profits overseas. It is just a matter of \nreality that if we do this, we are going to reap the whirlwind. It is \njust that simple.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, if my colleague from North Dakota would \nyield for a question on this subject.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Our colleague from Utah, Senator Hatch, if he would just \nobserve, this issue is not a new one. I know Senator Grassley, who is \non the Finance Committee, is here, and there has been a lot of \ndiscussion about this: Do we have an extraordinarily high rate of \ntaxation on corporations or don't we? We just heard on the floor that \nwe rank I think the second highest in tax rates on corporations. Well, \nthis is not some arcane discussion between people who can't understand \nexactly what is happening. We rank, I believe, third from the bottom in \nthe rate of taxes paid by corporations of all of the OECD countries--\n30-some countries, we rank third from the bottom, not from the top.\n  So they come out here and say: Well, we have a high rate. Our \nstatutory rate is high, toward the top, no question about that, but \nthat is not what corporations are paying. They are not paying the rate, \nthey are paying the rate minus all of the deductions and loopholes. The \nfact is, the corporate tax burden in this country is right close to the \nbottom of all of the other industrialized countries. Now, this ought \nnot be debatable. We can easily find out what the facts are. So are we \ncompetitive with respect to the corporate income tax? The answer is \nyes.\n  I understand why the Chamber of Commerce and others want to \nperpetuate this notion that somehow we overtax corporations, but, in \nfact, the taxes paid by American corporations rank right near the \nbottom of all of the 30 or so OECD countries, the industrialized \ncountries--right toward the bottom, not the top. That is what they, in \nfact, pay. If we are going to debate public policy, let's debate it \nwith a set of facts so that we all understand what the facts are. The \nfact that people are talking about this in the context of what is the \ntax burden on corporations? The answer is, we are toward the bottom of \nall of the OECD countries. Those are the facts.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, the Senator is correct. I am on the \nFinance Committee, and I have this responsibility on the Budget \nCommittee. It is very clear, while we do have a high nominal rate--I \nthink we are second highest in the industrialized world--the effective \nrate that companies actually pay, we are near the bottom.\n  At this point, I wish to yield 25 minutes to my colleague from North \nDakota.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I know this is a very important debate, \nthis issue of the budget. This is: What are our priorities? I have said \noften that 100 years from now, we will all be dead and the only \nevidence of what our value system was right here, right know, will be \nevaluated by historians. Historians will be alive, and they will look \nback and say: What did that country believe in? What was their value \nsystem? What did they think was important? What did they invest in? So \ntake a look at all of this and then make judgments.\n  We will have a debate all this week on this issue: What is important \nfor the country? What do we believe represents our highest set of \nvalues? Kids? I have always said I know what might be in second, third, \nor fourth place in people's lives, but I certainly know what is in \nfirst place--their kids, right? So what about our budget with respect \nto health care for kids, just as an example. When we establish the \npriorities of what is important in our country, this is where we do it: \nin the budget. We debate it, we think about it, and then we say: This \nis what our country believes to be important. Here is what we should \ninvest in to make this a better place in which to live.\n  I came to the floor to say something about the financial crisis and \nthe financial meltdown in our country because that has a profound \nimpact on this debate on the budget. This financial meltdown has begun \nto dry up the Federal revenues on the tax side. It has pushed up \ndramatically the expenditure side because we have what are called \nstabilizers in our economy. When people lose their jobs, they get \nunemployment checks. So we have these economic stabilizers that \nincrease spending, even during this financial crisis when you see \ndecreased revenue. That has a huge impact on this budget.\n  If this financial crisis has this kind of an impact on the budget, \nthen we have a right to know what has caused all of this to happen, and \nwhat can we do to make sure it never happens again.\n  Last week, the Secretary of the Treasury announced a number of steps \nfor financial regulatory reform, and those are a move in the right \ndirection. He says we are going to regulate hedge funds, we are going \nto require the oversight of what are unregulated derivatives--these \nfancy, exotic financial products these days--we are going to require \nmany of them to be regulated, although not fully. He needs to go \nfurther. But the Secretary is moving in the right direction to regulate \nhedge funds, to get rid of this dark money and bring derivatives and \nCDOs and credit default swaps and so on into the daylight. Then he \ntalks about a powerful regulator that would be able to take a look at \nsystemic risks and so on. I think all of that advances the ball and is \nin the right direction.\n  But this doesn't yet answer the larger question we have to answer \nwith respect to this financial crisis and this meltdown. That larger \nquestion, using an automobile metaphor, is this: Is it time for a \ntuneup or is it time for a complete overhaul of the system? I come down \non the side that you have to overhaul the entire system if you are \ngoing to provide the confidence needed in the American people going \nforward.\n\n[[Page S3967]]\n\n  Now, let me explain how I see what has gone on. For the last 15, 20 \nyears, we have had a bunch of people who were worshiping at the altar \nof this new type of finance--new financial instruments, new larger \nfinancial institutions, securitized credit, and selling the risk \nforward so that someone giving a home loan to a prospective homebuyer \ndoesn't have to underwrite it or care so much about the risk, because \nthey can sell that risk to an investment bank or a hedge fund, and sell \nit several times--these fancy, complex financial products.\n  I mentioned credit default swaps. There also has been a dramatic \nexpansion of debt and leverage with almost every part of our financial \nenterprise in this country. Congress repealed the protections that used \nto exist for banks called the Glass-Steagall Act. Congress not only \nrepealed these protections that used to protect banks so they could not \ninvest in real estate and securities, and so on, but then allowed for \nthe creation of the very large holding companies so they could get \ninvolved in one big financial swap--one-stop shopping. Gramm-Leach-\nBliley did this, supported by the Clinton administration, I might say. \nThese are all new-fashioned ideas. They got rid of the old-fashioned \nideas, such as Glass-Steagall--just deregulate the market and don't \nworry about them.\n  Alan Greenspan chimed in, saying: I want to make a nice sound with \nall of this deregulation that is going on in Congress and I believe in \nself-regulation. We don't have to regulate. The Chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board, Mr. Greenspan, said that would work. The lending terms \nand the incomes were from outer space; the incomes were unbelievable in \nall of these areas. And then the lending terms were completely \nunsupportable, and I will describe a few of those today.\n  We need to overhaul all this. What do we do to overhaul this? We have \nto get rid of this too-big-to-fail notion. We are now allowing banks \nthat are too big to fail to merge with troubled banks, making them, \napparently, too much bigger to fail, which is bizarre. We need to get \nrid of the holding companies, which never should have been allowed to \nhappen in the first place. We need to go back to Glass-Steagall and \ncreate a portion of that to separate banking from the other risk \nenterprises.\n  Until we do that and address those fundamental questions, I think it \nis going to be very hard to instill the kind of confidence we want to \ninstill in the American people. The New York Times asked the question \nin their editorial on Sunday of this week: What is it we are trying to \nfix? What caused the meltdown?\n  If you go back to the mid-1990s, I wrote an article in the Washington \nMonthly Magazine that was a cover story in 1994, I believe. The title \nwas ``Very Risky Business.'' I wrote about derivatives, and I wrote \nthat about tens of billions in derivatives that then existed. I \nintroduced four pieces of regulation to regulate derivatives trading. \nNone of it was acceptable because those involved in the new, modern \napproach to finance felt that you don't regulate these things. They \nwill self-regulate and everything will be fine.\n  Of course, it was not fine and we had not only the notion of too big \nto fail, but the repeal of Glass-Steagall. We had the deregulation of \nall of this and the fusing of banking with riskier enterprises in \nholding companies. Regulators came to town boasting about the fact that \nwe were willing to be blind. We had products developed that were hard \nto understand for even those engaged in trading them. Coupled with \nthat, we had an unbelievable culture of greed, and the result was a \nfinancial meltdown.\n  The question is, what has caused, as the New York Times said, this \nhouse of cards? What is the cause? Do we know? Well, the fact is we \nneed to know in order to move forward. The American people need to \nknow. There needs to be a narrative that says here is what happened. We \nunderstand a portion of what happened, and it has been a calamity. \nNobody understands all of it. The Attorney General of New York is doing \nsome investigations here and there, but there is no comprehensive \ninvestigation. I believe there ought to be a select committee of the \nSenate, and I have introduced such legislation, with Senator McCain as \na cosponsor. I believe we must do a select committee of the Senate to \naddress these issues. I believe we also ought to have a financial \ncrimes task force at the Justice Department to prosecute that which is \ndiscovered is illegal--a whole series of things.\n  We need to reconnect Glass-Steagall and decide that too big to fail \nis a doctrine that itself is old-fashioned, and we have to run our \nbanks through a banking ``carwash'' of sorts, where you get rid of the \nbad assets and keep the good and rename them, if necessary. We need a \nbanking system that is a circulatory system of our economy. But we \ncannot ignore what happened. We have to understand what happened and we \nhave to fix it.\n  Let me go back to 1999, if I might, during the debate over the repeal \nof Glass-Steagall and passage of a bill called Gramm-Leach-Bliley. I \nwas one of eight Senators who voted against it. On May 6, 1999, I said \nthis bill will, in my judgment, raise the likelihood of future massive \ntaxpayer bailouts. It will fuel the consolidation of mergers in the \nbanking and financial services. I said that 10 years ago. I felt that \nwould happen if we decided to let the big banks get bigger, without \nregulatory involvement. I said during that debate that we will, in 10 \nyears time, look back and say we should not have done that repeal of \nGlass-Steagall, because we forgot the lessons of the past.\n  I wish this didn't happen, but it did. I wish to talk about what we \ndo now. There are four steps. One, investigation. We need to find out \nwhat happened here. The New York Times has said--and I agree--in their \nquestions on reform--in Sunday's editorial, it says that without an \ninvestigation, the reform effort will be, at best, hit or miss and, at \nworst, a charade.\n  Congress should start now to gear up for an investigation, using as \nits model the 1930s Pecora inquiry into the stock market crash, or the \nWatergate hearings of the 1970s. Here is a picture of Mr. Pecora, whom \nI described. Mr. Ferdinand Pecora was chief counsel of the Senate \nBanking Committee during the 1930s investigating the Wall Street \nbanking and stock brokerage practices. He was involved in an \ninvestigation that I think was a very important one with respect to the \ncause and effect of the Great Depression. A real investigation is \nnecessary and it will at least give those people who are furious about \nwhat happened an understanding and an outlet to understand and be a \npart of knowing what happened.\n  Now, I want to talk about the roots of some of this and why I think \nit is scandalous. The trigger of this financial crisis, I think, was \nthe subprime scandal. Under the subprime scandal, there was so much \ndebt and leverage that it was nearly unbelievable. We need something \nsuch as that to develop the narrative of what happened.\n  Let me describe the triggering mechanism with respect to the subprime \nlending. I went to the Internet today, and I will read a couple of \ninvitations on the Internet. This is from speedybadcreditloans.com:\n\n       Do you want your loan approved on the terms you desire, \n     with easy credit and no credit check? This is the smartest \n     and fastest way to get the money you need for a home loan. \n     Bad credit, no credit, bankruptcy, you have been declined \n     before? Don't worry at Speedy Bad Credit Loans we have \n     lenders dealing with all kinds of credit loans. You will get \n     the money you need, and fast.\n\n  That is today. They are willing to loan on those terms today.\n  You can go to the Internet and find a dozen of these. In fact, I will \nshow you this. Leading up to this crash, this financial crisis, Zoom \nCredit said this in their advertisement:\n\n       Credit approval is seconds away. Get on the fast track, and \n     at the speed of light they will approve you. Even if your \n     credit is in the tank, Zoom Credit is like money in the bank. \n     We specialize in credit repair and debt consolidation. \n     Bankruptcy, slow credit, no credit, who cares?\n\n  Is it a surprise that a financial system that allows this nonsense to \ngo on somehow, at some point, collapses? That is not a surprise to me.\n  Here is Millenium Mortgage's advertisement:\n\n       Twelve months, no mortgage payment. That's right, we will \n     make your payments for the first 12 months. Our loan program \n     may reduce your current monthly payment by as much as 50 \n     percent and allow you to make no payments for the first 12 \n     months. Call us today.\n\n  Countrywide, the single largest mortgage company in America--by the \nway,\n\n[[Page S3968]]\n\nits CEO was able to get out of this with around $140 million, or so, I \nam told. They said:\n\n       Do you have less than perfect credit? Do you have late \n     mortgage payments? Have you been denied by other lenders? \n     Call us. Are you a bad risk? Call us, we will lend you some \n     money.\n\n  What did the biggest mortgage company in our country do? It made all \nthese mortgages and then wrapped them up into securities--they \nsecuritized them. I have described it like the making of sausage, when \nthey used to pack them with sawdust as filler. They packed these \nsecurities with good loans, bad loans, subprime loans, and conventional \nloans, and sold them to an investment bank, or a hedge fund--and, by \nthe way, when you read about the toxic assets in the bowels of these \ninstitutions, these are the toxic assets.\n  Is it a surprise? This is bad business. They all made big money. They \nwere like hogs at a trough, with unbelievable greed. They made massive \namounts of money. Yet they were able to sell the risk forward, and the \npeople in the hedge funds made money, and the people in the investment \nbanks made money. The amount of money they made is unbelievable. Bear \nStearns went belly up. Alan Schwartz, the CEO of Bear Stearns the 5 \nyears prior, made $117 million. Jimmy Cane, the previous CEO, 5 years \nprior, made $128 million. At Lehman Brothers, Dick Fuld, 5 years prior \nto him going bankrupt, made $350 million. This was a carnival of greed. \nEveryone was doing well, except the economy, with this unbelievable \navalanche of debt and leverage that all completely collapsed.\n  Now, we have a situation today where we have the American people \ntrying to figure out what happened. I described the subprime loan \nscandal, which was at its roots. They were all making a lot of money by \nvictimizing the American people. I should say some of the people were \nnot victims. Some of these folks were willing victims because they \nwanted to buy a house with a special deal and flip it and make money. \nThey got caught. They are not really victims. They were trying to \nprofiteer. A lot of other folks were victims of this sort of scam.\n  I mentioned that these big investment banks took on all these assets \nand then got bailed out, and we now think there is $9 trillion of \nAmerican taxpayers' money at risk going out through the back door of \nthe Federal Reserve Board, Treasury, and the FDIC--$9 trillion. There \nhas never been a hearing about that. No one has been able to get the \nFederal Reserve Board before a hearing to tell us where those trillions \nof dollars are pledged, who got the money, and how much money did they \nget. You cannot find out. The information we do have is pried out of \nthe Federal Reserve Board. Bloomberg News corporation filed a lawsuit \nto get some of this information. That is unbelievable.\n  I mentioned these big financial firms that got all these bailouts. \nAbout $45 billion in TARP funds have gone to Bank of America. Bank of \nAmerica got $30 billion in January of this year. Bank of America, last \nSeptember, was urged to buy Merrill Lynch, a failed investment bank, by \nthe then-Treasury Secretary Paulson. So what happened was the marriage \nwas arranged by the Treasury Secretary and was going to be consummated \nin January. It turns out that in December, Merrill Lynch, which lost \n$27 billion in 2008, paid $3.6 billion in bonuses to their employees.\n  Let me say that again. An investment bank called Merrill Lynch that \nlost $27 billion--$15 billion in the fourth quarter alone--paid $3.6 \nbillion in bonuses in December just prior to being taken over by Bank \nof America. Then Bank of America received $20 billion in TARP funds \nfrom the American taxpayers--in addition to $10 billion it had just \nbeen paid, which was initially allocated to Merrill Lynch. Pretty \nunbelievable.\n  Here are the Merrill Lynch bonuses, $3.6 billion. The top four \nexecutives got $121 million. This is for a company that lost $27 \nbillion last year and was a failing company. Madam President, 694 \nexecutives got more than $1 million each. These are bonuses that would \nnormally have been paid in January. They were paid in December, and my \nsuspicion is they were paid by arrangement with Bank of America to be \npaid before the end of the year and before $30 billion went from the \nAmerican taxpayers to Bank of America that just took over Merrill \nLynch. That means, in my judgment, the American taxpayers paid bonuses \nto those who worked for a company that lost $27 billion in a year.\n  Do people have a right to be furious about this situation? You bet \nthey do, and they should.\n  There are a lot of needs we have in this country to try to find a way \nto fix this situation so it never happens again. But as I have \nindicated, the first step, it seems to me, always is to try to \nunderstand what has happened and what to do about it.\n  The Washington Post had a story recently. In fact, I believe it was \nan editorial. They talked about the fact that hedge funds were not a \npart of the problem in this financial meltdown. I don't know about \nthat. Let me show some examples of incomes at the hedge fund level. \nThis is a man named James Simons. There is no implication here about \nbeing right or wrong, legal or illegal. My point is about the \nspectacular amount of income, what I call incomes from outer space. Mr. \nSimons made $2.5 billion last year--$2.5 billion. It is interesting. He \nruns a hedge fund.\n  Here is a man named John Paulson, who also runs a hedge fund. He made \n$2 billion last year. It seems to me he is probably profoundly \ndisappointed because the year before, John made $3.7 billion. And, oh, \nby the way, my best guess is that each of them probably pays a 15-\npercent income tax rate, something called carried interest. But that is \nanother story for another day. They pay income tax rates, in most \ncases, that would be below the marginal tax rate paid by their \nreceptionist in their office. That is not their fault. That is the \nfault of the Tax Code and the fault of this Congress for not changing \nit.\n  John Paulson last year made $3.7 billion. He has a reason probably to \ncome home and say: Honey, we need to tighten our belt here. Madam \nPresident, $3.7 billion--by the way, that is $10 million a day. In \n2007, he made in 4 minutes what the average worker works for a year to \nmake. Incomes from outer space, big old hedge funds--they play a role \nin this collapse. The Washington Post said they have played no role. \nOh, really? Really? Where are they in the food chain of derivatives, \ncredit default swaps, CDOs? Does the Washington Post know? Of course, \nit doesn't. It doesn't have the foggiest idea what role hedge funds may \nhave played in this situation.\n  What we do know is there is a lot of dark money out there traded off \nthe exchanges. Nobody knows what risk you have. That is why you have \nhad all these big-shot bankers walking around acting like they are in \nsome sort of seizure because nobody knows how much risk has been taken \non. Every time we turn around it is more. It is billions, hundreds of \nbillions, then trillions of dollars.\n  As I said earlier, we need to create a select committee in the Senate \nand soon. It is this body's job. We are the ones who send the money \nout. We are the ones who have said we are going to provide $700 billion \nof TARP funds. It is our responsibility to track it and to understand \nwhat has caused its need.\n  Second, I think there is a substantial reason--by the way, there are \nsome attorneys general of this country, including Mr. Cuomo in New \nYork, who are doing first-rate work in investigating. But I think there \nis substantial reason to believe there is a need for a national \nfinancial crimes prosecution task force.\n  Do I think all of this is criminal? Not at all. I think some of it is \nborn of ignorance, some of it is born of greed, some of it is born of \ndeliberate, willful blindness. But there are some, in my judgment, who \ndesperately deserve to be investigated and, if necessary, prosecuted.\n  Finally, real reform. Real reform exists when we have real \nregulators, when we revisit 1999 and restore a portion of Glass-\nSteagall, when we decide to take down the ceilings and walls of these \nlarge holding companies, when we decide we are going to restore, once \nagain, trust in banks.\n  Let me also say that in my home State, I visit with a lot of \ncommunity bankers. They are not at risk. They did not do this. They did \nnot invest in these assets. Most of them did banking the old-fashioned \nway. They took deposits and made loans. When they\n\n[[Page S3969]]\n\nmade loans, they underwrote the loans. That is the way banking ought to \nbe done. We need to revisit that with respect to some of the largest \nbanking and financial enterprises in our country.\n  I am convinced we can fix all of this. I understand there is great \nanxiety. None of us have been here before. No one quite knows what is \nthe medicine to try to address this economic illness. I understand. \nThere is reason to be anxious. But I am also convinced we can and we \nwill find the opportunity to put this back on track and fix what is \nwrong in this country. We will not fix what is wrong unless we \nunderstand the core and root cause of what has happened.\n  There is nothing I see--nothing I see--that is going to give us that \nanswer. It is our responsibility. If we are required to put up the \nmoney, to try to find a way to invest in future health and so on, it is \nour responsibility to find out what happened and make sure it cannot \nhappen again.\n  Steps are being taken in the right direction. I applaud those steps \nby the Treasury Secretary and others. But we are not nearly there with \nthe giant steps that are necessary to fix that which has been existing \nnow and growing for a decade or two.\n  Finally, I was telling a group the other day about Ray Charles, who \nused to sing that great song ``America the Beautiful,'' when he sang `` \n. . . spacious skies, For amber waves of grain, For purple mountains \nmajesties. . . .'' The interesting thing about Ray Charles, who sang \nthat song unlike anybody else could sing it, was he was blind. Somehow, \nto me, it always meant it wasn't so much someone being able to see this \nas it was to experience what the idea of America is. America is an \nidea. Part of this idea, born over two centuries now, is we have the \ncapability to do almost anything if we get together and decide to work \ntogether. We can do that now. We can put this country back on track. \nThis is a financial collapse of significant proportions, perhaps the \ngreatest crisis we have faced since the Great Depression. But I am not \ndespondent about that if we can begin to take the steps--not the baby \nsteps but the big steps--in the right direction to decide to fix what \nwent wrong. The first step to do that always is to understand what went \nwrong and then join together and say: We can make this right; we can \nmake a better future happen if we decide to link arms and come up with \nthe answers.\n  I am going to speak, at some point later, on the budget as well. But \nnothing impacts this budget in a more profound way than the financial \ncollapse and meltdown which we have seen. It dramatically increases the \nneed for funding for economic stabilizers, unemployment and so on and \nit substantially reduces the revenue. It has caused a substantial \nincrease in deficits. Even as we debate this budget going forward for 2 \nyears, 5 years, 10 years, the fact is we have to get this right. We \nhave to put this economy on track, and I believe we can do that if we \nmake the right decisions very soon.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, at this point, I yield to the Senator from \nIowa, and I ask unanimous consent that upon completion of his \nstatement, unless the Democratic membership has a speaker to intercede, \nthe next speaker be the Senator from South Dakota, who will be \nrecognized to offer the first amendment, which I understand on our side \nis going to be acceptable.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot object, the point is following the next Democratic speaker, if \nthere is one?\n  Mr. GREGG. Yes.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I do not have an objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today the Senate begins consideration of \nwhether we should apply more or less budget discipline to record debts \nand deficits that my President, President Obama, inherited when he came \ninto office January 20 of this year.\n  Last week, we heard a lot of revisionist fiscal history or it might \nbest be described as heavy editing of recent budget history. Our \nPresident has alluded to it several times. I agree with the President \nthere is a lot of revisionism in this debate. The revisionist history \nbasically boils down to two conclusions: The first is that all the good \nfiscal history of the 1990s was derived somehow from a partisan tax \nincrease bill that passed in 1993; and that, two, all the bad fiscal \nhistory of this decade to date is attributable to the bipartisan tax \nrelief plans of 2001 and later.\n  Not surprisingly, nearly all the revisionists who speak generally \noppose tax relief and support tax increases. The same crew generally \nsupports spending increases and opposes spending cuts.\n  In the debate so far, many on this side of the aisle have pointed out \nsome key and undeniable facts. It might surprise you, but we happen to \nagree with President Obama on one key fact. This President did inherit \na big deficit and a lot of debt.\n  During the last quarter of 2008, the antirecessionary spending, \ntogether with lower tax receipts because of the recession, and the TARP \nactivities has set a fiscal table of a deficit of $1.2 trillion. That \nwas, in fact, on the President's desk when he took over the Oval Office \non January 20 of this year. That is the highest deficit as a percentage \nof the economy in post-World War II history inherited by any of the \nPresidents since World War II.\n  Quite obviously, this is not a pretty fiscal picture. I have a chart \nthat shows the history of that fiscal time, through the last \nadministration and the big deficit at this point about which President \nObama speaks.\n  As predicted a couple months ago, that fiscal picture got a lot \nuglier with the stimulus bill. For the folks who saw that bill as an \nopportunity to recover America, with Government taking a larger share \nof the economy over the long term, I say congratulations because you \ngot what you wanted. For those Senators who voted for the stimulus \nbill, those Senators put us on a path to a bigger role in Government.\n  So let me make it clear. Those Senators who voted for the stimulus \nbill, you put us on a path to a bigger role in Government. Over a \ntrillion dollars of new deficit spending was hidden in that bill. It \ncaused some of the extra ink on this chart for the year we are in. This \nis what was inherited by January 20, but legislation passed since \nJanuary 20 adds that much. Supporters of that bill, then, as far as I \nam concerned, need to own up to the fiscal course that has been charted \nby actions of this Congress and this President since January 20.\n  Now, to be sure, after the other side pushed through the stimulus \nbill and the second $350 billion of TARP money, the Congressional \nBudget Office reestimated the baseline. A portion of this new red ink \nupfront is due to that reestimate. The bottom line, however, is that \nthe reestimate occurred several weeks after the President and a robust \nDemocratic majority took over the Government. Decisions were made, and \nthe fiscal consequences followed. Those fiscal consequences are in \nthese red figures, above what would have been if Bush's budget had \nstayed in place during this period of time. That is where we would be.\n  Some on the other side raise this point about the March CBO \nreestimate. Of course, that is fine, but if they were to be consistent \nand intellectually honest, then they would have to acknowledge the CBO \nreestimate that occurred in 2001, after President Bush took office. The \nsurplus went south because of what? Because of economic conditions. The \n$5.6 trillion number--so often quoted by those on the other side--was \nillusory. And I will say more about that in just a few minutes.\n  Here is where the revisionist history comes from. It is a strategy to \ndivert, through a twisted blame game, from the facts before us. How is \nthe history revisionist? Well, I would like to take each conclusion one \nby one.\n  The first conclusion is that all of the good fiscal history was \nderived from the 1993 tax increase. To knock down that falsehood, all \nyou have to do is\n\n[[Page S3970]]\n\ntake a look at this chart. And this chart is not produced by data I \naccumulated but data from the Clinton administration. So here we have a \nhistory put forth with data from the Clinton administration about the \ntax increase of 1993 and whether it did a lot of good or not so much \ngood.\n  Much of the ballyhooed partisan 1993 tax increase accounts for just \n13 percent--just 13 percent--of the deficit reduction that took place \nduring all of the 1990s--again, just 13 percent.\n  Now let's look at what are the biggest sources of deficit reduction, \nbecause obviously it is not the tax increase.\n  Thirty-five percent came from a reduction in defense expenditures. Of \ncourse, that fiscal benefit originated from President Reagan, who \nstared down the Communist regime in Russia. The same folks on that side \nwho opposed President Reagan's buildup somehow want to take credit for \nthe fiscal benefit of the peace dividend--that 35 percent.\n  The next biggest source of deficit reduction--32 percent--came from \nother revenue. Basically, this was the fiscal benefit from progrowth \npolicies, such as the bipartisan capital gains tax cut of 1997 and, of \ncourse, the free-trade agreements President Clinton, with Republican \nvotes, established. That is the 32 percent that reduced the deficit \nfrom that point of view.\n  The savings from the policies that I earlier mentioned translated, \nobviously, into interest savings, and that interest savings is this 15 \npercent right here.\n  Now, for all the chest thumping about the 1990s, the chest thumpers \nwho pushed for big social spending didn't bring much to the deficit \nreduction table of 1990. That amounted to a mere 5 percent.\n  What is more, the fiscal revisionists in this body tend to forget who \nthe players were. They are correct that there was a Democratic \nPresident in the White House, but they conveniently forget that the \nRepublicans controlled the Congress for the period where the deficit \ncame down and turned to surplus. They tend to forget that they fought \nthe principle of balanced budgets, which was the centerpiece of the \nRepublican fiscal policy that led, over a 4-year period of time in the \nlate 1990s, to paying down $570 billion on the national debt.\n  Now, you may remember the Government shutdowns of late 1995. Remember \nwhat that was all about? It was about a plan to balance the budget. \nRepublicans paid a pretty high political price for forcing that issue. \nBut in 1997, President Clinton agreed. You may recall all through the \n1990s what those yearend battles were all about. On one side were \ncongressional Democrats and the Clinton administration pushing for more \nspending, and on this side of the aisle congressional Republicans were \npushing for tax relief. Well, what happens when you have that extreme--\nmore spending on the one end, less spending and tax decreases on the \nother? Both sides end up compromising. That is the real fiscal history \nof the 1990s.\n  So now let's turn to the other conclusion of the fiscal revisionists. \nThat conclusion happens to be that in this decade, since the year 2000, \nall fiscal problems are attributable to the widespread tax relief \nenacted in 2001, 2003, 2004, and 2006. In 2001, President Bush came \ninto office. He inherited an economy that was careening downhill. You \nknow, NASDAQ lost 50 percent of its value in the year 2000, not in the \nyear 2001. That bubble burst. You may remember that starting in \nFebruary 2000, we started on a 46-month decline in manufacturing, so we \nhad a manufacturing recession already set in place. Then, of course, \ncame the economic shock of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. And, of course, \nyou have to add in corporate scandals to that economic environment. You \nwill remember Enron.\n  It is true--very true--that as fiscal year 2001 came to a close, the \nprojected surplus turned into a deficit, and the chart shows that right \nhere in 2001. In just the right time, though, the 2001 tax relief plan \nkicked in. As the tax relief hit its full force in 2003, the deficit \ngrew smaller. This pattern continued from 2003 through 2007.\n  If my comments were meant to be a partisan shot, I could say that \nthis favorable fiscal path from 2003 to 2007 was the only period--aside \nfrom the 6 months in 2001--where Republicans controlled the White House \nand the Congress. But, unlike fiscal history revisionists, I am not \ntrying to make any partisan points. I am just trying to get to the \nfiscal facts.\n  I have another chart that compares the tax receipts for 4 years after \nthe much-ballyhooed 1993 tax increase and the 4-year period after the \n2003 tax cuts. Observe this chart. On a year-to-year basis, this chart \ncompares the change in revenues as a percentage of GDP. In 1993, the \nClinton tax increase brought in more revenue as compared to the 2003 \ntax cut. You can see here, compared to here. That trend does reverse, \nas you see here, as both policies moved along. You can see how the \nextra revenue went up over time relative to the flat line of the 1993 \ntax increase.\n  This is the 1993 tax increase bringing in revenue and then pretty \nmuch flat-lining out over a long period of time; whereas you can see \nthe tax relief bill of 2001 went down and then very dramatically \nincreased in revenue. This ought to disabuse people who think that \nevery time you increase tax rates you bring in more revenue and when \nyou decrease tax rates you bring in less revenue. This chart shows that \nyou can decrease tax rates and bring in more revenue.\n  So let's get the fiscal history right. The progrowth tax and trade \npolicies of the 1990s, along with the peace dividend, had a lot more to \ndo with deficit reduction in the 1990s than the 1993 tax increase. In \nthis decade, deficits went down after tax relief plans were put into \nfull effect.\n  Now that is the past. We need to make sure we understand it. You have \nto understand the past because the past is going to be brought up the \nnext 4 days of this week as we are on this budget resolution. And, by \ngolly, people ought to be accurate when they state what the impact is \nof the 1993 tax increase versus all the blame that is given on this \nside of the aisle for actions taken in 2001 and beyond with those tax \nreductions.\n  What is most important is the future. People in our States send us \nhere to deal with future policy. This budget debate should not be about \nDemocrats flogging Republicans and vice versa. The people don't send us \nhere to flog one another like partisan cartoon cutout characters, and \ndo it over past policies. They do not send us here to endlessly point \nfingers of blame. Let's focus on the fiscal consequences of the budget \nthat is before the Senate over the next 4 days.\n  President Obama rightly focused us on the future with his eloquence \nduring his campaign. I would like to paraphrase a quote from the \nPresident's nomination acceptance speech:\n\n       We need a President who can face the threats of the future, \n     not grasping at the ideas of the past.\n\n  Well, President Obama was right. We need a President--and I would add \nCongressmen and Senators--who can face the threats of the future. This \nbudget as currently written poses considerable threats to the fiscal \nfuture. It taxes too much, it spends too much, and it borrows too much. \nGrasping at ideas of the past, or playing the partisan blame game, will \nnot deal with the threats to our fiscal future.\n\n  Let's face the honest fiscal facts. Let's not revise fiscal history \nas we start this critical debate about the fiscal choices ahead of us. \nThe people who send us here have a right to expect nothing less of us.\n  As I noted in remarks just completed a shorttime ago, a portion of \nthe new deficits to the Congressional Budget Office March re-estimate. \nCBO revised the deficit downward by $1.3 trillion over 10 years. The \nrevision is attributable to much worse economic conditions. The \nbottomline, however, is that re-estimate occurred several weeks after \nthe President and robust Democratic majorities took over the \ngovernment. Decisions were made and the fiscal consequences followed.\n  Some on the other side raise this point about the March CBO re-\nestimate. That's fine, but, if they were to be consistent and \nintellectually honest, then they would have to acknowledge the CBO re-\nestimate that occurred in 2001 after President Bush took office. The \nsurplus went South because of economic conditions and new spending \nneeded to deal with the consequences of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The \n$5.6\n\n[[Page S3971]]\n\ntrillion number so often quoted by those on the other side was revised \nwithin a year of President George W. Bush's presidency.\n  In January 2002, CBO revised the $5.6 trillion number downward to \n$1.6 trillion. To listen to folks on the other side, you would think \nall of that $4 trillion downward adjustment was attributable to the \nbipartisan tax relief of 2001.\n  In fact, the tax relief accounted for 40 percent of the adjustment. \nMost of the balance, $2.6 trillion, was due to factors that had noting \nto do with the tax relief. I am talking about the reduced revenues, \nincreased spending for the war on terror and homeland security and \nother factors.\n  So, if folks on the other side want to be intellectually honest about \nthe budget and fiscal history, they need to be consistent on how the \nCBO re-estimates are treated. If you are going to give President Obama \n$1.3 trillion for the post-January 20, 2009 re-estimates, then you have \nto give President George W. Bush credit for twice as much, $2.6 \ntrillion. That's what CBO said in January 2002. we can't have different \nstandards for different people and be intellectually honest.\n  One other point that came up was the comparative corporate tax rates. \nAs Senator Hatch pointed out, the U.S. statutory corporate rate is very \nhigh. The Chairman of the Budget Committee agreed but then stated that \nthe U.S. effective corporate rate is relatively low. Business taxation \noccurs in corporate and non-corporate form, through S corporations, \npartnerships, and proprietorships. If you want to compare U.S. taxation \nwith the rest of the developed world, it is best to look at comparative \nbusiness tax rates on investment. If you do so, you will find the U.S. \nhas a higher rate than the G-7 group of comparative economies. You will \nfind this data in an analysis prepared by former Senior Treasury \nEconomist Robert Carroll.\n  This analysis is contained in an August 2008, Tax Foundation paper \nentitled ``Fiscal Fact Comparing International Corporate Tax Rates: \nU.S. Corporate Tax Rate Increasingly Out of Line by Various Measures.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oregon is recognized.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, this week the Senate focuses on the Federal \nbudget and folks at home are going to hear a lot about reserve funds \nand reconciliation and a lot of other technical budget lingo. A reserve \nfund, for example, is not some kind of checking account where you can \ngo get a bunch of money to spend on Government programs. It is more \nlike a work plan that is used to structure how difficult policy \njudgments are made on important issues.\n  Budget reconciliation is perhaps even more incomprehensible to folks. \nThat is why I want to spend a few minutes this afternoon talking about \nwhat it means, particularly in terms of health care reform, which we \nall understand is a particularly pressing domestic concern. Budget \nreconciliation, strictly speaking, means reconciling Government policy \nwith budget targets. If you were to pursue health care reform using \nbudget reconciliation, you would, under the Senate rules, need only a \nmajority vote here in the Senate as opposed to 60 votes, which is often \nneeded in the Senate to cut off debate. So Senators now find themselves \nbeing buttonholed by reporters for something of a health care \ninterrogation. The question invariably is, is a Senator in favor of \nusing reconciliation for health care reform?\n  The theory, I gather, is if a Senator is in favor of using budget \nreconciliation, the Senator is just in favor of bullying health care \nreform through the Senate with a narrow majority. And somehow, if a \nSenator is not for using reconciliation on health care reform, that \nSenator is not sympathetic to the cause of fixing the American health \ncare system.\n  It is my view that, like most of these kinds of issues, this is \nvastly oversimplifying the case. In my view, I have spent more than 5 \nyears trying to make the issue of reconciliation on health care \nirrelevant. Senator Bennett and I, for example, have teamed up, now \njoined by 14 colleagues of both political parties, evenly divided, \nbecause we believe it is critically important to address this issue of \nhealth care reform in a bipartisan way.\n  Every time we talk about this issue, we talk about our desire to work \nwith the chairman of the Finance Committee. I see the ranking minority \nmember on the floor, Senator Grassley. It is our desire to work with \nChairman Baucus and Senator Grassley and Chairman Kennedy and our \ncolleague from Wyoming, Senator Enzi. Everything we have worked toward \nin this area of health care reform has been pointed toward the goal of \nmaking reconciliation irrelevant because we wish to be part of an \neffort, working with Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley and Chairman \nKennedy and Senator Enzi, on a path to getting 68 to 70 votes here in \nthe Senate so we can have an enduring and bipartisan coalition in place \nto fix American health care.\n  I will tell you, on the basis of visiting most of our colleagues in \ntheir office to listen to them on the issue of health care reform, I \nthink it is possible to find a path to 60 to 70 votes on this critical \ndomestic question. I think there is a growing consensus here in the \nSenate that both political parties have been right on major concerns \nthey have about American health care. I think there is a growing \nawareness that our party, the Democratic Party, has been right on the \nissue of ensuring that all Americans have good quality, affordable \ncoverage. If you don't do that, what happens is the people who are \nuninsured shift their bills to the insured and they shift the most \nexpensive bills. So you cannot fix this system unless you get all \nAmericans good quality, affordable coverage.\n  I think Republicans have had a very valid point with respect to \ngiving flexibility to the private sector on the issue of health care. \nIt is important, so as to not freeze innovation, to make sure there are \nnot price controls, there are not global budgets so there are plenty of \nprivate sector choices, the way Members have with respect to this \nissue. It is something of a philosophical truce. Democrats have been \nright on the issue of making sure that you expand coverage to stop the \ncost shifting and deal with the question of holding down costs which is \nso important to American business and tough global financial markets. \nAnd Republicans have had a valid point with respect to the role of the \nprivate sector.\n  I think there is a growing consensus about how, if you are going to \ncontain costs in American health care, you have to go to areas that \nchange the incentives, that drive the behavior in American health care. \nRight now, most individuals don't even have a choice with respect to \ntheir health care. If they are lucky enough to have employer-based \ncoverage, they don't get a choice. So they are already in a position, \nin my view, that is not fair and certainly is not in sync in a way that \nworks for the Members of the Senate. The distinguished President of the \nSenate and every other Member come here and get plenty of private \nsector choices for their health care, and I think there is a growing \nsense here in the Senate that those kinds of choices ought to be \navailable to all Americans. Fourteen Senators are behind legislation \nthat would do that. I point out the very fine white paper offered on \nAmerican health care by the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee envisions Americans having more choices for their coverage, \nthe way Members of Congress have.\n  We are going to talk about a lot of issues this week with respect to \nthe budget. You are going to hear a lot about reserve funds and \nreconciliation. I hope that as colleagues go through this topic and \nissues related to it, the rules with respect to how you are going to \npay for American health care, I hope there will be a recognition that a \nlot of Senators wish to make the issue of reconciliation on health care \nirrelevant.\n  Senator Bennett and I, for example, have received a report from the \nCongressional Budget Office--it is on my Web site--making it clear that \nour proposal is revenue neutral 2 years in and in the third year starts \nbending the cost curve downward. The way we get those savings, in most \nparticulars, is through approaches that Chairman Baucus has advocated \nin the white paper I have mentioned here on the floor.\n  There are plenty of opportunities for finding common ground on this \nbudget, on bringing Democrats and Republicans together on key issues \nsuch as\n\n[[Page S3972]]\n\nhealth care, on making the whole question of reconciliation go by the \nboards because Democrats and Republicans have come together.\n  I want to close by commending Chairman Conrad for the approach he has \ntaken with respect to the budget and for his desire, particularly, to \nwork in the health care area of the budget in a bipartisan way. He \nworked with me, for example, on the issue of suggesting in the budget \nthat periodic reports would have to be made with respect to health cost \ncontainment. That sends a strong message that the Senate is not going \nto wait around for 10 years or so to see if there are any savings. \nChairman Conrad has added language to make it clear that on an ongoing \nbasis there should be an effort to wring out savings from the existing \n$2.5 trillion being spent on American health care this year. Chairman \nConrad does not want to sit around and wait for 10 or 12 or 15 years to \nsee if anybody can save some money on American health care. He has \npicked up, as the Congressional Budget Office said in their report to \nSenator Bennett and me and our colleagues, there are savings that can \nbe made over the next few years.\n  There is enough money being spent on American health care today. It \nis not being spent in the right places. This year we will spend $2.5 \ntrillion on health care. There are 305 million of us. If you divide 305 \nmillion into $2.5 trillion, you can go out and hire a doctor for every \nseven families in the United States. You could hire a doctor for every \nfamily in the State of Virginia or Oregon or elsewhere, pay the doctor \n$225,000 a year, and invariably when I bring this up to physicians, \nthey say: Where can I go to get my 7 families?\n  We spend enough on health care. We don't spend it in the right \nplaces. Chairman Conrad, by approaching the health care issue as he has \nin this budget, allows us to first focus on the savings that can be \nproduced out of the existing $2.5 trillion. I commend Chairman Conrad \nfor working with us in that fashion.\n  I also commend the ranking minority member for his work on health \ncare as well. He is a cosponsor of the Healthy Americans Act and has \nmade it very clear that he wants to work with Chairman Baucus and \nSenator Grassley and Chairman Kennedy and Senator Enzi so that we bring \nthe Senate together in a bipartisan fashion.\n  There is much to work with here. As Senators do get buttonholed by \nreporters with respect to the issue of whether they are in favor of \nusing reconciliation for health reform, I hope Senators will see that \nthis is not a yes or no answer but that there is a large and bipartisan \ngroup of us who want to pass health care reform this year on President \nObama's timetable--this year--but we want to do it by bringing \nDemocrats and Republicans together and making the issue of \nreconciliation on the issue of health care reform irrelevant.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. On a number of previous speakers, I am afraid I had to be \naway from the floor to deal with some of the challenges back home with \nflooding. Some of the previous speakers have referenced tax increases \nas part of the budget I have offered my colleagues in the Senate.\n  Let me indicate very clearly, the budget resolution that is before us \nhas net tax cuts, net tax cuts of $825 billion. The other assertions \ndirected at the President's budget about tax increases--and there are \ntax increases in the President's budget and in my budget, but they are \ncompletely dwarfed by the tax cuts that are in our budget.\n  In the President's budget, over 10 years, he has $2.4 trillion of net \ntax cuts. In other words, if you take the tax raises that are in the \nPresident's budget and you stack them up against the tax cuts in the \nPresident's budget, he has a net of $2.4 trillion of tax cuts over 10 \nyears.\n  In the budget I have offered my colleagues that has come from the \nBudget Committee, that is a 5-year budget instead of a 10-year budget \nof the President, we have net tax cuts of $825 billion.\n  Here is why that is so. Middle-class tax relief from 2001 and 2003 is \nall extended in this budget. That means the 10-percent tax, the child \ntax credit, the marriage penalty relief, the education incentives, all \nthose things are extended in this budget for those earning less than \n$250,000 a year.\n  The net effect of that change alone is $601 billion tax relief. In \naddition, we provided relief from the alternative minimum tax for 3 \nyears. That costs $216 billion. We have estate tax reform that takes \nthe level of exemption to $3.5 million per person, $7 million per \nfamily. That means 99.8 percent of the people in this country will pay \nno estate tax. None. Zero. That costs $72 billion.\n  We have business tax provisions and extenders, those provisions that \nperiodically have to be extended. They are incentives to the business \ncommunity. That costs $69 billion. That is a total of $958 billion of \ntax reductions over 5 years. And then if you look at the offsets, the \nloophole closers, going after the offshore tax havens, the abusive tax \nshelters, that raises $133 billion for net tax reduction over 5 years \nof $825 billion, most of it for the middle class.\n  I see Senator Thune here now. If he is ready to go, we would be ready \nfor him to go. How much time does the Senator seek?\n  Mr. THUNE. Probably 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 15 minutes of Senator Gregg's time to Senator \nThune.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 731\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank the Senator from North Dakota for yielding. I call \nup an amendment I have filed at the desk and ask unanimous consent that \nit be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 731.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 731) is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To amend the deficit-neutral reserve fund for climate changes \n    legislation to require that such legislation does not increase \n                    electricity or gasoline prices)\n\n       On page 33, line 21, after ``economy,'' insert ``without \n     increasing electricity or gasoline prices,''.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. The Senate is in the process of an important fiscal debate \nwhich will set the Federal budget for the next 5 years. The budget \nprocess is particularly important as our Nation faces a prolonged \nrecession and an ongoing financial crisis.\n  I think there are two primary questions facing the Congress at this \ntime. One is, how do we help the middle class cope with the current \nrecession. Secondly, how do we create jobs and investments that will \nlead us out of this recession?\n  The Democratically led Congress, I believe, missed a major \nopportunity to address the economic recession during the debate of the \nstimulus bill. Rather than providing significant tax relief for middle-\nclass families and small businesses, Congress poured billions of \ntaxpayer dollars into Government programs and pet projects.\n  The middle class was largely left behind in the stimulus bill. In \nreturn for an $800 billion stimulus bill, the average taxpayer gets a \ntemporary tax break of roughly $8 per week, not even enough, in most \nplaces, to buy a cup of coffee each day.\n  Unfortunately, the administration's budget proposal is another missed \nopportunity to address the fundamental issues that are plaguing our \neconomy. Not only does the administration's budget increase taxes on \nfamilies and small business owners, it calls for a massive national \nsales tax on energy as well.\n  This sales tax, which is implemented in the name of global warming, \nwill dramatically increase energy costs for all consumers. I wish to \npoint out something that President Obama said with regard to that \nenergy cap-and-trade plan. He said:\n\n       Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates \n     would necessarily skyrocket.\n\n\n[[Page S3973]]\n\n\n  This regressive national sales tax on energy will hit lower and \nmiddle-income households at a time when they can least afford it. Now, \nincidentally, the architect of the President's budget, Peter Orszag, \nwho is the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, agrees that \nthe President's energy tax will have a significant impact on energy \nprices, and lower income families will bear a greater burden on account \nof this tax.\n  Orszag testified before Congress that a cap-and-trade program would \nincrease energy costs which will immediately be passed on to the \nconsumer. During a House of Representatives Budget Committee hearing in \n2007, Mr. Orszag stated:\n\n       Under a cap-and-trade program, firms would not ultimately \n     bear most of the cost of the allowances, but instead would \n     pass them along to their customers in the form of higher \n     prices for products such as electricity and gasoline.\n\n  Orszag is also on record saying:\n\n       The higher prices caused by the cap would lower real wages \n     and real returns on capital, which would be equivalent to \n     raising marginal tax rates on those sources of income.\n\n  In September of 2008, Mr. Orszag testified before the House Committee \non Ways and Means.\n\n       The rise in prices for energy and energy-intensive goods \n     and services would impose a larger burden relative to income \n     on low-income households than on high-income households.\n\n  Both Mr. Orszag and President Obama, they are not the only ones who \nbelieve higher energy prices on account of climate change legislation \nwill have a greater negative impact on low-income families.\n  I quote from the Wall Street Journal on March 9 of this year:\n\n       Cap-and-trade, in other words, is a scheme to redistribute \n     income and wealth, but in a very curious way. It takes from \n     the working class and gives to the affluent; takes from \n     Miami, Ohio, and gives to Miami, Florida; and takes from an \n     industrial America that is already struggling and gives to \n     rich Silicon Valley and Wall Street ``green-tech'' investors \n     who know how to leverage the political class.\n\n  I would also quote from Warren Buffet.\n\n       That tax [the cap-and-trade tax] is probably going to be \n     pretty regressive. If you put a cost on putting carbon into \n     the atmosphere . . . it's going to be borne by customers. And \n     it's a tax like anything else.\n\n  Now is not the right time to place another burden on families who are \nstruggling to make ends meet during the current recession. Many two-\nincome families are now reduced to one. One-income families are trying \nto make do with reduced wages or fewer hours. Mortgage payments have \nbecome a burden too great for millions of families. In light of the \nunprecedented challenges that are facing the middle class, I find it \nunconscionable that President Obama and the Democrats in Congress want \nto place an indirect tax on these families through increased energy \ncosts.\n  In April of 2007, MIT conducted an economic study of the Sanders-\nBoxer climate change bill. Interestingly enough, at that time, 2007, \nthen-Senator Obama was a cosponsor of that bill. The proposal he has \nput in front of us very closely resembles that proposal.\n  MIT concluded in their analysis of that particular piece of \nlegislation that the Federal Government would take in an additional \n$366 billion in revenue each year, which is equivalent to over $3,128 \nper household. That is in the year 2015.\n  Having said that, if you think about $366 billion coming in in \nadditional revenue to the Federal Government, that means someone in \nthis country is paying that tax. As I mentioned earlier, many have \nconcluded it is not going to be the utilities, those taxes are going to \nbe passed on and borne by power consumers, electric, fuel consumers in \nthis country.\n  If the MIT study is correct, that would be equivalent to over $3,100 \nper household. So I think it is important to note that President \nObama's cap-and-trade tax is even more stringent than the Sanders-Boxer \nclimate change bill, which I alluded to, which the MIT study makes \nreference to, which would only increase the national sales tax on \nenergy prices.\n  In other words, President Obama's cap-and-trade proposal is even more \nstringent than the one that was analyzed by researchers at MIT who \nconcluded, again, it would cost the average household in this country \nover $3,100 per year.\n  President Obama wants to take some of the proceeds from the carbon \ntax revenue and give it back to families through the Making Work Pay \ntax credit. The Making Work Pay tax credit totals about $400 per \nindividual and about $800 per married couple. This credit barely covers \na fourth of the household costs of the energy cap-and-trade tax of \n$3,100 per household.\n  The President's message to the middle class is: Don't worry about \npaying the additional $3,100 each year in higher energy costs because \nthe Government is going to refund $800 of that total in the form of the \nmaking-work-pay tax credit. That comes out to about a quarter of what \nthe tax is going to be, the energy tax that each family will be faced \nwith, if this particular proposal were to become law.\n  Additionally, a significant number of individuals and married couples \nmaking less than $250,000 a year are not going to be eligible for the \nmaking-work-pay tax credit and are still going to be hit by the \nnational sales tax on energy. The national energy sales tax is a direct \ncontradiction to President Obama's campaign pledge not to increase \ntaxes on those making less than $250,000 a year. The making-work-pay \ntax credit does not apply to a lot of people who make under that \namount. The energy tax will apply to all of the people in this country \nto the tune of about $3,100 a year, according to the MIT analysis.\n  According to a recent Washington Times article, the Obama cap-and-\ntrade proposal could be far more costly than the estimated figures in \nthe Obama budget blueprint. According to this article, President \nObama's climate plan could cost close to $2 trillion, which would \ninevitably be passed on to consumers in the form of higher electricity, \ngas, and heating oil, as well as higher prices for other goods and \nservices affected by higher energy costs. That is a bad deal for hard-\nworking, taxpaying Americans, and it is the wrong solution to our \neconomic problems.\n  Like many Midwest States, South Dakota is heavily dependent upon coal \npower to meet our energy needs. One public power utility in South \nDakota analyzed what little details are available on the President's \nnational sales tax on energy and determined that their power costs \nwould increase by $107 million per year by 2015. That represents a 65-\npercent increase in annual power costs. One of the largest municipal \npower customers would see their annual costs go up by $13 million for a \nrural community of just over 20,000 residents. That community is \nWatertown, SD. One of the largest industrial customers of a municipal \npower provider would see their electric bill increase by $2 million per \nyear.\n  Like many other States, South Dakota is trying to deal with the \neconomic recession and is looking for ways to create jobs and help \nbusinesses grow. The President's proposal to tax energy will result in \na new annual tax of $2 million on just one business in my State. It \nwill kill jobs and stifle economic growth, and it should not be \nincluded in the fiscal year 2010 budget resolution.\n  In the words of the CEO of this South Dakota-based power public power \nprovider:\n\n       In plain English, [the President's climate change proposal] \n     represents a perpetual tax increase on our electric \n     consumers.\n\n  I want to show another power company in South Dakota, Black Hills \nCorporation, a diversified energy company serving customers in South \nDakota, Colorado, Wyoming, Kansas, Nebraska, and Iowa. They have \nprovided some generic examples of how a cap-and-trade proposal would \nimpact the monthly electric bills of various types of customers. The \nfirst chart is at $50 per ton of carbon dioxide, a monthly residential \nbill increases from $94 to $154. That is your average residential bill. \nA small commercial customer would see their monthly bill increase from \n$4,500 to $7,500 per month. You probably can't see, because this is \nfairly small print, that increase, but if you look at what the estimate \nis, the current cost being $4,500 for a small commercial customer bill, \nunder the proposed climate change tax, if enacted, that would go up to \nabout $7,500 per month.\n  So we are looking at about a 67-percent increase per month. When you\n\n[[Page S3974]]\n\nstart multiplying that out, it becomes a staggering amount of money on \nan annual basis.\n  A school customer would see their electric bill--this is the same \npower company, same statistics that apply to this, about $50 per ton of \ncarbon dioxide--if they had a typical bill today of $15,000, under this \nparticular plan they could see that electric bill go from $15,000 a \nmonth to $30,000 a month. Again, you probably can't see the small \nprint, but essentially what it is telling us is that a current $15,000-\nper-month cost for electricity for a typical school in South Dakota \nwould virtually double on a monthly basis. If you annualized that, that \nis $180,000 a year additional cost for a school in South Dakota which, \nin most cases, is struggling to provide school supplies and pay \nteachers fair salaries.\n  Finally, take a look at a large industrial customer bill, the current \nmonthly cost for power. With the energy tax that is under consideration \nin the President's proposal, that would go up to about $234,000 per \nmonth under the cap-and-trade proposal.\n  I guess my point is, when you start looking at the kinds of costs \nthis imposes on industries--and I used these examples from my State and \ninformation that was furnished to us by utility companies there--if you \ntake a large industrial customer who is going to see their energy costs \nincrease by $110,000 each month and you annualize that, you are looking \nat an additional $1.4 million each year on account of this proposal.\n  The bottom line is, the amendment I have offered would amend the \nreserve fund included in a future climate cap-and-trade proposal. I \nknow several of my colleagues, Republican colleagues, will be offering \namendments to strike or lessen the impact of the President's national \nsales tax on energy as part of the budget process.\n  What my amendment does is ensure that any cap-and-trade proposal \ndrafted under this deficit-neutral reserve fund would not increase \ngasoline prices or electricity rates for consumers. I believe this \namendment is the very least we can do for consumers dealing with the \neconomic downturn and businesses struggling to make it through a \nprolonged recession.\n  I encourage colleagues to support the amendment. I hope we will not \ninclude, in any budget resolution or reconciliation instructions coming \nback from the House or wherever that might occur, any language that \nwould in any way implement the cap-and-trade proposal. This amendment \nensures that doesn't happen in a way that would increase gasoline and \nelectricity rates for customers.\n  I ask that when we get to the vote, my colleagues will support the \namendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator from South Dakota for his amendment \nand indicate clearly that this budget resolution does not prejudge in \nany way the climate change debate. It does not assume that there will \nbe cap and trade or that there will not be. It leaves to the committees \nof jurisdiction the responsibility to come up with the best possible \nplan and to do it in a deficit-neutral way. That is the trigger. That \nis the condition. Whatever plan they devise must be deficit neutral and \nwill have to go through the legislative process.\n  I yield 7 minutes from Senator Gregg's time to Senator Johanns.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 735\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 735 which is at \nthe desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to laying aside the pending \namendment?\n  Mr. CONRAD. We have no objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report:\n  The bill clerk read as follows.\n\n       The Senator from Nebraska [Mr. Johanns] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 735.\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To prohibit the use of reconciliation in the Senate for \n      climate change legislation involving a cap and trade system)\n\n       Section 202 is amended by inserting at the end the \n     following: ``(c) The Chairman of the Senate Committee on the \n     Budget shall not revise the allocations in this resolution if \n     the legislation provided for in subsections (a) or (b) is \n     reported from any committee pursuant to section 310 of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974.''\n\n  Mr. JOHANNS. I rise to offer an amendment to the budget resolution. \nThe amendment is simple. It inserts language that would bar the use of \nbudget reconciliation for climate legislation. Budget reconciliation \nessentially fast tracks legislation. It limits debate. It circumvents \nnormal Senate procedure and requires only a simple majority for \npassage.\n  For weeks, the House leadership, the Senate leadership, and the \nadministration have been pushing the Senate to use reconciliation to \npass cap-and-trade legislation. They certainly have not taken it off \nthe table. This is a mistake. Members on both sides of the aisle and on \nboth sides of the Capitol agree with me.\n  The Senate resolution before us does not include reconciliation \ninstructions. That is noteworthy. It is commendable. However, it is the \nconference report that concerns me. It should raise a red flag for all \nSenators.\n  Let me step back for a minute and review where we are. We now know \nthat the House budget has included reconciliation instructions to the \nCommittee on Energy and Commerce and two other committees. Why would \nthe House include instructions at all? The House has a Rules Committee \nthat sets rules for debate and amendments. Reconciliation instructions \nin the House budget are therefore meaningless except for one purpose: \nto open the door to cap-and-trade policy in the final budget resolution \nthat emerges from the conference process.\n  Now that we have reached the heart of the matter, let me say again: \nThe House language is there to dictate how the Senate conducts its \nbusiness. The House language is a placeholder, a Trojan horse to limit \ndebate, amendment, transparency, and a thoughtful consideration in the \nSenate on cap and trade.\n  We know that the leadership in the Senate is already planning how it \nwill spend the cap-and-trade revenues. How do I know this? The Senate \nmajority leader said last week that the collection of revenues from cap \nand trade would be useful for other governmental spending down to the \nvery last penny.\n  Budget reconciliation is actually about lowering spending and \ncontrolling the debt. So let's take a closer look at the House \nlanguage. After all, that language might set the rules for debate in \nthe Senate, unless my amendment is adopted.\n  The House instructions call for a savings of $3 billion. The key, \nthough, is this: The committees could raise hundreds of billions of \ndollars in new taxes and fees, including cap and trade, so long as new \nspending is $3 billion below the total revenues collected. Cap-and-\ntrade legislation is expected to generate almost a trillion dollars in \nrevenues--a lot of spending. I make this point to illustrate the \nsignificance of taxing and spending that could be passed under the \nguise of reconciliation.\n  Finally, I see that the House language even provides a placeholder in \nthe text for Senate reconciliation instructions. Section 202 provides \nthe following:\n\n       Senate reconciliation instructions to be supplied by the \n     Senate.\n\n  I suggest we adopt my amendment and send a clear, bipartisan message \nopposing the use of reconciliation for cap and trade. Cap and trade is \nsimply too large, too significant, and too important and costly to pass \nunder the cloak of another bill.\n  The senior Senator from West Virginia, a man I admire immensely, said \nit eloquently:\n\n       Putting climate change legislation on a freight train \n     through Congress is an outrage that must be resisted.\n\n  Quoting again:\n\n       It is an abdication of the constitutional role of the \n     Senate.\n\n  I cannot say it better.\n  Before closing, I would like to discuss the economic impacts of this \ncap-and-trade freight train for a moment. The President's climate \nproposal could cost an American family an additional $3,000 per year or \nabout $250 a month. Most families will see much of this\n\n[[Page S3975]]\n\nextra expense show up in their electric bill, especially if the family \nis from a State where significant amounts of electricity are generated \nby coal.\n  That is right, everyone with a light switch will see the pain of this \npolicy.\n  The rest of the additional costs could show up in all sorts of bills \nfamilies struggle to pay. If a family uses natural gas to heat their \nhome, cook or fuel their small business, the bill will go up. Higher \nnatural gas prices drive fertilizer costs up. When these increases are \ncoupled with higher gasoline and diesel fuel prices, the costs to our \nfarmers in terms of production go up. That means the costs of dairy, \nbeef, pork, and chicken producers are bound to increase. Some of those \nhigher costs will be seen at the grocery store. Because steel and \ncement manufacturing would be affected, even the cost of heavy \nconstruction goes up, and that impacts our infrastructure.\n  Americans are on the hook for all of this, while China gains a \ncompetitive advantage.\n  I could go on and on, but I think I have said enough. Aren't these \neconomic impacts significant enough to warrant an open discussion, a \ntransparent debate? Not some parliamentary maneuver hatched in a late-\nnight conference committee?\n  Well, I think they are. Our constituents deserve to understand the \ntrue impact of the decisions we debate on this floor.\n  To sum up, cap-and-trade legislation is complex and costly. Americans \ndeserve, and the issue demands, a thoughtful, deliberate approach. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Johanns for offering his \namendment early on like this. I think this is the way we ought to \nfunction on a budget resolution. Let's get these amendments up and \ndebate them and have a chance for people to get votes early in the \nprocess.\n  Mr. President, on our list, Senator Bond was to be next.\n  Mr. BOND. I am ready.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask the Senator, how much time does he need?\n  Mr. BOND. About 6 minutes, I would think.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I yield the Senator 6 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I appreciate the managers giving me time.\n  We are all concerned about our struggling families and workers during \nthis time of economic pain. We know too many families are struggling to \nmake ends meet, unable to pay their mortgages, bills or debts. They are \nstruggling, out of a job or failing to find work that can support a \nfamily.\n  We should not impose an energy tax on our families and workers, as \nPresident Obama proposes through his budget cap-and-trade plan that \nwill cause pain for our families and workers for years and decades to \ncome.\n  While the President and his supporters say this is a cap-and-trade \nscheme to cut carbon, it will result in higher costs for makers and \nusers of energy. Those higher energy prices will be passed straight to \nthe consumer, who will feel like they are paying a new energy tax, and \nthat is what it will be. Under the Obama energy tax, Americans would \npay more for every time we turn on a light, put gas in our cars or heat \nour homes.\n  They also did not include the President's energy tax in their budget, \nthe Democrats will claim. But the leadership keeps reminding us they \nare prepared to impose an energy tax through the budget reconciliation \nprocess. Therefore, it is important we confront what this will mean for \nour families and workers who would have to pay more for everything from \npower bills to grocery bills if their budget energy tax plan succeeds.\n  Higher energy prices will mean many must make a decision between heat \nor eat. I have in the Chamber this photo of a young girl in a newspaper \nad for a low-income housing assistance program. Her family cannot \nafford the heating bills, thus, the caption: ``I have two coats. One \nfor outside and one for inside.''\n  For too many families such as this girl's, higher heating bills from \nPresident Obama's energy tax will force them to decide between paying \nheating bills or food bills--heat or eat.\n  Seniors will face a tough choice too. They already pay too much for \nprescription drug medicines. Tragically, we know many seniors die \nduring heat waves because they lack air-conditioning.\n  Higher electricity bills will force seniors on fixed incomes to \nchoose between buying their lifesaving prescription drugs or paying for \ntheir lifesaving air-conditioning.\n  This is a direct impact on senior citizens throughout the Nation.\n  Many workers will not have a choice when they are told they are \nlosing their family-supporting job. President Obama's energy tax will \nhit blue-collar workers particularly hard. Many of them depend upon \nenergy-intensive manufacturing to support their middle class way of \nlife. This will be a particularly heavy burden on the Midwest and the \nSouth.\n  Higher energy costs will kill jobs in energy-intensive \nmanufacturing--steel, aluminum, cement, chemicals, plastics, \nfertilizers, and the pharmaceutical industry.\n  Green jobs are held out as a solution for some. But far too many will \nsee their future go from blue collars to burgers under the Obama energy \ntax.\n  All of us will face more pain at the pump. Higher energy costs \nimposed on our oil refiners will translate straight to higher gasoline \nand diesel prices. Families who depend on affordable gas will suffer, \ntruckers who depend on affordable diesel will suffer, farmers who \ndepend on affordable fuel will suffer, and workers who depend on \naffordable commutes will suffer from an energy tax.\n  How bad will things be? The President was only willing to admit to \nthe $646 billion he put in his budget. But administration officials in \nmeetings with staff are admitting costs ``two to three'' times that \namount or $1.3 trillion to $1.9 trillion to be paid by average \ncitizens.\n  We have to remember this is only an 8-year total. The President wants \nhis program to run through at least 2050, so the total new energy taxes \nimposed on families and workers will be much higher and continue.\n  Sponsors of the cap-and-trade bill we debated and defeated in the \nSenate last year said it would impose $6.7 trillion in higher energy \ncosts over its lifetime. Mr. President, $6.7 trillion was an outrageous \namount of money to impose on families and workers, and the Senate \nrightfully defeated the proposal. However, we can expect President \nObama's energy tax will be even more expensive than $6.7 trillion \nbecause of his planned stricter requirements and use of price \nmaximizing auctions.\n  The $6.7 trillion Lieberman-Warner bill the Senate defeated proposed \nto cut energy emissions by 70 percent. The President proposes an 80-\npercent cut.\n  The $6.7 trillion Lieberman-Warner bill, defeated here, required \nparticipation with a mix of no-cost approaches and auctions. On the \nother hand, the President is proposing a 100 percent use of auctions to \nset program prices.\n  What is an action about, after all, but a method to maximize prices? \nThus, President Obama's budget energy tax will maximize higher energy \nprices from climate legislation. That means President Obama will force \nfamilies and workers to pay even more than $6.7 trillion in higher \nenergy bills.\n  President Obama's budget energy tax will drive gasoline prices even \nhigher than the $1.40 per gallon EPA predicted for the bill we \ndefeated, the Warner-Lieberman proposal at the $6.7 trillion number.\n  President Obama's budget energy tax will force electricity bills even \nhigher than the 44-percent increase EPA predicted for the Lieberman-\nWarner proposal.\n  President Obama's budget energy tax will cost the average household \neven more than the $4,377 per year predicted for the Lieberman-Warner \nbill.\n  President Obama's budget will cut even more than the 3 million jobs \nthe American Council for Capital Formation predicted for the defeated \nLieberman-Warner proposal.\n  While I think no time is a good time to debate imposing at least $6.7 \ntrillion in new energy taxes, we certainly should not do so now.\n  That is why I am filing three amendments. My first amendment will \nrequire that any climate legislation\n\n[[Page S3976]]\n\npassed by the Senate does not cause significant job losses, especially \nin the Midwest, Great Plains, and the South. My second amendment will \nensure that any climate legislation does not increase residential \nelectricity, natural gas or fuel oil bills for homeowners. The last \namendment would protect farmers from higher fertilizer and fuel prices.\n  Senator Thune has filed an amendment to prevent climate legislation \nfrom raising electricity or gasoline prices. I strongly support this \namendment.\n  I hope we can protect our families, farmers, and workers by refusing \nhigher energy taxes, and I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  I thank the Chair and I thank my colleagues.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Bond for the time he has \ngiven to the budget discussion tonight.\n  I ask Senator Sessions, how much time would he like?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would ask to be notified at 7 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. All right.\n  Mr. President, I yield from Senator Gregg's time 7 minutes to the \nSenator, who is a member of the Budget Committee, and a very active and \nvalued member of the committee, Senator Sessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. I say to the Senator, it is a pleasure to work with you. You \ndo a great job in an exceedingly difficult situation.\n  But the net result so far is a budget that is thunderously \nirresponsible, and we cannot and should not pass it. We must not pass \nthis budget. I think it would send a signal that we are not serious \nabout our financial future, that the world may think, as the President \nof the European Union said in Europe recently, from the Czech Republic, \nthat the United States fiscal policy is on the road to hell. That was \nhis direct quote in the newspaper.\n  So this is a serious matter.\n  A President's budget states what the President believes in, and what \nhe wants to see accomplished over a period of time. A 10-year budget--\nwhich he submitted--is good. Sometimes we do 5 years. It could be 5 \nyears. Senator Conrad and the Democratic members of the Budget \nCommittee, unhappy with the numbers of the 10-year budget, submitted a \n5-year budget, and just did not talk about the second 5 years. But \nthere is a grim second 5 years also.\n  So this budget is a plan, a direction, a list of priorities of the \nPresident. What we can see with absolute certainty is that financial \nresponsibility is not a priority for the President. It is not. In fact, \nthe title of his budget is ``A New Era of Responsibility''--and the \nnumbers I am going to be talking about are either numbers that come \nright out of his budget called ``A New Era of Responsibility,'' from \nthe Office of Management and Budget, and it has explicit numbers about \nwhat it intends to spend, how much debt will be created and how much \ntaxes will be imposed and how it all will play out over a 10-year \nperiod.\n  So the Senate Budget Committee's budget suggests it is better or at \nleast it does not spend as much money. But I do not think that is \nsustainable. I think the real analysis came from the Director of the \nOffice of Management and Budget, Mr. Peter Orszag, the President's \nbudget manager, who said it is 98 percent of what President Obama asked \nfor.\n  Because there are some gimmicks in the Senate budget. And there are \nflaws in it that make it look better, such as not fully accounting for \nthe cost of fixing the alternative minimum tax or the doctor fix or \nTARP II or some of the other things we know we are going to be spending \nmoney on.\n  Let me just sum up the situation with regard to the CBO analysis, the \nCongressional Budget Office analysis. Our Congressional Budget Office \nanalyzes the President's budget and attempts to explain what it is. \nThey calculate numbers just like the President did. But very truly \ntheir analysis is more realistic and more likely to be true than the \nPresident's because he took some gimmicks too--not as many, I have to \nadmit, as some have taken, but he has quite a number of gimmicks in \nit. Without the gimmicks, our Congressional Budget Office gives us a \nreliable analysis. They work both Houses of Congress, their leadership \nis selected by the Democrats, and it is certainly not a Republican \ninstitution. They are proud of their nonpartisanship and their accuracy \nand their figures.\n\n  So this is what would happen to the debt held by the public if this \nbudget passes and becomes reality. In 2008, debt held by the public was \n$5.8 trillion. That represents the entire debt of the United States of \nAmerica since its founding. Under the proposed budget of President \nObama, by 2013 that debt will double to $11.8 trillion. In 5 years, it \nwill do that. In 2019, 5 more years later, it triples to $17.3 \ntrillion. I do not believe those numbers are challengeable in any \nsignificant way.\n  If you take the President's budget, you make sure that the figures, \ncalculated with legitimate expectations of the future as CBO has done--\nthis is what they come up with. The President's proposal assumes more \nfavorable numbers--instead of $17.3 trillion, $15-plus trillion, which \nis almost virtually three times the $5.8 trillion we have today. He \nadmits that is what his budget does, with his own numbers. So that is a \nbig question.\n  Here is an example of where we are with the debt. My colleagues \nsavaged President Bush for excessive spending, and the debt held by the \npublic did go up during his time in office, to over $5 trillion, but \nthis is not an exaggeration, colleagues. This is what the numbers show. \nIt is going to go up to $17 trillion.\n  So my first point to my colleagues and to those who might be \nlistening is these numbers are not political numbers ginned up out of \nthin air; these are numbers that have been calculated from the \nPresident's own budget, entitled ``A New Era of Responsibility,'' \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, and that is when they \nscore the situation to be 10 years from now.\n  So you say: Well, we are in an economic disaster area. We have very \nbad problems in the economy.\n  Well, maybe we do, but the President, in his expectation of income to \nthe Government, other than this year being a year of negative growth, \nassumes we will have positive growth in the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 3 additional minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. So according to his budget, in year 3, we will have 4 \npercent growth for 3 consecutive years and never have a recession and \nhave good growth all 10 years, except for this year, where we will have \n1.2 percent negative growth. Well, I think that is probably too \noptimistic. If it is too optimistic, then this figure is going to be \nworse. It could be far worse.\n  So what does that mean? Does the debt make a difference?\n  This is today's Wall Street Journal, an article by Mr. Mark \nWhitehouse in which he states that countries with mounting debt burdens \nwill:\n\n       Ultimately face a growing temptation to allow inflation to \n     accelerate more than they typically would--a move that would \n     slash the value of their debts as the prices of everything \n     else rose.\n\n  He points out that poor demand at a U.S. Government bond auction and \nthe failure of a separate auction in the UK added to unease about the \nmarket's willingness to support the country's heavy borrowing. So we \nhave now not only our country going in debt, we have the UK going into \ndebt, causing the European Union folks to get very nervous.\n  So who is going to buy this debt? When we go into debt, it doesn't \njust happen; somebody has to loan us the money. Right now, we sell \nTreasury bills. China has bought a whole lot of them, as well as Saudi \nArabia and other countries. We are talking about selling twice as many \nin 5 years, three times as many in 10, and at the same time other \ncountries are going into debt. Who is going to buy this, and what does \nit mean to the economy?\n  Mr. Whitehouse quotes Mr. Kenneth Rogoff, an economics professor at \nHarvard and a former chief economist of the International Monetary \nFund. This is what he said in today's paper. Mr. Rogoff says annual \ninflation could go as high as 8 to 10 percent within 3 to 5 years in \nthe United States and sooner\n\n[[Page S3977]]\n\nin the UK. He projects eight to ten percent inflation in 3 to 5 years, \nbased on what we are doing today. He notes that the average inflation \nrate in 1 month in this country has gone up 25 percent, the projected \nrate of inflation.\n  Debt matters. There are no free lunches. Nothing comes from nothing. \nDebts have to be repaid--not only repaid; we have to pay interest on \nit, and the interest on this debt will go, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, from $170 billion this year--that is what \nwe pay out of our whole $3 trillion budget--$170 billion is the \ninterest on the public debt--this $5 trillion. CBO is projecting that \n10 years from now, we will pay in interest $800 billion--$806 billion, \nto be exact. We spend $100 billion on education, so we will have \ninterest payments in just 10 years 8 times as large as the amount of \nmoney we spend on education. Our highway spending, $40 billion a year \ntoday--it will go up some, but we will be spending 20 times as much in \ninterest. So future generations in America will be paying an incredible \nburden of interest, denying them money to spend on education and \nhighways and other good things because we irresponsibly spent it now.\n  It is not right. It is wrong. It should not occur. We really need to \nhave a national discussion about this and try to fix this problem.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I wish to congratulate the Senator from \nAlabama, who has always succinctly and effectively described what we \nare confronting here, which is a wall of debt, a massive wall of debt, \nwhich will overwhelm our children. So I thank him for his statement.\n  At this point, I think the chairman had some comments on proceeding.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that on Tuesday, \nMarch 31, when the Senate resumes consideration of the budget \nresolution, the statutory time remaining be 40 hours, each side \ncontrolling 20 hours.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I further ask unanimous consent that we \ncome in at 10 a.m. and go to the budget resolution, with Senator Patty \nMurray being recognized for 15 minutes; at the conclusion of her \nremarks, that Senator Gregg or his designee be recognized for the \npurpose of offering an amendment with 1 hour equally divided; that at \nthe conclusion of that debate, Senator Boxer be recognized to offer an \namendment in relationship to the Thune amendment and that there be 1 \nhour equally divided; also, at the end of that period, that I be \nrecognized, or my designee, for a possible side-by-side to the Johanns \namendment. We may not need that, but we may, and so I ask unanimous \nconsent that that time be reserved as well.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. With that, we are ready to stand in recess for the day. I \nthink we are ready to go to closing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/30/senate-section/article/S3977-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3977]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Mr. President, I rise on a matter of personal privilege \nto talk about what is going on in my State. I was just there this past \nFriday morning and through the weekend. As the country knows, we are \nfacing record floods across the entire State of North Dakota. These are \ncrests we have never seen before on river after river in North Dakota. \nThe great Missouri was bogged down with ice dams and nearly flooded the \ncapital city last week, but that was prevented by a demolition team \nthat came in and set charges and blew a channel in the ice.\n  I was in Fargo, ND, on Friday and Saturday and Sunday--which everyone \nhas been watching--and it is truly inspirational to see what is \nhappening there. It is a town of 90,000, and the mayor told us \nyesterday that of those 90,000 people, they have 80,000 volunteers \nbecause everybody knows that everything is on the line. You go into the \nFARGODOME, which is a giant sports facility where NDSU plays its games, \nand they have thousands of volunteers, with rock music blaring. They \nmade 3 million sandbags in 7 days. Think about that--3 million sandbags \nin 7 days, working 24 hours a day, around the clock. They are fully \nstaffed around the clock, and they are doing everything that is humanly \npossible to save that city.\n  This was the headline yesterday in the Fargo Forum: ``Holding \nSteady.'' It shows a picture of National Guardsmen and the Coast Guard \nrescuing people, and you can see these massive ice chunks and the \nflood.\n  Today, we got the news that we can now anticipate another major \nwinter storm beginning tonight, with 6, 7, or 8 inches of snow. Of \ngreater concern, however, are the higher winds because we have miles \nand miles of dike--at least 38 miles of main dike. These dikes, of \ncourse, for the most part are clay dikes, and in many places those are \ntopped over with sandbags to raise the level. Because the weather \nservice raised the forecast level right at the end on us, we had to \nbuild the dikes up even further.\n  While the good news is that the river is dropping slightly--from just \nunder 41 feet to now just over 39 feet--we know there is a wall of \nwater headed for that river.\n  There is a most incredible snow wall--three times normal--out in the \nwatershed, and all that water is headed for this river. So while we are \ncautiously optimistic, we all know the dikes can breach. That happened \nthe night before last in the early hours, and we lost an entire high \nschool campus in the middle of the night. The good thing is the \ncontingency dikes that have been built right behind the main dikes \nheld--and I can tell you it is an impressive site.\n  Remember, this river is 22 feet above flood stage. So these massive \ndikes that have been built all along the river, and then these \ncontingency dikes behind them, are in preparation for a breach.\n  I attended early morning meetings with the city leadership. They have \nthis organized. They have rapid strike teams, rapid response teams, \nthey have 24-hour patrols trying to make certain the dikes don't \nbreach, that they are not seeping. If they get a report, the report \ngoes in, and they have four different types of rapid response teams \nready to go to fill the breach. If there were ever a case of an \nextraordinary outpouring, this is it.\n  This is a picture of what I was talking about in the FARGODOME. Look \nat this. This is thousands and thousands of people with sand, filling \nbags. This is what you see throughout that facility. This is just a \nsmall part of it. It is an absolute beehive of human activity working \nto defend that town and to save their homes.\n  So far we have been remarkably successful. There has been tragedy--2 \ndeaths, 50 injuries as of yesterday. But this has so far averted a much \nbigger crisis.\n  This is a picture of a home out in the county. You can see they have \ndiking around that home, and you can see there is not much freeboard \nthere. We are hoping it holds.\n  This is another picture that shows response of our National Guard. \nThis is one of the rapid response teams that moved to fill a place \nwhere the levee needed to be built up. There was some seepage. So this \nis one of the rapid response teams that has moved in to try to prevent \nthat dike from breaching. These guys have been absolutely heroic.\n  One of the things that has been interesting, there is a great rivalry \nbetween the University of North Dakota and North Dakota State. North \nDakota State is in Fargo; UND is in Grand Forks. In 1997, the great \nflood hit Grand Forks. So this year all the sports teams from UND are \ndown at NDSU with their rivals working together to defend these dikes.\n  This is a picture from yesterday. That is a 1-ton sandbag being \nlifted by a helicopter. They are going to put it in place to try to \ndivert the flow of the river. The river has tremendous force behind it. \nOf course that force is hitting the dikes. In order to divert at a \nvulnerable position, yesterday they dropped about a dozen of these 1-\nton sandbags to change the direction of the river.\n\n[[Page S3978]]\n\n  This is a picture of what you can see all throughout Fargo, ND. They \nhave Neighborhood Watch groups to patrol to make sure there is no \nseepage. If there is a place that needs to be built up, they put out a \ncall and people turn up just like this. You can see hundreds of people \nhere working to sandbag to try to defend their homes and defend their \nneighborhoods.\n  The thing that has kind of escaped the attention of the national \nmedia but which is so striking is, this flood threat is all across \nNorth Dakota, from the far western part of the State all across to \neastern North Dakota and the Red River Valley. The Red River Valley \ngets most of the attention, but we landed in Valley City on Friday and \nin Valley City--no, this was on Saturday--the snow around the airport \nwas 10 feet high. That is the Cheyenne River Valley. The Cheyenne River \nValley will crest later than the Red. But they are anticipating record \ncrest levels.\n  Again, we went to a place where they have the Winter Show, in Valley \nCity, ND. It is a big structure. There are hundreds of volunteers there \nworking around the clock. This is from my hometown, the Bismarck \nTribune, Bismarck, ND, with the headline, simply ``Battered,'' ``Area \nHit Hard by a 1-2 Punch.'' That was flooding and a blizzard; 12 to 18 \ninches of snow hit my hometown last week.\n  Last night we got another major winter storm. I am told more than 10 \ninches of snow hit last night. We were faced with an immediate threat \nof flooding.\n  Here you can see two guys wading. This is ice. They have broken \nthrough the ice in their hip waders, and this is all water. They are \ngoing to check on the home of a couple to make sure they are safe.\n  This is the kind of flooding that was in my hometown. Here is a \ncanoe, people going from one house to another in a canoe.\n  It is hard to fully appreciate the magnitude of this. We have had \nmassive snowfall in places in the State, three times average, of course \nleading to these record floods. We have never seen the Red River at \nthis height before in recorded history. Never before in recorded \nhistory has it been this high.\n  I want to say to people who are watching, it is inspirational to see \nthese communities come together, to work together in an all-out effort \nto save their homes, to save their communities. I could not be more \nproud of the people of North Dakota. Boy, faced with threat, they have \nabsolutely demonstrated what I think are heroic qualities.\n  I was pleased the President acknowledged this in his weekend address \nand talked about what this demonstrates about the human spirit. \nHonestly, you have to be there to fully appreciate what I am talking \nabout.\n  We are thinking about our friends and neighbors and families back \nhome, wishing them the very best as this flood fight continues. The \ngreat news is the river is going down, at least the Red is going down. \nBut we have to contend with this major winter storm that is going to \nhit tonight, and we also have to contend with something nobody can \npredict--how fast things will warm up. If it warms up too fast that \nwater out there is going to head for the river. We know we ought to \nkeep up our guard, and that is what everybody intends to do.\n  I also want to acknowledge the local leadership: Mayor Walaker, \nDeputy Mayor Tim Mahoney--what outstanding leadership they are \nproviding in that community. These guys are not working any 8-hour \ndays. It is round the clock and it could not be better. They are out \nthere urging their citizenry on. They have said: If we go down, we are \ngoing to go down swinging.\n  I tell you, I don't think they are going to go down. I think they are \ngoing to win.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/30/senate-section/article/S3978-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       Corporal Michael Ouellette\n\n  Mr. GREGG.

Offices will be \n     given a single economic allocation to purchase supported \n     computer and office equipment. This will ensure that offices \n     are better equipped in a manner that is ``revenue neutral'' \n     to the Senate. The regulations ensure that each employee or \n     detailee gets one workstation and access to appropriate \n     office equipment.\n       (2) Smoking Policy--Rule X, Rules for Regulation of Senate \n     Wing\n       The limited exception of approved indoor smoking space in \n     the Senate Wing of the Capitol and the Senate Office \n     Buildings has been removed due to the closing of all indoor \n     smoking rooms under the control of the Rules Committee. The \n     proposed text of Rule X deletes the exception for smoking \n     rooms in the Senate that no longer exist.\n       (3) Ticket Preparation Fees--Senate Travel Regulations\n       The proposed amendment removes the dollar amount from the \n     Senate Travel Regulations and authorizes the Rules Committee \n     to set a rate for ticket preparation fees. This will permit \n     the periodic adjustment of the fee by the Rules Committee \n     without necessitating a change in the regulations.\n       (4) Regulations Governing Rates Payable to Commercial \n     Reporting Firms for Preparation of Transcripts of Hearings in \n     the Senate\n       These regulations were last updated in 1990 and include \n     reimbursement to transcription companies that are well below \n     market rate. The proposed amended regulations authorize the \n     Rules Committee to publish and periodically update a schedule \n     of reimbursement rates for transcription services.\n       (5) Signature/Documentation Provisions--Regulations \n     Governing Senators' Official Personnel and Office Expense \n     Accounts\n       The provisions for authorized signature(s) were originally \n     adopted in 1979 and amended in 1992 to permit a designated \n     staff member to certify vouchers and the Senator to approve \n     them. An amendment in 2003 increased the threshold of the \n     receipt amount to $50. However, the 2003 amendment used the \n     1979 version of the regulations instead of the 1992 updated \n     version. The proposed change will update the signature/\n     documentation provisions to include the 1979, 1992, and 2003 \n     amendments, in accordance with the current practices used \n     throughout the Senate. If approved, this regulation will be \n     reprinted in\n\n[[Page S3979]]\n\n     the Senate Travel Regulations for the sake of convenience.\n       (6) Advance Payment Regulations\n       Language is being added at the request of Senate office \n     managers to clarify the obligation of funds at the end of a \n     fiscal year. There has been confusion over the years \n     regarding which funding period should be used for certain \n     types of expenses. The new language provides the necessary \n     explanation and is in accordance with the practices used \n     throughout the Senate. The regulation will also be amended to \n     permit Senate Officers to make advance payments.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Appendix II-A: Regulations Governing Allocation and Acquisition of \n  Equipment for Senators, Committees, Officers, and Employees of the \n                          United States Senate\n\n\n                       Sec. 1.

Mr. President, earlier this month, the Brady Center to \nPrevent Gun Violence released a report, ``Exporting Gun Violence,'' \nthat documents how Mexican drug gangs are exploiting weak U.S. gun laws \nand corrupt gun sellers in the U.S. to amass arsenals of high powered \nguns. These guns have been used to kill thousands in Mexico and pose an \nincreasingly grave security threat to both Mexico and the United \nStates.\n  Mexican law enforcement officials are increasingly being outgunned by\n\n[[Page S3982]]\n\ndrug gangs bearing military-style assault weapons, .50 caliber sniper \nrifles and other high powered weapons that originate from the United \nStates. According to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives, ATF, more than 7,770 guns recovered from crime scenes in \nMexico were traced back to gun dealers in the U.S. during 2008, up from \n3,300 in 2007. The ATF has warned that an ``iron river of guns is \nstreaming across the border at such a pace that some are being \nrecovered in Mexico within days after their purchase in the U.S.''\n  According to the U.S. Department of State's latest International \nNarcotics Control Strategy report, ``U.S.-purchased or stolen firearms \naccount for an estimated 95 percent of Mexico's drug related \nkillings.'' Unlike Mexico's tougher gun laws, unlicensed sellers in the \nU.S. are allowed to sell guns without a background check, civilians are \npermitted to purchase military-style assault weapons, and there are no \nlimits on the quantity of guns that can be sold at any given time. In \nthe U.S., a trafficker can purchase as many guns they want from an \nunlicensed seller, no questions asked.\n  On March 17, 2009, both ADM James Stavridis, commander of the U.S. \nSouthern Command, and GEN Gene Renaurt, commander of the U.S. Northern \nCommand, testified during a Senate Armed Services Committee hearing, \nwhich I chaired, that the large flow of guns into Mexico and Central \nAmerica from the U.S. is having a destabilizing impact in those \ncountries. Many believe this destabilization could pose a significant \nnational security threat to the U.S. According to the report, Mexican \nAttorney General Medina Mora has stated that, before the assault \nweapons ban in the U.S. was allowed to expire, only 21 percent of the \nweapons seized from traffickers were assault rifles, while today, it is \nmore than half.\n  President Obama has called for a comprehensive approach to the \ngrowing level of violence in Mexico. However, unless existing gun laws \nare strengthened, drug cartels and criminals in Mexico and the United \nStates will continue to build their arsenals. We must act to close the \ngun show loophole, reinstate the assault weapons ban and enact other \ncommonsense gun safety legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/30/senate-section/article/S3982-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3982-S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        OMNIBUS PUBLIC LANDS ACT\n\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I was pleased to attend today's \nPresidential signing ceremony for the Omnibus Public Lands Management \nAct of 2009, H.R. 146. In signing the act into law, President Obama \nunderscored the Nation's commitment to serve as a responsible steward \nof our public lands and cultural and natural resources.\n  As a bipartisan package of more than 160 individual bills, the \nenactment of this act culminates many hours of congressional hearings, \ndeliberation, and debate. As the former chairman of the Senate Energy \nand Natural Resources Subcommittee on National Parks, I was proud to \nhave chaired hearings on individual measures in the act and to have \nworked with my colleagues in the House and Senate to put together a \npublic lands package that confirms our Nation's desire to ensure that \nfuture generations will enjoy and benefit from the preservation of \nnatural resources and historic sites.\n  I join those who have praised this momentous act for setting aside \nmore than 2 million acres of land as protected wilderness and more than \n1,000 miles of wild and scenic rivers. It is important to note that \nthis act also is invaluable in protecting, preserving, and \nmemorializing our country's cultural heritage and natural resources. \nThis act contains four provisions that I sponsored during the 110th \nCongress which acknowledge the historical contributions made by Native \nHawaiians as well as the need to preserve Hawaii's unique heritage and \nbiodiversity for future generations: H.R. 3332, the Kalaupapa Memorial \nAct; S. 1728, the Na Hoa Pili O Kaloko-Honokohau Advisory Commission \nReauthorization Act; S. 2220, the Outdoor Recreation Act of 1963 \nAmendments Act; and S. 320, the Paleontological Resource Preservation \nAct, which preserves fossils across the Nation. In addition, it \nincludes a bill that I cosponsored, S. 1680, the Izembek and Alaska \nPeninsula Refuge Enhancement Act of 2008, which addresses the needs of \na rural and indigenous Alaska Native community.\n  Section 7108 authorizes a memorial to be established at Kalaupapa \nNational Historical Park, which is located on a remote peninsula on the \nisland of Molokai. This long overdue memorial will honor and perpetuate \nthe memory of those Hansen's disease patients who were forcibly \nrelocated to the Kalaupapa community, many of whom were buried with no \nmarked grave. This measure authorizes a nonprofit organization, Ka \n`Ohana O Kalaupapa, consisting of the remaining Kalaupapa residents and \nthe family and friends of current and past residents, to establish a \nmemorial at a suitable location in the Park for the 8,000 residents who \nlived at the Kalaupapa and Kalawao communities. This monument empowers \nthe people of Kalaupapa to share their story and the lessons learned as \nthe community came together to overcome their hardships. Previously \nonly recognized as a place of isolation, this monument will transform \nKalaupapa into a place of healing, education, and contemplation \nconnecting families to their ancestors.\n  The Na Hoa Pili O Kaloko-Honokohau Advisory Commission \nReauthorization Act, section 7401, extends the authorization for the \nNational Park's advisory commission through 2018. Located on the \nwestern coast of the island of Hawaii, Kaloko-Honokohau National \nHistorical Park was established in 1978 to provide for the \npreservation, interpretation, and perpetuation of the Park's cultural \nand natural features. The Advisory Commission has played an integral \nrole in advising the National Park Service to provide for the \neducation, enjoyment, and appreciation of traditional Native Hawaiian \nactivities and culture within the Park.\n  The Kaloko-Honokohau Park is a unique part of the Hawaii National \nPark System as it is home to two types of fish ponds, as well as the \n`Ai `opio fish trap, a 1.7-acre pond comprised of a manmade stone and \ncoral wall along the naturally curving shoreline. These are treasured \nsites not only from a cultural stand point demonstrating the ingenuity \nof Native Hawaiians in engineering these fishponds but also from a \nresource management perspective on how in the 21st century we can \nutilize such traditional knowledge to enhance our understanding and \nshape our management practices today.\n  Recognizing the importance of the `Ai `opio fish trap, in 2008 the \nNational Park Service Save America's Treasure program awarded a \n$350,000 grant to Project Ola `Ai `opio, a Park Service initiative to \nrestore the fish trap. Ocean waves and erosion have endangered the \nstructural integrity of the trap and the grant will be used to \nmethodically stabilize the kuapa--fish trap walls--over a 12-month \nperiod. This award not only aids in preservation of the fish trap but \nalso ensures that visitors will be able to appreciate Hawaii's unique \nhistorical and cultural heritage into the future.\n  Section 13006 of the act contains my bill to authorize appropriations \nfor fiscal years 2008 through 2017 in the amount of $5 million for the \noperation and maintenance of the National Tropical Botanical Garden. A \ncongressional charter established the National Tropical Botanical \nGarden in 1964 to foster horticultural research, education, and plant \npreservation. This authorization enables the National Tropical \nBotanical Garden to meet its Federal mandate and preserve unique \nspecies found only in Hawaii for the benefit of future generations. The \nNational Tropical Botanical Garden has proven itself to be a \nsignificant national and international resource. The tranquil beauty \noffered by its gardens, collection of rare and endangered plant life, \nfocused library and herbarium collections, scientific research, \nconservation initiatives, and education programs have all benefited the \nUnited States.\n  The National Tropical Botanical Garden is expressly mandated to \nfoster and encourage research of tropical flora in agriculture, \nforestry, horticulture, medicine, and other sciences for the benefit of \nall the people in the United States. It is a national resource for \nbiological science. Most recently, in 2008, it discovered Bilirubin, an \nanimal pigment, in plants. This important discovery documented for the \nfirst time that an animal pigment is naturally occurring in the seed of \nthe white bird of paradise tree.\n\n[[Page S3983]]\n\n  The National Tropical Botanical Garden is a national resource for \neducation and career development. Over four decades, it has developed a \nfull spectrum of educational offerings that provide opportunities for \nthe next generation of scientists. Over 5,000 school-aged children are \neducated each year in conservation principles and practices. The \nHorticultural Internship Program trains undergraduates in horticulture, \nbotany, and conservation.\n  In addition, the National Tropical Botanical Garden is a national \nresource for medical research. Its researchers have developed and hold \npatents on a potential anti-HIV drug called Prostratin that is \ncurrently going through clinical trials and are also working to find \nthe cause for Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Once a year, it \nholds a course accredited by the American Medical Association that \nprovides 16 credits to medical professionals in herbal remedies derived \nfrom plants. By enacting this provision into law, I am hopeful that the \nNational Tropical Botanical Garden will be able to continue with its \nimportant work for years to come.\n  The Paleontological Resources Preservation Act, title VI, subtitle D, \nhelps protect and preserve the Nation's important fossil resources that \nare found on Federal lands for the benefit of our citizens. As a matter \nof clarification, this bill covers only paleontological remains on \nFederal lands and in no way affects archaeological or cultural \nresources under the Archaeological Resources Protection Act of 1979 or \nthe Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act.\n  The provision to preserve paleontological resources, in its original \nand amended form, never intended to undermine the current practice of \ncasual collecting that is being enjoyed on Federal lands. \nNotwithstanding the educational benefits and the major fossil \ndiscoveries made by amateur collectors and curio hunters, this title \naddresses the increasing problem of intentional fossil theft on Federal \nlands. Vertebrate fossils are rare and important natural resources that \nhave become increasingly endangered due to an increase in the illegal \ncollection of fossil specimens for commercial sale. Recognizing that \nthere was no unified policy regarding the treatment of fossils by \nFederal land management agencies, I worked to include this provision in \nthe act to help protect and conserve fossil specimen, a valuable \nscientific resource. This act will provide uniformity to the patchwork \nof statutes and regulations that previously existed. Further, it will \ncreate a comprehensive national policy for preserving and managing \nfossils and other artifacts found on Federal land, and will prevent \nfuture illegal trade.\n  Title VI, subtitle E, the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge Land \nExchange, addresses the needs of a rural and indigenous Alaska Native \ncommunity. This subtitle allows developing a road that would provide \ndependable and safe year-round access for the residents of King Cove in \nAlaska to the nearby Cold Bay Airport. I believe that the 800 residents \nof King Cove, most of which are native Aleut, have an absolute right to \na reliable means of transport that is accessible under all weather \nconditions. This provision will help address many of the community's \nsafety, health, and medical concerns. The United States has a \nresponsibility to its indigenous people, and I am proud this provision \nwill enable this community and appropriate State and Federal \nstakeholders to move forward on this initiative.\n  Passage of this act was an extensive, challenging, but ultimately \nfulfilling journey, and I am pleased with today's enactment of the \nOmnibus Public Lands Management Act of 2009 into law. I am confident \nthis act will promote and strengthen opportunities to preserve Hawaii's \nand the Nation's environmental and cultural heritage. This landmark Act \nwill serve as a stable foundation for us to continue to build upon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/30/senate-section/article/S3983-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HOUSING AND ECONOMIC RECOVERY ACT\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to discuss S. \n253, a bill introduced by Senator Johnny Isakson to expand the home \nbuyer tax credit. I support this legislation and have asked to be added \nas a cosponsor.\n  A robust home buyer tax credit will spur consumer demand and help to \nstop the fall in home values, which continues to affect millions of \nAmericans. This decline is destroying the savings and net worth of \nAmericans, whose homes are their most valuable asset. Many now have \nmortgages that exceed the value of their homes.\n  The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created a tax credit \nfor first-time home buyers of $7,500 through June of 2009. However, \ntaxpayers were required to repay the tax credit in equal installments \nover 15 years, which greatly reduced its effectiveness. The 2009 \nStimulus bill waived the repayment requirement for purchases made in \n2009, increased the value of the credit to $8,000, and extended \neligibility for purchases made through November of 2009.\n  Further improvements are necessary, in my judgement, to bring about a \nrecovery in the housing market that will ultimately contribute to the \nturnaround of the broader economy. First, S. 253 would increase the \nvalue of the credit to 10 percent of the home price capped at 3.5 \npercent of Federal Housing Administration loan limits. These limits are \ngeographically dependent and would yield a credit ranging between \napproximately $10,000 and $22,000.\n  Second, S. 253 would make the home buyer tax credit available to any \nindividual who purchases a home, not just first-time home buyers. Doing \nso would stimulate demand for the entire range of homes on the market.\n  Finally, S. 253 would increase the income eligibility threshold to \nindividuals earning up to $125,000, or $250,000 in the case of a joint \nreturn. Currently, the credit is reduced for individuals with modified \nadjusted gross income, AGI, of more than $75,000--$150,000 for joint \nfilers--and is zero for those individuals with modified AGI in excess \nof $95,000--$170,000 for joint filers. Again, doing so would stimulate \ndemand for the entire range of homes on the market.\n  The need for a robust home buyer tax credit is clear. According to \nthe National Association of Realtors, pending home sales hit a record \nlow in January 2009. The pending home sales index, which measures the \nnumber of sales contracts signed each month, fell 7.7 percent to 80.4, \nthe lowest mark since 2001 when tracking began.\n  At the same time, the housing affordability index rose 13.6 \npercentage points to a record high of 166.8. A value of 100 means that \na family with the country's median income has exactly enough income to \nqualify for a mortgage on a median-priced existing single-family home. \nThe higher the index, the better housing affordability is for buyers.\n  These two figures, taken together, demonstrate that a robust home \nbuyer tax credit is needed to spur demand from Americans that are \nhesitant to buy homes for fear that prices will not stabilize.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/30/senate-section/article/S3983-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3983-S3985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       The rising cost of fuel along with the slow-down of the \n     housing industry has had a big effect on my family. My \n     husband is a residential contractor who builds homes all over \n     the valley. There are days when he spends\n\n[[Page S3984]]\n\n     more time in his vehicle than at the office. With the housing \n     market slump plus the rising cost of gas we have already had \n     to take pay cuts which will now put us in jeopardy of being \n     able to pay all of our bills. We have also reduced the \n     comfort level (temperature) of our home so that we can \n     continue to pay our electricity and natural gas bills.\n       The most difficult thing I encounter is to my weekly trips \n     to the grocery store. We have four growing children and it is \n     not cheap to feed them and ourselves. Each week I purchase \n     fewer groceries, yet my food bill does not diminish. Because \n     of the interest in bio-fuels, essentials like vegetable oil, \n     flour, and wheat are skyrocketing. The cost of vegetable oil \n     has more than doubled in the last six months.\n       My biggest source of frustration is the lack of action the \n     government is taking. It upsets me to no end that as a nation \n     we are paying trillions of dollars every year for oil to \n     nations that would very much like to destroy us. I believe \n     that other methods for fuel need to be looked into, but first \n     we need to be independent from outside oil. Let's use our \n     resources and pay Americans to find, drill, and to refine our \n     own oil! Let's help our economy by keeping the trillions of \n     dollars we are pouring into the Middle East inside our own \n     country. Not only would we keep our money here, but we could \n     employ thousands of Americans as well. I feel like the \n     leaders of this nation have lost sight of what is important \n     to the people. Get rid of the laws that are restricting our \n     prosperity, remember that the well being of human beings is \n     more important than animals, fish, bugs etc. and accomplish \n     something that will bring relief to hard working families.\n       Thank you for your time and for this opportunity to express \n     my feelings and concerns. I have felt so powerless for so \n     long when it comes to what is happening in this world, and I \n     have prayed to know how I can make a difference. I hope that \n     this will help you and that it will be an answer to my \n     prayers as well. I appreciate the service you give to our \n     State and Country.\n     Sarah, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       Like all Americans I am disturbed by the current state of \n     affairs in this country that are due to energy costs. There \n     are a number of things I believe the federal government can \n     do to either ease the burden in the short term, or to urge \n     the country forward to a much more independent state.\n       Short term suggestions:\n       Let us allow oil exploration in the currently prohibited \n     coastal areas, the Alaska National Wildlife Refuge, the Rocky \n     Mountains etc. A policy which ensures reasonable protections \n     for the environment yet provides the energy the American \n     people need, cannot be beyond the capacity of Congress to \n     develop.\n       Encourage President Bush to direct all Executive Agencies \n     to allow work shifts of four 10 hour days per week, for as \n     many employees as possible. He and Congress should further \n     encourage all employers in this country to do the same where \n     possible. A 20% reduction in commuting fuel use for employees \n     will help not only them, but reduce congestion, and therefore \n     fuel use, for everyone else as well. Those employers who can \n     shut down their operation for a day per week as well, will \n     save substantially in overhead energy costs. If it is \n     possible to implement an incentive for employers to do this \n     the federal government should provide one.\n       Longer term suggestions:\n       The US Postal Service has a very large fleet of vehicles \n     which would benefit from regenerative braking systems. I'm \n     specifically speaking of the Grumman Long Life Vehicles \n     (LLV's). They are on the road six days a week, for a \n     substantial portion of the day, and spend the majority of \n     that day stopping and going repeatedly. Eaton Corporation is \n     currently in partnership with Peterbuilt to produce garbage \n     trucks with hydraulic regenerative braking systems (http://\nwww.greencarcongress.com/2004/10/eaton_and_peter.html). A \n     group from UCLA has made substantial progress in using \n     compressed air as a storage medium in passenger cars. As the \n     USPS LLVs are all basically the same, a system could be \n     retrofitted to them at a reasonable cost, and it would \n     substantially lessen their fuel consumption. The Eaton system \n     is designed for trucks in excess of 7000 pounds, and UCLA's \n     system is not fully flushed out at this time. Nevertheless, I \n     see this as an area the federal government can take the lead \n     in, assisting in the proving of the technology, and in \n     getting to the necessary economy of scale needed to bring \n     these systems into the mainstream. I believe the USPS will be \n     able to break even on the investment in a short enough period \n     of time to make this viable.\n       The fleet of vehicles used by most government agencies is \n     diverse. Including a choice for full electric vehicles is \n     appropriate. While clearly a BLM ranger in Idaho won't be \n     able to function with an electric car with a 100 mile range, \n     I'm sure there are a number of applications for that same \n     vehicle in the DC area. GSA's vehicle contracts should bring \n     these vehicles into being within a few years.\n       We have the Renewable Fuels Standard (RFS), law on the \n     books now, but it is not as good a law as it should be. It is \n     written to reward industry for per gallon production of \n     biofuels. The easiest fuel for them to produce is ethanol, \n     which has about half the energy of gasoline, cannot be run in \n     unmodified engines, and has such an affinity for water that \n     we cannot use the existing fuel pipelines to transport it. \n     (It absorbs any water it encounters so it must be reprocessed \n     to remove that water.) This law should be modified to reward \n     industry for the production of readily usable fuels, and do \n     so on a gasoline energy equivalency scale. This will \n     encourage more production of biodiesel, and butanol. Butanol \n     is a 4 carbon alcohol (ethanol has two carbon atoms), it can \n     be run in unmodified engines in much higher concentrations \n     than ethanol, it is energy density is close to that of \n     gasoline and it has nowhere near the affinity for water that \n     ethanol has. Biodiesel is roughly equal to petroleum based \n     diesel in energy, and requires very little if any \n     modification of standard engines.\n       My understanding is that part of our gasoline price problem \n     is due to the limited number of refineries in this country. \n     Further the oil companies are not building new ones due to \n     the onerous environmental regulations which apply to new \n     facilities. (The older ones being grandfathered in with lower \n     requirements.) I'm having difficulty separating the truth \n     from the propaganda on this issue. If the preceding \n     statements are indeed correct, we need to reevaluate the \n     standards which a refinery must meet, and produce legislation \n     which encourages the creation of new facilities. As an \n     example, allow one refinery to be built which meets a lower \n     pollution standard for each two new ones which meet the \n     current requirements. Or allow a new refinery to meet lower \n     standards for the first three years of operation, before it \n     must be brought up to the higher standard. Or allow a new \n     refinery to meet the lower standards, but require it only \n     be built in areas which can tolerate the impact more \n     readily.\n       The Federal Government needs to initiate an effort on par \n     with the Apollo program or the Manhattan Project to relieve \n     us from dependence on foreign oil. We need research into \n     better batteries, capacitors with higher energy density, \n     hydrogen storage systems with higher energy density, more \n     efficient solar cells, inexpensive cellulase enzyme \n     production, and other technologies which will allow this \n     country to declare our independence again. I wouldn't mind if \n     the financing came by reducing the foreign aid to countries \n     which are not acting as our friends at this time. I sincerely \n     hope that you, and your fellow Senators and Congressmen can \n     help move the country forward from this untenable state,\n     Steve, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       With the higher energy prices, we are allocating more money \n     for fuel and less to other items which in the long run will \n     slow different parts of the economy...we have less money to \n     use on discretionary items. We are becoming part of a nation \n     that will only be able to work and will no longer be able to \n     enjoy any free time to vacation or buy needed things that \n     wear out because we cannot afford them. Only work and work--\n     nothing else.\n       (1) I am for opening all aspects of drilling and we have \n     the technology and expertise to drill responsibly. Drill \n     offshore and open all venues to drill for the oil we have.\n       (2) Suspend production of different blends of fuel, one \n     blend with different octane ratings for gas will free up \n     production. Pick a blend and stay with it throughout the U.S.\n       (3) Streamline in months not years the application process \n     for nuclear plants.\n       (4) This should be #1...remove all fuels and food products \n     from the hands of big speculators. These were developed to \n     hedge farm, and oil field production, let us get it back that \n     way and smaller speculators can still supply liquidity to the \n     market.\n       (5) If #4 does not work, then have safety valves by \n     government intervention in order to keep undue hardship from \n     befalling most Americans from high food and fuel prices?\n       (6) Urge Mr. Bernanke to raise interest rates to strengthen \n     the dollar.\n       (7) Use monies sent overseas to other countries to pay off \n     national debt to strengthen dollar.\n       (8) Raise taxes on people making over $200,000 to help pay \n     off national debt to strengthen dollar. We paid it off once. \n     Let us do it again the same way. No need to re-invent the \n     wheel; just get it done!\n       (9) Quit [partisan] bickering. These policies can help \n     everyone; poverty knows no party. We need solutions and we \n     need them now!\n       (10) Hefty windfall profits tax to companies that are \n     exploiting us and jail time to the people that are making \n     large profits from things that are necessities of life. Some \n     are not eating, some are not heating their homes, some are \n     dying because of it. Shame on them, and our seniors who are \n     lifelong taxpayers are being shunned and left to die.\n     Jimmy.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a large fish farmer from the Magic Valley. Our energy \n     costs have escalated over the past few years and \n     unfortunately we deal with very perishable food. Our trout \n     must be shipped directly to buyers without changing hands so \n     we must cope with the huge cost of fresh transport across the \n     nation. Idaho is a fabulous place to live and what makes it \n     so nice are the wide open spaces between us all. So, just \n     like having to send fish in a hurry, the citizens of Idaho \n     must travel large distances. I grew up in Iowa, and there is \n     a town\n\n[[Page S3985]]\n\n     every five to ten miles. Here we must travel sometimes 50 to \n     80 miles between towns. Sometimes farther to purchase items \n     from larger cities.\n       I think it is wise to look at the bigger picture and try to \n     figure out where we can save fuel and where we cannot. I \n     think that shipping products by rail is one very, very \n     efficient way to use fuel. Unfortunately for most shippers \n     the slow movement of products by rail discourages most of us \n     from using this efficient means of transportation. If our \n     government provided railroads with the funds needed to \n     improve their infrastructure by double, triple, or even \n     quadruple tracking the most efficient corridors, we may \n     divert the thousands of inefficient trucks from using so \n     much diesel fuel. It is possible to move products by rail \n     nearly as fast as trucks can. This may in turn reduce \n     demand and thus reduce the cost of fuel for the average \n     citizens of Idaho.\n     Dirk.\n                                  ____\n\n       I think that the oil companies should increase the \n     production because it is putting our nation's truck drivers \n     out of business and without truck drivers who will carry our \n     freight.\n     Charlie, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am from Burley, but am presently teaching English in \n     Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. I am sure you know that these gasoline \n     prices Americans are now paying have been this high, or \n     generally, much higher, in Europe, Asia, and Africa. We \n     Americans do not have any room to whine, but rather we simply \n     need to learn how to cope, like the rest of the world. Gas is \n     ten bucks a gallon in the UK. Thailand is around the same, as \n     is Japan. I say let us Americans experience what the rest of \n     the world has been experiencing for many years.\n     Bob.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a retired federal employee, after 40 years of federal \n     service as an air traffic controller, and six years military. \n     I feel I have a voice as to what should happen in my \n     retirement. My fuel costs have now exceed my food costs, \n     which means less food. Having a small retirement fixed income \n     means sacrifices in food, medical treatment, and other \n     necessary expenses. The irony of it all is it is not \n     necessary. Stop China's offshore drilling into our oil, \n     authorize ANWR, stop exporting our Alaskan oil, listen \n     intently to the Governor of Alaska and her solutions for some \n     of our energy problems. Get all of our alternative energy \n     systems up and running now, not next year, now. Just because \n     other governments have failed, is it just fashionable that we \n     should cause ours to fail??? Also, we as a people should be \n     very embarrassed, with the way we have conducted our \n     political fiasco the last few months. It has been a total \n     disgrace.\n     Gene.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am sending you this email in response to your questions \n     on how energy prices are affecting me. I have a family of \n     eight. We cannot downsize to a more fuel-efficient vehicle. \n     We will have driven about 5,000 miles this summer just for \n     family vacation, family reunions, and church camps. That is \n     about $1,300 in gas, assuming it averages $4.00 per gallon. \n     In addition, we are the kids' taxi for soccer, piano, guitar, \n     dance, scouts, and other activities. Rising energy prices are \n     causing a noticeable rise in the food prices for a family of \n     8. I am also a small business owner struggling to keep my \n     business going. I have to travel. Airplane and rental car \n     prices have gone up noticeably.\n       To address this issue, I think first priority is to \n     increase drilling in the Gulf and ANWR and build new domestic \n     refineries. We know how to do that--we can do it relatively \n     quickly. Once our foreign oil sources see that we are serious \n     about domestic production, they will lower the prices to get \n     us to forget about it and be complacent again. It will be a \n     few years before our new oil rigs and refineries come online \n     but the message to the world will be clear. Do not let the \n     government impact big oil with extra taxes or limits. Nuclear \n     and other alternative energy sources are good but will take \n     too long to come online and have an impact. But we need to \n     foster companies to develop those sources. Conservation by \n     getting people to change their behavior is impractical and \n     temporary. Conservation by developing new technologies will \n     help our energy situation. I am helping develop technology \n     with a client, Green Plug (www.greenplug.us), that will \n     conserve electrical energy. In summary, let big oil and other \n     energy companies flourish. Let capitalism work its wonders.\n     Gary, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       My husband and I returned from Arizona yesterday, after \n     being away from home for six weeks. The reason that we went \n     to Arizona was to visit the Mayo Clinic, since the ailment my \n     husband had was unable to be treated here. We are blessed to \n     have family in the Phoenix area, so we were able to stay with \n     them. The very big expense was the price we had to pay for \n     fuel going and coming back. We live in McCall, and any time \n     we need to see a specialist we have to drive to Boise which \n     is a 100 miles away. Again the price of gas is choking us. It \n     is sad to know that we have oil available in this country, \n     but that Congress does everything to stop us from getting it. \n     We listened to President Bush's speech today, and agree \n     wholeheartedly with what he said. Our view is also that we \n     need to develop nuclear power, and any other means of keeping \n     this country self reliant.\n     Louise, McCall.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am writing concerning the high cost of fuel, and in hopes \n     that you and your fellow Senators will act and do something \n     to give us relief. My husband and I own a small business \n     doing demolition and excavation. We own one tractor truck and \n     several pieces of heavy equipment. We are a ``one-man'' \n     operation. Just the other day we paid $4.34 a gallon for off-\n     road diesel. On road diesel is even higher. It takes almost \n     $1,000 to fill the tanks on the truck. Because of the \n     slowdown in the building market around here, jobs are hard to \n     come by. We can only afford to raise our rates so much--then \n     we lose the business all together.\n       On a different note, my mother and sister have both been \n     unemployed for a few months. They both just got jobs in \n     another city about 15 miles away. They both get paid $9.00 an \n     hour and work about 30 hours a week. We are very excited that \n     they are now able to stop receiving government aid. However, \n     with the price of gasoline over $4 a gallon in the end they \n     will hardly make enough to pay their rent and other bills. \n     (They work in different places doing one-on-one care for \n     special needs children and are unable to carpool either.) \n     This, to me, is a sad state of affairs when people should be \n     excited about supporting themselves, but are still unsure of \n     whether they can.\n       I grew up in Texas during the oil boom in the 80s. Drilling \n     for oil there did not hurt anyone I knew. I am sure that \n     technologies have improved over the past two decades, so any \n     environmental concerns should be taken care of. I do not \n     understand why we are not taking advantage of the resources \n     we have in our own country to provide for ourselves as well \n     as provide much needed jobs for our citizens. Please lift the \n     ban on off-shore exploration, oils shale production, and \n     drilling in ANWR. Also, has the idea of suspending the \n     federal fuel tax for period of time been dismissed? This \n     would provide immediate short-term relief. Please encourage \n     your counterparts to consider the working class of America. \n     We need a break!\n     Shelli.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am very concerned about ever-increasing energy costs.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \ncapacity of the Department of Veterans Affairs to recruit and retain \nphysicians in Health Professional Shortage Areas and to improve the \nprovision of health care to veterans in rural areas, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am today introducing legislation to make \nvarious improvements to VA rural health care. I am pleased to be joined \nin this effort by Senators Max Baucus and Mark Begich. The legislation \nis designed to bring more doctors into small communities; promote the \nuse of volunteer counselors to help with mental health issues; expand \ntelemedicine services; and create incentives for VA's community \npartners to provide high quality services to veterans.\n  As the drawdown of forces in Iraq begins, VA must be prepared to meet \nthe health care needs of veterans upon their return.\n  Many veterans live in small towns and communities. This includes a \nlarge number of Guard members and Reservists who have served in such an \nintegral role in Iraq and Afghanistan. Members of the Guard and Reserve \nface challenges that are different than those faced by their active \nduty counterparts, who return to military bases with the support of \ntheir unit and programs geared toward re-acclimating them to life \noutside of the combat zone. When members of the Guard or Reserves \nreturn home, they often are isolated from their units, leaving them to \nreintegrate back into their communities without a strong VA or DoD \npresence or support system.\n  When health care is needed, a rural community may not have providers \nwho offer mental health services, such as group counseling, and may not \nbe familiar with treating combat-related disorders.\n  I believe strongly that there is an obligation to care for all \nveterans in need, regardless of where they live. We must ensure that \nadequate resources are available to serve those who live in rural \ncommunities, and that VA works closely with local health care providers \nto help meet the need for care. It is critical that VA reach out to \nveterans living in rural communities so that they receive the care they \nneed. Every resource must be united in the effort to care for wounded \nwarriors, whether in a community hospital or VA clinic. When there is \nno VA presence in a community, VA may need to pay community providers \nfor the reasonable costs of care.\n  Last month, the Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing on \nhealth care for veterans in rural areas. We heard from the chief \nexecutive officer of a community hospital, from a former director of a \nrural health clinic, and from outreach organizations who work to bridge \nthe gap between VA and community health care systems. These witnesses \ntestified about how hard it is for veterans who live in rural areas to \nfind health care in the communities where they live, and about how \ndifficult it is for community hospitals and clinics to provide quality \nservices with the limited resources available to them.\n  Committee on Veterans' Affairs staff also conducted an oversight \nvisit to Hawaii and saw firsthand the needs of veterans living in rural \ncommunities on the neighbor islands. Many of those veterans find it \nhard to access VA health care because of travel restrictions and a \nshortage of services in their communities. Committee staff found that \ntechnology was not being used to bridge this gap; indeed, the use of \ntelemedicine is actually declining in Hawaii.\n  The legislation we are introducing today would help address the needs \nof veterans living in rural communities in a number of ways.\n  First, the bill would bring more doctors to targeted communities by \nrepaying their student loans while they work for VA. Currently, VA's \nloan repayment program is capped at an amount that is less than \\1/3\\ \nthe average cost of medical school. This bill would remove the cap, \nallowing VA to offer full loan repayment so as to provide a much more \neffective recruitment tool.\n  In addition, this bill would encourage VA and HHS to use the National \nHealth Service Corps Scholarship Program to recruit physicians for VA \nfacilities located in underserved areas. The National Health Service \nCorps pays for medical school up front in exchange for a doctor's \nagreement to work in an underserved area after graduation.\n  To address the shortage of mental health providers in many \ncommunities, this legislation would also allow VA to shorten the \ncredentialing and privileging process for licensed volunteer counselors \nwho could provide mental health services to our veterans.\n  The legislation would also create a pilot program to place VA doctors \nin community hospitals so as to enable them to provide more continuous \ncare for veterans. Under this pilot, VA doctors working in communities \nwithout a VA hospital would be able to follow their patients when \nadmitted to the local hospital. Participating VA doctors would earn \nadditional compensation for assuming these responsibilities, thereby \ncreating financial incentives for doctors to stay within VA. Since many \nnon-VA hospitals do not have mental health providers or other providers \nexperienced in the treatment of conditions such as post-traumatic \nstress disorder that disproportionately affect veterans, this would \nalso bring needed expertise into other care communities.\n  This bill would also allow VA to monitor the quality of care provided \nin non-VA facilities. Currently, there is no way for VA to do such \nquality assurance in a systematic way. This bill would encourage VA's \ncommunity partners to participate in quality programs like peer review, \nor to seek accreditation by an outside organization.\n  This bill also would bring new technologies to rural communities. By \nmodifying VA's internal mechanism for distributing funds, the \nlegislation would provide incentives for VA hospitals and clinics to \nuse telehealth technologies. VA currently bases the distribution of \nfunds to its facilities on workload and does not currently count all \ntelehealth visits in a facility's workload. By requiring VA to give \nhospitals and clinics credit for telehealth\n\n[[Page S3989]]\n\nvisits, this bill will promote the natural expansion of these services \nto our veterans.\n  Finally, for those veterans who must travel by air to obtain their \nhealth care--because of their health status, geography or other \nbarriers--this bill would allow VA to pay beneficiary travel benefits \nfor airfare to those veterans who cannot afford it. In recognition of \nthe cost of airfare, a different income eligibility standard from that \nused for ground transportation would be used in connection with \nreimbursement of the costs of air travel.\n  I urge our colleagues to work with me and the other members of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee to improve access to health care for \nveterans who live in rural areas.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 734\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide for improvements in the Federal hiring \nprocess and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security \nand Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, today I introduce the Federal Hiring \nProcess Improvement Act to help agencies fix the broken recruitment and \nhiring process in the Federal Government. I am pleased to be joined by \nmy good friend Senator Voinovich in this effort.\n  The Federal Government is the largest employer in the U.S., but every \nday talented people interested in Federal service walk away because the \nhiring process is longer and more complicated than that of other \nemployers. Too many Federal agencies have built entry barriers for new \nworkers, done too little to recruit the right candidates, and invented \nan evaluation process that discourages qualified candidates.\n  In the private sector, many employers post job vacancies through a \nvariety of online and other venues and require only a resume and cover \nletter to apply. Applying to the federal government should be similarly \naccessible and easy. However, agencies often require substantial essays \nand other documentation at the initial application stage.\n  Agencies need to adapt, just as the private sector has, to take \nadvantage of modern technology to boost recruitment efforts and \nstreamline the hiring process to make it more user friendly. \nInexpensive outlets such as social networking sites offer agencies an \nopportunity to expand their profile and post job opportunities without \nemptying their wallets. It is easier than it was in the past to submit \nand track application materials during the application process. \nAgencies should accept candidate-friendly applications such as resumes \nand cover letters for the initial application and ask for additional \ninformation only as needed. Likewise, technology makes it possible to \nprovide automated information to candidates, so candidates should \nreceive timely and informative feedback about the application process.\n  Additionally, more employees with advanced and technical skills are \nneeded in the modern federal workforce, so more pipelines into colleges \nand technical schools need to be developed to recruit candidates from \ndiverse backgrounds.\n  Last year, I chaired a hearing of the Subcommittee on Oversight of \nGovernment Management, the Federal Workforce, and the District of \nColumbia, where witnesses testified to the need for reforms in the \nhiring process. The Government Accountability Office testified to the \nbroad failures of agencies to address such problems as passive \nrecruitment strategies, unclear job vacancy announcements, and \nimprecise candidate assessment tools. Witnesses testified that young \npeople are greatly interested in Federal Government service, but \nagencies need to meet them where they are. Developing broader \nrecruitment strategies, using online resources and streamlining the \nhiring process are essential to attracting the next generation of \nFederal employees.\n  In response to the hearing, the Office of Personnel Management, OPM, \ndeveloped the End-to-End Hiring Roadmap initiative that provides \nagencies a streamlined 80-day model from the time a manager seeks to \nfill a position to the time an offer is made. This initiative addresses \nstrategic workforce planning, targeted recruitment, clear job \nannouncements, and hiring flexibilities. The initiative also advocates \naccepting resumes and cover letters over the lengthy and onerous \nknowledge, skills, and abilities essays, KSAs, required for many \nFederal jobs.\n  This initiative includes many positive steps, but many agencies are \nnot adopting them. OPM does not have the authority to require agencies \nto do so. Congress must step in.\n  The Federal Hiring Process Improvement Act requires agencies to \ndevelop strategic workforce plans, including hiring projections and \ncritical skills gaps analyses of the workforce; post brief, clear job \nannouncements in plain writing; Allow submission of resumes and cover \nletters and no longer require KSAs; provide timely notification to \napplicants of the status of their application; take no more than 80 \ndays from the time a manager decides to fill a vacancy to the time an \noffer is made; keep an inventory of all applicants who elect to be \nconsidered for other Federal vacancies; and measure the effectiveness \nof hiring efforts and reforms.\n  Agencies must make reforming the recruitment and hiring process a top \npriority, and this bill furthers the discussion. The Federal Hiring \nProcess Improvement Act will require agencies to abandon their stale \nrecruitment and hiring processes and develop streamlined hiring \npractices that attract high-quality candidates. The future of the \nFederal workforce is depending on it.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 736\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join my good friend and \npartner in Federal workforce issues, Senator Daniel K. Akaka, to \nintroduce the Federal Hiring Process Improvement Act of 2009.\n  When we discuss hiring, we discuss a process that affects every \nindividual employed by the government today. Making the right hiring \ndecisions affects the current workforce's ability to continue doing \ntheir jobs. It also is the same process these employees must go through \nwhen pursuing new opportunities within the Government, including \npromotions.\n  Additionally, we need to convey to the thousands of men and women at \nall stages of their career that the Federal Government is more than \njust an employer, but a place where Americans can utilize and grow \ntheir skills in service to their Nation.\n  As the old cliche goes, ``You never get a second chance to make a \nfirst impression.'' We need to convey to these Americans that the \nFederal Government wants them. If we do not, someone else will.\n  The Baby Boomers are retiring at a time when needs and demands on \nGovernment continue to grow. The Office of Personnel Management has \nidentified certain areas of critical hiring importance: air traffic \ncontrollers, border patrol officers, engineers, food inspectors, human \nresources specialists, nurses, visa examiners, patent examiners, \nscientists, veterinarians, accountants, and acquisition professionals. \nIn addition, the Partnership for Public Service has estimated the \nFederal Government will lose approximately 530,000 employees over the \nnext 5 years, including many mission critical jobs.\n  We know the challenges confronting the Federal Government. Now we \nmust make sure our processes result in hiring the right person, at the \nright place, at the right time, to get the job done.\n  Over and over, we hear of the problems in the Federal hiring process. \nIt takes too long; it is too burdensome, and so forth. The quality of \ntechnology has improved, but our processes have not. This does nothing \nto dispel any preconceived notions that the Federal Government is \nnothing but a bureaucratic system.\n  Accordingly, Senator Akaka and I are introducing legislation to \nstreamline the hiring process. The Federal Hiring Process Improvement \nAct brings together commonsense solutions to a government-wide \nmanagement challenge. Our legislation would require job announcements \nto be written in plain language; guarantee agencies provide feedback to \napplicants at a minimum of four key points during the process; and \nensure individual hiring decisions are made within 80 days or less. In \naddition, our legislation would require agencies to improve their \nworkforce planning and make hiring projections available to the public.\n  Too often, we have heard that processes exist for what I believe to \nbe unacceptable reasons, such as, that is how it always has been done. \nBut to be an employer of choice, the government must understand what \nthe competition is doing and adapt to the changing environment. This \nlegislation is an important first step in meeting that goal.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. COLLINS (for herself and Mr. Udall of Colorado):\n  S. 737. A bill to amend the Energy Independence and Security Act of \n2007 to authorize the Secretary of Energy to conduct research, \ndevelopment, and demonstration to make biofuels more compatible with \nsmall nonroad engines, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, today I, along with Senator Udall of \nColorado, am introducing legislation that would amend the Energy \nIndependence and Security Act of 2007 to expand on a research, \ndevelopment, and demonstration program, authorized in that bill, to \ninclude efforts to make biofuels more compatible with small non-road \nengines.\n  The Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, directed the \nSecretary of the Department of Energy, DOE, in coordination with the \nSecretary of the Department of Transportation, DOT, and in consultation \nwith the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, to \ncarry out a program of research and development regarding the impact \nthat biofuels, like ethanol, may have on existing fuel storage and \ndelivery infrastructure used for petroleum-based fuels. It is critical \nthat these biofuels also are safe to use in operating small non-road \nengines. My bill requires these agencies to expand their research \nprogram to include small engines such as those in snowmobiles, boats, \nlawnmowers, and chainsaws.\n  Previous testing done through DOE shows that increased ethanol \ncontent in smaller engines creates a leaner burning mixture, which may \nincrease idle speed on some small engines, creating unanticipated \nclutch engagement on equipment such as chainsaws and handheld trimmers. \nAlso, ethanol is more corrosive and less efficient than traditional \ngasoline blends. During these difficult economic times, equipment \ndamage due to ethanol-gasoline fuel blends only adds to the many \nchallenges facing Maine's farmers, fishermen, independent woodsmen, and \nrecreational industry.\n  As we pursue strategies to lessen our dependence on foreign oil, we \nmust also take action to ensure that ethanol fuel blends are safe and \nefficient for small engines. I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 737\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. BIOFUELS DISTRIBUTION AND ADVANCED BIOFUELS \n                   INFRASTRUCTURE.\n\n       Section 248 of the Energy Independence and Security Act of \n     2007 (42 U.S.C. 17054) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by striking ``and new alternative \n     distribution infrastructure'' and inserting ``, new \n     alternative distribution infrastructure, and effects on small \n     engines''; and\n       (2) in subsection (b)--\n       (A) in paragraph (8), by striking ``and'' after the \n     semicolon at the end;\n       (B) by redesignating paragraph (9) as paragraph (10); and\n       (C) by inserting after paragraph (8) the following:\n       ``(9) problems associated with the use of biofuels in small \n     nonroad engines; and''.\n\n[[Page S3994]]\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER:\n  S. 740. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to expand \nthe homebuyer tax credit, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to introduce \nlegislation to further expand the home buyer tax credit.\n  A robust home buyer tax credit will spur consumer demand and help to \nstop the fall in home values, which continues to affect millions of \nAmericans. This decline is destroying the savings and net worth of \nAmericans, whose homes are their most valuable asset. Many now have \nmortgages that exceed the value of their homes.\n  The Housing and Economic Recovery Act of 2008 created a tax credit \nfor first-time home buyers of $7,500 through June of 2009. However, \ntaxpayers were required to repay the tax credit in equal installments \nover 15 years, which greatly reduced its effectiveness. The 2009 \nStimulus bill waived the repayment requirement for purchases made in \n2009, increased the value of the credit to $8,000, and extended \neligibility for purchases made through November of 2009.\n  Further improvements are necessary, in my judgment, to bring about a \nrecovery in the housing market that will ultimately contribute to the \nturnaround of the broader economy. First, this bill would amend the \nStimulus bill and raise the value to $15,000, or 10 percent of the \nvalue of the home, whichever is less.\n  Second, this bill would make the home buyer tax credit available to \nany individual who purchases a home, not just first-time home buyers. \nDoing so would stimulate demand for the entire range of homes on the \nmarket.\n  Finally, this bill would remove the income eligibility threshold. \nAgain, doing so would stimulate demand for the entire range of homes on \nthe market. Currently, the credit is reduced for individuals with \nmodified adjusted gross income, AGI, of more than $75,000, $150,000 for \njoint filers, and is zero for those individuals with modified AGI in \nexcess of $95,000, $170,000 for joint filers.\n  The need for a robust home buyer tax credit is clear. According to \nthe National Association of Realtors, pending home sales hit a record \nlow in January 2009. The Pending Home Sales Index, which measures the \nnumber of sales contracts signed each month, fell 7.7 percent to 80.4, \nthe lowest mark since 2001 when tracking began.\n  At the same time, the housing affordability index rose 13.6 \npercentage points to a record high of 166.8. A value of 100 means that \na family with the country's median income has exactly enough income to \nqualify for a mortgage on a median-priced existing single-family home. \nThe higher the index, the better housing affordability is for buyers.\n  These two figures, taken together, demonstrate that a robust home \nbuyer tax credit is needed to spur demand from Americans that are \nhesitant to buy homes for fear that prices will not stabilize.\n  Recent reports indicate a 13-month supply of unsold new homes, \ncompared with a 4-month supply under more normal circumstances. Add to \nthat a continually increasing number of foreclosed homes. According to \nthe RealtyTrac 2008 Year-End Foreclosure Market Report, a total of 3.2 \nmillion foreclosure filings--default notices, auction sale notices and \nbank repossessions--were reported on 2.3 million U.S. properties during \n2008, an 81 percent increase in total properties from 2007 and a 225 \npercent increase in total properties from 2006.\n  Jobs across all industries have been lost as a result of the housing \ncrisis. According to a March 2, 2009, op-ed in the Washington Post by \nRobert J. Samuelson, ``Since late 2007, housing-related jobs--\ncarpenters, real estate agents, appraisers--have dropped by 1 million, \na quarter of all lost jobs.''\n  I applaud the efforts of Senator Johnny Isakson, who has been the \nleader on this issue in the Senate. I cosponsored his legislation in \nthe 110th Congress to create a home buyer tax credit. In the 111th \nCongress, I supported his amendment to the Stimulus bill to make \nimprovements to the credit and I have decided to join him as a \ncosponsor of S. 253, which seeks to make further improvements.\n  The bill I am introducing is different from S. 253 in three main \nways. First, my bill would improve the home buyer credit using the 2009 \nStimulus bill as a starting point. Second, my bill would increase the \nvalue of the credit to $15,000, or 10 percent of the home value, \nwhichever is less, whereas S. 253 would increase the credit amount to \n10 percent of the home price capped at 3.5 percent of Federal Housing \nAdministration loan limits. These limits are geographically dependent \nand would yield a credit ranging between approximately $10,000 and \n$22,000. Finally, my bill would remove income limitations on the \ncredit, whereas S. 253 limits the credit for individuals earning up to \n$125,000, or $250,000 in the case of a joint return.\n  I believe it is important for both bills to be pending so that \nadditional ideas can be debated. To that end, I look forward to working \nwith Senator Isakson to build consensus and support for further \nimprovements. As long as forecasts predict that home prices are falling \nand that the economy will remain weak, a large fraction of potential \nhomebuyers may choose to remain on the sidelines without a robust tax \ncredit in place.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, or the legislation \nintroduced by Senator Isakson, to make further improvements to the home \nbuyer tax credit.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. SPECTER\n  S. 741. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to impose a \nflat tax only on individual taxable earned income and business taxable \nincome, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, American taxpayers face another Federal \nincome tax deadline. The date of April 15 stabs fear, anxiety, and \nunease into the hearts of millions of Americans. Every year during \n``tax season,'' millions of Americans spend their evenings pouring over \npage after page of IRS instructions, going through their records \nlooking for information and struggling to find and fill out all the \nappropriate forms on their Federal tax returns. Americans are \nintimidated by the sheer number of different tax forms and their \ninstructions, many of which they may be unsure whether they need to \nfile. Given the approximately 582 possible forms, not to mention the \ninstructions that accompany them, simply trying to determine which form \nto file can in itself be a daunting and overwhelming task. According to \nthe 2008 annual report to Congress, released on January 7, 2009 by the \nNational Taxpayer Advocate for the IRS, U.S. taxpayers and businesses \nspend about 7.6 billion hours a year complying with the filing \nrequirements of the Internal Revenue Code. This figure does not include \nthe millions of additional hours that taxpayers must spend when they \nare required to respond to an IRS notice or audit. Much of this time is \nspent burrowing through IRS laws and regulations which fill over 17,000 \npages and have grown from 744,000 words in 1955 to 7.1 million words in \n2005. By contrast, the Pledge of Allegiance has only 31 words, the \nGettysburg Address has 267 words, the Declaration of Independence has \nabout 1,300 words, and the Bible has only about 1,773,000 words.\n  The majority of taxpayers still face filing tax forms that are far \ntoo complicated and take far too long to complete. According to the \nIRS's most available data, the average time burden for all taxpayers \nfiling a 1040, 1040A, or 1040EZ in 2006 was 26.4 hours, with an average \ncost of $207 per return. Taxpayers filing 1040 forms had an average \nburden of approximately 34 hours. Moreover, this complexity is getting \nworse each year. According to the estimated preparation time listed on \nthe forms by the IRS, the 1999 Form 1040 was estimated to take 12 hours \nand 51 minutes to complete. Thus, the time it now takes to fill out \nthese tax forms has more than doubled over an eight year period.\n  It is no wonder that more than 80 percent of individual taxpayers pay \ntransaction fees to help file tax returns. Well over half of all \ntaxpayers, 61 percent according to a recent survey, now hire an outside \nprofessional to prepare their tax returns for them. However, the fact \nthat only about 35 percent of individuals itemize their deductions \nshows that a significant percentage of our taxpaying population \nbelieves that the tax system is too\n\n[[Page S3995]]\n\ncomplex for them to deal with. We all understand that paying taxes will \nnever be something we enjoy, but neither should it be cruel and unusual \npunishment. Further, the pace of change to the Internal Revenue Code is \nbrisk. Since the beginning of 2001, there have been more than 3,250 \nchanges to the tax code, an average of more than one a day, including \nmore than 500 changes in 2008 alone. And we are far from being \nfinished. Year after year, we continue to ask the same question--isn't \nthere a better way?\n  My flat tax legislation would make filing a tax return a manageable \nchore, not a seemingly endless nightmare, for most taxpayers. My flat \ntax legislation will fundamentally revise the present tax code, with \nits myriad rates, deductions, and instructions. This legislation would \ninstitute a simple, flat 20 percent tax rate for all individuals and \nbusinesses. This proposal is not cast in stone, but is intended to move \nthe debate forward by focusing attention on three key principles which \nare critical to an effective and equitable taxation system: simplicity, \nfairness, and economic growth.\n  My flat tax plan would eliminate the kinds of frustrations I have \noutlined above for millions of taxpayers. This flat tax would enable us \nto scrap the great majority of the IRS rules, regulations and \ninstructions and delete most of the 7.1 million words in the Internal \nRevenue Code. Instead of billions of hours of non-productive time spent \nin compliance with, or avoidance of, the tax code, taxpayers would \nspend only the small amount of time necessary to fill out a postcard-\nsized form. Both business and individual taxpayers would thus find \nvaluable hours freed up to engage in productive business activity or \nfor more time with their families, instead of pouring over tax tables, \nschedules, and regulations.\n  My flat tax proposal is dramatic, but so are its advantages: a \ntaxation system that is simple, fair, and designed to maximize \nprosperity for all Americans. A summary of the key advantages are:\n  A 10-line postcard filing would replace the myriad forms and \nattachments currently required, thus saving Americans up to 7.6 billion \nhours they currently spend every year in tax compliance.\n  The flat tax would eliminate the lion's share of IRS rules, \nregulations and requirements, which have grown from 744,000 words in \n1955 to 7.1 million words currently. It would also allow us to slash \nthe mammoth IRS bureaucracy of approximately 87,000 employees, creating \nopportunities to put their expertise to use elsewhere in the government \nor in private industry.\n  Economists estimate a growth due to a flat tax of over $2 trillion in \nnational wealth over 7 years, representing an increase of approximately \n$7,500 in personal wealth for every man, woman and child in America. \nThis growth would also lead to the creation of 6 million new jobs.\n  Investment decisions would be made on the basis of productivity \nrather than simply for tax avoidance, thus leading to even greater \neconomic expansion.\n  Economic forecasts indicate that interest rates would fall \nsubstantially, by as much as two points, as the flat tax removes many \nof the current disincentives to savings.\n  Americans would be able to save or invest the $265 billion they \ncurrently spend every year in tax compliance.\n  As tax loopholes are eliminated and the tax code is simplified, there \nwill be far less opportunity for tax avoidance and fraud. Currently, \nthe IRS is estimating a tax gap of $300 billion a year.\n  Simplification of the tax code will allow us to save significantly on \nthe $10 billion annual budget currently allocated to the Internal \nRevenue Service.\n  The most dramatic way to illustrate the flat tax is to consider that \nthe income tax form for the flat tax is printed on a postcard--it will \nallow all taxpayers to file their April 15 tax returns on a simple 10-\nline postcard. This postcard will take 15 minutes to fill out..\n  This is a win-win situation for America because it lowers the tax \nburden on the taxpayers in the lower brackets. For example in the 2006 \ntax year, the standard deduction is $5,150 for a single taxpayer, \n$7,550 for a head of household and $10,300 for a married couple filing \njointly, while the personal exemption for individuals and dependents is \n$3,300. Thus, under the current tax code, a family of four which does \nnot itemize deductions would pay taxes on all income over $23,500--that \nis personal exemptions of $13,200 and a standard deduction of $10,300. \nBy contrast, under my flat tax bill, that same family would receive a \npersonal exemption of $30,000, and would pay tax on income over that \namount.\n  The tax loopholes enable write-offs of some $393 billion a year. What \nis eliminated under the flat tax are the loopholes, the deductions in \nthis complicated code which can be deciphered, interpreted, and found \nreally only by the $500-an-hour lawyers. That money is lost to the \ntaxpayers. $120 billion would be saved by the elimination of fraud \nbecause of the simplicity of the Tax Code, the taxpayer being able to \nfind out exactly what they owe.\n  This bill is modeled after a proposal organized and written by two \nvery distinguished law professors from Stanford University, Professor \nHall and Professor Rabushka. Their model was first introduced in the \nCongress in the fall of 1994 by Majority Leader Richard Armey. I \nintroduced the flat tax bill--the first one in the Senate--on March 2, \n1995, Senate bill 488. On October 27, 1995, I introduced a Sense of the \nSenate Resolution calling on my colleagues to expedite Congressional \nadoption of a flat tax. The Resolution, which was introduced as an \namendment to pending legislation, was not adopted. I reintroduced my \nlegislation in the 105th Congress with slight modifications to reflect \ninflation-adjusted increases in the personal allowances and dependent \nallowances. I re-reintroduced the bill on April 15, 1999, Tax Day, in a \nbill denominated as S. 822. I then introduced my flat tax legislation \nas an amendment to S. 1429, the Tax Reconciliation bill; the amendment \nwas not adopted. During the 108th Congress, I introduced my flat tax \nlegislation once again on April 11, 2003. On May 14, 2003, I offered an \namendment to the Tax Reconciliation legislation urging the Senate to \nhold hearings and consider legislation providing for a flat tax; this \namendment passed by a vote of 70 to 30 on May 15, 2003. I then \ntestified on this issue at a subsequent hearing held by the Joint \nEconomic Committee on November 5, 2003. On April 15, 2005 and again on \nApril 10, 2007, I again reintroduced my flat tax legislation in a bill \ndenominated as S. 812 and S. 1081 respectively.\n\n  Over the years and prior to my legislative efforts on behalf of flat \ntax reform, I have devoted considerable time and attention to analyzing \nour nation's tax code and the policies which underlie it. I began the \nstudy of the complexities of the tax code over 40 years ago as a law \nstudent at Yale University. I included some tax law as part of my \npractice in my early years as an attorney in Philadelphia. In the \nspring of 1962, I published a law review article in the Villanova Law \nReview, ``Pension and Profit Sharing Plans: Coverage and Operation for \nClosely Held Corporations and Professional Associations,'' 7 Villanova \nL. Rev. 335, which in part focused on the inequity in making tax-exempt \nretirement benefits available to some kinds of businesses but not \nothers. It was apparent then, as it is now, that the very complexities \nof the Internal Revenue Code could be used to give unfair advantage to \nsome. Einstein himself is quoted as saying ``the hardest thing in the \nworld to understand is the income tax.''\n  The Hall-Rabushka model envisioned a flat tax with no deductions \nwhatsoever. After considerable reflection, I decided to include in the \nlegislation limited deductions for home mortgage interest for up to \n$100,000 in borrowing and charitable contributions up to $2,500. While \nthese modifications undercut the pure principle of the flat tax by \ncontinuing the use of tax policy to promote home buying and charitable \ncontributions, I believe that those two deductions are so deeply \ningrained in the financial planning of American families that they \nshould be retained as a matter of fairness and public policy--and also \npolitical practicality. With those two deductions maintained, passage \nof a modified flat tax will be difficult, but without them, probably \nimpossible.\n  In my judgment, an indispensable prerequisite to enactment of a \nmodified flat tax is revenue neutrality. Professor Hall advised that \nthe revenue neutrality of the Hall-Rabushka proposal, which uses a 19 \npercent rate, is\n\n[[Page S3996]]\n\nbased on a well-documented model founded on reliable governmental \nstatistics. My legislation raises that rate from 19 percent to 20 \npercent to accommodate retaining limited home mortgage interest and \ncharitable deductions.\n  This proposal taxes business revenues fully at their source, so that \nthere is no personal taxation on interest, dividends, capital gains, \ngifts or estates. Restructured in this way, the tax code can become a \npowerful incentive for savings and investment--which translates into \neconomic growth and expansion, more and better jobs, and raising the \nstandard of living for all Americans.\n  The key advantages of this flat tax plan are threefold: First, it \nwill dramatically simplify the payment of taxes. Second, it will remove \nmuch of the IRS regulatory morass now imposed on individual and \ncorporate taxpayers, and allow those taxpayers to devote more of their \nenergies to productive pursuits. Third, since it is a plan which \nrewards savings and investment, the flat tax will spur economic growth \nin all sectors of the economy as more money flows into investments and \nsavings accounts.\n  Professors Hall and Rabushka have projected that within seven years \nof enactment, this type of a flat tax would produce a 6 percent \nincrease in output from increased total work in the U.S. economy and \nincreased capital formation. The economic growth would mean a $7,500 \nincrease in the personal income of all Americans. No one likes to pay \ntaxes. But Americans will be much more willing to pay their taxes under \na system that they believe is fair, a system that they can understand, \nand a system that they recognize promotes rather than prevents growth \nand prosperity. My flat tax legislation will afford Americans such a \ntax system.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of my flat tax \npostcard, a variety of specific cases that illustrate the fairness and \nsimplicity of this flat tax, and an example flat tax table be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       2008 Individual Tax Return\n\n                         ARLEN SPECTER FLAT TAX\n                    Form 1--Individual Wage Tax--2008\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n------------------------------------------------------------------------\nYour full name with initial (if       Your social security number\n joint return, also give spouse's\n name and initial)\n \nHome address (number and street       Spouse's social security number\n including apartment number or rural\n route)\n \nCity, town, or post office, state,\n and ZIP code\n \n1.

Mexico:\n  S. 743. A bill to require air carriers to provide training for flight \nattendants and gate attendants regarding serving alcohol, recognizing \nintoxicated passengers, and dealing with disruptive passengers, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the \nAirline Personnel Training Enhancement Act of 2009 and to ask for \nSenators' support for this important measure to improve safety in the \nair and on the ground.\n  The story of this legislation begins with a tragedy. On November 11, \n2006, Paul and Renee Gonzales were driving back from a soccer \ntournament with four of their daughters. They were roughly 1 hour from \ntheir home in Las Vegas, NM, when they saw Dana Papst's vehicle. Papst \nhad been driving on the wrong side of I-25 for about 5 miles before his \ncar collided with the Gonzales's minivan at 60 to 75 miles per hour. \nFive of the six members of the Gonzales family were killed. Papst later \ndied at the hospital.\n  I cannot say for certain whether this tragedy could have been \nprevented by a change in laws. But I do know this: A few hours before \nDana Papst took six lives, including his own, he was flying back to \nAlbuquerque after a business trip. On that flight, he was noticeably \nintoxicated. Yet he was served alcohol by airline personnel. When his \ntruck collided with the Gonzales's minivan, his blood-alcohol level was \nfour times the legal limit.\n  When I heard about Dana Papst and the Gonzales family, I began to \nlook for legislation that could prevent tragedies like this in the \nfuture. I learned that under existing law, Papst should not have been \nserved alcohol on his flight. In fact, somebody as drunk as Papst never \nshould have been allowed on that flight. But airlines are not required \nto teach their personnel how to handle an intoxicated passenger.\n  To address this problem, I introduced the Airline Personnel Training \nEnhancement Act in the other body during the last Congress. I am \nintroducing it again today.\n  This legislation requires air carriers to train their employees on \nrecognizing and dealing with drunk or disruptive passengers. This \ntraining will help employees make informed decisions when allowing \npeople to board flights, when deciding whether a passenger should be \nserved alcohol, and when dealing with belligerent passengers. Many \nStates require people who serve alcohol in restaurants and bars to be \nproperly trained. This legislation simply closes a large and \npotentially deadly loophole. I hope it will lead to fewer deaths on our \nroads.\n  New Mexico, like so many other States, has too many crosses on its \nhighways, too many stories of loss and regret. Drunk driving claimed \n155 New Mexico lives the year Paul and Renee Gonzales were killed. It \nclaimed 188 the year before, and 211 the year before that. We have the \npower to help reduce these numbers. I hope we will use it.\n  But my legislation is not just about drunk driving. As I began to \nstudy the training of airline personnel, I discovered a large and \nfrightening threat to the traveling public. Outbursts by belligerent \npassengers are more and more common. But airline personnel are rarely \ntrained on how to handle these situations.\n  Incidents of ``air rage'' increased 400 percent since 2000. There are \nan estimated 10,000 cases each year in the United States alone. Airline \nsecurity experts estimate that alcohol is the underlying cause of the \nmajority of incidents. These incidents can pose a serious threat to \npassengers and personnel. In some cases, flights have been diverted \nfrom their destination in order to land where threatening passengers \ncould be arrested.\n  Airline personnel are on the front line for ensuring flight safety. \nGate attendants are in the best position to keep drunk or belligerent \npassengers off flights. Today, flight attendants are often the only \npersonnel capable of maintaining order in a plane's cabin.\n  Before 9/11, a flight's captain or co-pilot would leave the cockpit \nto assist the flight crew when a passenger made threats or became \nabusive. Today, the cockpit door is locked for safety. Flight \nattendants have more responsibility for keeping passengers safe.\n  Unfortunately, airlines do not have to give their employees the \nskills to meet their responsibilities. One study found that ``the lack \nof attention paid by the aviation community to the importance of the \nflight attendant's role in a commercial flight has led to recurring \ninstances of abuse of cabin crew by passengers and the inability of the \ncabin crew to restrain violent passenger[s]. . . .''\n  The Airline Personnel Training Enhancement Act will help remedy this \nunsafe and unacceptable situation. This legislation is supported by the \nAssociation of Flight Attendants and Mothers Against Drunk Driving. It \nis also a commonsense response to a serious problem. It will make our \nskies and our roads safer. I hope Senators will support it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/30/senate-section/article/S3997-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3997-S4005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS DURING ADJOURNMENT OF THE SENATE\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 13--SETTING FORTH THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET \n  FOR THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010, REVISING THE \n APPROPRIATE BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009, AND SETTING FORTH \n  THE APPROPRIATE BUDGETARY LEVELS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011 THROUGH 2014\n\n  Mr. CONRAD from the Committee on the Budget; submitted the following \nconcurrent resolution, which was placed on the calendar:\n\n                            S.

Any such motion shall be debatable. In any case \n     in which such point of order is sustained against a \n     conference report (or Senate amendment derived from such \n     conference report by operation of this subsection), no \n     further amendment shall be in order.\n\n                      Subtitle B--Other Provisions\n\n     SEC. 311.

Res. 89\n\n       Whereas the Vietnam War was fought in Vietnam from 1961 to \n     1975, and involved North Vietnam and the Viet Cong in \n     conflict with United States Armed Forces and South Vietnam;\n       Whereas the United States became involved in Vietnam \n     because policy-makers in the United States believed that if \n     the Government of South Vietnam fell to a communist \n     government then communism would spread throughout the rest of \n     Southeast Asia;\n       Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces began \n     serving in an advisory role to the Government of South \n     Vietnam in 1961;\n       Whereas, as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents on \n     August 2 and 4, 1964, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Gulf \n     of Tonkin Resolution (Public Law 88-408), on August 7, 1964, \n     which effectively handed over war-making powers to President \n     Johnson until such time as ``peace and security'' had \n     returned to Vietnam;\n       Whereas, in 1965, United States Armed Forces ground combat \n     units arrived in Vietnam;\n       Whereas, by the end of 1965, there were 80,000 United \n     States troops in Vietnam, and by 1969 a peak of approximately \n     543,000 troops was reached;\n       Whereas, on January 27, 1973, the Treaty of Paris was \n     signed, which required the release of all United States \n     prisoners-of-war held in North Vietnam and the withdrawal of \n     all United States Armed Forces from South Vietnam;\n       Whereas, on March 30, 1973, the United States Armed Forces \n     completed the withdrawal of combat troops from Vietnam;\n       Whereas more than 58,000 members of the United States Armed \n     Forces lost their lives in Vietnam and more than 300,000 \n     members of the Armed Forces were wounded;\n       Whereas, in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was \n     dedicated in the District of Columbia to commemorate those \n     members of the United States Armed Forces who died or were \n     declared missing-in-action in Vietnam;\n       Whereas the Vietnam War was an extremely divisive issue \n     among the people of the United States;\n       Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces who \n     served bravely and faithfully for the United States during \n     the Vietnam War were caught upon their return home in the \n     crossfire of public debate about the involvement of the \n     United States in the Vietnam War;\n       Whereas the establishment of a ``Welcome Home Vietnam \n     Veterans Day'' would be an appropriate way to honor those \n     members of the United States Armed Forces who served in \n     Vietnam during the Vietnam War; and\n       Whereas March 30, 2009, would be an appropriate day to \n     establish as ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors and recognizes the contributions of veterans who \n     served in the United States Armed Forces in Vietnam; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day'' with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities that promote awareness of the \n     contributions of veterans who served in the United States \n     Armed Forces in Vietnam and the importance of helping such \n     veterans readjust to civilian life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/30/senate-section/article/S4005-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4005]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 90--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF THE SENATE REGARDING THE \n   FIFTH SUMMIT OF THE AMERICAS, HELD IN PORT OF SPAIN, TRINIDAD AND \n                   TOBAGO, APRIL 17, 18, AND 19, 2009\n\n  Mr. KERRY (for himself, Mr. Lugar, Mr. Dodd, Mr. Menendez, and Mr. \nNelson of Florida) submitted the following resolution; which was \nreferred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                               S. Res. 90\n\n       Whereas the First Summit of the Americas, held in December \n     1994 in Miami, Florida, resulted in a comprehensive Plan of \n     Action, issued by the region's democracies, which included \n     initiatives on strengthening democracy, promoting human \n     rights, combating corruption, furthering sustainable economic \n     development, encouraging environmental conservation, and \n     committing to access to universal basic education and health \n     care throughout the Americas;\n       Whereas 3 Summits of the Americas and 2 Special Summits of \n     the Americas have been convened since 1994, resulting in \n     additional initiatives on sustainable development, \n     strengthening democratic practices and good governance, the \n     environment, economic relations, combating HIV/AIDS and other \n     diseases, and numerous other areas of mutual interest and \n     shared responsibility throughout the Western Hemisphere;\n       Whereas on July 21, 2008, the Draft Declaration of \n     Commitment by the Summit Implementation Review Group proposed \n     an agenda for the Fifth Summit of the Americas to discuss \n     promoting human prosperity, energy security, environmental \n     sustainability, public security, democratic governance, and \n     the Summit's implementation and review process; and\n       Whereas on February 10, 2009, President Barack Obama stated \n     that he would attend the Fifth Summit of the Americas to \n     ``create the kind of partnership based on respect that the \n     people of Latin America are looking for and that will be \n     beneficial to the United States'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate--\n       (1) to express support for the Fifth Summit of the Americas \n     as an effective multilateral forum, convened in the spirit of \n     cooperation and partnership for the 34 democratically elected \n     heads of state of the region to address shared challenges and \n     foster collaboration throughout the Western Hemisphere;\n       (2) that the Fifth Summit provides the United States with \n     an early opportunity to reinvigorate and strengthen its \n     engagement with the countries of the Western Hemisphere, \n     especially in--\n       (A) finding common solutions to the global economic crisis;\n       (B) promoting energy security;

Con. Res. 14\n\n       Whereas the United States enjoys broadcasting and sound \n     recording industries that are the envy of the world, due to \n     the symbiotic relationship that has existed among these \n     industries for many decades;\n       Whereas, for more than 80 years, Congress has rejected \n     repeated calls by the recording industry to impose a \n     performance fee on local radio stations for simply playing \n     music on the radio and upsetting the mutually beneficial \n     relationship between local radio and the recording industry;\n       Whereas local radio stations provide free publicity and \n     promotion to the recording industry and performers of music \n     in the form of radio air play, interviews with performers, \n     introduction of new performers, concert promotions, and \n     publicity that promotes the sale of music, concert tickets, \n     ring tones, music videos, and associated merchandise;\n       Whereas Congress found that ``the sale of many sound \n     recordings and the careers of many performers benefited \n     considerably from airplay and other promotional activities \n     provided by both noncommercial and advertiser-supported, free \n     over-the-air broadcasting'';\n       Whereas local radio broadcasters provide tens of thousands \n     of hours of essential local news and weather information \n     during times of national emergencies and natural disasters, \n     such as September 11th and Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, as \n     well as public affairs programming, sports, and hundreds of \n     millions of dollars of time for public service announcements \n     and local fund raising efforts for worthy charitable causes, \n     all of which are jeopardized if local radio stations are \n     forced to divert revenues to pay for a new performance fee;\n       Whereas there are many thousands of local radio stations \n     that will suffer severe economic hardship if any new \n     performance fee is imposed, as will many other small \n     businesses that play music including bars, restaurants, \n     retail establishments, sports and other entertainment venues, \n     shopping centers, and transportation facilities; and\n       Whereas the hardship that would result from a new \n     performance fee would hurt American businesses, and \n     ultimately the American consumers who rely on local radio for \n     news, weather, and entertainment, and such a performance fee \n     is not justified when the current system has produced the \n     most prolific and innovative broadcasting, music, and sound \n     recording industries in the world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That Congress should not impose any new \n     performance fee, tax, royalty, or other charge relating to \n     the public performance of sound recordings on a local radio \n     station for broadcasting sound recordings over the air, or on \n     any business for such public performance of sound recordings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/30/senate-section/article/S4006-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 730.

Res. 89\n\n       Whereas the Vietnam War was fought in Vietnam from 1961 to \n     1975, and involved North Vietnam and the Viet Cong in \n     conflict with United States Armed Forces and South Vietnam;\n       Whereas the United States became involved in Vietnam \n     because policy-makers in the United States believed that if \n     the Government of South Vietnam fell to a communist \n     government then communism would spread throughout the rest of \n     Southeast Asia;\n       Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces began \n     serving in an advisory role to the Government of South \n     Vietnam in 1961;\n       Whereas, as a result of the Gulf of Tonkin incidents on \n     August 2 and 4, 1964, Congress overwhelmingly passed the Gulf \n     of Tonkin Resolution (Public Law 88-408), on August 7, 1964, \n     which effectively handed over war-making powers to President \n     Johnson until such time as ``peace and security'' had \n     returned to Vietnam;\n       Whereas, in 1965, United States Armed Forces ground combat \n     units arrived in Vietnam;\n       Whereas, by the end of 1965, there were 80,000 United \n     States troops in Vietnam, and by 1969 a peak of approximately \n     543,000 troops was reached;\n       Whereas, on January 27, 1973, the Treaty of Paris was \n     signed, which required the release of all United States \n     prisoners-of-war held in North Vietnam and the withdrawal of \n     all United States Armed Forces from South Vietnam;\n       Whereas, on March 30, 1973, the United States Armed Forces \n     completed the withdrawal of combat troops from Vietnam;\n       Whereas more than 58,000 members of the United States Armed \n     Forces lost their lives in Vietnam and more than 300,000 \n     members of the Armed Forces were wounded;\n       Whereas, in 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was \n     dedicated in the District of Columbia to commemorate those \n     members of the United States Armed Forces who died or were \n     declared missing-in-action in Vietnam;\n       Whereas the Vietnam War was an extremely divisive issue \n     among the people of the United States;\n       Whereas members of the United States Armed Forces who \n     served bravely and faithfully for the United States during \n     the Vietnam War were caught upon their return home in the \n     crossfire of public debate about the involvement of the \n     United States in the Vietnam War;\n       Whereas the establishment of a ``Welcome Home Vietnam \n     Veterans Day'' would be an appropriate way to honor those \n     members of the United States Armed Forces who served in \n     Vietnam during the Vietnam War; and\n       Whereas March 30, 2009, would be an appropriate day to \n     establish as ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day'': Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors and recognizes the contributions of veterans who \n     served in the United States Armed Forces in Vietnam; and\n       (2) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     ``Welcome Home Vietnam Veterans Day'' with appropriate \n     ceremonies and activities that promote awareness of the \n     contributions of veterans who served in the United States \n     Armed Forces in Vietnam and the importance of helping such \n     veterans readjust to civilian life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "30"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/30/senate-section/article/S4008-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4008]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   ORDERS FOR TUESDAY, MARCH 31, 2009\n\n  Mr. CONRAD.
