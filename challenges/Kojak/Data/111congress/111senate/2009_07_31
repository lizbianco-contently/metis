Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senator from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, as we wait for Members to come forward with \namendments, I wish to talk about something that is happening down at \nthe USDA right now. This morning, Secretary Vilsack is announcing \nchanges to the Dairy Product Price Support Program. I wish to commend \nhim for his diligence and his willingness to keep pushing on this.\n  Wisconsin is home to more dairy farms than any other State in the \nUnion. We produce 2.1 billion pounds of milk each month. About half the \nState's $51 billion agriculture economy is directly tied to dairy. So \nwhen the dairy sector hurts, Wisconsin hurts. And I will say in no \nuncertain terms that the pain in dairy across America is very acute \nright now.\n  From January through April, the price of milk paid to dairy farmers \nhas been about $4.80 per hundredweight below the cost of production. \nDairy producers have lost $3.9 billion in equity in 5 months. At risk \nis the long-term stability of the industry, the Nation's milk \nproduction infrastructure, and thousands of rural communities.\n  With Senator Leahy and a number of our colleagues, we have pushed to \nconfront these challenges. In the last farm bill, we extended the basic \nsafety net for dairy producers, and we strengthened it with something \ncalled a ``feed cost adjuster.'' In the economic recovery bill we added \ncredit to help producers survive.\n  At the same time, the Secretary has worked to boost exports and \nprovide more dairy products for nutrition programs. All of these are \ncritical steps. Together they reflect, literally, a billion-dollar \neffort to address a crisis that has hurt dairy producers in every \ncorner of the country.\n  But over the past several weeks, in hearings and letters--and \npersonal consultations I have been a part of--there is a growing \nappreciation that more needs to be done. Today the Secretary is taking \nthe next step. For August through October, he is adjusting the Dairy \nProduct Price Support Program in a way that will yield an estimated \n$243 million in revenue increases for dairy producers.\n  I commend our Secretary of Agriculture for working with intensity and \npersistence. I commend our President for appointing a Secretary of \nAgriculture who works with intensity and persistence. And I want to \nreassure dairy farmers all across America that, although we do not have \nall the answers, we are committed to pressing forward on their behalf.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Kansas.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I urge my colleagues, particularly on \nmy side of the aisle, to get their amendments and bring them forward, \nbring them forward this morning. It would be my hope we could get this \nbill done on Monday, early evening, so we can move to the Sotomayor \ndiscussion and debate on the floor. I think most Members want to speak \nabout Sotomayor, so it is going to take a lot of time next week, being \nthe last week before we go on break. I hope we could start that as fast \nas possible and we could move through this bill expeditiously.\n  We worked very closely with the majority. I think we have a good \nbill. It certainly is not perfect; no bill is. But it is one for which \nwe have done a lot of work, and I do not see the issues outstanding \nhere to the degree that I think it would merit us putting off the \ndiscussion and debate on Sotomayor. So I am hopeful we can get those \namendments coming forward.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2229 To Amendment No. 1908\n\n  Mr. President, I have discussed with the majority about bringing up \nan amendment to deal with the issue of neglected and rare diseases. The \nFDA funding is in this bill, and we have negotiated an amendment with \nthe proper authorizing committee. So with that, I ask unanimous consent \nto set aside the pending amendment, to call up amendment No. 2229, and \nask for its immediate consideration.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, the clerk will \nreport.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Kansas [Mr. Brownback] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2229 to amendment No. 1908.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To establish within the Food and Drug Administration 2 review \n   groups to recommend solutions for the prevention, diagnosis, and \n  treatment of rare diseases and neglected diseases of the developing \n                                 world)\n\n       On page 85, between lines 16 and 17, insert the following:\n       Sec. 7__. (a) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall \n     establish within the Food and Drug Administration a review \n     group which shall recommend to the Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs appropriate preclinical, trial design, and regulatory \n     paradigms and optimal solutions for the prevention, \n     diagnosis, and treatment of rare diseases: Provided, That the \n     Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall appoint 8 individuals \n     employed by the Food and Drug Administration to serve on the \n     review group: Provided further, That members of the review \n     group shall have specific expertise relating to the \n     development of articles for use in the prevention, diagnosis, \n     or treatment of rare diseases, including specific expertise \n     in developing or carrying out clinical trials.\n       (b) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall establish \n     within the Food and Drug Administration a review group which \n     shall recommend to the Commissioner of Food and Drugs \n     appropriate preclinical, trial design, and regulatory \n     paradigms and optimal solutions for the prevention, \n     diagnosis, and treatment of neglected diseases of the \n     developing world: Provided, That the Commissioner of Food and \n     Drugs shall appoint 8 individuals employed by the Food and \n     Drug Administration to serve on the review group: Provided \n     further, That members of the review group shall have specific \n     expertise relating to the development of articles for use in \n     the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment of neglected diseases \n     of the developing world, including specific expertise in \n     developing or carrying out clinical trials: Provided further, \n     That for the purposes of this section the term ``neglected \n     disease of the developing world'' means a tropical disease, \n     as defined in section 524(a)(3) of the Federal Food, Drug, \n     and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 360n(a)(3)).\n       (c) The Commissioner of Food and Drugs shall--\n       (1) submit, not later than 1 year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, a report to Congress that describes \n     both the findings and recommendations made by the review \n     groups under subsections (a) and (b);\n       (2) issue, not later than 180 days after submission of the \n     report to Congress under paragraph (1), guidance based on \n     such recommendations for articles for use in the prevention, \n     diagnosis, and treatment of rare diseases and for such uses \n     in neglected diseases of the developing world; and\n       (3) develop, not later than 180 days after submission of \n     the report to Congress under paragraph (1), internal review \n     standards based on such recommendations for articles for use \n     in the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of rare diseases \n     and for such uses in neglected diseases of the developing \n     world.\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President and colleagues, this amendment goes at a \ncritical problem in the world and one\n\n[[Page S8621]]\n\nwe hold the key to answering. There is a lot of work that needs to be \ndone on disease treatment and drug development. Unfortunately, what we \nhave seen taking place is that the cost of developing a pharmaceutical \nproduct to treat particular diseases continues to go up and up and up \ninto, in some cases, billions of dollars to develop a particular drug \nfor a treatment for individuals.\n  When you are looking at disease categories, now that we are getting \ninto finer and finer groups, you may have a group of, say, 50,000 \npeople who have a particular disease, or for a neglected disease that \nis in a Third World country, you can have millions, even more than \nthat, who are affected by a disease, but there is not a large \nmarketplace to support the research that is necessary to develop a \ncure.\n  What we have put forward in this amendment is a review process to try \nto establish a new system for neglected and rare diseases so that drug \ndelivery can proceed, and it can proceed on an expedited basis and \nreduce the cost of doing it, so we can start to develop drug treatments \nfor rare diseases and neglected diseases that happen in poorer parts of \nthe world where the economy does not support that level of research.\n  The amendment establishes two review groups within the Food and Drug \nAdministration that would recommend solutions for the prevention, \ndiagnosis, and treatment of both rare diseases and neglected diseases \nof the developing world.\n  According to the World Health Organization, more than 1 billion \npeople--nearly one of every six people worldwide--are affected by at \nleast one neglected disease. We have a billion people who are in this \ncategory of having a disease for which there is little to no research \nbeing done.\n  Examples of well-known neglected diseases include malaria, \ntuberculosis, and cholera. Africa certainly bears the brunt of this, as \nnearly 90 percent of the world's neglected diseases afflict people in \nthis continent.\n  While this is the target category, it is my hope that what this will \nlead to is us developing systems and ways where we can reduce the cost \nand the time for drug delivery and development so we can use that in \nthis country. We can use that on rare diseases where you do not have \nthe population pool to support as much of the research.\n  Neglected diseases claim roughly 500,000 lives each year. They \ndisproportionately affect very low-income populations in developing \ncountries. Unfortunately, less than 1 percent of the roughly 1,400 \ndrugs registered between 1975 and 1999 treated such diseases--1 percent \nof them.\n  Streamlining the FDA review process to treat these diseases is not \nonly in our country's national interest, but it is consistent with our \nlongstanding tradition of caring for those who are less fortunate \naround the world.\n  I might point out that as to the public opinion standing of the \nUnited States, the continent where we have the highest public opinion \nstanding of the population is not even North America, it is Africa, \nwhere we are helping people with the PEPFAR program, with malaria, with \nfood, and people like you if you are helping them stay alive. This \ncontinues in that, so it is good foreign policy as well and also helps \nus in drug delivery and development for our rare diseases.\n  This amendment also addresses rare diseases or those diseases for \nwhich little market exists since so few patients are affected. If this \nhappens to be a person in your family, you do not care how many people \nare affected, you are affected, and you want somebody to be developing \ncures for it. Rare diseases can be especially lethal since few \ntreatments may exist for individual patients and time is not on their \nside.\n\n  For these reasons, I strongly urge my colleagues to support this \namendment No. 2229, which would allow experts to identify ways we can \nimprove the Food and Drug Administration's ability to review treatments \nfor rare and neglected diseases.\n  We worked carefully on this proposal with a number of individuals, \nincluding Dr. Francis Collins, who is nominated to be the head of NIH \nand who had the Human Genome Project, one of the great scientific \nbreakthroughs of the last 25 years; as well as with former FDA \nofficials and a number of people interested and concerned about what is \ntaking place here; about the expanded cost of developing drugs and the \nsmaller economic category that they have to hit in. I think this is in \nthe best traditions of the United States and is very helpful to us as a \ncountry to address.\n  I and my colleagues have traveled to some of the Third World areas. \nWe know malaria hits 60 percent of the children in Sub-Saharan Africa--\n60 percent. Tuberculosis as well is rampant. We have other diseases \nthat we haven't thought of here for a long time--sleeping sickness, \nriver blindness--that affect a large cross-section of individuals with \nlittle to no effort going into it. To the degree we can help will be a \nmassive good that we do. It is my fundamental belief that we are \nblessed to be a blessing, and this country has been blessed. We \ncertainly have our difficulties; no question about that, but here is an \narea where we can help and it helps us too.\n  I hope my colleagues will see fit to support this amendment. I will \nask at the proper time that it be supported and that we vote on it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, as we said before this morning, we intend to \ncomplete action on this bill Monday. We are here today to work with \nSenators if they have amendments. We need to move this bill along so we \ncan complete all our work as we know we wish to do before the August \nrecess. So if any Senators have amendments to the bill, they should \ncome to the floor so they can be offered, debated, and considered.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, while we are waiting on Members to come \nand present their amendments, I want to talk about something associated \nwith agriculture in my State. It is an issue that will probably come up \nafter the August break, and that is energy legislation. Energy, in our \nState, is inextricably linked to agriculture, where it is a big energy-\nusing industry but also one that derives a lot of income for \nagriculture.\n  The industry itself moved from a food and fiber industry to a food, \nfiber, and fuels industry, with ethanol and biodiesel and \nincreasingly--this is a bit of a sidebar but a connection--wind energy. \nWind energy, in many of the rural areas of our State, is providing \nincome to those regions.\n  I want to talk about the energy policy of this country, particularly \nas it is associated with agriculture. We need to look at the \nagricultural industry and what it can produce for a domestic fuel need. \nI am hopeful we can, over time, up the ethanol standard from 10 percent \nto a higher mixed blend. I would like to see us get to 15, 20 percent \nin the current vehicle fleet. I think this is doable and the technology \nis there and it is not harmful to anybody or any of the automobiles in \nthe automobile industry.\n  A number of us signed a letter asking that fuel blend be upped and \nalso that the refineries be held harmless in any up mixture of blending \nthat might be considered. A number of refineries are sensitive about \nthe MTBE problem, when they were pushed by Congress to put in MTBE, and \nlater were held responsible for difficulties associated with that. I \nthink we ought to hold the refinery industry harmless but allow the \nmixture to go up from 10 percent.\n  In my State, a number of ethanol plants have been built. They are \ncost effective and they continue to operate well. It is a dual-\ncommodity business, where we are looking at the commodity price of oil \nand the commodity price of corn. We can do very well financially, but \nif they move against us, we can do poorly. We have the capacity to move \nthe blend up to the 15 or 20 percent level.\n  It is my hope that down the road that will be something of \nconsideration. That has been a big piece of the agricultural policy in \nthis country--something that has been supported in the Agriculture \nappropriations bill, to increase research on ethanol and make\n\n[[Page S8622]]\n\nthe next generation out of cellulose or make everything a cellulosic \nstream, along with a grain stream of ethanol in the same ethanol plant, \nso we can mix those methods of making ethanol. That is an important \nendeavor that we can do.\n  On the Energy bill, there is a renewable energy standard put in it \nand not the cap-and-trade bill. I urge my colleagues, let's work on \nrenewable energy where we can get good, strong bipartisan support and \nnot a cap-and-trade system where it is going to hurt a number of States \nthat are high energy using and producing States--particularly like my \nown State or others in the Midwest that are very dependent upon energy. \nThis is a major tax on us. It taxes our electrical production that is \ncoal based. Our State is in the 60 to 70 percent electric production. \nIf we are taxing that, we are taxing people's utility bills. If we go \nwith a renewable energy standard, we can seed and develop the growth of \nthe wind energy business throughout a lot of the country, or biomass, \nwhich is helpful to agriculture, and not raise utility rates and not do \nit by taxing and regulating but, rather, by innovation and investment.\n  Earlier this week, I met with a number of people from the wind energy \nbusiness, and they were saying we have had a good run, but it is not \ngoing very well now with this economy and without a renewable energy \nstandard. The one we put forward in the Energy Committee has a 15-\npercent renewable energy standard; 4 percent of that can be met by \nconservation and 11 percent by renewable production, biomass, wind, and \neven things such as algae biofuel production, which is very much in the \nexperimental stage, but it is a developing technology.\n  If we can consider that and do the renewable energy standard \nportfolio, separate and distinct, and not blend it with cap and trade, \nI think we can come forward with a good, bipartisan bill that moves us \nforward off of our energy reliance on foreign fuels and into a cleaner \nenvironment. The tax and regulatory structure of a cap-and-trade system \nwould be very harmful on a State such as mine.\n  Senator Bingaman chairs the Energy Committee. He did a markup over a \nperiod of 4 weeks that was one of the most impressive markups I have \nseen, where he worked with everybody to get this bill together on a \nrenewable energy standard. We came out with a bipartisan energy bill on \na renewable energy standard. Not everybody got what they wanted; nobody \never does, but it was bipartisan, and it wasn't a cap-and-trade bill, \nwhich really sends the bells off for a lot of high energy using States. \nThat is doable, and it is what we ought to do rather than what the \nHouse did on cap-and-trade legislation, which passed by the thinnest of \nmargins.\n  It was basically done completely on Democratic votes, without \nRepublican votes; whereas, the renewable energy standard we passed had \na mixture of Republican and Democratic votes and even some Democrats \nvoted against the bill in committee. It is a bipartisan process and one \nthat we can move forward with--not to mention other things.\n  I just met with a refinery group doing petroleum products--pavement \nand other things--in the United States. They look to get hit with cap-\nand-trade legislation--to the point they will be driven out of \nbusiness. But we are still going to need asphalt in this country.\n  They are saying: Do you know where it is going to come from? It will \ncome from China and India; they will make the asphalt. Big plants are \nbeing planned and built there in anticipation that we will do cap-and-\ntrade legislation and they won't. Their CO2 emissions are \nnot counted and ours will be and they will sell us the product. That \ncompletely defeats the purpose of any type of CO2 \nmitigation--just driving the industry overseas. It is going to be more \npolluting there than here, and the CO2 emissions that go \ninto the atmosphere affect everybody. It is a bad idea for us to cause \nthat to happen in our own legislation.\n  Industries are planning on doing that now, just building and moving \nthe industries to China and importing the products back to the United \nStates. That hurts us. That hurts our people, our job formation, and it \ndoesn't help the environment. We have another way. We have a way, \nthrough this renewable energy standard, that can actually work.\n  I ask, as we consider the Agriculture bill and others, that we keep \nan eye on energy because it is one of the key cost drivers within the \nindustry. It is also one of the key possibilities for us to grow it in \nthe future and grow it for our country. That is why we put some \nprovisions in this Agriculture appropriations bill that are supporting \nthe energy industry in agriculture. But personally--and I know others \nhave different opinions on this--I ask that we don't then hurt it with \nlegislation later on that is not complementary toward it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Dr. Robert Keleher\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, while we have time waiting to clear \nsome amendments, I am also ranking member on the Joint Economic \nCommittee. Today is the last day serving on that committee staff of Dr. \nRobert Keleher. I rise to recognize him briefly.\n  He is retiring after many years of valuable service in the Congress. \nCongressman Jim Saxton, when he was chairman, persuaded Bob to join the \ncommittee staff back in 1996, as chief macroeconomist after an already \ndistinguished career. Bob's insightful mind, high standard, and \nextensive knowledge of economics made him a critical component of the \nstaff for many years.\n  Before joining the committee staff, Bob's career, including serving \nas the senior macroeconomist of President Reagan's Council of Economic \nAdvisers in 1985 and 1986, The head of Macro and International \nEconomics at the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, and as a special \nmonetary and economic adviser to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors \nVice Chairman Manuel Johnson. I think under anybody's standard, that is \na very successful career as an economist.\n\n  Bob's contribution to the committee was broad based and valuable. In \nparticular, his early and prolific work on the issue of inflation \ntargeting represents almost the entire body of congressional analysis \nin this area from 1997 to 2006.\n  During his career, Bob also conducted research applying the classical \nprinciples of economics to tax policy. His research emphasized the \nimportant effects that marginal tax rates have on economic behavior, in \nparticular the positive effects that reducing personal marginal rates \nhave on creating incentives for healthy economic growth. We would be \nwise to take Bob's research findings to heart.\n  Yet a person's work career is not the only thing that defines him. \nBob's work was first rate, relevant, and valuable to members of the \ncommittee. But Bob's character as a man, his judgement, and integrity \nonly add to the reasons he will be missed.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleagues on the committee, from both the \nSenate and the House, join me in extending a heartfelt thanks to Bob \nfor his years of service and in congratulating him upon his retirement.\n  Thank you, Bob. We wish you and your family the best. You have earned \nit. Godspeed.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n       Amendments Nos. 2234, 2225, and 2226 To Amendment No. 1908\n\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, I seek to clarify with the chairman an \neffort across two States to address the growing issue of bovine \ntuberculosis.\n  I have asked the subcommittee to provide funds for a joint effort \nbetween the University of Minnesota and Michigan State University in \nsupport of research to prevent the spread of bovine tuberculosis and \nultimately eradicate the disease from cattle, deer, and other wildlife. \nMy colleagues from Michigan and I understand the negative economic \nimpacts bovine tuberculosis impose on our States' agricultural \nindustries. In fact, agriculture is the second largest industry in both \nStates, and this research is key to protecting our economies.\n  However, it is my understanding that this research effort may have \nbeen mistakenly associated with Michigan's ongoing eradication efforts.\n  Mr. KOHL. I thank the Senator from Minnesota for bringing to my \nattention this issue. I understand the importance of the joint research \neffort on bovine tuberculosis taking place at the University of \nMinnesota and Michigan State University.\n  I will work with Senator Klobuchar to ensure that the bovine \ntuberculosis joint university research program is addressed as the \nfiscal year 2010 Agriculture appropriations bill moves through the \nlegislative process.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I congratulate the chairman for \ncrafting a strong fiscal year 2010 Agriculture appropriations bill and \nthank him for his efforts to assist me on this important initiative.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I rise to offer for the Record, the Budget \nCommittee's official scoring of S. 1406, the Agriculture, Rural \nDevelopment, Food and Drug Administration and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2010.\n  The bill, as reported by the Senate Committee on Appropriations, \nprovides $23.1 billion in discretionary budget authority for fiscal \nyear 2010, which will result in new outlays of $17.7 billion. When \noutlays from prior-year budget authority are taken into account, \nnonemergency discretionary outlays for the bill will total $24.9 \nbillion.\n  The Senate-reported bill matches its section 302(b) allocation for \nbudget authority and for outlays.\n  The bill is not subject to any budget points of order.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  S. 1406, Agriculture, Rural Development, Food and Drug Administration \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2010\n\n [Spending comparisons--Senate-Reported Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n\n                                                        General purpose\nSenate-Reported Bill:\n  Budget Authority...............................................23,050\n  Outlays........................................................24,886\nSenate 302(b) Allocation:\n  Budget Authority...............................................23,050\n  Outlays........................................................24,886\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n  Budget Authority...............................................22,900\n  Outlays........................................................24,686\nPresident's Request:\n  Budget Authority...............................................22,819\n  Outlays........................................................24,743\nSenate-Reported Bill Compared To:\n  Senate 302(b) allocation:\n    Budget Authority................................................  -\n    Outlays.........................................................  -\n  House-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority................................................150\n    Outlays.........................................................200\n  President's Request:\n    Budget Authority................................................231\n    Outlays.........................................................143\n\nNote: Table does not include 2010 outlays stemming from emergency \nbudget authority provided in the 2009 Supplemental Appropriations Act \n(P. 1102).\n  Mr. KOHL.

Mr. President, I rise today to address a topic we have \nbeen debating for many weeks and months but especially the last couple \nof weeks, and that is health care. We have spent a good deal of time in \nWashington talking about the details of various provisions, the \ndifferent ideas that have been introduced in bills and through the work \nof the committee.\n  I happen to be a member of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions \nCommittee, known by the acronym ``HELP.'' In our committee, we\n\n[[Page S8624]]\n\nspent about 60 hours in hearings and 25 hours or so in discussions with \nour Democratic and Republican colleagues, working through some ideas. \nWe accepted about 160 Republican amendments before our bill came out of \ncommittee. As you might know, the vote in committee was 13 Democrats \nvoted for it, 10 Republicans voted against it. But despite that divide \nin the vote, there was a good exchange on important issues.\n  Mr. President, you know as well as I do some of the issues with which \nwe are wrestling. We want to try to provide the President a bill that, \nfirst of all, in a general sense, provides stability--stability with \nregard to cost, lowering the cost and also controlling cost, and \nstability with regard to choices. I believe what we are going to send \nto the President this fall will allow people to keep the health care \nthey want to keep if they like what they have and are happy with it. \nBut if you don't have any health care or you have a plan that costs too \nmuch or is of poor quality, you can choose another option. I hope the \noptions will be both private plans and a public option, but that is a \npoint of contention we will be talking a lot about as well.\n  Finally, we want to make sure there is quality, at long last that we \nreach a point where we are introducing quality measures into our health \ncare system. Theories and proposals and strategies have been talked \nabout too much and not enacted or put into the law. There are a lot of \ngood examples by private companies across the country that have \nwellness policies, that invest in keeping people healthy so they do not \nhave to spend money from our health care system treating a disease--\ngetting out ahead of a problem, so to speak. And there is prevention, \nwith all kinds of ways to save lives, to improve quality, and to save \nmoney as well.\n  I wanted to walk through some provisions in some detail, not to take \ntoo much time because I know we are at the end of our week.\n  First is the fundamental urgency of where we are now. I believe we \ncannot wait. We have talked this issue to death for the last 15 years \nespecially, since the early 1990s. But even if you look at it beyond \nthat, for about 60 years or so since President Truman introduced this \nidea of doing something substantial on health care, we have talked \nabout it. The time for action is now. In my judgment, this is no longer \njust a nice thing to do. It is a necessity for our economy. We cannot \neven begin to imagine a strong economy over the next decade or longer \nwithout health care reform. More American families are unable to get \nthe coverage they need. So where we are now, the status quo, is not \njust unacceptable, it is economically unsustainable as we debate this \nissue today.\n  Let me go to the second chart with that same concept about it being \nunsustainable, the status quo, staying on the road we are on. Premiums \nhave doubled over the last 9 years, three times faster than wages. If \nwe do nothing in the next 30 years, a third of our economy will be \nspent on health care. That is unsustainable. Health care spending will \nincrease from $2.5 trillion to $7 trillion in the period between now \nand 2025.\n  This might be the most stunning set of numbers of all. Every week, \n44,230 people lose their health insurance. We cannot say that enough. \nWe cannot repeat that number enough. How can we build an economy, how \ncan we be a successful, vibrant, growing economy when every single week \n44,230 people lose their health insurance? We could chart this just \nfrom the time our committee voted the bill out of committee a couple \nweeks ago in the HELP Committee. Every week since then, more than \n44,000 are losing their health insurance.\n  This is a Pennsylvania number, roughly a 3-year number. From January \n2008 to December 2010, the projection is that 178,520 people will lose \ntheir coverage. For our State, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, that \nis unsustainable. We cannot grow an economy with those numbers.\n  Without reform--this is a State of Pennsylvania number--family \ncoverage would cost $26,679 in 2016, consuming 51.7 percent of \nprojected Pennsylvania family median income. I don't know of any family \nin America, even a very wealthy family, who can pay half their income \nto health care, certainly not a middle-income family. But that is the \nroad we are on. That is going to happen if we stay where we are and \nstay with the status quo. And that is 7 years away, that is not 25 or \n30 or 50 years. In 7 years, staying on the road we are on means the \naverage family in Pennsylvania is going to have to pay more than half \ntheir income to health care. To say that is unsustainable is something \nthat is an assertion of an understatement by a mile.\n  Here are some of the themes I talked about before--stable costs, \nsecure choices, and quality care. These are some of the themes we have \nto keep mentioning.\n  On the lower cost issue, preventing illness and disease, as I said \nbefore, does have a cost implication. It is not all the savings, but we \nknow from research and experience that we will have savings.\n  Uncompensated care. This is a factor we can consider today. People \nthink: I have health care. There are uninsured people out there, maybe \n50 million people uninsured. Someone who has health care might think: I \nwish they could get coverage, but I am afraid if they get coverage, I \nam going to be paying more. That is a lot of the debate. But what we \nfail to realize sometimes in the debate is people are paying right now \nfor the uninsured. Having uninsured Americans is not free. We all pay \nfor that, and by one estimate, $1,000 per year for every American who \nhas health insurance.\n  One of the things we are trying to do in this legislation is to cover \n97 percent, or one bill might have it at 95 percent, but above 90 \npercent of Americans is the goal for coverage.\n  I go to the next chart on reducing waste, fraud, and abuse. One \nestimate is we could save $60 billion per year. Some say that is an \nestimate and that is just what one group said. Let's say it is wrong. \nLet's say it is not quite $60 billion. What if it is off by a little? \nWhat if it is $40 billion? That is still a lot of savings. What if it \nis $30 billion? What if they are way off? That is a lot of savings \nevery year. But we are not doing that today, preventing that kind of \nfraud, waste, and abuse.\n  Capping out-of-pocket limits. Even when they have the benefit of \nhealth care delivery, the out-of-pocket costs keep going up and up. So \nmany small businesses worry about this when they are forced, if they \nwant to employ people, to pay more and more, and forcing people to pay \nmore out of their own pockets.\n  Small businesses and individuals join purchasing pools for lower \nrates. The reason that is important is because all the desks in this \nChamber--every one of us has health care, really good health care, if \nyou are a Federal employee. Thank goodness. I am blessed by that health \ncare. My wife and my four daughters and I all benefit from that, just \nlike every Member of the Senate and every Member of the House and \neveryone who works in the Federal Government. That is good. Guess what. \nThe reason we have health care and choice of lots of options and plans \nis because we pool all those people, millions of Americans who happen \nto be connected in some way to the Federal Government pool. They are in \none pool, and that keeps costs down. Why is that good enough for \nSenators and Congressmen, why is that available to them but small \nbusinesses don't have the same plan or the same option available to \nthem? I think every small business in America should have the benefit--\nthe cost-reduction benefit, at a minimum--that comes from pooling their \nresources and their individuals. That is part of the reform we are \ntalking about. It is not a concept, it is in the bill. And that is \nimportant to emphasize.\n\n  Finally, if you like what you have, you can keep it. I said that \nearlier. We should keep saying that because it is important.\n  Ensuring coverage even when families move, lose a job, or have an \nillness--why in America, if we can figure out so many complicated \nthings, can't we guarantee when someone loses their job they will not \nlose their health care? It does not make sense that we have accepted \nthat, tolerated that inequity for so long.\n  ``Gateway'' is a word about which we have been hearing a lot. What \ndoes that mean? It is really a marketplace. It allows people to go to a \nWeb site and find out what they want in their health\n\n[[Page S8625]]\n\ncare plan, not having to read hundreds of pages of fine print that the \nbest lawyers in America sometimes do not understand.\n  A marketplace is a gateway that allows families and businesses to \ncompare rates, benefits, plans, both private and, we hope--we hope--a \npublic option. Why can you go online and learn about a car or some \nother major purchase in your life and you can't do the same thing for \nhealth care? It is ridiculous, in a word. That is what this would \nallow--giving people the ability to do just that, just as they do for \nevery other major purchase in their life.\n  Secure choices is important. Individuals will have their choice of \ndoctors and individualized care. Government and insurance will not \ninterfere in the doctor-patient treatment decisions. I know there is a \nlot of talk about government getting in the middle. It is just not \ntrue, and people know it is not true. We have to make sure people \nunderstand that is a fundamental building block of what we are talking \nabout. We want people to be empowered, we want them to have more \nchoices, and we want them to have the choice of both the public option \nand private plans as well.\n  I am almost done, Mr. President. My colleague from Arizona is here, \nand I want to make sure he has his time on Friday to speak.\n  This is bill language. Sometimes we talk about concepts, and the \nAmerican people never get to the point of seeing in front of them \nlanguage from a bill that is actually understandable and is focused on \nthe real problem.\n  One of the biggest problems people in our State and a lot of States \nrun up against is a preexisting condition prevents them from getting \ntreatment. It is unbelievable that we have tolerated that for so long \nas well. Why can't we say we are going to pass a law that at long last \nsays a preexisting condition will not prevent you, your son, daughter, \nspouse, or loved one from getting the care they deserve? We should not \nhave to do it. Insurance companies have forced us to legislate, to make \nthis the law.\n  Here is the language. It is not complicated. It is not mysterious. It \nis not lawyer language:\n\n       A group health plan and a health insurance issuer offering \n     group or individual health insurance coverage may not impose \n     any preexisting condition exclusion . . .\n\n  Let me read that again:\n\n     . . . may not impose any preexisting condition exclusion with \n     respect to such plan or coverage.\n\n  That is in the bill. It is not a fuzzy concept, it is very specific.\n  One of the reasons I and so many others are saying we cannot stay on \nthe path we are on, we cannot accept again and again the status quo, is \nbecause of that--because the status quo means ``may not impose any \npreexisting condition exclusion'' does not become part of the law and \nwe have to continue to deal with the horrific and inexcusable nightmare \nof a preexisting condition preventing someone in America, someone who \nmight be very sick in America, from getting treatment, from getting the \nbenefit of health care they ought to have a right to expect.\n  So when we pass this bill, we have to make sure people understand \nthat is in the bill, and that is very specific and it is very pointed \nand focused on a real problem for families.\n  Finally, children. One of the goals here, obviously, is to make sure \nthat no child, especially poor children and those with special needs, \nis worse off as a result of this bill. Children are different from \nadults. They can't be treated the same way. They need strategies and \ntreatments that adults don't have. They have different health care \nneeds. It is critical that children, especially those who are \ndisadvantaged, who happen to be poor, who have special needs, get the \nhighest quality care, which they deserve. That is why I have a \nresolution as part of that which I have introduced.\n  Finally, with regard to children--no child worse off. Because we want \nthem to grow into healthy and productive adults, they need to get the \nhighest quality care throughout their childhood. We want them to get \nfrom this picture in a crib to that picture getting a diploma. So we \nwant them to have the kind of quality health care that will allow us to \nprevent disease and illness in a child early enough which will allow \nthem to lead a productive life and get ready to contribute to our great \neconomy and to our great country.\n  There is a lot to do. There is still more work to do, but we need to \ncontinue to talk about what is in these bills and to have a vigorous \ndebate. We are a long way from getting this done, but I believe we are \non the right track. I believe it is not only important, but unless we \ndo this, I think we are heading down a path that is unsustainable for \nour economy, for our country, and especially for our families.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/31/senate-section/article/S8625-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8625-S8628]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOUSE DEFENSE BILL AND EARMARKS\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to talk for a few minutes about the \nactions taken by the House of Representatives yesterday when they \npassed the Defense appropriations bill. It is not a small piece of \nlegislation. It provides $636 billion for defense, and it avoided one \nveto fight by stripping out funding for advanced procurement of the F-\n22 fighter jet, but it chose to ignore veto threats over funding for an \nalternative engine for the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter and the VH-71--\nincredibly, the VH-71 Presidential helicopter. The House bill provides \n$560 million to continue pursuing an alternative engine and $485 \nmillion for continuation of the VH-71 helicopter. The VH-71 helicopter \nis the Presidential helicopter, which Secretary Gates has, I think very \naccurately, derided as one of the most outrageous examples of \noverspending for any system the Defense Department has ever acquired. \nThe bill also provides $674 million for three C-17 cargo aircraft, not \nrequested in the administration's budget. It has been determined time \nafter time that there is no need for additional C-17 aircraft.\n  So what did they do in return for continuation of things like a \nPresidential helicopter that costs more than a 747 and all of these \nother porkbarrel projects? Well, the House bill reduces funding by $1.9 \nbillion for our request for MRAPs--for MRAPs, the vehicles that are \nprotecting young men and women who are fighting in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. They reduce the number from what the administration thinks \nwe need--5,244--to 2,000. It is remarkable.\n  But what I really wanted to talk about for a minute is the 1,100 \nearmarks totaling $2.8 billion. Of those, 540, totaling $1.3 billion, \nare slated to go to specific private companies without competition. \nRemarkable--$1.3 billion. You know, the bill may have language saying \nfunding should be competed, but in reality it is not the case when a \nspecific company is identified in report language.\n  Also incredibly, there are 70 earmarks in the bill for former clients \nof the PMA Group--the people whose offices have been raided and shut \ndown. It is currently under investigation by both the Justice \nDepartment and the House ethics committee.\n  Concerning earmark reform, President Obama said:\n\n       Earmarks must have a legitimate and worthy public purpose. \n     Earmarks that Members do seek must be aired on those Members' \n     web sites in advance, so the public and press can examine \n     them and judge their merits for themselves. Each earmark must \n     be open to scrutiny at public hearings, where Members will \n     have to justify their expense to the taxpayer.\n\n  None of that has happened. The earmarks in the House fail woefully in \nmeeting scrutiny at public hearings. As Representative Jeff Flake--a \nman of great courage and of incredible integrity--so rightfully pointed \nout when he addressed the earmarks in the bill:\n\n       These earmarks receive scant scrutiny by the House \n     Appropriations Committee. The committee's markup of the bill \n     lasted all of 18 minutes. Given the way this bill has been \n     earmarked, you'd never know that serious ethical questions \n     have been raised about this process. Simply put, Members of \n     Congress should not have the ability to award no-bid \n     contracts. Even worse, many times the recipients of these \n     earmarks are campaign contributors. The practice has created \n     an ethical cloud over Congress, and it needs to end.\n\n\n[[Page S8626]]\n\n\n  Congressman Flake talked about the ethical cloud over Congress. We \nknow about PMA. Every day, there is a new story about one of these \nearmarks. I would like to cite two quick examples.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article headlined ``nextgov,'' entitled ``Software company won \nearmarked funds for work on military health records,'' and the other \narticle from Politico entitled ``Exclusive: Earmark critic steered cash \nto blimp research.''\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                     [From NextGov, July 29, 2009]\n\n   Software Company Won Earmarked Funds for Work on Military Health \n                                Records\n\n                            (By Bob Brewin)\n\n       Adara Networks, the company that is the subject of a \n     Defense Department employee's allegations that it received \n     important software code in advance of winning a sole-source \n     contract to provide hardware and software for a new military \n     electronic health record system, has only between 20 and 50 \n     employees and revenues of $8 million a year, according to \n     online records. But the company has powerful friends in \n     Washington.\n       Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., inserted earmarks in the fiscal \n     2008 and 2009 Defense appropriations measures funding work by \n     Adara on Defense health record systems. He also has a pending \n     earmark for Adara in the 2010 Defense appropriations bill.\n       According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Adara has \n     paid $240,000 in lobbying fees to Gage LLC, a consulting and \n     government affairs firm whose partners include former Sen. \n     Conrad Burns, R-Mont. The firm is headed by Burns' former \n     chief of staff, Leo A. Giacometto.\n       The bulk of the fees, $160,000, went to Gage last year, \n     making Adara one of the company's biggest sources of revenue \n     in 2008. The Adara lobbying tab from Gage last year matched \n     the fee paid to the lobbying firm by VeriSign, an Internet \n     security company that had revenues of $255 million in the \n     first quarter of this year.\n       According to a database of federal contract awards, Adara \n     won Defense contracts valued at $7.2 million in 2007 and \n     $13.7 million in 2008.\n       Cochran's earmarks steered $4 million to Adara last year \n     for work on what was described as a ``next-generation \n     networking electronic medical records project'' and $1.1 \n     million in 2009 for the Strategic/Tactical Resource \n     Interoperability Kinetic Environment (STRIKE) project. \n     Cochran has sought $10 million in Adara funding for the \n     STRIKE project in the 2010 Defense appropriations bill, which \n     is pending in the Senate.\n       The STRIKE project, according to Cochran's office, is \n     designed to help the Defense Department solve problems of \n     interoperability, scalability, performance and security in \n     its medical information technology systems.\n       Internal Military Health System briefings show that Adara's \n     NPX routers, which the company says are capable of moving \n     data around faster than rival products, sit at the heart of \n     the new Military Health System electronic record \n     architecture. The routers serve as a bridge between Defense's \n     AHLTA electronic health record system, the Clinical Data \n     Repository that stores more than 9 million military health \n     records, and VA's electronic health record system.\n       An internal e-mail NextGov obtained shows that the Military \n     Health System tapped Adara to provide software as well as \n     hardware for a new enterprise architecture, including a means \n     of exchanging data and a graphical user interface to view \n     medical records.\n       In that e-mail, Maj. Frank Tucker, chief of product \n     development for the Defense Health Information Management \n     System at MHS, charged he was directed to provide Adara with \n     software source code and documentation, which he viewed as \n     unethical, because this would give the company a leg-up in \n     any competition.\n       Tucker alleged Adara was awarded a sole-source contract by \n     the Military Health System, but did not specify the \n     contract's value.\n       Adara has not returned calls seeking comment from NextGov \n     for the past three days. Cochran's office did not respond to \n     a request for comment placed Wednesday.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                     [From Politico, July 30, 2009]\n\n        Exclusive: Earmark Critic Steered Cash to Blimp Research\n\n                          (By John Bresnahan)\n\n       Rep. Pete Sessions--the chief of the Republicans' campaign \n     arm in the House--says on his website that earmarks have \n     become ``a symbol of a broken Washington to the American \n     people.''\n       Yet in 2008, Sessions himself steered a $1.6 million \n     earmark for dirigible research to an Illinois company whose \n     president acknowledges having no experience in government \n     contracting, let alone in building blimps.\n       What the company did have: the help of Adrian Plesha, a \n     former Sessions aide with a criminal record who has made more \n     than $446,000 lobbying on its behalf.\n       Sessions spokeswoman Emily Davis defends the airship \n     project as a worthwhile use of federal funds and says it \n     could eventually lead to thousands of new jobs in Sessions's \n     Dallas-area district.\n       But the company that received the earmarked funds, Jim G. \n     Ferguson & Associates, is based in the suburbs of Chicago, \n     with another office in San Antonio--nearly 300 miles from \n     Dallas. And while Sessions used a Dallas address for the \n     company when he submitted his earmark request to the House \n     Appropriations Committee last year, one of the two men who \n     control the company says that address is merely the home of \n     one of his close friends.\n       Jim G. Ferguson IV--the younger half of the father-son team \n     behind Jim G. Ferguson & Associates--told POLITICO that he \n     and his father are trying to build an airship with a ``high \n     fineness ratio'' that can be used in both military and \n     civilian applications.\n       Fineness ratio is the technical term for the relationship \n     between an airship's length and its diameter; the higher the \n     fineness ratio, the longer and more slender the airship is. A \n     blimp with a very high fineness ratio could fly faster and be \n     able to stay aloft longer--the holy grail for airship \n     designers during the past century.\n       Yet Ferguson acknowledged that neither he nor his father \n     has a background in the defense or aviation industries, nor \n     any engineering or research expertise.\n       A search of publicly available records shows no history of \n     the Fergusons ever being involved with the airship industry \n     other than their attendance at a February 2005 Pentagon \n     conference on the subject.\n       Jim G. Ferguson IV said in an interview that he and his \n     father ``were business people'' and had acquired the patents \n     for building an advanced airship prototype. He said that the \n     two men are playing a supervisory role in the project and \n     ``have obtained world-class experts to work for us.''\n       According to a statement that Sessions included in the \n     Congressional Record last September, slightly more than half \n     of the $1.6 million earmark was to go toward research and \n     engineering costs. The remainder was for overhead and \n     administrative costs.\n       ``This particular project is focused on study and analysis \n     of the high fineness ratio multimission airship for \n     implementation and deployment in support of the persistent \n     [Defense Department] wide shortfall in intelligence, \n     surveillance and reconnaissance capability,'' Ferguson said \n     in a statement.\n       The elder Ferguson declined to talk with POLITICO. His son \n     would not provide details on his professional career but did \n     say that he first came to Washington in 1991 to work in the \n     Transportation Department under Secretary Samuel Skinner. He \n     then did advance work for the White House when Skinner became \n     White House chief of staff under President George H. W. Bush.\n       On Federal Election Commission forms, Ferguson's occupation \n     has been listed at various times as lobbyist, rancher or \n     self-employed investor. When asked about his activities since \n     the first Bush administration, Ferguson said he was ``just \n     working, doing a bunch of different stuff.''\n       He has also donated money to Sessions and other \n     Republicans. FEC records show that Ferguson contributed \n     $5,000 to Sessions's leadership PAC in October 2007. Overall, \n     Ferguson and his father have given $18,500 to GOP lawmakers \n     over the past six years.\n       Ferguson declined to describe his relationship with Plesha.\n       ``I've known him for a long time,'' Ferguson said. ``As you \n     know, [Washington] is a small town.''\n       Likewise, Plesha would not comment about his work with the \n     Fergusons or about any interactions he may have had with \n     Sessions or his office concerning the earmark.\n       ``As a policy, I never discuss anything regarding my \n     clients other than what is already publicly available or \n     required to be disclosed by law--especially for a client such \n     as this where their technology is very much sought after by \n     the larger defense and corporate shipping firms,'' Plesha \n     said in a statement provided to POLITICO.\n       In 1997--before going to work for Sessions--Plesha was \n     arrested for illegal possession of a handgun in Washington, \n     after he shot a man who was burglarizing his apartment, \n     according to court documents. Plesha claimed he had acted in \n     self-defense, but the burglar said Plesha shot him three \n     times in the back as he was running away. Plesha pled guilty \n     to the handgun charge, was sentenced to 18 months' probation \n     and ordered to do 120 hours of community service.\n       Within a year, he was working as a campaign manager for \n     Republican House candidate Charles Ball, who was running \n     against then-Rep. Ellen Tauscher (D-Calif.).\n       In that campaign, the FEC has said that Plesha created a \n     fake Democratic committee to attack Tauscher. The FEC said \n     the committee sent out 40,000 letters and made 10,000 phone \n     calls to Democratic voters in Tauscher's district just prior \n     to the 1998 midterm elections suggesting that Democratic Rep. \n     George Miller was opposing Tauscher's reelection.\n       But Miller was, in fact, backing Tauscher. The FEC launched \n     an investigation. And in a 2004 news release, the FEC said \n     that Plesha had not only ``authorized and distributed the \n     fabricated letters and calls'' but also ``knowingly made \n     false statements to the FEC'' about them, ``denying \n     involvement in or knowledge of this scheme.''\n       According to the FEC and court documents, Plesha pled \n     guilty to lying to investigators in the case. He was fined \n     $5,000, placed on three years' probation and ordered to do an \n     additional 160 hours of community service, according to \n     federal court documents. He also entered into a \n     ``conciliation\n\n[[Page S8627]]\n\n     agreement,'' under which he was to pay a $60,000 civil \n     penalty, the FEC said.\n       Lobbying disclosure records show that, beginning in \n     November 2005, Ferguson and Plesha lobbied on behalf of \n     Sphere Communications, a division of NEC Corp., the Japanese \n     telecommunications giant. Plesha also worked for a time for a \n     San Francisco-based defense contractor whose employees, FEC \n     records show, had contributed heavily to Sessions and his \n     PAC.\n       By 2006, lobbying disclosure forms show that Plesha was \n     working for the Fergusons. The records show that he collected \n     $51,400 in fees from the Fergusons during the last six months \n     of 2006; nearly $292,000 more in 2007; and $64,500 in 2008.\n       The records show that the Fergusons are, by far, Plesha's \n     most lucrative lobbying clients.\n       Sessions's office said Plesha wasn't given any special \n     access to his former boss.\n       ``His role is clear: He and his client presented a position \n     (i.e., briefing) to the congressman and his staff,'' said a \n     Sessions aide. ``As with any project request, Congressman \n     Sessions evaluates the merits of the project and accordingly \n     makes a decision to either support or decline the request. \n     Based on the project's represented merits, . . . Sessions \n     decided to submit the request to the Appropriations Committee \n     for its review and determination.''\n       And the Texas Republican still believes in the project, his \n     staff said.\n       ``Based on briefings that Congressman Sessions and his \n     staff have received, projected applications of the technology \n     include military surveillance, fuel-efficient military cargo \n     transportation (especially into areas without adequate \n     infrastructure) and missile defense,'' Davis, the \n     congressman's spokeswoman, said in a statement.\n       Davis also noted that Sessions has supported a moratorium \n     on all earmarks since the start of the 111th Congress, after \n     the earmark for the Fergusons was approved.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Quoting from the first article:\n\n       Adara Networks, the company that is the subject of a \n     Defense Department employee's allegations that it received \n     important software code in advance of winning the sole-source \n     contract to provide hardware and software for a new military \n     electronic health record system, has only between 20 and 50 \n     employees and revenues of $8 million a year. But the company \n     has powerful friends in Washington. Senator Thad Cochran . . \n     . inserted earmarks in the fiscal 2008 and 2009 Defense \n     appropriations measures funding work by Adara on Defense \n     health record systems. He also has a pending earmark for \n     Adara in the 2010 Defense appropriations bill.\n       According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Adara has \n     paid $240,000 in lobbying fees to Gage LLC, a consulting and \n     government affairs firm whose partners include former Senator \n     Conrad Burns, R-Montana.

Cochran's earmarks steered $4 million \n     to Adara last year for work on what was described as a \n     ``next-generation networking electronic medical records \n     project'' and $1.1 million in 2009 for the Strategic/Tactical \n     Resource Interoperability Kinetic Environment Project. \n     Cochran has sought $10 million in Adara funding for the \n     STRIKE project in 2010.\n       An internal e-mail NextGov obtained shows that the military \n     health system tapped Adara to provide software as well as \n     hardware for a new enterprise architecture, including a means \n     of exchanging data and a graphical user interface to view \n     medical records. In that e-mail, Major Frank Tucker, chief of \n     product development for the Defense Health Information \n     Management System at MHS, charged he was directed to provide \n     Adara with software source code and documentation, which he \n     viewed as unethical because this would give the company a leg \n     up in any competition. Tucker alleged Adara was awarded a \n     sole-source contract by the Military Health System, but did \n     not specify the contract's value.\n\n  There should be a full investigation of that.\n  Quoting from the Politico story:\n\n       Representative Pete Sessions, the chief of the Republicans' \n     campaign arm in the House, says on his Web site that earmarks \n     have become ``a symbol of a broken Washington to the American \n     people.'' Yet in 2008, Sessions himself steered a $1.6 \n     million earmark for dirigible research to an Illinois company \n     whose president acknowledges having no experience in \n     government contracting, let alone in building blimps. What \n     the company did have: the help of Adrian Plesha, a former \n     Sessions aide with a criminal record who has made more than \n     $446,000 lobbying on its behalf.\n       But the company that received the earmarked funds, Jim G. \n     Ferguson & Associates, is based in the suburbs of Chicago, \n     with another office in San Antonio--nearly 300 miles from \n     Dallas. And while Sessions used a Dallas address for the \n     company when he submitted his earmark request to the House \n     Appropriations Committee last year, one of the two men who \n     control the company says that address is merely the home of \n     one of his close friends.\n       . . . Ferguson acknowledged that neither he nor his father \n     has a background in the defense or aviation industries, nor \n     any engineering or research expertise.\n\n  Finally, it goes on:\n\n     . . . more than half of the $1.6 million earmark was to go \n     toward research and engineering costs. The remainder was for \n     overhead and administrative costs.\n\n  This is the result--and there are myriad examples--of this earmarking \nwhich goes on and on in this year's Defense appropriations bill from \nthe House, and there will be more from the Senate. There are 1,102 \nearmarks. We can't do that. We have to stop. The American people are \nvery tired of it.\n  Let me remind my colleagues again about PMA, of which there are some \n70 earmarks. The PMA Group was a DC lobbying firm with deep ties to \nCapitol Hill and a reputation for securing lucrative earmarks for its \nclients, especially defense earmarks. It boasted more than $15 million \nin revenue last year. PMA Group clients reportedly received $300 \nmillion in defense earmarks for fiscal year 2008 and $317 million for \nfiscal year 2009. PMA Group and its clients spread around a lot of \ncampaign contributions in an attempt to curry favor with lawmakers. \nAccording to one report, the firm had been credited with $1.8 million \nin contributions since 2001, and that is just the members of the \nDefense Appropriations Committee.\n  Last November, the Federal Bureau of Investigation raided PMA's \noffices and the home of its founder, Paul Magliocchetti. According to \nnews reports, prosecutors were initially focused on whether Mr. \nMagliocchetti used a Florida wine steward and a golf club executive as \na front to funnel illegal donations to lawmakers. The Washington Post \nexamined campaign contributions reportedly given by employees of the \nPMA Group and found listed in donor records ``several people who were \nnot registered lobbyists and did not work for the lobbying firm,'' \nincluding a 75-year-old California man who had never even heard of the \nfirm.\n  Since then the Department of Justice has raided the offices of a \nnumber of PMA clients and their business partners. One former PMA \nclient is accused of giving kickbacks to an ex-Air Force contracting \nofficial. A Federal grand jury reportedly subpoenaed records from one \nU.S. Representative's congressional and campaign offices, and the FBI \nis interviewing his staffers.\n  It upsets my colleagues when I talk about corruption in earmarking. I \nknow it is very painful. I do not question the integrity of any of my \ncolleagues. But when something like this PMA situation goes on, the \nstories are myriad of this influence of special interests at a time \nwhere we have nearly 10 percent unemployment in the United States of \nAmerica, people not able to stay in their homes, people not being able \nto keep their jobs. If it was ever unacceptable, which it always was, \nit certainly is unacceptable now.\n  At some point, the Defense appropriations bill will come to the floor \nof the Senate. If it is anything like the Defense appropriations bill \nthe House of Representatives passed yesterday, we are going to have a \nlong process because we have to bring this practice to an end.\n  During the campaign, the President of the United States said we would \nreview every appropriation line by line and do away with those that \nwere unnecessary and unwanted and a waste of the taxpayers' dollars. \nThere is no greater opportunity than there is now.\n  I appreciate the President's involvement in ending production of the \nF-22, his involvement in saying the alternate engine is unsustainable \nfor the F-35--continued billions of dollars of funding. But the \nearmarks are also billions of dollars of waste of the taxpayers' \ndollars. The earmarks are what bred corruption and the reason we have \nformer Members of Congress residing in Federal prison. It has to be \nstopped. No contract should be allowed on a noncompetitive basis to be \nappropriated by the Congress of the United States.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S8628]]\n\n  Mr. REID.

Mr. President, I applaud the Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship Committee for their efforts in putting together a \nthoughtful, balanced reauthorization of the Small Business Innovations \nResearch--SBIR--and Small Business Technology Transfer--STTR--programs.\n  I know the committee is in negotiations with the House trying to \nreach a good reconciliation with the right parameters. I hope they do, \nso that we have these programs in place for years to come instead of \nanother short-term extension.\n  SBIR was set up in 1982 and requires 11 Federal departments and \nagencies like the Department of Defense, the National Institutes of \nHealth and the National Science Foundation to set aside 2.5 percent of \ntheir research and development budgets for small businesses, which is \nover $2 billion per year. STTR sets aside another 0.3 percent of R \nfor small businesses to work in partnership with university and \ninstitutional researchers. Both programs have been highly successful, \nhelping propel small business growth, and develop and commercialize the \ninnovations that are the backbone of our economy.\n  I wanted to share a few facts about small business for the record.\n  According to the Small Business Administration, small businesses \nannually create between 60 and 80 percent of the net new jobs in \nAmerica.\n  Small businesses produce on average 13 to 14 times more patents per \nemployee than large patenting firms.\n  Small business employs about 38 percent of the scientists and \nengineers in America, up from only 6 percent in 1978.\n  Despite all this growth and stellar track record, small business \nreceives only about 4 percent of Federal extramural research dollars. \nThat needs to change. Small business has proven they can do Federal R \nas well as or better than large business, and they deserve more space \nat the table.\n  Small business is going to be the engine that pulls the country out \nof this recession, like it has so many times in the past. Looking \nbeyond the recession, small business will again develop the innovative \ntechnologies in which America consistently leads the world. The Senate \nbill wisely supports and extends our support for small business's role \nin growing a vibrant national economy.\n  In my own State of North Dakota, SBIR has helped fund a number of \ninnovations, and I wanted to mention a few of them.\n  The Technology Applications Group of Grand Forks, located in the Red \nRiver Valley Research Corridor, invented the Tagnite coating system \nthrough Army and Navy SBIR funds. The technology allows the military to \ncoat magnesium alloys for parts, ships, helicopters and airplanes in a \nway that is much less toxic than old processes, cuts down on corrosion, \nand saves on maintenance.\n  Agsco of Grand Forks received an SBIR grant that led to development \nof the SCOIL and SUN-IT II products that enhance crop herbicide \neffectiveness. Agsco turned their SBIR grants into two products with a \ngreat deal of commercial impact.\n  Dakota Technologies of Fargo has received multiple SBIR grants, \nincluding two that led to development of BEAM, or ballast exchange \nassurance meter, which measures ballast water in ships to make sure \nthey don't contain harmful species or contaminants. BEAM is currently \nin a pilot program with the Coast Guard.\n  Back in 2002, I secured funding to develop telepharmacy technology to \nconnect pharmacists directly with patients and pharmacy technicians \nregardless of their location. Technologies like this have been a boon \nto rural communities because they allow them to compete on a level \nplaying field with urban areas.\n  The USDA just awarded Telepharmacy Concepts of Dickinson, ND, with an \n$80,000 Phase I SBIR award that will allow them to research whether \ntelepharmacy technology could be used for medication therapy \nmanagement, which is a way to provide patient education, increase \nmedication compliance and improve health care outcomes.\n  Praxis Strategy Group of Grand Forks has received SBIR awards nine \ntimes, including grants from the USDA to develop strategic processes \nlike the High Performance Community Initiative and the Enterprise \nHomesteading Program that help communities, especially small \ncommunities, attract entrepreneurs, develop dynamic economies, and \nmarket themselves.\n  While I am happy with the Senate reauthorization, I am concerned \nabout some of the provisions in the House version we are trying to \nreconcile it with.\n  First, the House bill opens participation in SBIR to companies that \nare majority-owned by venture capital firms. I have nothing against \nventure capital companies, but the small businesses that they own have \nalready shown they can successfully attract capital in the private \nmarket.\n  SBIR was intended to help small businesses without the connections \navailable to do that. I think the House bill is trying to fix something \nthat isn't broken.\n  Second, given the long-term success of SBIR and STTR, I think it only \nmakes sense to increase the share of agency funds set aside for small \nbusiness as the Senate's bill gradually does.\n  American business has changed dramatically since SBIR was created. \nSince 1978, the share of scientists and engineers working for small \nbusinesses has, as I said, increased from 6 to 38 percent. Funding for \nSBIR and STTR needs to increase to reflect that reality. I am concerned \nthat the House bill keeps their allocations where they have been for 27 \nyears, despite the successful track record of the programs. Given the \nfigures I have quoted previously, increasing the set-aside from 2.5 to \n3.5 percent is the very least we should do.\n  Small business is the core of our country's economy, and we have here \na program that has a strong track record of encouraging growth and \ninnovation in that area. I urge the program's reauthorization with the \nprinciples of Senate bill S. 1233.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/31/senate-section/article/S8628-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8628-S8629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ZERO TOLERANCE FOR VETERANS HOMELESSNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the introduction of S. \n1547--the Zero Tolerance for Veterans Homelessness Act. I am very proud \nto be an original cosponsor of this legislation and to join my good \nfriend, Senator Jack Reed, along with Senators Tim Johnson and Patty \nMurray, on addressing the tragedy of homelessness among our Nation's \nveterans. My three colleagues have been steadfast in their resolve to \naddress the needs of veterans, including the tragedy of homelessness, \nand I commend them.\n  Senator Reed has been a strong and committed leader on affordable \nhousing and homeless issues and his leadership played a strong role in \nthe recent enactment of the historic Homeless Emergency Assistance and \nRapid Transition to Housing Act or HEARTH Act. I am honored to join him \nagain.\n  Like the HEARTH Act, the Zero Tolerance for Veterans Homelessness Act \nbuilds on our work over the past several years by focusing on the \nimportance of permanent supportive housing. Further, it takes important \nsteps to break down the barriers between the Departments of Veterans \nAffairs, VA, and Housing and Urban Development, HUD, to ensure that \nveterans receive the quality services and housing they deserve and \nneed.\n  The most notable element of the legislation is the authorization of \nHUD-VA Supportive Housing or HUD-VASH rental-assistance vouchers. \nWorking with Senator Patty Murray, new HUD-VASH vouchers have been \nfunded over the past 2 years. While other HUD homeless-assistance \nprograms serve veterans, HUD-VASH is the only permanent housing program \nthat is specifically targeted to veterans and tied to veteran-specific \nsupportive services from the VA.\n  We have been fortunate to fund 10,000 new vouchers each year but with \nover\n\n[[Page S8629]]\n\n130,000 homeless veterans on any given night and thousands more who are \nat risk of becoming homeless, we must do more and this bill does \nexactly that.\n  As I noted, there are over 130,000 homeless veterans in America. \nSadly, veterans make up a significant and disproportionate amount--over \n20 percent--of the country's homeless population. Many of these \nveterans are from the Vietnam war. Even more sad and stunning is the \nfact that the number of homeless Vietnam-era veterans is greater than \nthe number of service persons who died during that war.\n  But the face of homeless veterans is changing and is not limited to \nthose who fought in Vietnam. We also are seeing homelessness increase \namong Desert Storm veterans and veterans returning from the ongoing \nconflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In addition, recent reports are finding a troubling trend of \nhomelessness among female veterans. The VA estimates that the number of \nhomeless veterans who are female has doubled over the past decade. And \nmany homeless female veterans carry the burden of being single parents.\n  This bill that I cosponsor sends a loud and clear message that \nhomelessness among our veterans is unacceptable and intolerable.\n  As I have stated in previous speeches, homelessness is thankfully no \nlonger a hopeless situation. We have learned that permanent housing \ntied to supportive services, such as mental health care and job \ntraining, was the antidote to homelessness. Nevertheless, we must \ncontinually adjust our programs to meet the changing composition of \nhomelessness.\n  Before closing, I comment on a couple of other items that will help \nto prevent and end homelessness among our Nation's veterans.\n  First, we must improve the coordination between the Department of \nDefense, DOD, and the VA. Specifically, DOD, and VA can prevent \nhomelessness among veterans by improving discharge planning and \ncoordination of the medical programs between the two Departments.\n  Second, we must find ways to improve the integration of HUD-VASH \nprograms with services that deliver job training, employment, \neducation, and health care. Specifically, we need to integrate fully \nthe Department of Labor's Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program and \nprograms run by the Department of Health and Human Services' Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n  The U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness was reactivated to \naddress the coordination between Federal agencies. It is my hope that \nthe ICH will work within existing authorities to address the DOD and \nother service integration issues that I have raised, and come forward \nwith specific recommendations for the Congress to consider. I also look \nforward to working with Senator Reed and others to address these issues \nas we move this bill through the legislative process.\n  Again, I thank Senator Jack Reed for his leadership and commitment on \nissues related to housing, veterans, and national security. I strongly \nurge my colleagues to support this bipartisan legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/31/senate-section/article/S8629-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8629]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TRIBUTE TO COMMAND SERGEANT MAJOR MICHAEL W. GLAZE\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize and pay tribute \nto Command Sergeant Major Michael W. Glaze, the Regimental Command \nSergeant Major of the Judge Advocate General's Corps, United States \nArmy, for his many years of exceptionally meritorious service to our \ncountry. Command Sergeant Major Glaze will retire from the United \nStates Army on September 1, 2009, having completed a distinguished 32-\nyear military career. We owe him a debt of gratitude for his many \ncontributions to our Nation and the legal profession, particularly \nduring operations in support of the Global War on Terror.\n  He was born in Frankfurt, Germany in 1960, where his father was \nstationed at the time, his father retired from the U.S. Army with the \nrank of Sergeant Major. He enlisted in November 1977, completed Basic \nTraining at Fort Knox, Kentucky, Advanced Individual Training at Fort \nBenjamin Harrison, Indiana and Airborne School at Fort Benning, \nGeorgia. His initial assignments as a Legal Specialist were at Fort \nBragg, North Carolina, and Schofield Barracks, Hawaii. He then returned \nto Fort Bragg as a Legal Noncommissioned Officer. Recognized for his \nsuperior performance, he then served in the Office of the Chief of \nStaff of the Army, where he deployed to Kuwait. Following redeployment, \nhe served at the Chief Paralegal at the Fort Belvoir legal office and \nat the United States Army Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg. In \nJuly 1998, Command Sergeant Major Glaze was selected as the Chief \nParalegal for XVIII Airborne Corps at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where \nhe deployed on several occasions to Iraq and Afghanistan to check on \nthe welfare of his Soldiers.\n  Command Sergeant Major Glaze was selected to be the 10th Regimental \nSergeant Major for the Judge Advocate General's Corps in 2004. On the \n2nd day of October 2006, he was appointed to Command Sergeant Major, \nthe first Command Sergeant Major in the 234-year history of the United \nStates Army Judge Advocate General's Corps. As the Command Sergeant \nMajor of the Judge Advocate General's Corps from March 2004 to \nSeptember 2009, he was the principal advisor to the Judge Advocate \nGeneral of the Army and the Deputy Judge Advocate General regarding all \nenlisted matters for a multi-component force. Additionally, he expertly \nmanaged the final stages of the Noncommissioned Officers Academy at the \nJudge Advocate General's Legal Center and School, and directed the \nfinal process for professional accreditation.\n  Command Sergeant Major Glaze's military awards and decorations \ninclude: Meritorious Service Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Army \nAchievement Medal, Good Conduct Medal, National Defense Service Medal, \nSouthwest Asia Service Medal, Armed Forces Service Medal, Humanitarian \nService Medal, Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, \nNoncommissioned Officer Professional Development Ribbon, Army Service \nRibbon, Overseas Service Ribbon, the Kuwait Liberation Medal and he is \nalso authorized to wear the Parachutist Badge.\n  A Soldier who embodies the very best of Army Values and the \nNoncommissioned Officer's Creed, Command Sergeant Major Glaze trained \nand mentored a Noncommissioned Officer Corps that truly is the backbone \nof the Judge Advocate General's Corps. His integrity is impeccable, his \ncounsel is widely sought, and he remains deeply committed to his \nSoldiers and their families. He is a leader whose honor and candor were \nthe hallmark of a career spent in selfless service to the Judge \nAdvocate General's Corps, and the United States Army. I know all my \ncolleagues join me in saluting Command Sergeant Major Michael W. Glaze \nand his wife, Debbie, for their many years of truly outstanding service \nto the Judge Advocate General's Corps, the United States Army, and our \ngreat Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/31/senate-section/article/S8629-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8629-S8631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CAP AND TRADE\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise today to highlight the impact of \ncap and trade legislation on American agriculture.\n  Mr. President, the House and Senate Western Caucuses yesterday hosted \na hearing entitled, Cap and Trade: Impact on Jobs in the West and the \nNation. Jim Magagna, the Executive Vice President of the Wyoming Stock \nGrowers Association testified at the Hearing.\n  I want to thank Jim for all he has done for agriculture in Wyoming. I \nalso ask unanimous consent that his statement from yesterday's hearing \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\nTestimony of James H. Magagna, Executive Vice President, Wyoming Stock \n                          Growers Association\n\n       Co-Chairmen and Members of the Senate Western Caucus and \n     House Western Caucus:\n       I am Jim Magagna, Executive Vice President of the Wyoming \n     Stock Growers Association (WSGA), the 137 year old voice of \n     the Wyoming cattle industry. I am also a life-long sheep \n     producer and former president of the American Sheep Industry \n     Association and the National Public Lands Council. I \n     appreciate the opportunity to appear before you today to \n     share my perspective on the\n\n[[Page S8630]]\n\n     impacts of cap and trade legislation on jobs in the \n     agricultural sector, particularly in the West.\n       My comments today will focus on four primary areas of cap \n     and trade impacts on agriculture: 1) Input costs; 2) Prices \n     received; 3) International trade and competition; and 4) \n     unintended environmental consequences. I will also briefly \n     discuss the role of proposed agricultural offsets. In \n     addition to providing an analytical overview, I will attempt \n     to put a personal face on these issues by introducing \n     comments provided to me by Wyoming agricultural producers.\n\n\n                                  JOBS\n\n       It is difficult to ascertain actual numbers of potential \n     lost jobs and lost new employment opportunities due to the \n     impact that cap and trade legislation would have on \n     agriculture. As smaller agricultural production enterprises \n     succumb to the cost-price squeeze exacerbated by the impacts \n     of cap and trade, farmers and ranchers will be forced to \n     enter the non-agricultural job market in increasing numbers. \n     This will particularly impact our young producers--those who \n     represent a bright future for American agriculture. In the \n     United States agricultural jobs are ``green jobs'' \n     contributing to the sustainable management of our natural \n     resources.\n       A decline in the number and size of agricultural \n     enterprises has a direct impact on jobs in supporting \n     industries. These include animal pharmaceuticals, \n     fertilizers, feeds, farm equipment, fencing and tack. While \n     many of these jobs are located in manufacturing centers, a \n     significant number are sales and support positions in the \n     field.\n       As agriculture declines so do our small western \n     communities. In many small towns in Wyoming the survival of \n     local businesses--the tire shop, repair service, bank, \n     grocery store--is dependent on the economic strength of the \n     agricultural sector. I am confident that this is true in many \n     of your states as well. These losses in turn affect the \n     public sector--schools, senior centers, hospitals and \n     clinics. The result is both a loss of jobs and a loss of a \n     culture and way of life.\n\n\n                              INPUT COSTS\n\n       Agriculture is heavily energy dependent. While the energy \n     needs of cultivated crop production are generally \n     acknowledged and serve as the basis for most studies, the \n     energy costs of those engaged in livestock production, in \n     particular range sheep and cattle operations, are seldom \n     analyzed. Livestock production and native hay production are \n     the primary agricultural enterprise in many of our western \n     states. In Wyoming livestock production accounts for over 82% \n     of total cash receipts from agriculture.\n       The overwhelming prices of diesel, gasoline and propane in \n     2008 provide us with a preview of the impacts of high energy \n     costs. Many of my members who had already taken all feasible \n     steps to drastically reduce their input costs began to plan \n     their exit from production agriculture. Fortunately, the \n     relief in energy prices in 2009 has given them some renewed \n     optimism. The primary energy focused input costs for \n     agriculture include: direct purchases of fuels and \n     electricity (13%); fertilizer & pesticide costs (7%); feed \n     costs (25%); and transportation/storage costs (1%). According \n     to the latest available USDA NASS data these components \n     constituted over 45% of total purchased inputs excluding seed \n     and livestock. As one WSGA member recently noted, ``These \n     costs are already stifling growth and regular, necessary \n     maintenance items. Any additional costs imposed by government \n     are obviously another blow to any size business.''\n       The EPA analysis of HR 2454 conservatively projects the \n     impact of cap and trade legislation on energy prices for the \n     period from 2015 to 2050. Price increases for electricity \n     range from 10.7% in 2015 to 35.2% in 2050. For natural gas \n     the corresponding increases are 7.4% and 30.9% while impacts \n     on petroleum prices are projected at 3.2% and 14.6%. \n     Agriculture simply cannot absorb these incremental increases \n     to already rising production costs in the light of current \n     flat to declining prices for many commodities.\n       Western open-range livestock operations are typically \n     overlooked by analysts studying overall agricultural impacts. \n     This is true for both EPA and USDA analysis of the impacts of \n     cap and trade legislation. While per acre energy costs may be \n     almost negligible, several factors contribute to high overall \n     costs. Ranchers must often travel long distances with 4-wheel \n     drive vehicles pulling trailers to check their livestock, \n     pastures and waters. Winter feeding requires heavy duty \n     tractors and equipment. Federal land grazing permittees face \n     increasing energy related costs as they implement intense \n     rotational grazing systems requiring frequent movement of \n     livestock and increased sources of water. In addition, \n     livestock must often be moved from one allotment to another \n     using either rancher owned or contract trucks. Similarly, hay \n     and supplemental feeds are often trucked very long distances.\n\n\n                            PRICES RECEIVED\n\n       The cliche that agricultural producers are price takers has \n     a solid foundation in market analysis. While some inroads \n     have been made in recent years in vertical integration \n     through retained ownership, the use of co-operatives and \n     marketing affiliations, livestock in particular are \n     most often sold to the highest bidder. Thus, while some of \n     the added energy costs of processing and transporting \n     agricultural products will flow to the consumer, much of \n     this cost increase will be reflected in prices received by \n     producers. The recently released analysis of the \n     agricultural impacts of cap and trade by USDA fails to \n     even address the prices received side of the equation. \n     (``A Preliminary Analysis of the Effects of HR 2454 on \n     U.S. Agriculture'', USDA, Economic Research Service, July \n     22, 2009).\n       Western cow/calf producers typically sell either calves or \n     yearlings which eventually move to a feedlot. While we have \n     seen growing demand for ``grass fed beef'', grain fed \n     products remains the preference of most consumers. Thus, corn \n     prices drive fed cattle prices. The dramatic increase in corn \n     prices fueled by the ill-advised government mandates and \n     subsidies for ethanol production have resulted in losses to \n     cattle feeders ranging from $100 to $140 per head. Feeders \n     are facing increased costs from EPA regulatory mandates under \n     the Clean Water Act and Clean Air Act. As feeders seek to \n     recover from this blow, feeder cattle prices may reach five-\n     year lows this fall. Proposed cap and trade legislation will \n     only fuel this trend.\n       A analysis of crop production costs under 2008 Senate \n     energy legislation (S. 2191) using scenarios from an EPA \n     study demonstrates that the cost of producing an acre of corn \n     could be expected to rise from $40 per acre to $80 per acre. \n     (``An Analysis of the Relationship Between Energy Prices and \n     Crop Production Costs'', Doane Advisory Services, May 2008) \n     The cost of transporting this corn to feedlots will increase \n     proportionately.\n       Transportation of livestock, crops and food products is an \n     inherent component of U.S. agriculture. A typical calf \n     leaving a Wyoming ranch may travel to a calf lot in another \n     state for the winter, return to a summer pasture in the West \n     the following summer, then move to a feedlot before finally \n     being shipped to a processing facility. The added costs of \n     transportation projected to accrue from cap and trade will \n     affect the value of this calf at every level.\n\n\n                  INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND COMPETITION\n\n       Today most major agricultural products, both crops and \n     livestock, produced in the United States are dependent on \n     global markets. Market growth is expected to occur primarily \n     in the export arena. U. S. food products are in great demand \n     due to our high quality food safety standards and \n     environmentally friendly production methods. However, U. S. \n     agriculture struggles to remain price competitive. The \n     cumulative added input costs at all levels that are \n     inevitable under cap and trade will further erode our \n     competitiveness.\n       If the U.S. is to remain committed to providing global \n     market access for its agricultural production, we cannot make \n     unilateral commitments to GHG reduction. To date China and \n     India, key export markets, have explicitly declined to commit \n     to a reduction in carbon emissions. Cap and trade \n     legislation, if adopted by Congress, should be made \n     contingent on Senate ratification of an international \n     commitment that imposes comparable standards on all \n     countries.\n\n\n                 UNINTENDED ENVIRONMENTAL CONSEQUENCES\n\n       Cap and Trade is being offered as a response to climate \n     change. Though the relationship remains tenuous and unproven, \n     it is important to assess the broader environmental impacts \n     of this legislation. As specifically related to agriculture, \n     the economic costs of cap and trade will make it more \n     difficult for some to continue and to enhance agricultural \n     practices that have no proven environmental benefits. Two \n     examples in the ranching field immediately come to mind. \n     First, rotational grazing has been shown to improve forage \n     production with benefits to the environment and wildlife, \n     including endangered species. These management systems \n     require more intense management, fencing, water development \n     and regular movement of livestock. All of these activities \n     will become significantly more costly under cap and trade. \n     Second, ranchers currently spend $5,000 to $10,000 per well \n     to convert from generators or undependable windmills to solar \n     pumping. Environmental benefits accrue both from less use of \n     gas engines and less need to visit the pumping sites. \n     However, the cost of solar pumping conversions can be \n     expected to rise significantly in response to cap and trade.\n\n\n                          AGRICULTURAL OFFSETS\n\n       The agricultural and forestry related offsets incorporated \n     in Title V of HR 2454 have the potential to benefit forestry \n     and, to a lesser extent, crop production. The level of \n     benefit and the practicality of administration of the program \n     remain in question. However, there is little evidence to \n     support the USDA analysis that, according to Secretary \n     Vilsack, ``opportunities for farmers and ranchers can \n     potentially outpace--perhaps significantly--the costs from \n     climate change legislation.'' Significantly, USDA's own \n     analysis of carbon sequestration potential by region, based \n     on a carbon price of $34/metric ton demonstrates virtually no \n     potential for offsets in the Mountain Region. While the \n     greatest potential is shown for the Pacific Region, (over 150 \n     million metric tons), nearly all of this is achieved through \n     ``afforestation from pasture''. (Figure 4--Carbon \n     Sequestration Potential by Region, ``A Preliminary Analysis \n     of the Effects of H.R. 2454 on U.S. Agriculture'', USDA, \n     Economic Research Service, July 22, 2009). This translates to \n     thousands of acres removed from valuable pastureland for our \n     livestock. It is clear to me that, in touting the benefits of \n     agricultural offsets, our western states have been ignored.\n\n[[Page S8631]]\n\n                            A RETURN TO JOBS\n\n       In closing I would like to return to the issue that is the \n     primary focus of today's hearing--jobs. Agricultural jobs \n     range from basic manual labor to highly skilled crop and \n     livestock production positions. For many individuals \n     agricultural work is both a profession and a passion. \n     According to the 2007 Ag Census there are nearly 10,000 hired \n     agricultural workers in my state of Wyoming. Over one-half of \n     these work less than 150 days per year days at their \n     agricultural job. These part time jobs are essential to both \n     Wyoming agriculture and to the families that they help to \n     support. They are at the highest risk in the cost/price \n     squeeze that will be exacerbated by cap and trade.\n       Wyoming's experience shows that there is a well-established \n     progression in job losses related to diminishing agricultural \n     profitability among small and medium sized operations. First \n     the ``hired help'' is dismissed. This has already been \n     occurring at a rapid rate in our ranching industry due to \n     drought, input costs and livestock prices. As the squeeze \n     continues and the operation can no longer support two or more \n     generations, the younger family leaves the farm or ranch to \n     seek employment elsewhere. As a financial crisis approaches, \n     the older generation ``retires'' and the land is sold to \n     developers. I am sure that this scenario repeats itself in \n     many of your states. Agriculture holds multigenerational \n     families together. When the agricultural operation ceases, \n     these generational ties are lost, communities disintegrate \n     and a critical skill-set disappears. Our ability to feed \n     ourselves as a nation is diminished. This is a price that our \n     nation cannot afford to pay for a cap and trade system that \n     is at best an uncertain response to unsubstantiated climate \n     change concerns. In the words of one successful young \n     southeastern Wyoming crop and livestock producer, ``Even \n     though there may be some benefits, dad and I both agree that \n     we don't have confidence in our government to successfully \n     implement such a system.''\n       I look forward to your questions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/31/senate-section/article/S8631-1", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING DAVID LUSK\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to inform the Senate about a \nVermonter whose work has been a unique and meaningful contribution to \nthe Burlington International Waterfront Festival, a celebration of the \n400th anniversary of French explorer Samuel de Champlain's arrival at \nLake Champlain. Vermont poet David Lusk is using his craft to recreate \nexperiences that are inspired by the surrounding Vermont communities, \nthe lake's natural history, the more than 300 documented shipwrecks, \nand the rare prehistoric artifacts that lie on the lake's floor. Mr. \nLusk's poems also draw from maritime literature and his visits to the \nshipwrecks that he has taken with guides from the Lake Champlain \nMaritime Museum. He intends to create a collection of poems called \n``Lake Studies: Meditations on Lake Champlain.'' Mr. Lusk says the \npoems strive to ``reflect our mutual associations with these mysteries \nand to suggest something of our own psychological complexity in the \nprocess.''\n  Below is a poem that Mr. Lusk shared with those attending the opening \nceremony at the Burlington Waterfront on July 2, 2009, for the \ncelebration of the 400th anniversary of Samuel de Champlain's \nexplorations. I ask that the text of his poem be printed in the Record.\n\n                         Sunset on Mallet's Bay\n\n                            (By David Lusk)\n\n     For just an instant\n     as the sun reclines\n     between wooly clouds\n     and profound, lavender\n     pillows of the mountains\n\n     a flock of sheep\n     will appear to cross\n     the glimmering road\n     of iridescent silver\n     creasing the broad back\n     of the lake.\n\n     See--here they come,\n     the little sheep,\n     huddled together, afraid.\n--for L.J. and Beth\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/31/senate-section/article/S8631-2", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/31/senate-section/article/S8631-3", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "31"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/07/31/senate-section/article/S8631-4", "month": "07", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8631]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MEASURES PLACED ON THE CALENDAR\n\n  The following bill was read the second time, and placed on the \ncalendar:\n\n       S. 1552.
