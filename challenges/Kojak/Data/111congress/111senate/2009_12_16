Mr. President, we continue making progress toward making it \npossible for every American to afford to live a healthy life. Senators \ncontinue to work together toward that goal because even though we may \nhave differences of opinion on the details, we all share the strong \nbelief in the differences we can make for the American people as it \nrelates to their being healthy.\n  We all know our current system is beyond broken, and we know the \ncitizens of this country demand that we fix it. We know this because \nthey tell us--in letters, in phone calls, and visits we have at home, \nand we have not been going home very much, but certainly when we are \nable to get there. Those who oppose making health insurance more \naffordable and making health insurance companies more accountable would \nlike you to believe that is not the case. But that is only propaganda \nby the insurance industry.\n  They want you to think the American people are happy when these \ngreedy insurance companies deny health care to the sick and take away \ntheir coverage at the exact moment they need it the most.\n  They would like you to believe the American people do not mind \nhearing a multibillion-dollar company tell them: I am sorry you have \ndiabetes. I am sorry you have a heart condition. But, also, it hurts my \nbottom line, so you are on your own.\n  These insurance companies and health care deliverers want you to \nbelieve that women gladly pay more than they should for the screenings \nthey have to catch breast cancer, that men gladly pay more than they \nshould to have the test to catch prostate cancer, and that seniors \ngladly pay much more than they should to get their prescription drugs.\n  Those who are trying to slow the Senate--and really the country--and \nstop reform want you to believe the American people do not mind paying \nhidden taxes to cover the uninsured, they do not mind the waste and \nfraud rampant in the health care system, and they do not mind losing \ntheir health insurance if they lose their job. But, simply, that is not \ntrue. That is not the case.\n  The people we represent--whether it is New Mexico, Montana; we have \ntwo from New Mexico, we have one from Michigan, one from Kentucky, \nOklahoma--it does not matter what State you represent; there are \nstories.\n  Listen to what Mike Tracy, who lives in north Las Vegas, NV, said. \nHis 26-year-old son has been an insulin-dependent diabetic since he was \na baby. The insurance Mike's son gets through work will not cover his \ntreatments, and the Tracys cannot afford to buy more coverage on their \nown.\n  But this family's troubles are about more than just money. Since they \ncould not afford to treat their son's diabetes, it developed into \nsomething called Addison's disease--a disease that President Kennedy \nhad. If you have money, you can treat the disease. If you do not, it is \na very bad disease, likely could be fatal.\n  This is what Mike wrote me this past Friday.\n\n       I don't know what to pray for first: that I will die before \n     my son will so I don't have to bear the burden, or that I \n     outlive him so I can provide support to his family when he is \n     gone.\n\n  This should not be a choice for any American, and when given the \nchance to help people such as Mike, our choice should be easy.\n  Here is another example: Ellen O'Rourke wrote to me last Tuesday \nabout her friends, the Hidalgos, who live in Incline Village, NV, a \ntown on the shores of Lake Tahoe. The Hidalgos' 2-year-old daughter \nLexie Mae has a cancer of the eye that could cost her vision or her \nlife.\n  Lexie Mae's parents do not have health insurance and are counting on \nfriends to help pay for their daughter's mounting medical bills. They \nare also counting on us to lower the cost of health care so they can \nafford their own. They work hard. They want health insurance. They \ncannot get it.\n  Another letter I got last week was from Elizabeth Parsons. She \nteaches music at an elementary school in Reno and volunteers after \nschool at a dance and drama theater in town. She is 60 years old and \nwanted to retire at the end of this school year. But as she wrote me \nlast Thursday.\n\n       Unfortunately that plan has been postponed indefinitely for \n     one reason only:\n\n  ``one reason''--\n\n       I can't afford to retire because of the skyrocketing \n     increases in [my] health insurance.\n\n  Ms. Parsons has done a lot for her community. Now her country's \nleaders should do something for her: We should make sure her decision \nabout whether to retire doesn't hinge on how expensive it is to keep \nher insurance.\n  A man named Walt Cousineau from Elko wrote me last Monday to tell me \nabout his wife. She had a heart attack three Decembers ago. Health \ninsurance companies are using that as an excuse to charge $2,000 a \nmonth for coverage, $25,000 a year. They call it a preexisting \ncondition, a prior heart attack. She is not old enough yet for \nMedicare, but Walt is. He is 68. He had to go back to work so she could \nbe put on his health insurance. Now Walt is asking us to go to work for \nhim and asking us to make sure no one's health history can make staying \nhealthy in the future more expensive.\n  Ken Hansen is from Mesquite, a town on the Arizona-Nevada border. He \nhas chronic health problems and parts of his feet have been amputated. \nKen can't go to a doctor because he makes too much to qualify for \nMedicaid and too little to afford private insurance. I wish to share \nwith the Senate exactly what Ken wrote me:\n\n       I am very frustrated because my only hope is that I die \n     very soon because I can't afford to stay alive.\n\n  Those are his words--not my words--that his only hope is that he die. \nHow can we look the other way? How can we possibly do nothing? This \nisn't about balance sheets or graphs or charts; it is not about \ncontracts or fine print; it is not about politics or partisanship. This \nis about life and death in America.\n  Each story is more heartbreaking than the last. Each of these \nNevadans has more than enough on his or her mind. Yet each of these \ncitizens took time out of his or her day to beg their leaders to do \nsomething.\n  Mike Tracy, the father of the young man with diabetes and Addison's \ndisease, ended his letter to me just a few days ago with this plea. \nHere is what he said:\n\n       Democrats need health care. Republicans need health care. \n     Independents need health care. All Americans need health \n     care. Get it done.\n\n  We can't let them down. We just can't let them down.\n  Those trying to kill this reform have made it clear they will do \nanything to stop us. They can recite recycled talking points until \ntheir hearts' content, but that is it. But as long as Mike Tracy's son \nmight die from a disease we know how to treat, we can't let these\n\n[[Page S13279]]\n\nobstacles stand in our way. As long as Lexie Mae's parents have to \nborrow from their friends to take their daughter to the doctor, we \ncan't take no for an answer. As long as Elizabeth Parsons can't afford \nto retire, Walt Cousineau can't afford to stay retired, and Ken Hansen \nsays he can't afford to stay alive, we can't stop fighting for them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/16/senate-section/article/S13279-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ESTATE TAX REFORM\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on a final point, for some time now we \nDemocrats have been trying to reform the estate tax to avoid the train \nwreck that is coming next month.\n  Because of the legislation passed by the Republicans in 2001, the \nestate tax is repealed for 2010--gone, nothing. But because of the \ngimmick they used to pass this legislation, the estate tax returns in \n2011, and it does so at the levels that were in effect in 2001.\n  This chicanery has created a nightmare for families trying to plan \ntheir affairs.\n  We have proposed a responsible path forward toward curing the estate \ntax problem. We proposed to extend the current tax parameters so that \nin 2010 couples would be able to pass down up to $7 million completely \ntax free. An estate tax at that level exempts all but the wealthiest \ntwo-tenths of 1 percent of estates from paying any estate tax.\n  The other side has rejected this reasonable approach. Instead, they \nwant to keep the Bush tax law in place for 2010 as originally designed.\n  The irony in the Republicans' position is, it hurts the very \nfamilies--small business men, women, and family farmers--whom they \nclaim they are trying to help.\n  The surprise facing family farms and family-owned small businesses in \n2010 is that repeal of the estate tax will actually increase their tax \nliabilities. These are families who would never pay the estate tax \nbecause they don't have assets totaling more than $7 million for a \ncouple.\n  So why do they face a tax increase? It has to do with a provision in \nthe Tax Code called stepped-up basis. What does this mean? The assets \nof family-owned businesses are often in the form of unrealized capital \ngains, the appreciation of the family business over time. Right now, \nuntil the end of this year, December 31, these capital gains are \nforgiven when a person dies--no capital gains at death and for these \nfamilies with less than $7 million there is no estate tax under current \nlaw. Therefore, for these families, death is not a taxable event.\n  The capital gains tax is forgiven because the heirs to the property \nreceive a step up in its basis for measuring tax liability when they \nultimately sell the property.\n  The law my Republican colleagues insist go into place next month \nrepeals stepped-up basis.\n  The bargain my Republican colleagues are advancing is simple. If you \nare rich, celebrate. If you are not, you should be afraid. If you are \nvery wealthy, you get a huge windfall from repeal of the estate tax. If \nyou are modestly successful--say you have a shoe store, a service \nstation, a small farm, or whatever small business--but not to the point \nwhere you are facing an estate tax liability, your heirs will, \nnonetheless, face a tax increase because of the repeal of the estate \ntax.\n  For the wealthiest families in this country, they say don't worry \nabout that. The estate tax is gone. For many more small businesses, \nRepublicans say that is too bad. All these years, as Republicans were \nusing family farms and small businesses as props in their zeal to \nrepeal the estate tax, their real goal was protecting the wealthiest of \nthe wealthy. The unfortunate aspect of that campaign is that repeal of \nthe estate tax, even for just 1 year, will come at the expense of \nfamily-owned farms and small businesses.\n  We asked, last night, and it will be asked again by the chairman of \nthe Finance Committee, the senior Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus, to \nextend the estate taxes that now exist, giving a couple an exemption of \nup to $7 million for 2 months while we work things out on that and a \nnumber of other issues, but that has been rejected by my friends on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  I repeat: If the estate tax lapses for a period at the beginning of \n2010, this will be a boon for the wealthy, a huge drain on the U.S. \nTreasury and, more importantly, let me also note that tens of thousands \nof middle-class families could suffer. If the estate tax lapses, even \nfor a short period, these families will be subject to capital gains \nwhen they sell their inherited or bequeathed property, a process that \nwill be enormously complicated for families who have no estate tax or \nplanning issues today. Although this could be retroactively eliminated, \nin the meantime the uncertainty and planning around this would affect a \nlarge number of families who ordinarily don't have to think about the \nestate tax.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/16/senate-section/article/S13279-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13279]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, reclaiming my leader time, the longer \nthe debate over health care goes on, the clearer it becomes that the \nproblem the Democrats are having isn't with some of the provisions we \nkeep hearing about on the news; their problem is the fundamental \nopposition of the American people to the core components of the bill--\nthe core of the bill.\n  Americans oppose the Democratic plan because they know the final \nproduct is a colossal legislative mistake. Not only does this bill fail \nto achieve its primary goal of lowering the cost of health care, it \nmakes matters worse by driving up premiums, raising taxes, and wrecking \nMedicare for seniors.\n  The bill is fundamentally flawed, and the American people know it \ncan't be fixed. That is why they are asking us to stop and start over \nwith the kind of commonsense, step-by-step reforms that will address \nthe cost problems.\n  Fortunately, a growing number of Democrats are beginning to listen to \nthe voices of the American people. We have, just today, a Washington \nPost poll indicating, once again, the polls are unanimous that the \nAmerican people are overwhelmingly opposed to this bill, and seniors in \nparticular, by a very wide margin, do not favor this bill.\n  So our friends on the other side of the aisle face a choice. They can \neither side with those who are making a call to history or they can \nside with their constituents who say a vote on this bill would be a \nhistoric mistake.\n  That is what is unfolding behind the scenes: As a handful of \nDemocratic leaders press ahead in a blind rush of frantic dealmaking to \nfind 60 votes by Christmas, a handful of other Democrats are wondering \nwhich side they want to be standing on when the dust settles--with \nthose who are pushing them to support a bill they don't like or with \nthe American people who are imploring them not to do it.\n  This is an important moment in the life of our Nation. This is one of \nthose moments when the free decisions of a handful of elected leaders \nare the only difference between America going down one road or another. \nHistory will be made either way. History will be made either way. But \nin this case, as in\n\n[[Page S13280]]\n\nmany others from our history, Americans want history to show that a \ndetermined few took their side and triumphed over a powerful majority--\na majority who clearly misread its mandate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/16/senate-section/article/S13280-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GUANTANAMO BAY\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, early yesterday, the administration \nannounced what can only be viewed as the latest in a string of \nseriously misguided decisions related to the closing of the secure \nfacility at Guantanamo Bay. It plans to move dozens of terrorist \ndetainees from Guantanamo Bay Cuba to a prison in northern Illinois.\n  The explanation we used to get for moving detainees onto American \nsoil was that Guantanamo's existence is a potent recruiting tool for \nterrorists. But even if you grant that, it is hard to see how simply \nchanging Guantanamo's mailing address would eliminate the problem. Does \nanyone believe Al-Jazeera will ignore the fact that enemy combatants \nare being held on American soil? It is naive to think our European \ncritics, the American left, or al-Qaida will be pacified by creating an \ninternment camp in northern Illinois, a sort of ``Gitmo North'' instead \nof ``Gitmo South.''\n  As I said, this is just the latest in a series of misguided \ndecisions. First, there was the decision to close Guantanamo by an \narbitrary date without a plan for doing so. Americans expect their \nGovernment to protect them. That is why Americans overwhelmingly \nrejected the idea of closing Guantanamo.\n  Then there was the decision to bring the self-avowed mastermind of \nthe 9/11 attack, Khalid Shaikh Mohammed, and his fellow 9/11 plotters \ninto New York City for trial. We learned just this week, the \nadministration plans to give other terrorists the benefits of a \ncivilian trial in the United States.\n  Now there is this: According to the reports we have seen, the \nadministration intends to bring as many as 100--100--foreign terrorist \nfighters from Guantanamo Bay to America, a plan that would make our \nNation less safe, not more so. What is worse, the defenders of the \nproposal don't even seem to get the implications.\n  Rather than even attempt to reassure people about safety, politicians \nin Illinois are trumpeting this decision--get this now--as a jobs \nprogram, a jobs program. That is how out of touch they are. Democratic \npoliticians are so eager to spin the failure of the $1 trillion \nstimulus, they are now talking about national security in the language \nof saved and created jobs.\n  The advocates of closing Guantanamo without a plan can't seem to make \nup their minds as to why it is a good idea. First, we were told we had \nto bring them here because Guantanamo is a dangerous symbol--the whole \nsymbolism over safety argument. Now, with unemployment in double \ndigits, it is being sold--incredibly--as a jobs project, some kind of \nshovel-ready plan.\n  But leaving aside the absurdity of marketing this as a jobs program, \nlet's get to the core issue. The core issue is this: Moving some of the \nworst terrorists on Earth to U.S. soil on its face is more dangerous \nthan leaving them where they are. Nobody could argue with that. Make no \nmistake, this decision, if implemented, will increase the threat to \nsecurity at home. Let's count the ways in which it increases the \nthreats of security in the United States.\n  There will now be another terrorist target in the heartland of \nAmerica--an obvious one at that, right near the Mississippi River.\n  The FBI Director has already stated his concerns about the \nradicalization of other prisoners that could happen by moving \nterrorists here.\n  There is also the danger of detainees communicating with terrorists \non the outside, as has happened in the past--a danger that would \nundoubtedly increase with the additional legal rights detainees will \nenjoy once they are moved into the United States.\n  Then there is the danger that the detainees could sue their way to \nfreedom--yes, that the detainees could sue their way to freedom. Before \nthe first detainee has even set foot in the United States, their \nlawyers stand ready to challenge in court the administration's decision \nto incarcerate detainees indefinitely in the United States. By \npurposefully moving detainees here, the administration is making it \neasier for detainees and their lawyers to succeed in doing so.\n  The Supreme Court has repeatedly held that foreign nationals have \nmore rights if they are present on U.S. soil than if they are not. We \nhave already seen the application of this principle. We have seen a \nFederal judge order detainees released into the United States--only to \nbe reversed because the detainees at the time didn't enjoy the \nadvantage of being present in the United States--an advantage the Obama \nadministration intends to confer on them.\n  Then there is the case of the so-called shoe bomber, Richard Reid, \nwho narrowly failed in his effort to blow up a passenger jet in midair. \nAmericans might recall that Reid ended up in a supermax facility in \nColorado. They might not recall what happened next. Not satisfied with \nhis conditions of confinement, Reid sued the government. He said he \nwanted to be placed in less restrictive conditions where he could watch \nTV, order periodicals through the mail, and learn Arabic. He got his \nwish. The Obama administration acceded to Reid's demands. He has been \nplaced in the general prison population, a less restrictive environment \nwhere he can speak to the media and where his visitors and mail will no \nlonger be regularly monitored by the FBI. Is this how we should treat \npeople who attempt to blow up commercial airliners? We will no longer \nhave the FBI routinely monitor their mail? This is an outrage, an \nabsolute outrage. Unfortunately, it is not an isolated case.\n  Just a few years ago, this same supermax allowed terrorist inmates to \ncommunicate with terrorist networks abroad. At the time, our Democratic \ncolleagues criticized these security lapses harshly. The senior Senator \nfrom New York said Federal prison officials were ``incompetent when it \ncomes to detecting possible terrorist activity in Federal prisons.'' He \nnoted ``past evidence of terrorists communicating with live terror \ncells from inside prison walls.'' That was the senior Senator from New \nYork.\n  Our Democratic colleagues now raise concerns about similar potential \nlapses at the proposed ``Gitmo North.''\n  This decision is ill-advised on multiple levels. It is also \nprohibited by law. Fortunately, if and when the Obama administration \nsubmits its plan for closing Guantanamo, Congress will have an \nopportunity to revisit the prohibition in current law that bars the \ntransfer into the United States of Guantanamo detainees for the \npurposes of indefinite detention. That is against the law. At that \npoint, we will decide whether this prohibition ought to be removed and \nwhether millions of dollars ought to be appropriated to make this ill-\nadvised decision a reality.\n  In short, Congress will have a chance to vote on whether we should \ntreat the national security needs of the country as just another local \njobs project. I suspect the American people will be no more supportive \nof this idea than they were of the administration's plan to close \nGuantanamo by an arbitrary date. Security can't take a backseat to \nsymbolism, and it certainly should not take a backseat to some \nparochial jobs program.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/16/senate-section/article/S13280-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13280]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume consideration of H.R. 3590, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 3590) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 to modify the first-time homebuyers credit in the case \n     of members of the Armed Forces and certain other Federal \n     employees, and for other purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid amendment No. 2786, in the nature of a substitute.\n       Hutchison motion to commit the bill to the Committee on \n     Finance, with instructions.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the first hour will\n\n[[Page S13281]]\n\nbe equally divided and controlled between the two leaders or their \ndesignees, with the minority controlling the first half and the \nmajority controlling the second half.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Under current law, the estate tax disappears next year--\nin 16 days--but snaps back to a 55-percent rate the year after. I \nbelieve that is not sound policy. The estate tax should not be zero in \n1 year and then be snapped up to a very high rate in the subsequent \nyear. As the Chair knows, current law has the rate slowly declining and \nthe exemption slowly increasing. The individual exemption now is $3.5 \nmillion. If Congress takes no action, then beginning on January 1 of \nnext year, that could be zero. The estate tax could be zero.\n  But another consequence that will occur too is that all heirs of the \nestate will find that the property they receive will be subject to a \ncarryover basis. Currently, today, property received by heirs is \nsubject to a step-up basis. They get the new basis and the value of the \nestate as of the date of the decedent's death. If this law expires, \nthere would be no estate tax paid next year on any estate, but also the \nheirs will no longer have a step-up basis on the assets they receive.\n  There are several problems with letting the current law expire next \nyear. One is the yo-yo effect. It is an outrage if Congress allows \nestate taxes to change so much, particularly near the end, that is, a \nlower rate this year with an expiration to a zero rate next year, and \nalso changing a step-up to a carryover basis, and the following year up \nat a much higher rate.\n  The second problem, frankly, is I do think there should be an estate \ntax on the highest value estates. I think that is good policy.\n  Third, people don't talk much about this, but I think we should focus \non it. If current law expires, every heir will be subject, as I said, \nto a carryover basis in determining his or her taxes when that \ntaxpayer, the heir, at a later date sells the property and has to pay \ncapital gains. What are the problems with that? First of all, massive \nrecord-keeping confusion--massive.\n  Soon, I am going to propose an extension in the current law. If that \nis not passed and if we do not extend the estate tax law, all \ntaxpayers, all heirs, will be subject to massive confusion in trying to \ndetermine the value of the underlying assets when they later try to \nsell. The value of the step-up basis to the heir obviously is a lower \ncapital gains tax, but there is also certainty. People pretty much know \nthe value at the death of the decedent.\n  I cannot emphasize strongly enough how much confusion there will be \non January 1, if my consent is not agreed to. There will be such \nconfusion because of the heirs receiving property subject to a \ncarryover basis, not a step-up basis, let alone the capital gains tax \nthey will have to pay when they sell that capital asset at a subsequent \ndate. Currently, when the heir receives that capital asset, because it \nis a step-up basis, there is much less capital gain paid, presumably, \nby that heir who sells the asset.\n  Here it is mid-December. The only responsible thing to do to \nprevent the yo-yo effect--how in the world can people look at planning \nin their estates if the law goes up and down and changes all the time? \nIt has kind of leveled off, as I said, at the 2009 rates and people \nhave a pretty good idea what those are. Some in this body would like to \nsee the rate go lower and exemptions go higher. Some in this body would \nlike to see other changes. We kind of leveled off at 2009 estate tax \nlaws, where the rates are set and the exemptions are set. Most people \nin the country are anticipating Congress will eventually pass that.\n\n  It would be irresponsible to further the yo-yo effect by allowing \ncurrent law to expire and create all this massive confusion, this chaos \nthat will apply to heirs of the estates on January 1 because of this \nchange in capital assets from step-up to a carryover basis, among other \nthings.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4154\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 4154, which was just received from the \nHouse and is at the desk; that the Baucus substitute be considered and \nagreed to, the bill, as amended, be read the third time and passed, the \nmotion to reconsider be laid upon the table; that any statements \nrelating to the measure be printed in the Record without any further \naction or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, there is \nnothing more outrageous to the American people than the thought that \nthey will have to visit both the IRS and the undertaker on the same \nday.\n  Surveys indicate that Americans, even after informed that estate tax \nmay not apply to them, object to it in principle.\n  I am going to ask that the chairman of the Finance Committee modify \nhis request in the following way:\n  That there be an amendment considered that reflects a permanent, \nportable, and unified $5 million exemption that is indexed for \ninflation, and a 35-percent top rate; and further, that the amendment \nbe agreed to, the bill then be read the third time and passed, with the \nmotion to reconsider laid upon the table.\n  Before the Chair rules, I want to acknowledge my good friend Senator \nKyl, the Republican whip, who has been our leader on this side of the \nissue. He has crafted a proposal, along with the leader on this on the \nother side, Senator Lincoln of Arkansas, that is consistent with the \nconsent agreement and with the modification I am now asking the \nchairman of the Finance Committee to make. This approach would provide \ncertainty and clarity to all taxpayers, especially small businesses and \nfarmers; whereas the UC propounded by the chairman would only create \nadditional confusion, with three different rates coming into effect in \nthe course of a 12-month period.\n  Summing it up, I ask that my friend from Montana modify the agreement \nin the way I described.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I don't think this is the way to do \nbusiness here; that is, to enact estate tax law here on the floor of \nthe Senate without any notice, and also because there are so many \nconsiderations Senators on both sides want to look at. It would be \nimproper. I object.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the Senator from New \nMexico.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, let me speak in support of what Senator \nBaucus, the Senator from Montana, attempted to do just now--to get a \nshort-term extension of current law with regard to the estate tax, so \nwe would have a $3.5 million exemption from the estate tax into next \nyear for a short period, while we actually settle on what type of \npermanent change in estate tax law is appropriate.\n  As the Senator from Montana pointed out, the circumstance we find \nourselves in right now, given the current state of the law, is \nuntenable and irresponsible. What the current status is that if a \nperson dies in the next 16 days, if their estate exceeds $3.5 million, \nthey will be subject to an estate tax, and a couple whose estate--when \nthe second member of the estate dies and their estate would exceed $7 \nmillion, they would be subject to an estate tax.\n  After the next 16 days, beginning on January 1 of next year, we have \nno estate tax under the law as it now exists. But at the end of next \nyear--or the beginning of 2011--the estate tax comes back at a 55-\npercent rate.\n  That is not a reasonable set of circumstances for the American public \nto have to face. Not only is it a 55-percent rate that comes back on \nJanuary 1, 2011, the exemption--the amount that is exempt from the \nestate tax--is reduced to $1 million. That is, obviously, adverse to \nmany families in this country.\n  What has happened on the Senate floor is that the Senator from \nMontana has said let's do a short-term extension of the current estate \ntax provisions for a few months and get a resolution of what should be \ndone on a permanent basis. The Republican leader has said: No; here is \na permanent solution. Take this permanent solution or we object.\n  That is not a responsible way for this body to proceed, in my \nopinion. I do\n\n[[Page S13282]]\n\nthink this issue that both Senator Reid and Senator Baucus have spoken \nabout of this problem with a stepped-up basis going away for inherited \nassets is a very real problem. It is arcane, I understand that. It \nsounds like accounting speak. But it is a very real problem for \nAmerican families when they inherit property in the future to have to \ntake the value for purposes of paying capital gains tax. If that \nproperty is ever sold, they will have to go back and try to determine \nwhat was the basis that their parent or the person from whom they \ninherited the property had in that property. It is a bookkeeping \nnightmare and will create great confusion for American families.\n  Clearly, the right course is for us to do a short-term extension of \nthe current estate tax provisions and then get agreement between the \ntwo parties as to what a long-term solution could be in the next couple \nof months.\n  That course, evidently, is being blocked. The request was made \nyesterday, I understand, by Senator Pryor to have a short-term \nextension. The Republican leaders objected to that request. The same \nobjection has been raised to the request by Senator Baucus today.\n  I do think this is an unfortunate circumstance. It is a great \ndisappointment to me to see us doing business in this fashion. I know \nthere are many who think there should be no estate tax. I do not agree \nwith that perspective. The estate tax in my State--I went back and got \nthe IRS figures. There were 80 individuals in the year 2008 who wound \nup having to pay some estate tax, whose estates had to pay some estate \ntax in the State of New Mexico. It does not apply to most individuals.\n  I do believe it is appropriate that there be an estate tax for large \nestates. I do believe we should have a consistent policy, and it should \nnot be something that is here today, gone tomorrow, and back again in a \nmuch worse form at the beginning of January 2011. That is the course we \nare on today. I think it is very unfortunate.\n  Again, I strongly support what the Senator from Montana was trying to \naccomplish with his unanimous consent request.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kyl \nbe permitted to speak for up to 5 minutes and that following his \nremarks, the hour of controlled time on the health care legislation \nbegin.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the argument that the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee made reminds me of a story told in law school of the fellow \naccused of murdering his parents. He pled for mercy on the court since \nhe was an orphan.\n  I asked the chairman of the committee numerous times this year to \naddress this problem, and the response always was: We are too busy. We \nare too busy with health care was the usual response. Now we find \nourselves at the end of the year, and it is odd that the chairman \nargues that we have a big emergency on our hands and we have to act.\n  It is not as if we have not known this issue was out there. Nor, as \nSenator Bingaman just suggested, has it been a big mystery that the \nrate on the estate tax was going to go to zero next year. That is the \n2001 law. We have known that for years.\n  Frankly, people have applauded the fact there is not going to be an \nestate tax next year. The only problem is if the people on the other \nside of the aisle intend to repeal that law so we do have an estate \ntax. I know that is their intention. They are creating the confusion \nbecause the law has been known about for 10 years that we are going to \nhave a zero rate. Now all of a sudden they say we cannot let that \nhappen. We are going to have to change it next year. Since we think we \nmay be able to do that, we should extend what we have right now and not \nlet the zero rate take hold.\n  I suspect the great dilemma that is being posed is one most folks \nwould love to have as a problem. The dilemma being proposed is that if \nthe rate goes to zero and the heirs of the property decide to sell the \nproperty at some point, they will have to pay a capital gains tax. That \nis just fine. That is what most people would like to do.\n  Since this income is taxed twice--it is taxed once when you make the \nincome, then it is taxed again if you have any of that left over when \nyou die--that is unfair. What we have always argued is that the estate \ntax, therefore, should go away and just leave the existing Tax Code \nwhere it is, which says: If somebody inherits property and later sells \nthat property, sure, they should pay a capital gains tax on it. I would \nthink most people would think that is a pretty good deal.\n  The capital gains tax is 15 percent; whereas the estate tax under the \nproposals of my friend from Montana would go to 45 percent. As between \npaying 45 percent and 15 percent, I think it is pretty clear what most \nsmall business folks and farmers would like to do.\n  Of course, the original basis of the property is the basis for paying \nthe tax. Again, if you put that question to small business folks or \nfarmers, they would tell you they would rather pay the capital gains \ntax than they would an estate tax of 45 percent.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks an editorial from the Wall Street \nJournal from December 11 called, ``The Tax That Won't Die, Death Blow, \nNight of the Living Death Tax, Estates of Pain.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, among the things pointed out in this \neditorial, they say:\n\n       We've long argued that the economically optimal and fairest \n     death tax rate is zero. The tax is applied to income that was \n     already taxed when it was earned, so it is a double tax on \n     savings and capital. The correct way to tax a gain in the \n     value of assets bequeathed to an heir is with a capital gains \n     tax of 15 percent when the assets are sold, rather than at \n     the time of the funeral of the original owner.\n\n  I think that says it all. I hope the problem my friends are so \nconcerned about--first of all, they recognize a problem they themselves \nmanufactured by not getting around to doing anything about this until \nthe eleventh hour. Second, it is a problem that does not have to exist \nif they will leave the existing law alone and let the rate go to zero, \nwhich is what everybody wants it to be.\n  Sure enough, if your heirs sell property after that, they will have \nto pay capital gains. Ask them what they would rather do--pay a 15-\npercent rate or a 45-percent rate. I think the answer to that is pretty \nclear.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 11, 2009]\n\n                         The Tax That Won't Die\n\n       Well, the moment of truth has arrived, and House Democrats \n     recently voted 234-199 to cancel the 2010 repeal and hold the \n     rate permanently at 45% with a $3.5 million exemption. Senate \n     Majority Leader Harry Reid now wants to do the same. But to \n     suspend the Senate's health-care debate and turn to the \n     estate tax, he needs 60 votes. All Republicans and some \n     Democrats are saying no. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas and Jon \n     Kyl of Arizona will accept no more than a 35% permanent rate \n     with a $5 million exemption.\n       We've long argued that the economically optimal and fairest \n     death tax rate is zero. The tax is applied to income that was \n     already taxed when it was earned, so it is a double tax on \n     savings and capital. The correct way to tax a gain in the \n     value of assets bequeathed to an heir is with a capital gains \n     tax of 15% when the assets are sold, rather than at the time \n     of the funeral of the original owner.\n       Study after study, including one co-authored years ago by \n     White House economist Larry Summers, finds that a powerful \n     motivation for entrepreneurs to grow their businesses is to \n     pass that legacy to their children. The left disparages this \n     as building ``family dynasties,'' but most Americans think \n     that it is immoral for the government to confiscate the \n     fruits of a life's effort merely because of the fact of \n     death.\n       Democrats also say their rate would apply only to the \n     richest 2% of estates. But a new study by economists Antony \n     Davies and Pavel Yakovel of Duquesne University finds that \n     the estate tax ``impacts small firms disproportionately \n     versus large firms'' by encouraging well-capitalized \n     companies to gobble up smaller ones at the owner's death. The \n     study shows the result is to ``promote the concentration of \n     wealth by preventing small businesses from being passed on to \n     heirs.''\n       Republicans and willing Democrats shouldn't give up on \n     eliminating the death\n\n[[Page S13283]]\n\n     tax. The Kyl-Lincoln amendment to create a permanent 35% rate \n     is far better than the confiscatory House bill. But the best \n     strategic outcome now is to let the death tax expire in \n     January as scheduled under current law, and return to this \n     debate next year when the tax rate is zero. Then let liberal \n     Democrats explain to voters on the eve of elections that they \n     must restore one of the most despised of all taxes.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, clearly, the right public policy is to \nachieve continuity with respect to the estate tax. If we do not get the \nestate tax extended, even for a very short period of time, say, 3 \nmonths, we would clearly work to do this retroactively so when the law \nis changed, however it is changed, or if it is extended next year, it \nwill have retroactive application.\n  The uncertainty for tens of thousands of middle-class families needs \nto stop. That is why retroactive application of anything that passes \nnext year makes sense.\n  Right now, 99.7 percent of estates do not have to worry about the \nestate tax. If we do not extend current law, many heirs are going to \nhave to worry about capital gains. There is the potential for high-\nincome households to take advantage of the temporary reductions in the \nrates for gift taxes and temporary elimination of GST to do massive \nestate planning--potentially benefiting those households by billions of \ndollars at the expense of U.S. taxpayers. Beyond this, what Congress is \ndoing is a huge benefit for lawyers and accountants who do all the \nestate planning.\n  The right thing to do is to extend current law for a brief period of \ntime to get our act together to decide what estate laws should be. That \nis the right thing to do. I am very disappointed that the other side of \nthe aisle does not let us do the right thing--at least extend current \nlaw for a while until we know what the estate tax law should be.\n  Mr. COBURN addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana has the floor.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, for the benefit of Senators, we are now \nback on the health care bill. Let me lay out today's program.\n  It has been nearly 4 weeks since the majority leader moved to proceed \nto the health care reform bill. This is the 16th day that the Senate \nhas considered the bill.\n  The Senate has considered 23 amendments or motions and conducted 18 \nrollcall votes.\n  Today the Senate will debate the motion to commit regarding taxes \noffered last night by the Senator from Texas, Mrs. Hutchison. Under the \nprevious order, later this morning, we expect that the Senator from \nVermont, Mr. Sanders, will offer his amendment No. 2837 on a national \nsingle-payer system.\n  This morning, the first hour of debate will be equally divided and \ncontrolled between the two leaders or their designees. The majority \nwill control the first half hour and the Republicans will control the \nsecond half hour.\n  We expect the Senate to conduct votes today in relation to the \nHutchison motion and the Sanders amendment.\n  Also, today, the House of Representatives is scheduled to act on the \nDepartment of Defense Appropriations Act which also contains a number \nof vital year-end measures. We look forward to receiving that measure \nin the Senate as well.\n  I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from Ohio and then 15 minutes to \nthe Senator from Delaware.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I thank Senator Baucus for yielding, and I \nthank Senator Kaufman also for him yielding.\n  Less than 5 percent of cancer patients enroll in clinical trials. \nOnly 6 percent of people who suffer from severe chronic illnesses \nparticipate. These low participation rates mean it is harder to conduct \na timely trial. In fact, delays in patient recruitment for clinical \ntrials account for an average of almost 5 months lost per trial. Nearly \n80 percent of trials run over schedule by more than a month. Only 6 \npercent are completed on time.\n  Clinical trial delays lead to treatment development delays, whether \nit is the next breakthrough drug or some other lifesaving therapy. \nWithout clinical trials, medical innovation would come to a halt.\n  Unfortunately, one major reason more patients do not enroll in \nclinical trials is that their insurance company coverage discourages \nit.\n  Insurers today take advantage of lax regulations that allow them to \ndeem all care for a person in a clinical trial as ``experimental''--\neven routine services they would get if they were not in the trial, \nsuch as x rays, blood tests, and doctor visits.\n  This draconian policy predictably scares many patients away from \npotentially lifesaving trials. Patients simply cannot afford to pay out \nof pocket for all of their own care. Understand, they do not expect the \ninsurance company to pay for the trial itself. No one is suggesting \nthat. No one thinks that. But insurers should not be allowed to use a \npatient's participation in a clinical trial as an excuse to deny them \ncoverage for standard care.\n  To address this problem, Senator Hutchison of Texas and I have filed \namendment No. 2871. This amendment would require all insurance \ncompanies to simply live up to the promises they have made to their \npremium-paying policyholders. It means covering the cost of routine \ncare for clinical trial participants.\n  More than 30 States have already enacted a similar clinical trials \npolicy for their State-regulated insurance plans. Medicare has already \nenacted a similar clinical trials policy for its beneficiaries. The VA \nand DOD have already enacted similar clinical trials policies for their \nmembers. Even some insurance companies are already doing the right \nthing in covering the routine costs associated with clinical trials.\n  But because many are not and because there is no standard criterion \nby which appeals can be adjudicated, countless patients who would \notherwise enroll in clinical trials do not.\n  Take, for example, Sheryl Freeman from Dayton, OH. Sheryl and her \nhusband Craig visited my office in Washington in 2007. Sheryl was a \nretired teacher suffering from multiple myeloma. Thankfully, she had \nhealth insurance through her husband's employer. Yet when Sheryl tried \nto enroll in a promising clinical trial at James Cancer Hospital at \nOhio State, her insurance company balked, refusing to cover the routine \ncare costs.\n  Understand this: She had insurance, she had good insurance--she \nthought she had good insurance. She enrolled in a clinical trial paid \nfor by the people doing the clinical trials--the hospital, the drug \ncompany, whomever. But the insurance company pulled back and said: We \nare not going to cover routine care for her anymore since she is in a \nclinical trial, something she was entitled to with or without the \nclinical trial. Regardless of whether or not Sheryl enrolled in a \nclinical trial, she still needed to visit her oncologist in Dayton once \na week for standard cancer monitoring, including scans and blood tests. \nBut her insurance company would stop covering these services if she \nenrolled in the clinical trial.\n  Sheryl wanted to enroll in a clinical trial because she hoped it \nwould save her life. She hoped it would give her more time with her \nloved ones. She hoped it would help future patients diagnosed with the \nsame type of cancer, but she was not willing to force her family into \nbankruptcy. So instead of devoting her energy toward combating cancer, \nSheryl spent the last months of her life haggling with the insurance \ncompany. By the time her insurance company relented, it was too late. \nSheryl died December 7, 2007.\n\n  Sheryl's husband Craig, with whom I have spoken a couple of times and \nmet with, wrote the following about the ordeal:\n\n       No patient should have to fight insurance when battling a \n     disease such as cancer.\n\n  How many times have we heard that in this Chamber? Tragically, \nSheryl's experience is not an isolated case.\n  In Ohio--my State--one cancer hospital has reported that over one-\nthird of patients who tried to enroll in a clinical trial over a 6-\nmonth period were automatically denied access by their insurance \ncompany. Again, I understand how that happens. You have decent \ninsurance, you think. Then you decide to enroll in a clinical trial \nthat your doctor suggests. The insurance company then quits covering \nyou for the things it used to cover you for--the routine care you need \nas a patient.\n\n[[Page S13284]]\n\n  Take Gene Bayman. I met and talked to Gene--a courageous man who \nloved his family. His family was so fond of him, as you could see, when \nI saw him in Columbus with his family. He was diagnosed in February \n2007 with multiple myeloma. Gene's doctor recommended a combination of \nstandard treatment and clinical drugs, but Gene's insurance company \nthreatened to stop paying for the routine care otherwise covered under \nthe policy if he enrolled in the clinical trial.\n  If that is not rationing, Mr. President, I don't know what is.\n  Gene died in June of this year, never having the chance to \nparticipate in the cutting-edge research that might have saved his \nlife. Gene wrote, before he died:\n\n       I don't want my health options limited by insurance \n     companies concerned with the bottom line rather than the \n     medical research my doctor prescribes.\n\n  Mark Runion, also from Ohio, faced the same barrier. Mark was being \ntreated for multiple myeloma with standard care--a stem cell transplant \nand chemotherapy. His doctor recommended he enroll in a clinical trial \nto try out a new drug that might help him recover quickly. The \ninsurance company refused to comply, telling Mark if he were to enroll \nin the clinical trial they wouldn't pay for any of his cancer care. \nAnother terrible lost opportunity. The clinical trial would have helped \nus learn more about which drugs we should administer to patients after \nstem cell transplants. In other words, while this most directly, most \ntragically, most painfully affected Mark Runion and his family, it also \naffects all of us who have loved ones or who might ourselves come down \nwith this disease. The clinical trial that Mark wanted to enroll in \nwould have given him an opportunity and would have given all of us more \nscientific knowledge and information that would have been helpful.\n  Instead, the insurance company took a shortsighted view and denied \nMark the recommended care. Mark writes:\n\n       I personally would rather make my medical decisions with my \n     doctor--the expert in my care--rather than my insurer.\n\n  These stories should have ended differently. Sheryl, Gene, and Mark \nall paid premiums to health insurance for years. But when they got sick \nand were referred to a clinical trial, the insurance company refused to \npay for the benefits guaranteed under its policy.\n  Health insurance reform should be about making sure insurance \ncompanies can't renege on their commitments. It is about ensuring that \ninsurance companies can't write sham policies that allow for \nrescissions and riders and exceptions and bring about more horror \nstories than we all care to recount. It is about closing loopholes that \nhealth insurance companies are great at taking advantage of, and as \nsome say, staying one step ahead of the sheriff.\n  This amendment is consistent with those goals. It would help advance \nimportant research in the most serious diseases. This is a public \nhealth issue for all of us.\n  In closing, if we are ever going to find a cure for cancer and \ndiabetes and cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's and ALS and the \nhundreds of other diseases killing millions of Americans each year, we \nneed to encourage in every way possible participation in clinical \ntrials and not put up barriers against participation.\n  This amendment is endorsed by the Lance Armstrong Foundation, the \nAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, the Susan G. Komen for the Cure \nAdvocacy Alliance, the American Cancer Society, the Alzheimer's \nFoundation of American, and dozens of other national organizations.\n  Along with Senator Hutchison, this bipartisan amendment is also \nsponsored by Senators Franken, Whitehouse, Sanders, Specter, and \nCardin. Please join us in supporting amendment No. 2871.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kirk). The Senator from Delaware is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business for up to 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Financial Markets and Job Loss\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, my colleagues have heard me speak in \nrecent weeks about the troubling trends in our financial markets--the \ngrowing use of dark pools and high-frequency trading, increasing market \nfragmentation and looming regulatory gaps at the Securities and \nExchange Commission. Today, I want to talk about an economic threat \nthat encompasses these developments and why I think they are negatively \naffecting the long-term health of our economy.\n  After suffering through the most severe recession in decades, we are \nnow in the midst of the most fragile of recoveries. It is evident to \nall that we are in a jobs crisis. We need a laser-like focus on \ninnovation policies that encourage industry to create jobs. But this \nchallenge comes not just from the financial crisis and the recession \nthat followed, the American economy has slowed in its efforts to create \njobs for the past decade.\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the United States had \n108.5 million private, nongovernmental jobs as of September of this \nyear. But while our population has grown 9 percent in the last 9 years, \nthe number of jobs now available is essentially the same as June of \n1999.\n  Let me repeat that: The number of jobs now available is essentially \nthe same as June of 1999--over 10 years ago.\n  Many of the jobs this economy did create in the past decade were in \nthe financial, housing, and consumer-led retail sectors. Two of those--\nfinancial and housing--were bubbles that have now burst. Without these \nsectors playing a key role in providing new jobs, many Americans are \nasking: Where will the future job creation most likely occur?\n  In the past, job creation would often come from the raft of small, \nnewly financed, often innovative companies that raised their capital \nwith the help of Wall Street underwriters. Thousands of times I have \nheard in the last months that the recovery is going to come because of \nsmall businesses, and many of those raise their capital with the help \nof Wall Street underwriters.\n  Now I am deeply concerned there is a choke point in our efforts to \nreturn to economic vibrancy, a choke point that can be found on Wall \nStreet. Our capital markets, which have long been the envy of the \nworld, are no longer performing one of their most essential functions; \nthat is, the constant and reliable channeling of capital through the \npublic sale of company stock, known as initial public offerings--or \nIPOs--which small companies use to innovate and, most importantly, to \ncreate jobs.\n  Look at this chart. There is an IPO crisis in this country. Indeed, \naccording to a report released last month by the accounting firm Grant \nThornton, the IPO market in the United States has practically \ndisappeared. That, in turn, according to a second Grant Thornton study, \nhas had a ripple effect on the U.S. stock markets, with the number of \nstock listings since 1991 dropping 22 percent in absolute terms and 53 \npercent when factoring in inflation-adjusted GDP growth.\n  New companies have been shed from the NASDAQ, New York, and American \nStock Exchanges faster than being created, from almost 7,000 publicly \nlisted companies in 1991 and nearly 8,900 in 1997, during the dot-com \nbubble, to 5,400 listed in 2008, a turn of events Grant Thornton has \ndubbed the ``Great Depression of Listings.''\n  The United States is practically the only market in the world where \nthis phenomenon is occurring. The major stock exchanges--as you can see \nfrom this chart--in Hong Kong, London, Milan, Tokyo, Toronto, Sydney, \nand Frankfurt, have all grown from their 1997 levels, Grant Thornton \nreports. Just look at this chart. This is what is going to take us out \nof the recession. Look at where we are--the United States--in relation \nto Hong Kong, Tokyo, Australia, and the other markets.\n  The effects of the IPO crisis have rippled throughout the U.S. \neconomy. Because 92 percent of job growth occurs after a company goes \npublic, job creation may have been stunted by these developments. In \nfact, according to the Grant Thornton study, if the IPO market was \nworking properly today, we would have as many as 10 million to 20 \nmillion additional high-quality jobs for middle-class Americans. Even \nif that estimate is off by a factor of 10, this failure of Wall Street \nto provide capital to small companies may be costing our economy \nmillions of jobs.\n\n[[Page S13285]]\n\n  Mr. President, most every large company begins as a small company. \nThat is axiomatic. The IPO market has been hit hardest at the smallest \nend of the market. The medium IPO in the first 6 months of 2009 was \n$135 million. Let me say that again--$135 million. Twenty years ago, \nIPOs at $10 million were routine, and routinely succeeded.\n  Take a look at this chart and look at these companies. Venture \ncapitalists play a critical role in long-term investment, in growing \nour economy and creating jobs. Indeed, when you look at these 17 \nventure-backed companies that raised a total of $367 million in capital \nand today provide 470,000 U.S. jobs, they are among our economy's \nbiggest success stories.\n  Look at this list. Think of where we would be today if these \ncompanies were not able to get IPS: Adobe, Computer Associates, Intel, \nOracle, Yahoo. These are all the companies where growth came from. \nRight now, in our present market, they cannot go public the way they \nwent public originally.\n  What has happened? A host of well-intentioned changes--some \ntechnological, some regulatory--with many unintended consequences have \ncreated this situation. Online brokerage firms, with their $25 trades, \nfirst appeared in 1996, hastening the decline of traditional full-\nservice brokerage firms who charge $250 a trade. There was an advantage \nto those hefty fees, however. They helped maintain an underwriting \napparatus that encouraged small businesses to go public and supported a \nsubstantial research base that attracted both institutional and retail \nclients.\n  The rich ecosystem of investment firms, including the Four Horsemen--\nRobertson Stephens, Alex Brown & Sons, Hambrecht & Quist, and \nMontgomery Securities--that helped their institutional buy-side clients \ntake part in IPOs and marketed follow-on offerings, no longer exists \ntoday.\n  Structural changes in the U.S. capital markets dealt the final coup \nde grace. There were new order handling rules--decimalization, which \nshrank spreads significantly and made it increasingly difficult for \ntraditional retail brokers to remain profitable; Regulation ATS and \nNMS, which vastly expanded the electronic marketplace.\n  Finally, there has been an explosive growth in high-frequency \ntrading, which takes advantage of the market's now highly automated \nformat to send more than 1,000 trades a second ricocheting from \ncomputer to computer.\n  The result, as The Economist magazine wrote last week, is that high-\nfrequency traders who have come to dominate stock markets within their \ncomputer-driven strategies pay less attention to small firms, \npreferring to jump in and out of larger, more liquid shares.\n  The economist quoted:\n\n       Institutional investors wary of being stuck in an illiquid \n     of the market are increasingly following them.\n\n  This is a situation that stands as a veritable wall against a \nsustained economic recovery.\n  One of the very vital tasks before Congress is to help unemployed \nAmericans by crafting innovation policies that will rebuild our \neconomy, catalyze growth, and create high-quality jobs for struggling \nAmericans. That is our No. 1 job in the Congress right now. I think if \nyou asked every 1 of the 100 Senators, they would say that is the case.\n  We must identify the causes of last year's debacle and apply them to \nour current economic challenges in order to help the millions of \nstruggling Americans and to avert a future disaster. The fact that Wall \nStreet has resumed its risky and--as we know all too well--potentially \ndisastrous behavior is simply inexcusable.\n  In order to reverse this ominous trend and help companies raise \ncapital to innovate, create jobs, and grow, we must restore the \nfinancial sector's historical role as a facilitator of long-term growth \nand not the source of one bubble after another.\n  The question, finally, is this: How can we create a market structure \nthat works for a $25 million initial public offering, both in the \noffering and the secondary aftermarket? If we can answer that question, \nthis country will be back in business.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask to speak as in morning business for \nup to 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     In Praise of William Phillips\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I rise once again to recognize one of America's great \nfederal employees.\n  Last week, in Stockholm and Oslo, the 2009 Nobel laureates accepted \ntheir prizes. I am particularly proud that 11 of this year's 13 prizes \nwere won by Americans. This is a reminder of our Nation's global \nleadership in science, medicine, economics, and peacemaking.\n  My honoree today holds the distinction of having been the first \nFederal employee to win a Nobel Prize in physics for work performed \nwhile serving the public.\n  Our Federal workforce is composed of citizens who are both highly \neducated and incredibly motivated.\n  Dr. William Phillips is the perfect example. A native Pennsylvanian, \nWilliam learned the importance of public service and hard work from a \nyoung age. His mother, an immigrant from Italy, and his father, a \ndescendent of American revolutionaries, were the first in their \nfamilies to attend college. They both pursued careers as social workers \nin Pennsylvania's coal-mining region. William, along with his brother \nand sister, grew up in a home where reading and education were \nemphasized.\n  As a boy, William fell in love with science, and he tinkered with \nmodel rockets and chemical compounds in the basement of his family's \nhome. While attending Juniata College in the 1960s, William delved into \nphysics research. He spent a semester at Argonne National Laboratory \nand, after graduation, pursued his doctorate at M.I.T.\n  During his time at M.I.T., the field of laser-cooling was just \nheating up, and William wrote his thesis on the collisions of atoms \nusing this new technology.\n  In 1978, William began working at what is today the National \nInstitute for Standards and Technology--or ``NIST''--at the Department \nof Commerce. At NIST, he pursued further research into laser-cooling, \nand his discoveries have helped open up a new field of atomic research \nand expand our knowledge of physics. His findings have found important \napplication in precision time-keeping, which is important for both \nprivate industry and for national security.\n  In 1997, William received the Nobel Prize for Physics along with two \nother scientists. One of his fellow-laureates that year was Dr. Steven \nChu, who now serves as Secretary of Energy.\n  After winning his Nobel Prize, William made a commitment to using his \nfame to promote both science education and public service. He regularly \nspeaks to student groups, and he serves as a mentor to graduate \nstudents in his field.\n  William won the prestigious Arthur S. Flemming Award for Public \nService in 1987, and he was honored by the Partnership for Public \nService with its 2006 Service to America Medal for Career Achievement.\n  He and his wife, Jane, live in Gaithersburg, MD, and are active in \ntheir community and church. Today, after a 3-decade Federal career, \nWilliam continues to work at NIST as the leader of its Laser-Cooling \nand Trapping Group.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Dr. William Phillips \nand all those who work at the National Institute of Standards and \nTechnology for their dedicated service and important contribution to \nour national life. They keep us at the forefront of science and human \ndiscovery. They do us all proud.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n[[Page S13286]]\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, before my colleagues begin, I think it is \nimportant for us to point out where we are here on December 16, 2009. \nWe are now almost a year into the discussion and debate about \n``reforming health care in America'' and we still do not know what is \nin the bill. We still do not know the specifics of what we are \nconsidering here.\n  I have had the honor of serving here for a long period of time, but I \nhave never seen a process like this. I have never seen a situation \nwhere a major piece of legislation is not before the body and is \nsomehow being negotiated and renegotiated amongst the other side. \nMeanwhile, according to the Washington Post this morning, a newspaper I \nalways have the utmost trust and confidence in--I wish to say the title \nis ``Public cooling to health-care reform as debate drags on, poll \nfinds.''\n\n       As the Senate struggles to meet a self-imposed, year-end \n     deadline to complete work on legislation to overhaul the \n     nation's health-care system, a new Washington Post-ABC News \n     poll finds the public generally fearful that a revamped \n     system would bring higher costs while worsening the quality \n     of their care.\n\n  A remarkable commentary about where we are in this legislation. One \nof the interesting things is this poll goes back to April, where in \nApril, 57 percent of the American people approved and 29 disapproved of \nthe President's handling of health care. Today it is 53 disapprove and \n44 approve, which means the American people, the more they find out \nabout this, the less they like it and the more concerned they are. \nAccording to this poll again:\n\n       Medicare is the Government health insurance program for \n     people 65 and older. Do you think health-care reform would \n     strengthen the Medicare program, weaken Medicare or have no \n     effect on it?\n\n  American people have figured it out. Amongst seniors, those who are \nin Medicare, 12 percent say it would strengthen, 22 percent no effect, \nand 57 percent of seniors in America believe--and they are correct--\nthat this proposal would weaken Medicare, the benefit they paid into \nand that they have earned.\n  Let me say it again: I plead with my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle and the majority leader. Let's stop this. The American people \ndo not approve of it. Let's sit down and work together; let's have real \nnegotiations; let's even have the C-SPAN cameras in, as the President \npromised October a year ago. This present legislation spends too much, \ntaxes too much, and reduces benefits for American citizens as far as \noverall health care is concerned, including Medicare, as the American \npeople have figured out.\n  I welcome my colleagues here. I see Dr. Coburn is here. Let me \nrestate: It is time to say stop. It is time to start listening to the \nAmerican people. It is time to start being straightforward with the \nAmerican people because the American people need to know what we are \ndoing and they do not. The distinguished Senator from Illinois, last \nFriday when I asked him what is in the bill, said none of us know what \nis in the bill.\n  I ask my friend from Oklahoma, isn't what is happening--we have a \nproposal, we send it to CBO, CBO sends back numbers they do not like so \nthey try to fix it, send it back to CBO, they send it back again. That \nis why only one Senator, the majority leader, knows what is going on.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What is the parliamentary situation, I ask the President?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I was under the impression there would \nbe a 30-minute allocation for colloquy for our side. I am not sure when \nwe start that process.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican side has 25 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. How many?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 25 minutes 15 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I think I have made my \npoint here. I wish to yield. I ask unanimous consent to have a colloquy \nwith the Senator from South Dakota, the Senator from Texas, the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, and the Senator from Wyoming.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. If I might respond to the question of the Senator, one of \nthe things our President has promised is transparency. We are going to \nsee at sometime in the next week or 10 days another bill--whatever the \ndeal is. It would seem to me that 72 hours with a complete CBO score, \nmuch like was asked by 12 Members on their side, before we have to take \nup or make any maneuvers on that, would be something everybody could \nagree to since nobody knows, except Harry Reid and the CBO, what is in \nthis bill now. At a later time, after we finish this colloquy, I will \nbe making that unanimous consent request.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from Oklahoma. I think it is very \nimportant that before we start talking about passing a bill or having a \ncloture on a bill--I think the Senator from Oklahoma is making the main \npoint. I think the Senator from Oklahoma was making a very good point \nthat I was hoping to work with him on and that is: Where are we now? \nThe Republicans have put forward reform alternatives for our health \ncare system that are not a government takeover and are not going to be \n$\\1/2\\ trillion in taxes and are not going to be $\\1/2\\ trillion in \nMedicare cuts.\n  The Republican proposals would do what health care reform should do--\nthey would lower cost. They would increase risk pools so that small \nbusiness would be able to offer health care coverage for their \nemployees. They would have medical malpractice reform so we would be \nable to lower the cost of frivolous lawsuits, cutting over $50 billion \nout of the costs of health care, making it more accessible for more \npeople. They would give tax credits for individuals who would buy their \nown health care coverage to offset that cost.\n  None of that would be a big government takeover of health care. That \nis what we have been trying to put forward here. But we have not had a \nseat at the table. We have not had the capability to say what our \nproposals would be because we have not even seen the proposed new bill \nyet. We have been talking about the tax increases that are going to \nburden small business at a very hard time for this country's economy \nand we have also been talking about $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts, \nwhich I think has caused many senior citizens to say: Wait a minute, I \ndon't want my Medicare options cut. I don't want Medicare Advantage to \nbe virtually taken away.\n  That is why we are here today, because the pending business before \nthe Senate is the Hutchison-Thune motion to recommit this bill to do a \nsimple thing. It is to say that you will not start collecting the taxes \nuntil the program is in place. It is very simple. It is the American \nsense of fair play, and that is that you do not start collecting taxes \nbefore you have a program that you might want to buy into. That is what \nthe Hutchison-Thune motion to recommit does. It is very simple. It is a \nmatter of fair play. I even question whether we have the right to pass \ntaxes for 4 years before you would ever see a program put in place.\n  We are going to try to do what is right by this body. That is to say, \nthe $100 billion in new taxes that will start next month--3 weeks from \nnow--will not start until there is a program put in place. Because \nright now $100 billion in new taxes starts next month but there is no \nprogram that anyone can sign up for that will supposedly make it easier \nto get health care coverage in this country until 2014, 4 years away.\n  I ask my colleague, the distinguished ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, if he believes all these new taxes would be fair to start \nbefore we could ever see a program--not 1 year from now, not 2, not 3 \nbut 4 years from now. I ask the distinguished ranking member of the \nFinance Committee if he believes it would be fair for us to start the \ntaxes in 3 weeks and then not start the program for 4 years. Does that \nseem like a fair concept?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Casey). The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator is absolutely right. Let me \nemphasize it this way. I was on a radio program in Iowa yesterday, \nwhere a lady called me, and I had been saying, as the Senator has just \nsaid, that you have to wait until 2014 for this program to go into \neffect. She said: You are telling me you are going to pass this bill \nright now, but we have to wait until 2014 until we get any benefit from \nit? She didn't talk about the taxes, as the\n\n[[Page S13287]]\n\nSenator is, but the taxes go into effect. Another smokescreen is, you \nhave 10 years of tax increases, fee increases, and the program is 6 \nyears long, but the taxes are 10 years long. So it is nice for the CBO \nto say: Yes, this is balanced and maybe even has a surplus in it. But \nover the long term, this program does not cost just $848 billion. I \nhope I answered your question.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. You did. It is interesting because you say maybe it \nis going to be break even. How is it going to break even? I ask my \ncolleague from South Dakota, who is a cosponsor of this motion: How is \nit going to break even? With $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts, $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion in tax increases, is that the way we ought to be saying to the \nAmerican people we will reform health care? Have we lost the purpose of \nthe bill, to make health care more affordable and accessible to the \nAmerican people? I ask my colleague, the Senator from South Dakota, who \nhas worked on this issue for a long time, is that the concept of break \neven?\n  Mr. THUNE. The Senator from Texas has touched on a very important \nissue. The motion she offers, and which I cosponsor, does lay out what \nis a simple principle of fairness that most Americans understand. When \nyou implement public policy, if you are going to raise taxes, you ought \nto align the tax increases and the benefits so they start at \nessentially the same time. What this bill does is it starts collecting \ntaxes, increases taxes on Americans 4 years before the major benefit \nprovisions kick in. On January 1 of 2014, 99 percent of the spending \nunder the bill kicks in. But the tax increases begin less than 3 weeks \nfrom today. Sixteen days from now is when the tax increases in the bill \nstart. A tax on prescription drugs, a tax on medical devices, a tax on \nhealth plans--all begin 16 days from now. A lot of those taxes will be \nimposed upon the American economy and passed on to people and small \nbusinesses in the form of higher premiums. People are going to get \nhigher premiums 4 years before they are likely to see any benefit. \nNinety-nine percent of the spending under the bill doesn't kick in \nuntil January 1, 2014, or 1,477 days from now. Most Americans, as they \nlisten to the debate, believe as I do, as a simple principle of \nfairness, you ought to align the benefits and the taxes. We had a vote \nyesterday on the Crapo motion that would recommit all the tax \nincreases. Many of us believe raising taxes on small businesses when \nyou have an economy in recession is not a smart thing to do; it is \ngoing to cost us a lot of jobs. Small businesses have made that clear. \nI also think, in addition to the principle of fairness that is at play, \nwhen it comes to raising taxes 4 years prior to the benefits kicking \nin, you also need to have a transparent sort of understanding about \nwhat the cost of the bill is going to be.\n  One of the reasons the revenue increases, the tax increases were \nbegun immediately or 16 days from now, but the majority of the \nspending, 99 percent, doesn't occur until January 1 of 2014 and beyond \nis to understate the true cost. They wanted to bring the cost of the \nbill in under $1 trillion.\n  If you can see, starting this year and going through 2019, it ends up \nat about $1 trillion or $1.2 trillion on this chart. But if you look at \nthe fully implemented period; that is, 2014, when the benefits and \nspending begin, and take that through the next 10 years, the total \nspending in the bill is $2.5 trillion over a 10-year period.\n  That is one thing the American people need to know. One of the \nreasons this is being done, tax increases starting January 1 next year \nor 16 days from now, most of the benefits not starting until 1,477 days \nfrom now, is so they can say this is only a $1 trillion bill or under \n$1 trillion, the way it has been advertised, when, in fact, it is going \nto cost $2.5 trillion when fully implemented.\n  We are here 16 days before the Christmas holiday, and there are \nthings Congress needs to do. There are a number of fairly urgent \nmatters that need to be dealt with before the end of the year, some of \nwhich have been mentioned this morning. But trying to jam through a new \nhealth care program, a $2.5 trillion expansion of the Federal \nGovernment in Washington, 70 new government programs, trying to jam it \nthrough in the next 9 days or so before Christmas seems to be done more \nout of a political necessity, the need for a political accomplishment \nor a political victory, than it does with making good public policy. As \nthe American people are approaching this holiday season, the best thing \nwe can do, the best Christmas gift we could give the people, frankly, \nis for Congress to adjourn and go home before passing this $2.5 \ntrillion expansion.\n  What does it mean? If you are a small businessperson, the Christmas \ngift you get this year is a big lump of coal from the Congress in the \nform of higher taxes. If you are a senior citizen, 1 of the 11 million \nwho are on Medicare Advantage and this bill passes, your Christmas gift \nthis year is benefit cuts. The same thing applies to many of our \nproviders--hospitals, nursing homes, home health agencies, hospices. If \nyou are an average American family who is worried about the high cost \nof health care, your Christmas gift this year is, if this bill passes, \nthat your health insurance premiums will continue to go up year over \nyear at twice the rate of inflation. You lock in higher premiums for \nmost people across the country, you raise taxes on small businesses, \nyou cut benefits to Medicare beneficiaries and, for future generations, \nyou create a $2.5 trillion new entitlement program they will be paying \nfor, for as far as the eye can see.\n  The CMS Actuary, last week, said, in addition to all the other things \nthey mentioned--the overall cost of health care is going to go up, 20 \npercent of hospitals will close--that the Medicare cuts that are being \nproposed cannot be sustained on a permanent basis. If that is true, how \nwill this be financed? Either with more taxes or borrowing, putting it \non the debt and handing the bill to future generations. That is what we \nare left with. Once you lock in a $2.5 trillion expansion of the \nFederal Government, it is going to be hard to reduce the cost. The \nspending is not going to go away. The way it will be paid for, if the \nMedicare cuts are not sustainable, is the tax increases. The increases \nthat are already in here would have to be increased even further or, \nworse yet, for future generations, if you are a young American, it will \nbe put on your bill.\n  The Senator from Texas and my colleagues who are here this morning \nall voted yesterday to get rid of the tax increases in the bill. But \nthe motion she offers and that I cosponsor would at least, as a \nprinciple of fairness, make sure those tax increases don't begin before \nthe benefits do.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, the 2 physicians out of the 100 \nMembers of Senate are here this morning. They have talked for a long \ntime about the quality of care. They are the two who have the \ncredibility on this. I would like to ask the Senator from Wyoming, Dr. \nBarrasso, to talk about what is going to happen to the quality of \nhealth care when you have $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts, which we \nhave discussed, and the bill we are discussing today and the motion \nSenator Thune and I are offering, that is going to put a higher cost on \nevery prescription drug, every piece of medical equipment. Perhaps you \nwould expand on what kind of medical equipment is needed for people to \nhave the quality of life we have in our country today and then the \ninsurance companies, which are, of course, going to raise the premium \nof every person who already has coverage.\n  I ask the Senator from Wyoming, Dr. Barrasso, in your experience, how \nis this going to affect the quality of health care?\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I am grateful to the Senator for bringing this up. I \nhad a telephone townhall meeting last night, and this specific motion \nthe Senator is bringing today came up with great praise from the people \nof Wyoming who said: She is doing it right, leading the good fight. \nAfter I answer the question, I will ask: How do we know the money is \neven going to be there? That is the question that came up in my \ntelephone townhall. People of Wyoming are concerned, if this passes, it \nwill make health care harder for people in rural States, such as \nWyoming and Montana. My colleague from Montana is on the floor. The \ndoctor shortage will worsen. This is the headline on the front page by \nthe Wyoming Tribune Eagle: ``Doctor Shortage Will Worsen.'' There is a \nlot of concern for the folks in Wyoming and communities where there is \na sole\n\n[[Page S13288]]\n\nhospital, a sole physician provider trying to recruit nurses and \nphysician assistants and nurse practitioners. The doctor shortage will \nworsen as we see a situation where they will be cutting Medicare $500 \nbillion, raising taxes $500 billion, and people who had insurance on \nthis telephone townhall were very concerned that their insurance \npremiums are going to go up, in spite of the fact that the President \nhas promised families would see insurance rates go down. We know those \nrates are going to go way up for people who buy their own insurance. \nPeople say: Don't cut Medicare, don't raise taxes, don't make matters \nworse than they are right now. For the people of Wyoming, they are \nafraid that matters will be made worse.\n  The Washington Post had a major poll in the paper today specifically \nasking seniors the question about Medicare. We are talking about health \ncare quality, the quality of care. The question is: Do you think health \ncare reform will strengthen the Medicare Program or weaken the Medicare \nProgram? They asked specifically and broke it down to seniors. Only 1 \nout of 8 seniors in this poll said it actually would get better. But \nthe rest are saying: No, it is going to get worse. The seniors who \nwatch this most carefully know what it means to try to get health care \nunder the Medicare Program, a program that we know is going broke. Yet \nthey are taking all this money not to save Medicare but to start a new \nprogram. We know the quality of care is going to go down. That is what \nthe people of my home State and the people I talked to from around the \ncountry are concerned about. They are delighted the Senator offered \nthis motion.\n  I did a poll in the townhall meeting: Are you for or against the \nbill? Some of them say: What is in it? We don't know. Which is exactly \nwhat the junior Senator, a Democrat from Indiana, said in today's \nnational press release: We are all being urged to vote for something, \nand we don't know the details of what is in it. The junior Senator from \nIndiana is a Democrat. He doesn't know what is in it. The people of \nWyoming don't know what is in it. But they do know taxes start \nimmediately, benefits not for 4 years. That is why they are happy you \noffered this motion. They want to know: How do we know the money will \nbe there 4 years from now?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is a very important question. Here we are going \nto start collecting the taxes for 4 years before the program is put in \nplace. The distinguished Senator from Oklahoma, the other physician in \nthis body, knows we have had promises from the Federal Government \nbefore. But I can't remember a time when we started collecting a tax \nfor a purpose that would be 4 years away. What on Earth could people \nexpect to actually be there when the program kicks in?\n  The program is going to have to be implemented. It is going to have \nto be brought up to speed. I am sure there will be changes. What would \nyou think your patients whom you still care for in Oklahoma or the \nones, in the experience you have had, how do you think people are going \nto react to having higher costs in all these areas of health care for 4 \nyears, even a tax on the high-income plans, not high-income people \nhaving those plans but high coverage that a union member might have \nthat will start being taxed in 2013, 1 year before the program takes \neffect?\n  How do you think that is going to affect the quality of health care \npeople can expect and the cost to them out-of-pocket when there would \nbe nothing even on the drawing boards for 4 years?\n  Mr. COBURN. To answer the Senator's question, No. 1, as we already \nknow, the Oklahoma State employees' health insurance plan, in 2013, \nwill be considered a Cadillac plan. That is every State worker in the \nState of Oklahoma. And they can hardly afford their copays and their \npremiums in that plan today. So what we know is, we are going to tax \nall the Oklahoma workers. Many of those are schoolteachers who happen \nto be my patients, and they are struggling today.\n  So this disconnect between when the taxes are----\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I ask the Senator from Oklahoma, you are saying that \na schoolteacher is probably not making $200,000 or more?\n  Mr. COBURN. Not at all.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Yet we were promised there would be no taxes, no harm \nto people making under $200,000. Remind me if there is a teacher in \nOklahoma--because I know there is not one in Texas--making over \n$200,000.\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, our teachers wish they made what the teachers in \nTexas make, but they do not. But they do not make anywhere close to \n$200,000. It does not just affect the Department of Human Services \nworkers, it is also going to impact the premium increases that are \ngoing to come about before this plan is implemented. We are going to \nsee premium increases. So the small businesses that are now covering \npeople are going to have massive premium increases. The individuals who \nare buying insurance in the open individual market themselves are going \nto see premium increases. The fact is, that is all going to happen \nbefore the first benefit, the first real benefit--other than \npreexisting illnesses--before anybody sees any benefit to that.\n  The other thing that is not talked about is, with the skewing of this \nand with the relatively low tax on not complying with it, our youngest, \nhealthiest people are going to say: I don't want any insurance because \nall I have to do is pay, in the first year, $250--or even less--up to \n$750, and I can save thousands of dollars every year by not buying \ninsurance, and buying it when I get sick.\n  So we are going to see everything skewed in the insurance market. \nThat is what is going to drive up the premiums.\n  My constituents, plus my patients, are not happy about the delay. If \nwe are going to make this, what I believe, is a fatal mistake for our \ncountry in terms of the quality of health care, then we ought to at \nleast match the revenues with the expenses.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. That is exactly what the Senator from South Dakota \nand I are trying to do. We are trying to make sure Americans will not--\nwill not--pay taxes and increased prices on prescription drugs, on \ncoverage we do have, the policies we do have, and the equipment that is \nso necessary for health care services.\n  Senator Thune and I want to do what is basic fairness and very \nsimple; that is, to say the program starts and the taxes start at the \nsame time. That is a tradition we have had in this country for years. \nWe do not tax people 4 years from having any kind of program in place \nthat they could choose from that might benefit them. We do not do that. \nThat is not the American way, and it is certainly not anything we have \ndone before.\n  What in the world would people expect to happen in 4 years? What if \nthis plan is changed? What if the people rise up and say: We don't want \nthis plan, and they say: No way, and they would have been paying higher \npremiums and higher health care costs already. It is a downpayment \nwhere you are not sure what the end is going to be.\n  It is like buying a house and saying: Now, in 4 years we are going to \ngive you the key to the house, we are going to give you the key to the \nhouse that you bought 4 years from now. Oh, maybe there will be a \nchange in condition, but you are going to get it. Maybe it will be \ndamaged. Maybe it will be worn. Maybe it will have a fire that starts \nin part of it. But you will get those keys and then something will be \nthere for you. We promise you. We are from the government, and we are \ngoing to promise you that.\n  That is not good enough. That is not what we owe the American people. \nAnd it is not health care reform.\n  I would just ask my colleague from South Dakota, who is the cosponsor \nof this motion, if he agrees that as a matter of simple fairness, \nopenness, and transparency to the American people, health care reform \nshould not mean 4 years of taxes before any program is put in place.\n  Mr. THUNE. I will say to my colleague from Texas, as to the taxes, \nthe fees, the tax increases, everything in our motion very simply \nstates they ought to be aligned with the beginning of the benefits. The \nbenefits and the exchanges and, frankly, all the major policies--the \nsubstance of this bill--begin in 2014; the individual mandate, the \nState exchanges, the subsidies, as I said, premium tax credits, \nMedicaid expansion, the employer mandate, 2014; the government plan, \n2014. The substance of this bill begins in 2014. Unfortunately, the tax \nincreases begin 4 years earlier, 16 days from now. Sixteen days from \nnow, January 1 of this\n\n[[Page S13289]]\n\ncoming year, is when the taxes start being raised. And, of course, the \nCBO has said those tax increases are going to be passed on in the form \nof higher premiums to people across this country. The benefits start \n1,477 days from now.\n  So what we simply say in this motion is, let's commit this bill and \nbring it back out with the tax increases--if there are going to be tax \nincreases; and many of us believe there should not be any, which is why \nwe voted for the Crapo motion yesterday--but if you are going to raise \ntaxes on America's small businesses, families, and individuals, at \nleast align those so the policy, the substance of this bill, which \nbegins 4 years from now, is synchronized so we are not slapping a huge \nnew tax increase on America's small businesses in the middle of a \nrecession and passing on those higher costs, which is what they will \ndo, to people in this country in the form of higher insurance premiums.\n  So I say to the Senator from Texas, this is a very straightforward, \nsimple motion. I hope our colleagues on both sides will support it. It \nis a matter of principle, of fairness when its comes to making policy \nthat I think the American people have come to expect. We ought to be \nhonest and give the American people a complete understanding of what \nthis bill really costs. Because they have done what they have done--by \ninstituting the tax increases immediately and the spending 4 years from \nnow--it understates the overall cost of this legislation. The American \npeople need to know this is a $2.5 trillion bill when it is fully \nimplemented. The only reason they can bring that in under that number \nis because they start raising taxes immediately and do not start paying \nbenefits out for another 4 years.\n  So I say to the Senator from Texas, I hope when we get to this vote, \nit will be a big bipartisan vote in the Senate, and I hope we will make \na change in this legislation that implements some semblance of fairness \nand also gives us a true reflection of what the bill really costs.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Senator from South Dakota.\n  Just to recap, the amount that would actually be collected before any \nprogram is put in place would be $73 billion--already collected. That \nwill include, as the Senator from Oklahoma mentioned, schoolteachers \nfrom Oklahoma who are considered to have these high-benefit plans, a \nschoolteacher making $50,000, $60,000 a year with a high-benefit plan. \nAnd do you know what the tax is on that high-benefit plan? Do you know \nwhat the tax is on that Oklahoma schoolteacher? A 40-percent excise \ntax--40 percent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the Senator, and I would just \nsay I hope we get a bipartisan vote on this motion. I hope we get a \nbipartisan vote to say the one thing we ought to do, if nothing else, \nis be fair to the American people. You do not pay taxes until the \nprogram is up and going.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to offer some \nunanimous consent requests to the chairman of the Finance Committee.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I offer a unanimous consent request that \nit not be in order for the duration of the consideration of H.R. 3590 \nto offer an amendment that has not been filed at the desk for 72 hours \nand for which there has not been a complete CBO score.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I would \nlike to just remind our colleagues, I have sought it, and I think it \nhas been basically a very forthright, open process we have conducted \nhere. Certainly in the Finance Committee--I see my colleague from Iowa \non the floor--it was totally transparent for months upon months, with \nhearing upon hearing. We posted amendments in the Finance Committee on \nthe Internet in advance of consideration.\n  I have never been part of a more transparent process since I have \nbeen here, frankly, at least for something of this magnitude over this \nperiod of time. In fact, one reporter even said to me: Senator, is this \nthe new way we do things around here? It is so transparent, so \nbipartisan, and so forth. I said: I don't know. I sure like it that \nway.\n  I also remind all of us that Senator Reid's amendment was made \navailable on November 18 of this year, and 3 days later, on the 21st, \nwe voted for cloture on the motion to proceed. Then, 12 days after the \nReid amendment was made available, we finally began debate on the bill. \nAnd here we are, nearly a month later. So this bill has been out here.\n  The Senator mentioned, I note, having in mind the managers' \namendment, which he has not seen and, frankly, this Senator has not \nseen either. I have some ideas what is in it, but I have not seen it \nmyself.\n  I think as a practical matter this will be available for 72 hours, as \nthe Senator suggests. Why do I say that? I say that because it is my \nexpectation that Senator Reid's managers' amendment will be filed very \nquickly, maybe in a day or two. It is also my expectation that we will \nthen proceed, according to expectations here, to the Defense \nappropriations conference report, which we will then be working on for \nseveral days. And probably a cloture motion might be filed on the \nhealth care bill--on the managers' amendment probably not until after \nwe do Defense appropriations. So during the interim, everyone is going \nto be able to see, at least for more than 72 hours, the contents of the \nmanagers' amendment in the health care bill which Senator Reid is going \nto be filing. So as a practical matter, I think it is going to happen.\n  I cannot at this point agree to the request to lock that in for 72 \nhours, but I think as a practical----\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Yes.\n  Mr. COBURN. One of the reasons I want this, is it not his belief that \nthe American people ought to get to see this for 72 hours as well and \nthat it ought to be on the Internet and that everybody in America, if \nwe are going to take one-sixth of our economy, ought to have the time \nto truly read--we are going to have a managers' amendment, and that is \nactually what mine is focused on.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Sure.\n  Mr. COBURN. But to be able to truly not just read the managers' \namendment but then go into the bill where it is going to fix the bill.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I think that is a good idea. I think it is going to \nhappen.\n  Mr. COBURN. But the Senator will not agree to it by unanimous \nconsent?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I cannot at this time but, again, saying it is my \nexpectation it will be available for more than 72 hours.\n  Mr. COBURN. I appreciate the sincerity of the chairman's remarks.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank the Senator. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I have another unanimous consent request. \nThe following consent request would be associated with a Coburn \namendment that would certify that every Member of the Senate has read \nthe bill and understands it before they vote on the bill. The reason I \nask unanimous consent that amendment be agreed to and accepted is that \nis exactly what the American people expect us to be doing.\n  So we do not have a bill right now. We do not know what is going to \nbe in the bill. The chairman has a good idea what is going to be in the \nbill, but he does not know for sure. Only two sets of people--Senator \nReid and his staff and CBO--know what is going to be in the bill. I \nsuspect somebody at the White House might.\n  But we ought to take and embrace the idea of transparency and \nresponsibility, that the American people can expect every one of us to \nhave read this bill, plus the amended bill, and certify that we have an \nunderstanding for what we are doing to health care in America with this \nbill.\n  I ask unanimous consent that be accepted.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I certainly \nagree with the basic underlying import that we should know what we are \nvoting on here. But I must say to my good\n\n[[Page S13290]]\n\nfriend from Oklahoma, I cannot certify that Members of the Senate will \nunderstand what they are reading. That presumes a certain level of \nperception on my part in understanding and delving into the minds of \nSenators that not only have they read but they have taken the time to \nunderstand. And what does ``understand'' mean? Understand the second \nand third levels, the fourth level of questions? I think it is a \npractical impossibility for anybody to certify that any other Senator \nhas fully understood. They may read, but they may not fully understand \nfor a whole variety of reasons. So I cannot certify that.\n  Mr. COBURN. Could I clarify my request?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. COBURN. Let me clarify my request that the individual certify \nthemselves. I am not asking some group of Senators to certify some \nother Senator. I am saying that Tom Coburn tells his constituency: I \nhave read this puppy. I have spent the time on it. I have read the \nmanagers' amendment, and I, in fact, certify to the people of Oklahoma \nthat I know how terrible it is going to be for their health care.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The Senator is always free to make any representations he \nwants. If he wants to certify he has read it and certify that he has \nunderstood it, that is the Senator's privilege.\n  Mr. COBURN. But the Senator won't accept that we as a body, on one-\nsixth of the economy, ought to say we know what we are doing?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I can't certify that every Member of the Senate has done \nanything around here. Neither can the Senator from Oklahoma. That is an \nimpossibility. But if the Senator wants to certify he has read it, that \nis great, and understands it fully, that is great, on any measure--not \njust this measure but any measure. But I can't certify that for 100 \ndifferent Senators, on any measure. That is up to the individual \nSenators and that is up to their mental capacities and up to their \ninitiatives and imaginations and conscientiousness and so forth. I \ncan't certify to that.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senator \nfrom Vermont be recognized to proceed for at least a half hour.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2837 to Amendment No. 2786\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I call up my amendment per the order.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Vermont [Mr. Sanders], for himself, Mr. \n     Burris, and Mr. Brown, proposes an amendment numbered 2837 to \n     amendment No. 2786.\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nreading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the reading of the \namendment.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \namendment be considered as read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. There is objection.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, may I ask my friend from Oklahoma why \nhe is objecting?\n  Mr. COBURN. Regular order, Madam President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Regular order is the reading of the amendment.\n  The assistant legislative clerk continued with the reading of the \namendment.\n  (The amendment (No. 2837) is printed in the Record of Wednesday, \nDecember 2, 2009, under ``Text of Amendments.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Vermont is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                      Amendment No. 2837 withdrawn\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I withdraw my amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. Regular order, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has that right. The amendment is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Pursuant to the 30 minutes that I----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Vermont is recognized for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, let me begin not by talking about my \namendment but by talking about the Republican action that we have seen \nright here on the floor of the Senate. Everybody in this country \nunderstands that our Nation faces a significant number of major \ncrises--whether it is the disintegration of our health care system, the \nfact that 17 percent of our people are unemployed or underemployed, or \nthe fact that one out of four of our children is living on food stamps. \nWe have two wars, we have global warming, we have a $12 trillion \nnational debt, and the best the Republicans can do is try to bring the \nU.S. Government to a halt by forcing a reading of a 700-page amendment. \nThat is an outrage. People can have honest disagreements, but in this \nmoment of crisis it is wrong to bring the U.S. Government to a halt.\n  I am very disturbed that I am unable to bring the amendment that I \nwanted to bring to the floor of the Senate. I thank Senator Reid for \nallowing me to try to bring it up before it was obstructed and delayed \nand prevented by the Republican leadership. My amendment, which was \ncosponsored by Senators Sherrod Brown and Roland Burris, would have \ninstituted a Medicare-for-all single-payer program. I was more than \naware and very proud that, were it not for the Republican's \nobstructionist tactics, this would have been the first time in American \nhistory that a Medicare-for-all single-payer bill was brought to a vote \nbefore the floor of the Senate. I was more than aware that this \namendment would not win. I knew that. But I am absolutely convinced \nthat this legislation or legislation like it will eventually become the \nlaw of the land.\n  The reason for my optimism that a Medicare-for-all single-payer bill \nwill eventually prevail is that this type of system is and will be the \nonly mechanism we have to provide comprehensive high-quality health \ncare to all of our people in a cost-effective way. It is the only \napproach that eliminates the hundreds of billions of dollars in waste, \nadministrative costs, bureaucracy, and profiteering by the private \ninsurance companies, and we are not going to provide comprehensive, \nuniversal, cost-effective health care to all of our people without \neliminating that waste. That is the simple truth.\n  The day will come, although I recognize it is not today, when the \nCongress will have the courage to stand up to the private insurance \ncompanies and the drug companies and the medical equipment suppliers \nand all of those who profit and make billions of dollars every single \nyear off of human sickness. On that day, when it comes--and it will \ncome--the U.S. Congress will finally proclaim that health care is a \nright of all people and not just a privilege. And that day will come, \nas surely as I stand here today.\n  There are those who think that Medicare-for-all is some kind of a \nfringe idea--that there are just a few leftwing folks out there who \nthink this is the way to go. But let me assure you that this is \nabsolutely not the case. The single-payer concept has widespread \nsupport from diverse groups from diverse regions throughout the United \nStates. In fact, in a 2007 AP/Yahoo poll, 65 percent of respondents \nsaid that the United States should adopt a universal health insurance \nprogram in which everyone is covered under a program like Medicare that \nis run by the Government and financed by taxpayers.\n  There is also widespread support for a Medicare-for-all approach \namong those people who understand this issue the most, and that is the \nmedical community. That support goes well beyond the 17,000 doctors in \nthe Physicians for National Health Care Program, who are fighting every \nday for a single-payer system. It goes beyond the California Nurses \nAssociation, the largest nurses union in the country, who are also \nfighting for a Medicare-for-all, single-payer health care. In March of \n2008,\n\n[[Page S13291]]\n\na survey of 2,000 American doctors published in the Annals of Internal \nMedicine concluded that 59 percent of physicians ``supported \nlegislation to establish national health insurance.''\n  Madam President, you might be particularly interested to know that \nthe New Hampshire Medical Society surveyed New Hampshire physicians and \nfound that two-thirds of New Hampshire physicians, including 81 percent \nof primary care clinicians, indicated that they would favor a \nsimplified payer system in which public funds, collected through taxes, \nwere used to pay directly for services to meet the basic health care \nneeds of all citizens. That is New Hampshire.\n  In 2007, Minnesota Medicine Magazine surveyed Minnesota physicians \nand found that 64 percent favored a single-payer system; 86 percent of \nphysicians also agreed that it is the responsibility of society, \nthrough the Government, to ensure that everyone has access to good \nmedical care.\n  But it is not just doctors, it is not just nurses, it is not just \nmillions of ordinary Americans. What we are seeing now is that \nnational, State, and local organizations representing a wide variety of \ninterests and regions support single payer. These include the U.S. \nConference of Mayors, the American Medical Students Association, the \nAFL/CIO, the United Church of Christ, the UAW, the International \nAssociation of Machinists, the United Steelworkers, the United \nElectrical Workers, the Older Women's League, and so many others that I \ndo not have the time to list them.\n  I ask unanimous consent to insert a list in the Record of all the \norganizations representing millions and millions of Americans who are \nsick and tired of the current system and want to move toward a \nMedicare-for-all single-payer system.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              National Organizations Support Single Payer\n\n       American Federation of Musicians of the United States and \n     Canada, American Medical Students Association, Americans for \n     Democratic Action, American Patients United, All Unions \n     Committee for Single Payer Health Care, Alliance for \n     Democracy, Business Coalition for Single Payer Health Care, \n     California Nurses Association/National Nurse Organizing \n     Committee, Coalition of Black Trade Unionists, Coalition of \n     Labor Union Women, Committee of Presidents, National \n     Association of Letter Carriers, Committees of Correspondence, \n     Earthly Energy Werx, Electrical Workers Minority Caucus, \n     Fellowship of Reconciliation, Feminist Caucus of the \n     American, Humanist Association, and Global Kids Inc.\n       Global Security Institute, Health Plan Navigator, \n     Healthcare NOW!, Hip Hop Caucus, House of Peace, Institute \n     for Policy Studies, Cities for Progress, Inter-religious \n     Foundation for Community Organization, International \n     Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, League of \n     Independent Voters, National Association for the Advancement \n     of Colored People, National Association of Letter Carriers, \n     National Council on Healthcare for the Homeless, National \n     Economic and Social Rights Initiative, National Education \n     Association, National Organization of Women, National Student \n     Nurses Association, Needed Now, and Older Women's League.\n       PACE International Union, Peoples' Health Movement--US \n     Circle, Physicians for a National Health Program, Progressive \n     Christians Uniting, Progressive Democrats of America, The \n     United Church of Christ, United Association of Journeymen & \n     Apprentices of the Plumbing & Pipe Fitting Industry of the \n     United States & Canada, United Automobile Workers, United \n     Automobile Workers, International Union Convention, United \n     Electric Workers, United Federation of Teachers, United \n     Methodist Global Board of Church and Society, United \n     Steelworkers of America, Up for Democracy, Women's Division \n     of The United Methodist Church, Women's Universal Health \n     Initiative, and Young Democrats.\n\n                State Organizations Support Single Payer\n\n       1199SEIU United Healthcare Workers East, MD, DC, NY, MA;

There is also significant support in the House of \nRepresentatives for a single-payer system. Together, H.R. 676 and H.R. \n1200, two different single-payer proposals, have 94 cosponsors.\n  And let me say a word about State legislatures that have moved \nforward aggressively toward a single-payer system. In California, our \nlargest State, the State legislature there has on two occasions passed \na single-payer program. The largest State in America passed a single-\npayer program, and on both occasions it was vetoed by the Governor. In \nNew York State, the State Assembly passed a single-payer system. Among \nother States where single payer has been proposed and seriously \ndiscussed are Ohio, Massachusetts, Georgia, Colorado, Maine, Vermont, \nIllinois, Wisconsin, Oregon, Washington, New Mexico, Minnesota, \nIndiana, and New Hampshire.\n  Why is it that we need an entirely new approach for health care in \nthis country? The answer is pretty obvious. Our current system, \ndominated by profit-making insurance companies, simply does not work. \nYes, we have to confess, it does work for the insurance companies that \nmake huge profits and provide their CEOs with extravagant compensation \npackages. Yes, it does work--and we saw how well it worked right here \non the floor yesterday--for the pharmaceutical industry which year \nafter year leads almost every other industry in profit while charging \nthe American people by far--not even close--the highest prices in the \nworld for prescription drugs.\n  So it works for the insurance companies. It works for the drug \ncompanies. It works for the medical equipment suppliers and the many \nother companies who are making billions of dollars off of our health \ncare system. But it is not working for--in fact, it is a disaster for--\nordinary Americans.\n  Today, 46 million people in our country have no health insurance and \nan even higher number of people are underinsured, with high deductibles \nor copayments. Today, as our primary health care system collapses, tens \nof millions of Americans do not have access to a doctor on a regular \nbasis and, tragically, some 45,000 of our fellow Americans who do not \nhave access to a doctor on a regular basis die every single year. That \nis 15 times more Americans who die of preventable diseases than were \nmurdered in the horrific 9/11 attack against our country. That takes \nplace every year: the preventable deaths of 45,000 people.\n  This is not acceptable. These horrific deaths are a manifestation of \na collapsing system that needs fundamental change.\n  A number of months ago I took to the floor to relate stories that I \nheard from people throughout the State of Vermont regarding the health \ncare crisis, stories which I published in a small pamphlet and placed \non my Web site. Let me tell you one story.\n  A man from Swanton, VT, in the northern part of our State, wrote to \nme to tell me the story of his younger brother, a Vietnam veteran, who \ndied 3\n\n[[Page S13292]]\n\nweeks after being diagnosed with colon cancer. At the time he was \ndiagnosed, he had been laid off from his job and could not afford COBRA \ncoverage. This is what his brother said:\n\n       When he was in enough pain to see a doctor it was too late. \n     He left a wife and two teenage sons in the prime of his life \n     at 50 years old. The attending physician said that, if he had \n     only sought treatment earlier, he would still be alive.\n\n  Horrifically, tragically, that same story is being told in every \nState in this country over and over again. If only he had gone to the \ndoctor in time he could have lived, but he didn't have any health \ninsurance. That should not be taking place in the United States of \nAmerica in the year 2009.\n  Our health care disaster extends beyond even the thousands who die \nneedlessly every single year. Many others suffer unnecessary \ndisability--strokes that leave them paralyzed because they couldn't \nafford treatment for their high blood pressure, or amputations, \nblindness, or kidney failure from untreated diabetes. Infants are born \ndisabled because their mothers couldn't get the kind of prenatal care \nthat every mother should have, and millions with mental illness go \nwithout care every single day.\n  In a town in northern Vermont not far from where I live, a physician \ntold me that one-third of the patients she treats are unable to pay for \nthe prescription drugs she prescribes. Think about the insanity of \nthat. We ask doctors to diagnose our illness, to help us out, she \nwrites the prescription for the drug, and one-third of her patients \ncannot afford to fill that prescription. That is insane. That is a \ncrumbling health care system. The reason people cannot afford to fill \ntheir prescription drugs is that our people, because of pharmaceutical \nindustry greed, are forced to pay by far the highest prices in the \nworld for prescription drugs. This is indefensible. There is nobody who \ncan come to the floor of this Senate and tell me that makes one shred \nof sense.\n  The disintegration of our health care system causes not only \nunnecessary human pain, suffering, and death, but it is also an \neconomic disaster. Talk to small businesses in Vermont, New Hampshire, \nany place in this country, and they tell you they cannot afford to \ninvest in their companies and create new jobs because all of their \nprofits are going to soaring health care costs--10, 15, 20 percent a \nyear. Talk to the recently bankrupt General Motors and they will tell \nyou that they spend more money per automobile on health care than they \ndo on steel. GM is forced to pay $1,500 per car on health care while \nMercedes in Germany spends $419, and Toyota in Japan spends $97. Try to \ncompete against that.\n  From an individual economic perspective, it is literally beyond \ncomprehension that of the nearly 1 million people who will file for \nbankruptcy this year, the vast majority are filing for bankruptcy \nbecause of medically related illnesses. Let's take a deep breath and \nthink about this from an emotional point of view. Let's think about the \nmillions of people who are today struggling with cancer, struggling \nwith heart disease, struggling with diabetes or other chronic \nillnesses. They are not even able to focus on their disease and trying \nto get well. They are summoning half their energy to fight with the \ninsurance companies to make sure they get the coverage they need. That \nis not civilized. That is not worthy of the United States of America.\n  In my State of Vermont--and I suspect it is similar in New Hampshire \nand every other State--I have many times walked into small mom-and-pop \nstores and seen those little donation jars that say: Help out this or \nthat family because the breadwinner is struggling with cancer and does \nnot have any health insurance or little Sally needs some kind of \noperation and she doesn't have any health insurance, put in a buck or \nfive bucks to help that family get the health care they need. This is \nthe United States of America. This should and cannot be allowed to \ncontinue.\n  One of the unfortunate things that has occurred during the entire \nhealth care debate is that we have largely ignored what is happening in \nterms of health care around the rest of the world. I have heard some of \nmy Republican colleagues get up and say: We have the best health care \nsystem in the world. Yes, we do, if you are a millionaire or a \nbillionaire, but we do not if you are in the middle class, not if you \nare a working-class person, certainly not if you are low income. It is \njust not true.\n  Today, the United States spends almost twice as much per person on \nhealth care as any other country. Despite that, we have 46 million \nuninsured and many more underinsured and our health care outcomes are, \nin many respects--not all but in many respects--worse than other \ncountries. Other countries, for example, have longer life expectancies \nthan we do. They are better on infant mortality, and they do a lot \nbetter job in terms of preventable deaths. At the very beginning of \nthis debate, we should have asked a very simple question: Why is it we \nare spending almost twice as much per person on health care as any \nother country with outcomes that, in many respects, are not as good?\n  According to an OECD report in 2007, the United States spent $7,290, \nover $7,000 per person on health care. Canada spent $3,895, almost half \nwhat we spent. France spent $3,601, less than half what we spent. The \nUnited Kingdom spent less than $3,000, and Italy spent $2,600 compared \nto the more than $7,000 we spent. Don't you think that maybe the first \nquestion we might have asked is: Why is it we spend so much and yet our \nhealth care outcomes, in many respects, are worse than other countries? \nWhy is it that that happens?\n  Let me tell you what other people will not tell you. One key issue \nthat needed to be debated in this health care discussion has not been \ndiscussed. The simple reason as to why we spend so much more than any \nother country with outcomes that are not as good as many other \ncountries is that this legislation, from the very beginning, started \nwith the assumption that we need to maintain the private for-profit \nhealth insurance companies. That basic reality that we cannot touch \nprivate insurance companies, in fact that we have to dump millions more \npeople into private health insurance companies, that was an issue that \ncould not even be discussed. And as a result, despite all the money we \nspend, we get poor value for our investment.\n  According to the World Health Organization, the United States ranks \n37th in terms of health system performance compared with five other \ncountries: Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, and the United \nKingdom. The U.S. health system ranks less or less than half.\n  Sometimes these groups poll people. They go around the world and they \npoll people and they ask: How do you feel about your own health care \nsystem? We end up way down below other countries. Recently, while the \nCanadian health care system was being attacked every single day, they \ndid a poll in Canada. They said to the Canadian people: What do you \nthink about your health care system? People in America say you have a \nterrible system. Do you want to junk your system and adopt the American \nsystem? By overwhelming numbers, the people of Canada said: Thank you, \nno thank you. We know the American system. We will stay with our \nsystem.\n  I was in the United Kingdom a couple months ago. I had an interesting \nexperience. It was a Parliamentarian meeting. I met with a number of \npeople in the Conservative Party--not the liberal Democratic Party, not \nthe Labour Party, the Conservative Party, the party which likely will \nbecome the government of that country. The Conservatives were outraged \nby the kind of attacks being leveled against the national health system \nin their country, the lies we are being told about their system. In \nfact, the leader of the Conservative Party got up to defend the \nnational health system in the United Kingdom and said: If we come to \npower, we will defend the national health system. Those were the \nconservatives.\n  What is the problem with our system which makes it radically \ndifferent than systems in any other industrialized country? It is that \nwe have allowed for-profit private corporations to develop and run our \nhealth care system, and the system that these companies have developed \nis the most costly, wasteful, complicated, and bureaucratic in the \nentire world. Everybody knows that. With 1,300 private insurance \ncompanies and thousands and thousands of different health benefit \nprograms all designed to maximize profits, private\n\n[[Page S13293]]\n\nhealth insurance companies spend an incredible 30 percent of every \nhealth care dollar on administration and billing, on exorbitant CEO \ncompensation packages, on advertising, lobbying, and campaign \ncontributions. This amounts to some $350 billion every single year that \nis not spent on health care but is spent on wasteful bureaucracy.\n  It is spent on bureaucrats and on an insurance company telling us why \nwe can't get the insurance we pay for. How many people today are on the \nphone today arguing with those bureaucrats to try to get the benefits \nthey paid for? It is spent on staff in a physician's office who spend \nall their time submitting claims. They are not treating people; they \nare submitting claims. It is spent on hundreds of people working in the \nbasement of hospitals who are not delivering babies, not treating \npeople with cancer. They are not making people well. They are sending \nout bills. That is the system we have decided to have. We send out \nbills, and we spend hundreds of billions of dollars doing that rather \nthan bringing primary health care physicians into rural areas, rather \nthan getting the doctors, dentists, and nurses we need.\n  Let me give a few outrageous examples. Everyone knows this country is \nin the midst of a major crisis in primary health care. We lack doctors. \nWe lack nurses. We lack dentists--a major crisis getting worse every \nsingle day. Yet while we are unable to produce those desperately needed \ndoctors and nurses and dentists, we are producing legions of insurance \ncompany bureaucrats.\n  Here is a chart which deals with that issue. What this chart shows is \nthat over the last three decades, the number of administrative \npersonnel, bureaucrats who do nothing to cure our illnesses or keep us \nwell, the number of bureaucrats has grown by 25 times the number of \nphysicians. This is growth in the number of doctors--nonexistent. This \nis growth in the number of health care bureaucrats on the phone today \ntelling you why you can't get the health care coverage you paid for or \ntelling you that you have a preexisting condition and throwing you off \nhealth care because you committed the crime last year of getting sick. \nThat growth is through the roof. This is where our health care dollars \nare going. This is why we need a single-payer system.\n  According to Dr. Uwe Reinhardt in testimony before Congress, Duke \nUniversity Hospital, a very fine hospital, has almost 900 billing \nclerks to deal with hundreds of distinct managed care contracts. Do you \nknow how many beds they have in that hospital? They have 900 beds. They \nhave 900 bureaucrats involved in billing for 900 beds. Tell me that \nmakes sense.\n  At a time when the middle class is collapsing and when millions of \nAmericans are unable to afford health insurance, the profits of health \ninsurance companies are soaring. From 2003 to 2007, the combined \nprofits of the Nation's major health insurance companies increased by \n170 percent. While more and more Americans are losing their jobs, the \ntop executives of the industry are receiving lavish compensation \npackages. In 2007, despite plans to cut 3 to 4 percent of its \nworkforce, Johnson & Johnson found the cash to pay its CEO Weldon $31.4 \nmillion. Ron Williams of Aetna took home over $38 million, and the head \nof CIGNA, Edward Hanway, took away $120 million over 5 years on, and on \nand on it goes.\n  So what is the alternative? Let me briefly describe the main features \nof a Medicare-for-all single-payer system. In terms of access, people \ngetting into health care, this legislation would provide for all \nnecessary medical care without cost sharing or other barriers to \ntreatment. Every American--not 94 percent but 100 percent of America's \ncitizens--would be entitled to care. In terms of choice, the issue is \nnot choice of insurance companies that our Republican friends talk \nabout. The question is choice of doctors, choice of hospitals, choice \nof therapeutic treatments. Our single-payer legislation would provide \nfull choice of physicians and other licensed providers and hospitals. \nImportantly--and I know there is some confusion--a single-payer program \nis a national health insurance program which utilizes a nonprofit, \nprivate delivery system. It is not a government-run health care system. \nIt is a government-run insurance program. In other words, people would \nstill be going to the same doctors, still going to the same hospitals \nand other medical providers.\n  The only difference is, instead of thousands of separately \nadministered programs run with outrageous waste, there would be one \nhealth insurance program in America for Members of Congress, for the \npoorest people in our country, for all of us. In that process, we would \nsave hundreds of billions of dollars in bureaucratic waste. In terms of \nbenefits, what would you get? A single-payer program covers all \nmedically necessary care, including primary care, emergency care, \nhospital services, mental health services, prescriptions, eye care, \ndental care, rehabilitation services, and nursing home care as well. In \nterms of medical decisions, those decisions under a single-payer \nprogram would be made by the doctors and the patients, not by \nbureaucrats in insurance companies.\n  If we move toward a single-payer program, we could save $350 billion \na year in administrative simplification, bulk purchasing, improved \naccess with greater use of preventative services, and earlier diagnosis \nof illness.\n  People will be able to get to the doctor when they need to rather \nthan waiting until they are sick and ending up in a hospital.\n  Further, and importantly, like other countries with a national health \ncare program, we would be able to negotiate drug prices with the \npharmaceutical industry, and we would end the absurdity of Americans \nbeing forced to pay two, three, five times more for certain drugs than \npeople around the rest of the world.\n  Every other industrialized country on Earth primarily funds health \ncare from broad-based taxes in the same way we fund the Defense \nDepartment, Social Security, and other agencies of government, and that \nis how we would fund a national health care program.\n  Let me be specific about how we would pay for this. What this \nlegislation would do is, No. 1, eliminate--underline ``eliminate''--all \npayments to private insurance companies. So people would not be paying \npremiums to UnitedHealth, WellPoint, Blue Cross Blue Shield, and other \nprivate industry companies--not one penny. The reason for that is that \nprivate for-profit health insurance companies in this country would no \nlonger exist.\n  Instead, this legislation would maintain all of the tax revenue that \ncurrently flows into public health programs like Medicare, Medicaid, \nand CHIP, and it would add to that an income tax increase of 2.2 \npercent and a payroll tax of 8.7 percent. This payroll tax would \nreplace all other employer expenses for employee health care. In other \nwords, employers in this country, from General Motors to a mom-and-pop \nstore in rural America, would no longer be paying one penny toward \nprivate insurance revenue.\n  The income tax would take the place of all current insurance \npremiums, copays, deductibles, and all other out-of-pocket payments \nmade by individuals. For the vast majority of people, a 2.2-percent \nincome tax is way less than what they now pay for all of those other \nthings. In other words, yes, you would be paying more in taxes. That is \ntrue. But you would no longer have to pay for private health insurance, \nand, at the end of the day, from both a financial perspective and a \nhealth security perspective, we would be better off as individuals and \nas a nation.\n  What remains in existence--I should add here--is the Veterans' \nAdministration. I believe, and most of us believe, they have a separate \nset of issues, and the VA would remain as it is.\n  Let me bring my remarks to a close by giving you an example of where \nI think we should be going as a country in terms of health care. Oddly \nenough, the process that I think we should be using is what a small \ncountry of 23 million people--the country of Taiwan--did in 1995. In \n1995, Taiwan was where we are right now--massive dissatisfaction with a \ndysfunctional health care system--and they did what we did not do. They \nsaid: Let's put together the best commission we can, the smartest \npeople we know. Let's go all over the world. Let's take the best ideas \nfrom countries all over the world.\n  As Dr. Michael Chen, vice president and CFO of Taiwan's National \nHealth Insurance Bureau, explained in an interview earlier this year, \nthe Taiwanese ultimately chose to model their system--after a worldwide \nsearch--on\n\n[[Page S13294]]\n\nour Medicare Program. That is where they went, except that they chose \nto insure the entire population rather than just the elderly. After \nsearching the globe, the Taiwanese realized what many Americans already \nknow: a Medicare-for-all, single-payer system is the most effective way \nto offer quality coverage at a reasonable price.\n  Taiwan now offers comprehensive health care to all of its people, and \nit is spending 6 percent of its GDP to do that while we spend 16 \npercent of our GDP. But, unfortunately, the single-payer model was not \never put on the table here. Maybe we should learn something from our \nfriends in Taiwan.\n  Let me end by saying this: This country is in the midst of a \nhorrendous health care crisis. We all know that. We can tinker with the \nsystem. We can come up with a 2,000-page bill which does this, that, \nand the other thing. But at the end of the day, if we are going to do \nwhat virtually every other country on Earth does--provide \ncomprehensive, universal health care in a cost-effective way, one that \ndoes not bankrupt our government or bankrupt individuals--if we are \ngoing to do that, we are going to have to take on the private insurance \ncompanies and tell them very clearly that they are no longer needed. \nThanks for your service. We don't need you anymore.\n  A Medicare-for-all program is the way to go. I know it is not going \nto pass today. I know we do not have the votes. I know the insurance \ncompany and the drug lobbyists will fight us to the death. But, mark my \nwords, Madam President, the day will come when this country will do the \nright thing. On that day, we will pass a Medicare-for-all single-payer \nsystem.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I take this opportunity to share with my \ncolleagues a statement I have prepared regarding the health care reform \ndebate in which the Senate is currently engaged.\n  A majority of the Members of Congress share President Obama's humane \ngoal that millions more Americans might enjoy health insurance coverage \nand that medical care to all Americans might be substantially improved. \nFor the moment, however, President Obama and the Congress must \nrecognize that the overwhelming demand of most Americans is that \npresidential and congressional leadership should focus each day on \nrestoration of jobs, strengthening of housing opportunities, new growth \nin small business and large industries, and banks that are not only \nsolvent but confident of normal lending. In essence, the task facing \nnational leadership is truly monumental. A national and international \nrecession has not ended and many economists predict that unemployment, \nwhich has exceeded 10 percent in the United States, will continue to \ngrow in coming months.\n  The President and the current Congress have realized a final deficit \nfor fiscal year 2009 of $1.4 trillion, with the total national debt now \nat $12 trillion. The appropriation bills that Congress has passed and \nthat will make up the next fiscal year's expenditures are predicted to \nresult in another annual deficit of more than $1 trillion. In fiscal \nyear 2009, Medicaid spending increased by 24.6 percent to $251 billion. \nSpending on Food Stamps increased 41 percent to $56 billion. \nUnemployment benefits increased almost 155 percent to $120 billion.\n  Republicans and Democrats may feel that passing comprehensive health \nlegislation before the end of the year is crucial to the success or \nfailure of the Obama administration and/or party leadership in the \nCongress.\n  But I would suggest that successful leadership will be defined, now \nand historically, by success in bringing a horrendous economic \nrecession to an end, bringing new strength to our economy, and \nproviding vital leadership in international relations as we hope to \nbring conflicts under control and in some cases, to conclusion.\n  I appreciate that President Obama has strongly argued that \ncomprehensive health care legislation is an important component to \nreducing federal deficit spending. He has contended that failure to \npass this legislation will increase deficits now and for many years to \ncome. I disagree with the President.\n  After the economic recession in our country comes to a conclusion, a \nhigh priority may be extension of health insurance coverage and reform \nof many health care practices. When such changes occur, they are likely \nto be expensive and Americans will need to debate, even then, their \npriority in comparison to many other national goals. One reason why \nhealth care is likely to remain expensive is that major advances in \nsurgical procedures, prescription drugs, and other health care \npractices have prolonged the lives of tens of millions of Americans and \nimproved the quality of those additional years. The Washington Post, in \na front-page story on July 26, 2009, mentioned that ``the fight against \nheart disease has been slow and incremental. It's also been extremely \nexpensive and wildly successful.'' Americans should not take for \ngranted all of the advances in health care that have enriched our \nlives, but we sometimes forget that we require and even pray for much \nmore medical progress in years to come, which is likely to be \nexpensive.\n  In order to pay for the cost of the nearly $1 trillion health care \nlegislation, several Members of Congress are suggesting new forms of \ntaxation, reduction of payments to doctors and hospitals, and \ncurtailment of certain types of insurance coverage. These and other \nsuggestions may temporarily bring about cost reduction but will also \nhave some after-effects in the overall economy. In fact, strong \nfinancial incentives may be needed to enlist men and women to enter the \nmedical field. Failure to enlist a sufficient number of doctors could \nlead to rationing of service and longer lines to find someone who will \ngive humane attention.\n  In the meanwhile, it is possible that the President and Members of \nCongress might find some inexpensive, incremental improvements that \ncould result in a greater number of Americans being served through \nhealth insurance and more efficiently operating health care \ninstitutions. The strong desire that most of us have to continue \ndiscussing these issues and make improvements need not be postponed \neven as President Obama and the Congress strive for victory over a \ndevastating national economic recession.\n  Because our Federal spending deficits have risen so much and are \npredicted to rise even more, all substantive discussions on health care \nand other important issues will be conducted during many years of \nplanning and, finally, decisive action to reduce deficit spending and \npreserve the value and integrity of the dollar as we continue to borrow \nhundreds of billions of dollars in the form of U.S. Treasury bonds sold \nto governments and citizens of other countries. They, too, are counting \non the integrity of our dollar and our financial system to preserve the \nvalue of their financial reserves.\n  Starting with President Obama and extending to all Members of \nCongress, we wish that we had inherited a neutral, peaceful playing \nfield. We have not been so fortunate. Our responsibility now is to \nrecognize the extraordinary financial tragedy that has befallen our \ncountry and to recognize the unprecedented opportunity that we have to \nstop the momentum of that tragedy. We must provide valid hope of \nconstructive vision, idealism, and change in the future. I look forward \nto working with the President and my colleagues to tackle first things \nfirst.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nmotion to commit offered by Senators Hutchison and Thune.\n  The Hutchison-Thune motion to commit would send the health care bill \nto the Senate Finance Committee with instructions to revise the bill in \na revenue-neutral manner, to prevent taxes in the bill from going into \neffect before the exchanges are set up in 2014.\n  The bill makes Americans wait until 2014 to get insurance through the \nnew ``exchanges,'' but it rolls out new tax hikes starting right away. \nUnless we take action to change this, Americans will see 4 years of tax \nincreases before the chief benefits of this bill become available.\n  In the 4 years between now and the time the exchanges come online, \nAmericans will face at least a dozen new or increased taxes and fees \ncosting $73 billion.\n  Some of these taxes start in 2 weeks. For example, a new tax on \npharmaceutical manufacturers, which will raise an average of $2.2 \nbillion per year; a new tax on health insurance providers, which will \nraise $6.7 billion per\n\n[[Page S13295]]\n\nyear; a new tax on medical device manufacturers, which will raise $2 \nbillion per year.\n  Other taxes kick in 1 year from now. These include an increased \npenalty on withdrawals from Health Savings Accounts and a new $2,500 \ncap on FLEX spending accounts.\n  These new limits and penalties make no sense to me. Why would we want \nto impose a penalty on Americans who use money from their FLEX spending \naccounts to buy over-the-counter medicine? How is that going to help \nmake health care more affordable?\n  But that is not all the bill does with respect to taxes. In 2013, the \nbill imposes several more taxes, including a reduction in the tax \ndeductibility of medical expenses, a new high cost insurance excise \nTax--the so-called Cadillac tax, and an increase in the Medicare \npayroll tax for high earners.\n  These tax increases total $73 billion before 2014, before anyone gets \na dollar of subsidy to purchase health insurance in the new exchanges.\n  These taxes will be paid right away by Americans in the form of \nhigher health insurance premiums. This is not just my opinion; this is \nwhat the Congressional Budget concludes too. Here is what the CBO said \nabout the $6.7 billion annual fee on health insurance providers, which \nis scheduled to begin next year:\n\n       We expect a very large portion of [the] proposed insurance \n     industry fee to be borne by purchasers of insurance in the \n     form of higher premiums.\n\n  It is not just taxes on insurance that will be passed on to \nconsumers. Taxes on pharmaceutical manufacturers and medical devices \nmakers will also be passed on.\n  This means that American consumers will see price increases for \neverything from insulin pumps, to pacemakers, to power wheelchairs and \ndrugs like Prilosec.\n  As the CBO Director has said:\n\n       Those fees would increase costs for the affected firms, \n     which would be passed on to purchasers and would ultimately \n     raise insurance premiums by a corresponding amount.\n\n  The Joint Committee on Taxation shares the CBO's view these tax hikes \nwill be passed along to consumers.\n  Once again, I do not see how imposing these new taxes now--before the \nexchanges are set up and the chief benefits of the bill are supposed to \nbecome available--makes health care more affordable.\n  For all of these reasons, I will be voting in favor of the Hutchison-\nThune motion to recommit, and I would urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n\n\n                            Motion To Commit\n\n  Mr. SANDERS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I thank the majority leader for \nallowing me to speak because I am very concerned about a precedent that \nhas been set on the floor in this last vote.\n  When the Senator from Vermont withdrew his amendment and started \ntalking, my motion to commit was the measure pending on the floor. I \ndid not have notice--which is the normal procedure here--to be able to \ntalk on my motion. We had no idea there would be a motion to table my \nmotion before I had a chance to close.\n  Here is my point. The measure that was tabled, the Hutchison-Thune \nmotion, would have assured the American people that there would not be \n4 years of tax collection before any kind of program would be put \nforward under the health care reform package. I thought it was very \nimportant that Senator Thune and I be able to close on that. That is a \nconcept we have always had in the Senate--that a program starts when it \nstarts. That means if taxes are included, the taxes will start when the \nprogram starts. That is not the case in the underlying bill. The \nunderlying health care reform bill has 4 years of taxes. There will be \ntaxes on insurance companies that will surely raise the premium of \nevery insurance policy in America. There are taxes on prescription drug \ncompanies, so that prescription drug prices will surely go up. There \nare taxes on medical device companies, so the prices on health care \nequipment will also go up. How much are we talking about? We are \ntalking about $100 billion in taxes that will start in 3 weeks--in \nJanuary of 2010. Again, we are looking at taxes that will start in 3 \nweeks, next month, which will accumulate up to $73 billion before a \nprogram is implemented that will give anyone a choice of an affordable \nhealth care option.\n  That is the motion that was tabled 10 minutes ago. I want to make \nsure everyone knows I never had a chance to close on the motion. \nSenator Thune didn't have a chance to close, because it was a motion \nmade that could not be objected to. That is not the way things have \noperated here in the past, and I think it is time we bring back the \ntraditions of the Senate, where we have time that we agree to, \neverybody has their say, and then we go forward.\n  I am very concerned about that process. I hope it is not setting \nprecedent because I think we can resurrect health care reform if we \nhave a bipartisan health care effort. If we have an effort that will \nbring down the costs, that will increase the risk pools so that an \nemployer will be able to afford to offer employees health care \ncoverage, bring down the costs of health care with medical malpractice \nreform that would save $54 billion in the system, we can do things \nwithout a government takeover of health care. But the bill that is \nbefore us has $\\1/2\\ trillion in Medicare cuts--Medicare cuts, $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion--and $\\1/2\\ trillion in new taxes--taxes on businesses that \noffer not enough coverage, businesses that offer too much coverage, a \n40-percent excise tax on policies that give what is called Cadillac \ncoverage, the high benefit plans. So if you have a good insurance \npolicy, you have a 40-percent tax on top of the premium you pay. And if \nyou have too little coverage, you also get taxed. You are whipsawed in \nthis bill.\n\n  I think the small business people of this country know what this bill \nis about because that is the comment we are getting. They are the \npeople calling into our offices. They are the people I see on the \nairplanes as I go back and forth to try to make sure we are covering \nthe bases on this bill and trying to let the American people know what \nis in it.\n  I am concerned about the precedent that was set, but more than that, \nI am concerned that the American people must know that if this bill \npasses as it is on the floor today, the taxes will take effect in 3 \nweeks, that insurance premiums will surely go up, prescription drugs \nwill surely go up, prices on medical equipment will surely go up, and \nthere will not be an affordable insurance plan for people to choose to \ntake for 4 years. It is like buying a house and having the mortgage \ncompany hand you the keys and say: Come back in 4 years, and we will \nlet you unlock the door.\n  I don't think that is transparency, and it is certainly not health \ncare reform. I hope there is still a chance that we can bring this body \nto a bipartisan effort that will allow lower premiums, more health care \noptions for the people of this country but, most important, that will \nkeep the quality of health care, the choices we have in health care \nthat Americans have come to expect and not start going on the road to a \nsingle-payer system because in the end, that is what the bill before us \nwill lead to. It will be a single-payer system. It will take choices \nout. It will take quality out.\n  It will add taxes and burdens on our small businesses at a time when \nthey need to be able to hire people to get our economy going and to get \nthat jobless rate down. We need them to employ people. We need to \nencourage our employers to employ people. They cannot do it if we put \nmore taxes and burdens on them, which is what the bill before us does.\n  I thank the majority leader for allowing me to speak since I did not \nhave a chance to speak before my motion was tabled. I hope the American \npeople\n\n[[Page S13297]]\n\nare listening because we have a chance to do this right. The bill on \nthe floor today is not that bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Texas. I am glad \nshe had an opportunity to speak. We disagree on this issue, but I am \nglad she had her opportunity to speak.\n  I hear from different people. Obviously, we must ride on different \nplanes because the people I speak with are anxious to see some change \nin this health care system and know that 14,000 Americans lose their \nhealth insurance every single day. They know that most people cannot \nafford health insurance because of the increase in costs.\n  I say to the Senator from Texas, she is my friend and we have worked \non many issues in the past, but we disagree on this issue.\n  I am coming before the Senate with a holiday proposal. Recently there \nwas a book that was published about World War I. It was about trench \nwarfare that went on and on with horrendous casualties and lives being \nlost. Then there came a moment, a Christmas moment, when they decided \nto call a truce because of Christmas and play a soccer game. The Allied \nand Axis troops came out and, for a brief moment, stopped the war, \nplayed the soccer game, and went back to the trenches and the next day \nstarted shooting again.\n  I am looking for a holiday truce here for our troops because what we \nhave before us right now is the Department of Defense appropriations \nbill. Although Senator Hutchison and I clearly disagree and many \nMembers on both sides clearly disagree when it comes to health care, \nthere is no disagreement when it comes to our troops. Every one of us \nsupports our troops. Every one of us wants to make sure they have what \nthey need, the resources they need to perform their mission \nsuccessfully and come home safely.\n  This bill that is before us, this Department of Defense \nappropriations conference report, is an attempt for us to do something \nto help these troops in time of war. I would hope I could appeal to my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle that for one brief, shining \nmoment in the spirit of the holiday we set aside our political \ndifferences for the sake of our men and women in uniform.\n  The point I am getting to is that if we go through the ordinary, \ntortured procedure and wait, it is going to take us days to complete \nthis bill for our troops. I hope we can show good faith on both sides \nof the aisle and overcome that. I hope we could enter into a consent \nagreement among Republicans and Democrats because I know as I stand \nhere that the Republicans feel as the Democrats do--that we should \nprovide funding for our overseas operations of our men and women in \nuniform.\n  In this bill, $101 billion is included for operations and maintenance \nfor ongoing military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan and to support \nthe preparations to continue the withdrawal from Iraq.\n  In this bill, there is $23.36 billion for equipment. We want to make \nsure our men and women in uniform have the equipment they need to make \ncertain they are safe and have what they need to come home safely.\n  There is also a pay raise in this bill, a 3.4-percent pay raise. Does \nanyone dispute the need that our military has to be recognized for what \nthey have given our country and be given a pay raise?\n  When it comes to readiness and training, there is $154 billion for \nthe defense operation and maintenance account to increase readiness.\n  In the field of military health care, there is $29 billion for the \nDefense Health Program to provide quality care for servicemembers and \ntheir families. It includes, incidentally, $120 million for traumatic \nbrain injury and psychological health research.\n  These are issues we have all come together on. We are not arguing \nabout these issues, and I do not think we should at this moment.\n  There is $472 million for family advocacy programs and full funding \nfor Family Support and Yellow Ribbon to provide support to military \nfamilies, including quality childcare, job training for spouses, and \nexpanded counseling and outreach.\n  There is one other section of the bill--and I will yield for a \nquestion from my friend from Alaska when I complete this point--there \nis one other section that relates to the unemployment crisis facing \nthis country. It is a modest extension of the unemployment benefits. \nThe last time it was on the floor, I believe it passed 97 to 0. I do \nnot believe there is any controversy to the fact that we want to extend \nunemployment insurance benefits through February 28 of next year. It is \ndifficult to envision a situation where we would actually leave here to \ngo home to our families for the holidays and not take care of the \nunemployed.\n  There is also a provision for their health insurance under COBRA and \nfor food stamps on which we know so many unemployed families rely. It \nseems to me if there is one thing in the midst of this political \nturmoil we can agree on, it is let's stand behind our troops, let's \nmake sure people who are unemployed have a happy holiday season. Why do \nwe want a tortured process to reach a ``yes'' on this conference \nreport? I appeal to my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to \nmake this a bipartisan effort. Let's do this part. We can return to the \nhealth care bill and the debate. But let's get this done and do it \nwithout all the necessary motions and time that may be spent.\n  I yield for a question from the Senator from Alaska.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alaska is recognized.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Illinois \nbringing up what I consider a very most important piece of legislation \nto Alaska. Eleven percent of our population are veterans. We have \nthousands of military individuals in our State.\n  I am new to the process. One of the questions I have for the \nSenator--and I hope he can enlighten me and also enlighten the whole \npublic watching--this is probably one of the most important departments \nat this time. We are in two wars. Can the Senator give me an \nexplanation? In the past--Senator Durbin started to do it--the Defense \nbill seemed to be one of those bills where we all came together. It is \na bipartisan approach. I know as members of the Armed Services \nCommittee, it seems every time we deal with these issues we are \nunified.\n  Help me to understand why this is something that seems to be \ncontroversial and yet should be so simple for us to do.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say in response to the Senator from Alaska, I think it \nis the moment. If we were in a different political environment, I think \nthe Republican Senators and Democratic Senators would agree that this \nshould go through and go through quickly. But we have been caught up \nfor weeks now in debate and controversy, and this bill has been tossed \ninto that environment. That is the explanation because I do not think \nthere is a single provision I read here that Republican Senators do not \nsupport, as the Democratic Senators support. That is why I made my \nsuggestion.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, if I may ask one more question. That last \nstatement the Senator from Illinois made, I know as a member of the \nArmed Services Committee, I have not heard complaints about this bill \nfrom anyone from the other side. I am asking, from a leadership \nposition, have we heard any complaints on this legislation? Is it just \nthat, it is the moment in time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say in response to the Senator from Alaska, it does \ninclude some provisions relative to the unemployed. There were other \nthings that could have been included by the House, but we reached out \nto the Republican side and asked: Are any of these problematic? By and \nlarge, they said here are the things you should not include, and we did \nnot. We did our best to ensure we brought a noncontroversial bill for \nconsideration.\n  Mr. BEGICH. I thank the Senator.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I am happy to yield to the Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, from the Senator's explanation and from \nwhat we have been working on, I want the Senator to clarify two things.\n  First of all, we could do this conference report today if there were \na willingness and, secondly, we have a pay raise for our troops that is \ncoming right before Christmas, the holidays,\n\n[[Page S13298]]\n\nhelp for families, help for those who have lost their jobs and are \ntrying to figure out how they keep their health care going, and help \nfor people who are trying to put food on the table for the holidays; is \nthat correct? I ask the Senator to expand. As I understand it, we could \nactually get this done today and give people some peace of mind going \ninto the holidays.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say to the Senator from Michigan, yes, we could enter \ninto a consent agreement now and pass this conference report without \ncontroversy, and I bet you it would get a unanimous vote.\n  As the Senator from Michigan described this, everybody here wants to \nmake sure we take care of our troops. We received a unanimous vote, if \nmemory serves me, the last time we extended unemployment benefits. I \nthink most Members want to stand up and help those who are unemployed \nthrough this difficult time of unemployment in our country.\n  If there ever were a bill to bring us together in those two areas--\nhelping our troops and helping the unemployed--this is the bill.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to ask another question of the \nSenator from Illinois. If, in fact, the Senator from Illinois is \nfinding the same thing I am right now--certainly, we have the highest \nunemployment rate in Michigan--and we are hearing it from all over the \ncountry; we are hearing from people that their unemployment benefits \nare about to expire. They are trying to figure out how they are going \nto make it through the next few months.\n  There are particular concerns that if we do not extend it by the end \nof the year that, in fact, many will have to go out and resign up with \na new bureaucracy to continue benefits.\n  I wonder if the Senator has heard the same kinds of concerns and \nsense of urgency people have about being able to keep a roof over their \nhead, keep food on the table, and keep their health care going--the \nsame sense of urgency that I know we are feeling from people in \nMichigan?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I say in response to the Senator from Michigan, through \nthe Chair, that I am happy to read the latest unemployment statistics \nshowing the number of people declared unemployed each month is going \ndown. We will not feel good about it until it is turned around and we \nare creating jobs again, which I hope is soon.\n  In the meantime, we have about six unemployed people for every job \nthat is available. These people are in a market that is terrible, and \nthey are trying their best. Some have gone back to school. Some are \ngetting training courses. Some are trying to keep things together with \ntheir family and not lose their home because of unemployment.\n  I am sure the Senator from Michigan has met with the unemployed in \nMichigan, as I have in Illinois. Some are, little by little, exhausting \nthe savings they have. Even with COBRA, many people find the COBRA \nprovision, which gives people a chance to buy insurance at discounts, \nis still too expensive. They are without a job. They are running the \nrisk of losing their home. They are without health insurance for their \nchildren and are desperately looking for a job. We certainly do not \nwant to put them in a situation where there is a question mark as to \nwhether after December 31 the unemployment check will be there next \nmonth. I think it is that peace of mind we owe these folks caught up in \nthe bad circumstances of our economy.\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I may conclude, to clarify, we can get this done \ntoday. We can create that peace of mind for families going into the \nholidays, going into Christmas, into the end of the year. We could \nactually do that today in the next few hours?\n  Mr. DURBIN. That is correct, I say to the Senator from Michigan, we \ncan. Earlier we were embroiled in the reading of an amendment that \nwould have literally consumed the entire day and forced us into another \nday's time and run the risk of not providing money for the troops when \nthe continuing resolution, the funding resolution, ran out.\n  The Senator from Vermont withdrew his amendment, and now we have \nmoved to this bill. But there is nothing stopping us. A consent \nagreement can be entered into by both sides of the aisle that can move \nthis through quickly and say to our troops: We are with you.\n  I yield to the Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, will the Senator from Illinois yield \nfor a question?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I am interested in the parliamentary situation that \ntook place earlier whereby one of our Members was actually obliged to \nwithdraw an amendment that was going to be voted on by all of us \nbecause of an insistence on the part of the other side that 800 pages \nbe read by our poor clerk before that vote should take place.\n  I have also heard the other side say that we want to get going, we \nwant to move toward votes. I would be interested in the reflections of \nthe distinguished majority whip on the extent to which a procedural \nobjection to force the clerk to read 800 pages of an amendment, and \ndeny one of our colleagues his vote, fairly represents a desire to move \nforward and get through our votes.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say in response to the Senator from Rhode Island, \nwe have heard repeatedly that people want amendment, debate, and a \nvote. What happened on the floor today, when Senator Coburn of Oklahoma \nrefused to give consent to suspending the reading of the amendment, is \nthat the clerk--clerks, I should say--were forced to start reading. As \ngood as they are at reading, the fact is, it was going to take up to 10 \nhours to read this amendment. During that 10-hour period of time, \nnothing could happen--no debate, no amendments--nothing other than \nlistening to the clerks' melodious voices. Fortunately for us, the \nSenator from Vermont stepped up and said: I withdraw the amendment. But \nif there was a true interest in debate and amendments on health care, \nit is inconsistent to say we are going to take a day out of the whole \naffair and read an amendment.\n  I can tell you, as I said to the Senator from Oklahoma, I can't \nbelieve there is a person in America who sat glued to the C-SPAN \ntelevision listening to this amendment so they would understand it. It \nis a very complicated amendment page by page but, in general, \nunderstandable. The Senator from Vermont was seeking a single-payer \nhealth care system. It was not likely to pass, but it is something he \nbelieves in fervently and he wanted to offer it. So I would say the \nstrategy on the floor today belies any request that we have more debate \nand more amendments.\n  Before the Senator from Rhode Island continues, I think this has been \ncleared on both sides, but I ask unanimous consent that the time until \n6:15 p.m. be equally divided between the two sides, with Senators \npermitted to speak for up to 15 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. If the Senator from Illinois would yield for another \nquestion.\n  I was elected just about 3 years ago, and I came in with the new \nmajority, so I did not have a chance to serve in this body when there \nwas a Republican President and a Republican majority. I wonder if the \nSenator, who was here at that time, would reflect on how the other side \nviewed Defense appropriations for our troops during the Iraq war when \nthey were in the majority. Were they desirous of delay and obstruction \nand debate and procedural maneuver on Defense appropriations at that \ntime or is this a new strategy of theirs?\n  Mr. DURBIN. I would say to my colleague from Rhode Island that \nexactly the opposite was true. They wanted to move quickly to pass any \nappropriations bill to make certain there was no question in the minds \nof our men and women in uniform that we were standing with them, and we \ndid. I don't believe even those of us who voted against the invasion of \nIraq tried to stop the proceedings from funding the troops, regardless \nof what our votes might be.\n  So I think it would be consistent now for our colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle to join us, in a bipartisan fashion, to say whatever \ndifferences on other issues, such as health care, let's let the troops \nknow this holiday season we stand behind them--Republicans and \nDemocrats--and let's do it in an efficient and effective way.\n  Since this unanimous consent request has been granted, I am going to\n\n[[Page S13299]]\n\nyield the floor and any of my colleagues who wish to speak, it will be \nequally divided time for the next 2 hours.\n  At this time, I yield the floor. Mr. President, if no one seeks time, \nI suggest the absence of a quorum and I ask unanimous consent that \nduring the time of the quorum the time be equally divided between both \nsides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Florida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, while we have been here discussing health \ncare, the clock has been ticking on our national debt. Just in the \nfirst 2 months of this fiscal year, we have accumulated $296 billion in \ndebt. We took in revenues of $268 billion, and we spent $565 billion. \nWe spent double what we took in just in the first 2 months of the \nfiscal year.\n  I know you are new to this Chamber, Mr. President, as am I. I have \nonly been here 90 days, but I have been here long enough to know this \nsystem is broken. It doesn't work. Neither this body nor the body \nacross the Capitol has an ability to make ends meet. We continue to \nspend money we do not have. We spend the money of our children and our \ngrandchildren. Right now we have a $12 trillion debt. It took us 167 \nyears in this country just to amass a $1 trillion debt in 1982. Now we \nare at $12 trillion. Every family in this country is now responsible \nfor $100,000 of debt.\n  Where are we getting this money? We are borrowing it from countries \nsuch as China, and it is hurting our standing in the world. Central \nbanks that hold American currency are shedding those dollars because \nthey no longer believe our country is a good investment. I worry about \nour children and our grandchildren. I have three sons, as you know, \nMax, Taylor and Chase--they are 6, 4 and 2--and we have a baby on the \nway in March. I am very worried that my children will not be able to \nexperience the American dream like you and I have; to be able to be in \nthe Senate, to be able to achieve all of our goals, whether in public \nservice or in private. I do not believe America is going to be the same \nplace for them, that it is going to hold the same opportunities because \nI believe this debt is going to strangle us.\n  If this body and the body across the Capitol don't figure out we need \nto start making ends meet and stop spending the dollars of future \ngenerations, this country will not be the leader of the world. It will \nnot have the promise we have all enjoyed.\n  I rise today to speak about S.J. Res. 22, which I filed yesterday. It \nis a constitutional amendment that requires the Congress to balance its \nbudget and also gives to the President of the United States a line-item \nveto so he, like most of the Governors in this country, can strike out \ninappropriate budget items, these earmarks that you hear about.\n  Senator McCain spoke this weekend about $2.5 million to the \nUniversity of Nebraska to study operations and medical procedures in \nspace. We cannot afford that program under any circumstance, and we \ncertainly can't afford programs like that when we are $12 trillion in \ndebt. These dollar numbers are so big they are hard to comprehend.\n  What does $1 trillion mean? What does $1 billion mean? In Washington \nwe throw these amounts around, and we do not even comprehend them. I \nknow for the American people at home it is hard to get their minds \naround how much money this is. I have said this on the Senate floor \nbefore, and I am going to keep saying it so people understand that \nevery dollar we spend is a choice.\n  One million dollars laid edge to edge on the ground would cover two \nfootball fields. One billion dollars laid edge to edge on the ground \nwould cover the city of Key West, FL, 3.7 square miles. And $1 trillion \nwould cover the State of Rhode Island--twice. If you stacked them on \nthe ground going up into the sky, it would be 600 miles of one-dollar \nbills.\n  Every dollar is a choice, and these numbers are out of control. Just \nthis past Saturday we voted on a spending bill, a spending bill that \nhad a 12-percent increase and $40 billion more than last year. I want \nto give the American people the sense of what you could do with this \nkind of money, what good you could do or, better yet, you could give it \nback to the American people and they could decide what good they could \ndo with those dollars for their families.\n  With $100 billion, we could give every Floridian a $5,000 tax cut.\n  With $200 billion we could pay the salary of every teacher for a \nyear. With $300 billion we could pay first-year tuition at a university \nof their choice for every kid who is in K-12. With $400 billion, we \ncould build high-speed rail for 10,000 miles. We could connect Key West \nto Anchorage and back.\n  Every dollar is a choice. We are spending money out of control. \nSimilar to those who have come before me, I will sound the alarm \nbecause we still haven't done anything about this problem. There are \ngood measures out there. Senator Gregg from New Hampshire has a \nmeasure, along with Senator Conrad, to put together a commission. I \nsupport that. Senator Sessions has a measure to bring caps back. Up \nuntil about 2002, we actually were making headway against the budget. \nThen those caps expired and spending went out of control.\n  I support all those efforts. I support any effort to bring spending \nunder control. This body doesn't have any leadership on spending. Look \nat what we spend. We don't look at the revenues coming in the door.\n  I served as chief of staff to a Governor in Florida. When the budget \nstarted to go bad in 2007, I was on the phone monthly with the person \nwho determined our receipts. I knew in Florida we could only spend as \nmuch money as we had. This institution does not work that way. No one \neven checks to see what kind of money we are bringing in. We just \nspend.\n  I wish to talk to the American people about articles in the Wall \nStreet Journal of today. This is not a Democratic problem or a \nRepublican problem. This is a problem of this institution. The article \nis titled ``The Audacity of Debt.'' I wish to read one paragraph. I ask \nunanimous consent that the full article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Dec. 16, 2009]\n\n                          The Audacity of Debt\n\n\n            Comparing today's deficits to those in the 1980s\n\n        At least someone in America isn't feeling a credit \n     squeeze: Uncle Sam. This week Congress will vote to raise the \n     national debt ceiling by nearly $2 trillion, to a total of \n     $14 trillion. In this economy, everyone de-leverages except \n     government.\n       It's a sign of how deep the fiscal pathologies run in this \n     Congress that $2 trillion will buy the federal government \n     only one year before it has to seek another debt hike--\n     conveniently timed to come after the midterm elections. Since \n     Democrats began running Congress again in 2007, the federal \n     debt limit has climbed by 39 percent. The new hike will lift \n     the borrowing cap by another 15 percent.\n       There is surely bipartisan blame for this government debt \n     boom. George W. Bush approved gigantic spending increases for \n     Medicare and bailouts. He also sponsored the first \n     ineffective``stimulus'' in February 2008--consisting of $168 \n     billion in tax rebates and spending that depleted federal \n     revenues in return for no economic lift.\n       Democrats ridiculed Mr. Bush as ``the most fiscally \n     irresponsible President in history,'' but then they saw him \n     and raised. They took an $800 billion deficit and made it \n     $1.4 trillion in 2009 and perhaps that high again in 2010. In \n     10 months they have approved more than $1 trillion in \n     spending that has saved union public jobs but has done little \n     to assist private job creation. Still to come is the \n     multitrillion-dollar health bill and another $100 billion to \n     $200 billion ``jobs'' bill.\n       We've never obsessed over the budget deficit, because the \n     true cost of government is the amount it spends, not the \n     amount it borrows. Milton Friedman used to say that the \n     nation would be far better off with a budget half the current \n     size but with larger deficits. Mr. Obama and his allies in \n     Congress have done the opposite: They have increased the \n     budget by 50 percent and financed the spending with IOUs.\n       Our concern is that the Administration and Congress view \n     this debt as a way to force a permanently higher tax base for \n     decades to come. The liberal grand strategy is to use their \n     accidentally large majorities this year to pass new \n     entitlements that start small but will explode in future \n     years. U.S. creditors will then demand higher taxes--taking\n\n[[Page S13300]]\n\n     income taxes back to their pre-Reagan rates and adding a \n     value-added tax too. This would expand federal spending as a \n     share of GDP to as much as 30 percent from the pre-crisis 20 \n     percent.\n       Remember the 1980s and 1990s when liberals said they \n     worried about the debt? We now know they were faking it. When \n     the Gipper chopped income and business tax rates by roughly \n     25 percent and then authorized a military build-up, Democrats \n     and their favorite economists predicted doom for a decade. \n     The late Paul Samuelson, the revered dean of the neo-\n     Keynesians, expressed the prevailing view in those days when \n     he called the Reagan deficits ``an all-consuming evil.''\n       But wait: Those ``evil'' Reagan deficits averaged less than \n     $200 billion a year, or about one-quarter as large in real \n     terms as today's deficit. The national debt held by the \n     public reached its peak in the Reagan years at 40.9 percent, \n     and hit 49.2 percent in 1995--This year debt will hit 61 \n     percent of GDP, heading to 68 percent soon even by the White \n     House's optimistic estimates.\n       Our view is that there is good and bad public borrowing. In \n     the 1980s federal deficits financed a military buildup that \n     ended the Cold War (leading to an annual peace dividend in \n     the 1990s of 3 percent of GDP), as well as tax cuts that \n     ended the stagflation of the 1970s and began 25 years of \n     prosperity. Those were high return investments.\n       Today's debt has financed . . . what exactly? The TARP \n     money did undergird the financial system for a time and is \n     now being repaid. But most of the rest has been spent on a \n     political wish list of public programs ranging from \n     unemployment insurance to wind turbines to tax credits for \n     golf carts. Borrowing for such low return purposes makes \n     America poorer in the long run.\n       By the way, today's spending and debt totals don't account \n     for the higher debt-servicing costs that are sure to come. \n     The President's own budget office forecasts that annual \n     interest payments by 2019 will be $774 billion, which will be \n     more than the federal government will spend that year on \n     national defense, education, transportation--in fact, all \n     nondefense discretionary programs.\n       Democrats want to pass the debt limit increase as a \n     stowaway on the defense funding bill, hoping that few will \n     notice while pledging to reduce spending at some future date. \n     Republicans ought to force a long and careful debate that \n     educates the public. Ultimately, the U.S. government has to \n     pay its bills and the debt limit bill will have to pass. But \n     debt limit votes are one of the few times historically when \n     taxpayer advocates have leverage on Capitol Hill. Republicans \n     and Democrats who care should use it to discuss genuine ways \n     to put Washington on a renewed and tighter spending regime.\n       ``Washington is shifting the burden of bad choices today \n     onto the backs of our children and grandchildren,'' Senator \n     Barack Obama said during the 2006 debt-ceiling debate. \n     ``America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. \n     Americans deserve better.'' That was $2 trillion ago, when \n     someone else was President.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Reading from the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       Democrats ridiculed Mr. Bush as ``the most fiscally \n     irresponsible President in history,'' but then they saw him \n     and raised. They took an $800 billion deficit and made it \n     $1.4 trillion in 2009 and perhaps that high again in 2010. In \n     10 months they have approved more than $1 trillion in \n     spending that has saved union public jobs but has done little \n     to assist private job creation. Still to come is this \n     multitrillion-dollar health care bill and another $100 \n     billion to $200 billion ``jobs'' bill.\n\n  We can't afford the programs we have, let alone the programs we want. \nI filed this joint resolution to have a balanced budget. I filed the \njoint resolution to give the President the line-item veto like \nGovernors do. I know I am tilting at windmills. I know there are very \nfew people in this Chamber or the Chamber down the hall who have the \ncourage to do this. They are part of the process. They go along and get \nalong. But I am fresh enough to still remember how things work in the \nreal world. We have to change things. Our children are not going to \nhave this great country. I am so afraid that one of my kids is going to \ncome to me when they are 18 or 22 and say: Dad, I am going to go to \nanother country to make my living. I am going to go to Ireland or Chile \nor India because I have a better opportunity there to succeed. I can't \npay 60 percent in taxes. I can't assume what will then be a $23 or $30 \nbillion debt.\n  We are not even talking about all the entitlements we haven't paid \nfor. We are not talking about all the money we have raided out of \nMedicare and Social Security in order to pay for current expenses. Some \npeople say those obligations are more than $60 trillion, numbers we \ncan't even comprehend.\n  I filed this resolution. I will send a letter to every Governor \nasking them to adopt it in advance of the Congress taking it up. A \nconstitutional amendment requires two-thirds of both Chambers and \nthree-quarters of the States. They can act first. They can send letters \nand resolutions from their legislators to this legislative body and \nsay: Get your act under control.\n  It affects them too. This new health care bill is going to send an \nunfunded mandate to the States and increase Medicaid from 100 percent \nof poverty to 133 percent. They will have to pay that bill. It is going \nto cost Florida in 10 years almost $1 billion. Right now, in Florida, \nthe No. 1 expenditure in our budget is Medicaid. Because we balance our \nbudget, that means we take money away from teachers and education. That \nmeans we take money away from law enforcement. It is out of control.\n  I am here to say the siren is sounding. The ship is going to hit the \niceberg. We can't make just incremental change because then we will \njust hit the side of the iceberg. We have to make substantial change. \nThe people in this body have to have the courage to do it. We can't \njust go along and get along as we have before. We cannot be tone deaf. \nThe American people are onto us. They understand we are spending money \nwe don't have. I will not stand by and let this great country fall into \ndecline without at least arguing and pushing as strenuously as I can \nfor a solution. I am willing to work with men and women of good will on \nboth sides of the aisle to solve the problem. I am new here. I might \nnot have all the answers. I probably don't. But I will surely work \nhard. I know this is one solution. If every State can have a balanced \nbudget amendment and 43 States can have a line-item veto, why can't \nthis body?\n  I have filed this resolution. I look forward to talking about it \nmore. I hope this body will take it seriously. I see my friend from \nMassachusetts is here. He also is new to this body, although he spent \nmany years working here. We have to do things differently. We throw \naround billions and trillions like it is just nickles and dimes in our \npockets. It is not. Every dollar is a choice. It is a choice to make. \nIf we don't make the right choice, it will be a choice our children and \ngrandchildren will suffer under.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, ``The need for comprehensive national health \ninsurance and concomitant changes in the organization and delivery of \nhealth care in the United States is the single most important issue of \nhealth policy today.'' Those are not my words. Those are the words of \nSenator Edward M. Kennedy. The ``today'' of which he spoke was December \n16, 1969, exactly 40 years ago today. It was his first major speech on \nhealth care reform, and I was privileged to be a young member of his \nstaff. He delivered that speech to a group of physicians at Boston \nUniversity Medical Center.\n  Senator Kennedy went on to say:\n\n       If we are to reach our goal of bringing adequate health \n     care to all our citizens, we must have full cooperation \n     between Congress, the administration, and the health \n     professionals. We already possess the knowledge and the \n     technology to achieve our goal. All we need is the will. The \n     challenge is enormous, but I am confident that we are all \n     equal to the task.\n\n  The world has progressed in many ways since he spoke those words four \ndecades ago, but our health care system has not. In 1969, the United \nStates spent $18 billion on health care. Today we spend over $2 \ntrillion a year. Senator Kennedy pointed out, in 1969, that the Nation \nfaced a shortage of primary care doctors. The reimbursement rates for \nphysicians treating Medicare and Medicaid patients were too low. There \nwas a need to support greater innovation in delivering care, and \nneighborhood health centers were underfunded. He said we needed to \ndevelop an effective means of providing quality, affordable care to all \nAmericans, regardless of their standing in life.\n  Does all this sound familiar? Yes. But that was then and this is now.\n  In recent weeks, Senators on both sides of the aisle have come to \nthis floor to debate the merits of the Patient Protection and \nAffordable Care Act. We have had our differences of opinion, to be \nsure. But on one issue there is no dispute. When it comes to our health \ncare system, there is no such thing as a status quo. We will move \nforward or we will continue to fall behind.\n  Here is what we will face, if we do not pass this reform. Premiums \nwill skyrocket and could consume as much as 45 percent of a median \nfamily's income by 2016. Bankruptcies will increase due to families not \nbeing able to\n\n[[Page S13301]]\n\nafford their medical costs. More Americans will be uninsured. Small and \nlarge businesses will suffer financially due to health cost increases. \nHealth care could constitute as much as 28 percent of our Nation's GDP \nby 2030. Fifteen percent of the Federal budget could be dedicated to \nMedicare and Medicaid by 2040.\n  Ted Kennedy had a keen sense of history. He knew Germany adopted the \nidea of national health insurance in the 1880s, that Britain, France, \nand a number of other European nations embraced the concept after the \nFirst World War, that Canada has had a publicly funded system since the \n1950s. He would ask, as he did in 1969 and again in 2009: If all these \nnations understood long ago that their economic health was ultimately \ntied to the health of their people, why does the United States stand \nalone as the only major industrial nation in the world that fails to \nguarantee health care for all its citizens?\n  It is not that we have never sought this goal in the past. \nPresidents, Republicans and Democrats, over many decades, have proposed \nnational health insurance in America. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, \nFranklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and \nBill Clinton all made health reform a part of their agenda. Now we \nstand on the threshold of history. Never has this country been so close \nto bringing affordable, quality health care to millions of America's \nfamilies. Today, under President Obama's leadership, the goal is within \nour reach. Failure is not an option. All interested parties have been \nbrought to the table. Physicians, hospitals, insurance companies, small \nbusinesses, pharmaceutical companies, and many others have had an \nopportunity to present their suggestions and offer their input. Dozens \nof hearings were held on all topics related to this issue.\n  The House of Representatives has acted. The Senate HELP Committee, \nthrough the diligence of Senators Kennedy, Dodd, and Harkin and the \nFinance Committee, under the leadership of Senator Baucus, held lengthy \nexecutive sessions that discussed all areas of reform and delivered and \ndeveloped their respective bills. Due to the hard work and tireless \npatience of the majority leader, we have one merged bill before us, a \nsingle piece of legislation which will improve the lives of millions of \nAmericans in the following ways. It expands coverage to an additional \n31 million Americans, bringing health insurance to almost 94 percent of \nour citizens. It saves money by rewarding the quality and value of \ncare, not the quantity and volume of care. It controls the cost of \nskyrocketing premiums and limits out-of-pocket expenses. It reduces the \nFederal deficit by an estimated $130 billion in the first 10 years and \nan estimated $650 billion in the second 10 years. It stimulates \ncompetition in the health insurance marketplace through establishment \nof exchanges. It strengthens Medicare by reducing unnecessary spending, \nlowering prescription costs, and closing the so-called doughnut hole. \nIt attacks fraudulent and wasteful spending and helps to correct abuses \nin the system. It rewards wellness and prevention by expanding access \nto advice on how to live a healthy lifestyle by practicing good \nnutrition, increasing physical activity, and quitting smoking.\n  It eliminates unfair discrimination against patients by preventing \ninsurance firms from denying certain coverage to women or to \nindividuals with preexisting conditions.\n  It promotes flexibility and innovation in new health care \ntechnologies. It introduces a self-funded, voluntary choice for long-\nterm services and support for the elderly and disabled. Most of all, it \nsaves lives by providing affordable, quality care for individuals, \nfamilies, and small businesses.\n  In my State of Massachusetts, because of our successful reform, the \nrate of the uninsured has been reduced to 2.7 percent of the \npopulation, and the lives of thousands of citizens of our Commonwealth \nhave been immeasurably improved.\n  Carol's case is one example. Carol did not realize the importance of \nhaving quality, affordable health insurance until she was confronted \nwith the gravity of her own health problems. She is a 24-year-old woman \nsuffering from seizures and desperately in need of help.\n  She remembers having occasional seizures as a child. They occurred \nmostly when she was overtired. As Carol grew older, the seizures became \nmore frequent. One day, she had an episode when driving her car. \nFortunately, her passenger was able to assist her. But that frightening \nincident convinced Carol to seek professional help.\n  She learned about the assistance of Health Care For All, the \nMassachusetts organization dedicated to making quality, affordable \nhealth care accessible to everyone. She applied and was declared \neligible for Commonwealth Care. She immediately went to see a \nspecialist and was given the health care she needed.\n  Carol expressed her gratitude in these words:\n\n       I definitely feel blessed to be a Massachusetts resident. I \n     can't thank Health Care For All and MassHealth enough for all \n     the support given to me. The Helpline counselors literally \n     held my hands and brought me to live a healthy life, where \n     there is no fear or embarrassment, but there is knowledge and \n     a total control of my seizures. So, thank you so much all of \n     you who make this happen in people's lives.\n\n  We should all think about Carol and the millions of working families \nacross the country when we vote for this legislation. It is our \nresponsibility to enact laws that make a positive difference in \npeople's lives, and that is what this bill is all about.\n  Senator Ted Kennedy envisioned a better America where, as he said:\n\n       [E]very American--north, south, east, west, young, old--\n     will have decent, quality health care as a fundamental right \n     and not a privilege.\n\n  This is a historic moment in our national life. We have the chance to \nfinally complete the work that a respected Republican President called \nfor over a century ago. Quality health care for all has always been \nneeded in America but never more than now. The finish line is clearly \nin sight. The momentum and the energy are with us, and it is our \nobligation to seize this historic moment.\n  Every Member of this body is aware of the valiant fight Senator \nKennedy waged for his own health during the last 15 months of his life. \nMany of you saw him, after receiving radiation and chemotherapy in the \nmorning in Boston, walk into this Chamber that he loved to cast a \ndeciding vote in the afternoon on the issue he proudly called the cause \nof his life.\n  While being treated at Massachusetts General Hospital, Senator \nKennedy met a woman named Karen List. Her daughter Emily was one of \nmany patients receiving a similar regimen of exhausting cancer \ntreatments. They came from different walks of life, and cancer had \ntouched them all.\n  In September 2008, after Emily's long summer of treatments, Karen \nwrote about Senator Kennedy and other patients he had met during his \ntreatment. She wrote:\n\n       Now, it is almost fall, and little Caroline is starting \n     kindergarten. Senator Kennedy, who came from a hospital bed \n     to speak at the convention, is planning his return to the \n     Senate in January. Alex, an Apache helicopter pilot, is back \n     at Fort Campbell and expects to be deployed to Afghanistan in \n     the New Year. And Emily hopes to be well enough by spring to \n     return to her life in London. The dream, as Senator Kennedy \n     promised, does live on.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the article by Karen List \nin the Daily Hampshire Gazette be printed in the Record.\n       There being no objection, the material was ordered to be \n     printed in the Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Daily Hampshire Gazette, Sept. 8, 2008]\n\n           A Champion of Health Comforts his Fellow Patients\n\n                            (by Karen List)\n\n       As Sen. Ted Kennedy's distinctive voice passed the torch at \n     the Democratic National Convention and promised us that the \n     dream lives on, all I could think of was that same \n     distinctive voice several weeks ago calling out: ``Where's \n     Emily?''\n       Ted was at the other end of the hall in the Proton Therapy \n     Center, Dept. of Radiation Oncology, at Massachusetts General \n     Hospital, where both the senator and my daughter Emily were \n     being treated for cancer.\n       The proton beam is cutting-edge treatment for certain types \n     of tumors, and the MGH center is one of only five in the \n     country and a handful in the world.\n       We were lucky to be there, though it was getting \n     increasingly hard to feel lucky as seven weeks of daily \n     treatment took their toll on Emily and the other patients at \n     the center.\n       They ranged in age from toddlers to the elderly. Little \n     Caroline was 5. Senator Kennedy was 77. In between them were \n     Emily, 23,\n\n[[Page S13302]]\n\n     and Alex, 26, two of just a few young adults in proton beam \n     treatment.\n       Radiation burn was the worst side effect for many patients, \n     and it was now preventing Emily from eating or talking. She \n     was at a low point, and she needed a lift.\n       We had seen Teddy come and go for several days, slipping in \n     through a side entrance and out the same way, always \n     accompanied by his wife, Vicki. When our eyes happened to \n     meet, we exchanged a thumb's up and were treated to that \n     Kennedy smile--as distinctive as the voice.\n       The day before Ted's treatment was to end, Emily's nurse \n     stopped by the room where she was being treated and pulled \n     the curtain aside. Several minutes later we heard him call \n     from the other end of the hallway: ``Where's Emily?'' And \n     then he was there, talking to her, encouraging her--and just \n     as quickly, he was gone.\n       Emily was so excited that she was hopping up and down in \n     the bed from a reclining position, if such a thing is \n     possible. But because she couldn't talk, she hadn't been able \n     to say a word to one of the few politicians she really \n     admires.\n       The next day, our nurse delivered the card we'd written to \n     the senator, explaining how thrilled Emily had been to meet \n     him and how distressed she was that she couldn't tell him so \n     herself. On the card was a photo of Emily at her favorite \n     English pub, smiling her own distinctive smile. She had been \n     home for a short break from her work interning in the London \n     Theater when she'd been diagnosed with cancer. Now she was \n     battling to get her work and her life back.\n       Teddy had just finished his treatment. This time, as he \n     came down the hall for the last time, Emily was ready. On the \n     slate that she'd been using to communicate, she'd written in \n     purple marker: ``We love you, Ted.'' The senator laughed, \n     walked to her bedside and whispered to her for a few minutes \n     in solidarity, while Vicki talked to Emily's dad and me. We \n     exchanged heartfelt good wishes for each other as they left \n     the center to return home.\n       Emily had another week of treatment left. During that time, \n     her nurse told us how concerned Sen. Kennedy had been about \n     the other patients, especially the children and young \n     people--and their parents. He had been through this same \n     experience with his own son decades earlier when only one \n     type of chemotherapy was available, unlike the cocktail of \n     diverse chemo drugs that patients like Emily receive today.\n       This lifelong champion of health care for all Americans, \n     especially children, had experienced once again--this time as \n     the patient himself--what first-rate cancer care could mean. \n     And he intends to continue fighting for its accessibility to \n     everyone as the senior Democrat on the Health, Education, \n     Labor, and Pensions Committee.\n       On Emily's last day at the center, there was a special gift \n     waiting for her. Ted had left her a copy of his book, ``My \n     Senator and Me: A Dog's-Eye View of Washington, D.C.,'' \n     written by him and his dog Splash. It was inscribed: ``To \n     Emily--Splash and I hope you enjoy.''\n       And she did. Ted had provided just the encouragement she \n     needed. He'd also left a stack of books for other young \n     patients and the book on tape for those whose vision had been \n     compromised by their treatments.\n       Now it's almost fall, and little Caroline is starting \n     kindergarten. Senator Kennedy, who came from a hospital bed \n     to speak at the convention, is planning his return to the \n     Senate in January. Alex, an Apache helicopter pilot, is back \n     at Ft. Campbell and expects to be deployed to Afghanistan in \n     the New Year. And Emily hopes to be well enough by spring to \n     return to her life in London.\n       The dream, as Senator Kennedy promised, does live on.\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Karen's was a statement of hope--hope and promise for each \nof these patients in the face of daunting odds. Their age did not \nmatter; their economic status did not matter; each received the highest \nquality of health care available. And so it should be for all our \npeople.\n  Senator Kennedy understood that we are all connected to one another. \nHe often referred to President Lincoln's words about our common \nhumanity and the good that can come to us all when touched ``by the \nbetter angels of our nature.'' And he knew that on no issue are our \nfutures more connected than on health care.\n  Ted Kennedy's voice still echoes in this Chamber. His spirit of hope \nand strength, of determination and perseverance is still felt here. He \nsaid:\n\n       For all my years in public life, I have believed that \n     America must sail toward the shores of liberty and justice \n     for all. There is no end to that journey, only the next great \n     voyage. We know the future will outlast all of us, but I \n     believe that all of us will live on in the future we make.\n\n  Let each of us in this Senate be moved by the better angels of our \nnature and make that future a better one for our generation and for \ngenerations to come. As Ted Kennedy said 40 years ago: ``All we need is \nthe will.'' This is our time, Mr. President. Let us pass this \nlegislation now.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the speech delivered by \nSenator Edward M. Kennedy on December 16, 1969, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Address by Senator Edward M. Kennedy, Lowell Lecture Series, Boston \n     University Medical Center--Lowell Institute, December 16, 1969\n\n       I am delighted to be in Boston today under the auspices of \n     the Boston University Medical Center and the Lowell Institute \n     to address this distinguished audience of medical educators, \n     private physicians, and lay men concerned with the quality of \n     health care in America.\n       I am particularly pleased to be here because it gives me \n     the opportunity to commend the many worthy accomplishments of \n     the Boston University Medical Center and its School of \n     Medicine. You have succeeded in breaking down walls that for \n     decades have turned medicine inward toward the age-old \n     trinity of patient care, research and teaching. You have \n     expanded your horizon to embrace the equally important area \n     beyond your walls--the community in which we live.\n       For more than 90 years, your Home Medical Service has taken \n     students into the community and provided model health care \n     and innovative medical services in the home. Your expanding \n     programs of new hospital affiliation have brought modern \n     urban medicine to outlying communities. You have helped to \n     lead the way in efforts throughout the world to unify cancer \n     care with cancer research, so that today's advances in the \n     laboratory become tomorrow's accepted treatment. Your School \n     of Graduate Dentistry, dedicated in September, will provide \n     high quality dental care as part of the Medical Center's \n     total health program for the community.\n       In the course of the past decade, your pioneering program \n     in community psychiatry and mental health in the South End \n     and Roxbury--launched long before the Great Society and the \n     Office of Economic Opportunity came into being and made such \n     programs fashionable--have become a model for the nation. You \n     helped develop what is now the rallying cry for health \n     planning in America--that new health programs must be \n     designed with the people and by the people, not just for the \n     people. As Dr. Handler has so eloquently stated, your far-\n     reaching role in community involvement is like a man standing \n     by a river watching people drown:\n       ``Medicine traditionally wades in,'' he said, ``and tries \n     to save them one at a time. After doing this repeatedly, you \n     can't help but ask what is happening upstream. It seemed \n     sensible to go back and find out why all the people were \n     falling in, and try to do something about it.''\n       I commend you for your leadership in looking upstream, and \n     for the remarkable efforts you are making in preventive \n     community medicine and all the other major areas of this \n     great center's activity.\n       Six weeks ago in Springfield, I had the occasion to discuss \n     what I regard as the single overriding economic issue of the \n     day--the war against inflation. As I have frequently stated, \n     the war against inflation is a war that can and must be won \n     without the cost of heavy unemployment. It is a war that can \n     and must be won without cutting back on our important \n     domestic priorities.\n       Nowhere is the impact of inflation more obvious than in the \n     rising cost of medical care. Never has the gift of good \n     health been more precious:\n       In the last three years, the cost of health has risen by 22 \n     per cent, or nearly double the rise in general consumer \n     prices.\n       Hospital daily service charges have soared by the \n     astronomical rate of 55 per cent, or nearly five times the \n     rise in consumer prices. The average cost of a hospital day \n     is now $68. It will rise to $74 next year, and to $98 by \n     1973.\n       Physicians' fees have risen by 21 per cent. Doctors line up \n     at lawyers' offices to form corporations and raid the Federal \n     Treasury for hundreds of thousands of dollars a year in \n     deferred taxes.\n       All of this inflation has occurred during the early years \n     of Medicare and the troubled Medicaid program. The most \n     rewarding experience of Medicare has been its success in \n     solving the serious problem of health costs for our poor and \n     our aged citizens. In spite of inflation, Medicare has been \n     immensely popular. It is liked and accepted by the people.\n       The most painful experience of Medicare and Medicaid has \n     been their unfulfilled promise. We sought to spread the \n     benefits of medical science and technology to millions of \n     Americans, without considering the anachronistic and obsolete \n     structure of the system by which the health services would be \n     delivered. Unwisely, as many experts have recognized, we \n     assumed that all that stood between our poor and aged \n     citizens and high quality medical care was a money ticket \n     into the mainstream of modern American medicine.\n       We know now that we were wrong. The money ticket was \n     important, but it was not enough to solve the problem. In the \n     years since Medicare and Medicaid were enacted, we have \n     learned that medical insurance and payment programs could not \n     be translated instantaneously into more doctors, more nurses, \n     more health facilities, or better organization of the \n     delivery system.\n       In wedding new purchasing power to the already existing \n     demand for health services, we did nothing to solve an \n     already intolerable situation. The cost of health care began\n\n[[Page S13303]]\n\n     to soar. In some cases, the quality of care declined, and an \n     enormous strain was placed on the capacity of our existing \n     health services and facilities. When an already overworked \n     physician goes from seeing one hundred patients a day to \n     seeing two hundred patients a day, the quality of his care is \n     inevitably affected. His only escape is to consign more of \n     his patients to hospital treatment, thereby increasing the \n     strain on hospital facilities and hospital costs.\n       Today in the United States, health care is big business. \n     Indeed, it is the fastest growing failing business in the \n     nation--a $60 billion industry that fails to meet the \n     urgent demands of our people. Today, more than ever \n     before, we are spending more on health care and enjoying \n     it less. By 1975, we may be spending $100 billion a year \n     on health and be worse off than we are now in terms of the \n     quality and responsiveness of our health care system.\n       Perhaps the most serious fault in the present situation is \n     the failure of the Federal Government to play a greater role \n     in improving the quality of the nation's health care. Health \n     is big business in America, and the Federal Government has \n     become a major partner in this business. The total outlays \n     for medical and health-related activities in the Federal \n     budget estimated for 1970 are $18 billion, or nearly one-\n     third of the total health expenditures in the nation. The \n     outlays for 1970 are divided among 14 principal departments \n     and agencies. By far the largest amount--$13 billion--is \n     expended by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, \n     but significant amounts are also expended by the Department \n     of Defense--$2 billion--and the Veterans Administration--$1.7 \n     billion.\n       In 1960, the total outlays for health in the Federal budget \n     were only $3 billion. Thus, in the decade of the Sixties \n     alone, we have had a six-fold increase in total Federal \n     outlays for health. Indeed, almost 10 per cent of the total \n     Federal budget now goes for health. The major share of the \n     rise in recent years has been for Medicare and Medicaid. Yet, \n     in spite of the dramatic increases in the health budget and \n     the large amounts we are now spending, there is almost no one \n     who believes that either the Federal Government or the \n     private citizen is getting full value for his health dollar.\n       Of course, a significant proportion of the increase in \n     health expenditures is being consumed by rising costs and our \n     growing population. Between 1950 and 1969, personal health \n     care expenditures increased by $42 billion. Of this increase, \n     50 per cent was attributable to rising coats, and another 19 \n     per cent was attributable to population growth, so that only \n     31 per cent of the increase represents real growth in health \n     supplies and services over the past two decades.\n       Although the conventional wisdom is content to blame our \n     current medical inflation on Medicare and Medicaid and the \n     excess demand created by these programs for health care, \n     there is another, more controversial aspect to the rising \n     prices. At Professor Rashi Fein and other experts in the \n     field of the economics of medicine have made clear, the basic \n     models used by economists are not appropriate when applied to \n     health. The medical market. is characterized by the absence \n     of competition, diverse products, and consumer ignorance. \n     Comparisons of quality and performance are extremely \n     difficult, if not impossible.\n       In other words, the medical marketplace is an area where \n     the laws of supply and demand do not operate cleanly, and \n     where physicians have a relatively large amount of discretion \n     in setting their fees. Thus, at the time Medicaid and \n     Medicare were instituted, fees rose for a variety of reasons, \n     many of which were unrelated to the creation of excess \n     demand:\n       Some physicians raised their fees in anticipation of a \n     Federal fee freeze.\n       Some raised their fees in the face of rising hospital \n     costs, in order simply to preserve their slice of the growing \n     health pie.\n       Some raised their fees simply because they had the \n     discretion to do so, and decided to take advantage of the \n     instability and price consciousness generated by the new \n     Federal programs.\n       As In the case of physicians' fees, the economic model of \n     supply and demand does not tell the whole story of rising \n     hospital costs. In part, hospitals took the opportunity to \n     provide substantial--and wholly justified--wage and salary \n     increases to their notoriously underpaid employees. In part, \n     costs rose because the new Federal financing methods \n     contained few incentives for improving efficiency, but simply \n     encouraged hospitals to pass the higher costs on to \n     Washington.\n       The high cost of medical care is but one aspect of the \n     overall health crisis, In America today, it is clear that we \n     are facing a critical shortage of health manpower. Indeed, at \n     bottom, our crisis in medicine is essentially a crisis in \n     manpower. The need is urgent for more physicians, more \n     dentists, more nurses, and more allied health professional \n     and technical workers. We must develop new types of health \n     professionals and pare-professionals. We must make far more \n     efficient utilization of our existing health manpower. Only \n     if we succeed in these efforts will we be able to free our \n     physicians and highly trained medical experts to perform the \n     sort of intricate operations and sensitive counselling \n     discussed by Dean Redlich in the inaugural lecture in this \n     series.\n       The need is especially clear in the case of the shortage of \n     doctors. Our low physician-population ratio means that \n     unsatisfactory medical care is a way of life for large \n     numbers of our people in many parts of our nation. In 1967, \n     in the United States as a whole, there were 260,000 private \n     physicians providing patient care for our 200 million people. \n     This is a ratio of 130 physicians for every 100,000 citizens, \n     or one doctor for every 700 people.\n       At first glance, the ratio appears to be fairly close to \n     the satisfactory ratio generally recommended by many health \n     experts, but the figures are misleading. The family doctor--\n     the general practitioner--is fast disappearing, and is on the \n     verge of becoming an extinct species. At the present time \n     only one out of four of the nation's physicians is engaged in \n     the general practice of medicine. Three out of four are \n     specialists, most of whom accept patients only on a referral \n     basis. The true doctor-population ratio, therefore, is more \n     like one general practitioner per three thousand population, \n     a ratio that is clearly unacceptable for adequate health care \n     for our people. For far too many of our citizens, the only \n     ``doctor'' they know is the cold and impersonal emergency \n     ward of the municipal hospital.\n       To make matters worse, the geographic distribution of our \n     doctors is highly uneven. Two-thirds of our physicians serve \n     the more affluent half of our population. In some states, of \n     course, the physician-population ratio is higher than the \n     national average of 130 doctors per 100,000 population. In \n     Washington, D.C., the ratio is 318; in New York it is 199; in \n     Massachusetts, 181.\n       In sixteen states, however, the physician-population ratio \n     is far below the national average. In Alaska and Mississippi, \n     the ratio is an abysmal 69, or about one-half the national \n     average. In Alabama, it is 75. Even in Texas, it is only 106. \n     Clearly, therefore, extremely large groups of our population \n     are receiving seriously inadequate medical care because of \n     the shortage of physicians.\n       One of our most urgent needs to meet this crisis is a \n     stronger Federal program to expand existing medical schools \n     and establish new schools. We must substantially increase the \n     output of doctors from our medical schools. At the present \n     time, about 8,000 students are graduated from our medical \n     schools each year. The Association of American Medical \n     Colleges estimates that the number of students entering \n     medical schools will increase by 25 per cent to 50 per cent \n     by 1975, as a result of the construction of new medical \n     schools already begun, and the expansion of existing schools \n     already planned. Yet, if the physician-patient ratio is to be \n     improved substantially, our goal should be to admit double \n     the number of current students by 1975, with special emphasis \n     on medical schools in regions where the physicians-population \n     ratio is too low.\n       There is another reason why we must increase the enrollment \n     in our medical schools, aside from the need to provide better \n     health care for our people. Today in America, the medical \n     profession is that one profession that flies in the face of \n     the American credo that every man shall have the opportunity \n     to join the profession of his choice. Today in America, if a \n     poor black or white young American aspires to be a lawyer, he \n     will have the opportunity to enroll in a law school somewhere \n     in the nation that will give him the chance to fulfill his \n     dream. It is the shame of American medicine that no such \n     opportunity exists for the youngster who aspires to enter \n     what is perhaps the most exalted and selfless of all our \n     professions, the healing arts.\n       Ironically, at the very time we are denying this \n     opportunity to our own citizens, we are importing thousands \n     of foreign-trained doctors each year to meet our manpower \n     crisis. Twenty per cent of the newly licensed physicians each \n     year in the United States are foreign-trained. Forty thousand \n     foreign medical graduates are now practicing medicine in the \n     United States, or about 15 per cent of the total number of \n     doctors providing patient care. Thirty per cent of all our \n     interns and residents are foreign-trained.\n       These figures are appalling. I believe that at this crucial \n     period in world history, it is deeply immoral for us to be \n     luring physicians from the rest of the world to meet our own \n     doctor shortage, when their services are even more critically \n     needed in their own lands.\n       The landscape we see is bleak, but it is not without hope. \n     If we are to be equal to the challenge, however, we must be \n     prepared to take major new steps. As Hippocrates himself put \n     it two thousand years ago, where the illness is extreme, \n     extreme treatments may be necessary. I would like, therefore, \n     to share with you my views as to the directions we should \n     begin to take now, if we are to meet the challenge.\n       First, and perhaps most important, we need a new approach \n     to the politics of health. Our single greatest deficiency in \n     the area of health is our failure to develop a national \n     constituency, committed to a progressive and enlightened \n     health policy. As a prestigious Committee of the National \n     Academy of Sciences has recently and eloquently stated with \n     respect to the problem of the confrontation between \n     technology and society, the issue is far more serious than \n     the simple question of braking the momentum of the status \n     quo. Today, all too often, whether the area be that of \n     medicine, or education, or pollution, the vested interests \n     are strongly ranged against innovation, and there is no \n     champion capable of marshaling the diffuse advocates for \n     progress and reform. When a better teaching organization \n     threatens the bureaucratic status quo in education, we know \n     there will be organized opposition from\n\n[[Page S13304]]\n\n     school officials, but there is seldom organized advocacy by \n     parents and children. When a new and more efficient \n     development is offered that threatens the status quo in \n     health--whether in the organization, financing, or delivery \n     of health care--we know there will be opposition from \n     organized medicine, but there is seldom organized advocacy by \n     health consumers.\n       In these situations, a thorough consideration of the \n     relative merits of alternative proposals is rendered \n     difficult, if not impossible, by the presence of powerful \n     spokesmen for the old, and the absence of effective spokesmen \n     for the new. If we are to succeed in making basic changes in \n     our health care system, we can do so only by creating the \n     sort of progressive national health constituency that can \n     make itself heard in the halls of Congress and the councils \n     of organized medicine.\n       To be sure, there is cause for hope. The present generation \n     of medical students is outstanding. They are already \n     beginning to develop the commitments to public causes, the \n     enlightment and social conscience so desperately needed in \n     the health profession, And, in spite of the heavy \n     responsibility that organized medicine must bear for the \n     inadequacy of our health manpower and other resources, a \n     few leaders have recently made progressive statements \n     suggesting a new recognition and awareness of the problem.\n       Second, the Federal Government must play a far more active \n     and coherent role in the formulation and implementation of \n     health policy. We must develop a comprehensive and carefully \n     coordinated national health policy, with an administrative \n     structure capable of setting health goals and priorities for \n     the nation, In the spring of 1968, I introduced legislation \n     urging the creation of a National Health Council to be \n     established in the Executive Office of the President with \n     responsibility for setting health policies and making \n     recommendations for the attainment of health goals, including \n     the evaluation, coordination, and consolidation of all \n     Federal health programs and activities. The National Health \n     Council would be modeled along the lines of the Council of \n     Economic Advisors, which has consistently played a \n     superlative role in planning and coordinating the nation's \n     economic policy.\n       Third, we must move away from our excessive emphasis on \n     high-cost acute-care hospital facilities. We must make more \n     imaginative use of innovative types of low-cost facilities, \n     such as neighborhood health centers and other out-patient \n     facilities, storefront clinics, and group health facilities. \n     In spite of the active opposition of a substantial segment of \n     the medical profession, group practice and hospital-based \n     practice are probably the most efficient and economical means \n     of delivering health care today. In many areas, the ideal \n     arrangement consists of a teaching hospital in a medical \n     center, with affiliations to community hospitals in the \n     surrounding area. In turn, each of the community hospitals \n     serves as the center of a series of satellite group practice \n     clinics that can reach out directly into the entire \n     community.\n       Fourth, while we are building the nation's overall health \n     policy, we must give special attention to the health of our \n     urban and rural poor. For too many of the poor, the family \n     physician has disappeared, to be replaced by the endless \n     lines and impersonal waiting rooms of huge municipal and \n     county hospitals. Yet, there are few physicians today who \n     were not trained on the wards and charity patients in our \n     teaching hospitals. Too often, as Professor Alonzo Yerby has \n     eloquently stated, our poor have had to barter their bodies \n     and their dignity in return for medical treatment.\n       In America today, millions of our citizens are sick, and \n     they are sick only because they are poor. We know that \n     illness is twice as frequent among the poor. We know that the \n     poor suffer three times as much heart disease, seven times as \n     many eye defects, five times as much mental retardation and \n     nervous disorders. Although our goal must be one health care \n     system open to all our citizens, we have an obligation now to \n     increase the range and efficiency of the health services and \n     facilities available to the poor, with special emphasis on \n     breaking down the barriers that have for so long divided our \n     society into a two-class system of care--one for the rich and \n     one for the poor, separate and unequal.\n       Specifically, I urge the Administration to create a \n     National Health Corps, as an alternative to the draft for \n     doctors, and stronger than the ``Project U.S.A.'' program \n     recently recommended by the AMA. Today, doctors are exempt \n     from the draft if they serve two years in the National \n     Institutes of Health or other branches of the Public Health \n     Service. The same exemption should exist for doctors \n     volunteering for medical service in urban or rural poverty \n     areas, Only in this way will we be able to meet the critical \n     need for health manpower in depressed areas. And, once young \n     physicians are exposed to the problems of health care for the \n     poor, a significant proportion of them will be encouraged to \n     remain and dedicate their careers to this service.\n       In addition, we should make a substantial new effort to \n     expand the neighborhood health center program. At the present \n     time, less than a dozen medical societies in the nation have \n     become actively involved in neighborhood health centers. Yet, \n     in recent weeks, prominent leaders of the AMA itself have \n     called for a greater role for neighborhood health centers as \n     a means of extending health care to the poor. A few \n     imaginative pilot projects reaching in this direction have \n     recently been funded by the Office of Economic Opportunity, \n     including a program to reorganize the out-patient department \n     at Boston City Hospital as a nucleus for community health \n     care, but our overall effort has been inadequate. Tragically, \n     at a time when even organized medicine is moving forward, we \n     have been unwilling to allocate the resources so urgently \n     needed for this program.\n       Fifth, within the critical area of health manpower, we must \n     give special attention to training new types of health \n     professionals. In far too many cases, highly trained \n     physicians spend the overwhelming majority of their working \n     day in tasks that do not require their specialized medical \n     skills. One of the most promising methods of easing the \n     shortage of doctors is to train new types of health workers \n     to perform these non-specialized tasks, thereby freeing our \n     physicians for other, more urgent needs. We must develop a \n     broad new range of allied health professionals, such as \n     paramedical aides, pediatric assistants, community service \n     health officers, and family health workers.\n       At a number of our universities, imaginative new programs \n     are under way to train medical corpsmen from Vietnam as \n     physicians' assistants. In the State of Washington, hospital \n     corpsmen are trained for three months in the medical school, \n     and then sent into the field for nine months' further \n     training in the offices of private physicians. A similar \n     program now exists at Duke University. These programs are \n     unique in their emphasis on combined training in the \n     classroom and in the field. They are programs that must be \n     greatly expanded if we are to meet the urgent demand for more \n     and better trained health manpower.\n       Sixth, we must restore the severe budget cuts that have \n     been proposed in Federal health programs by the present \n     Administration. Later this week, the full Senate will vote on \n     Federal health appropriations for the current fiscal year, \n     1970. None of us in Congress can be proud that almost half \n     way through the present fiscal year, we are only now about to \n     vote the funds that may be used. Our error is compounded by \n     the knowledge that at this time of medical crisis, Federal \n     assistance to health programs may be drastically curtailed, \n     especially in the areas of research and manpower training.\n       Today, when every medical school and every other health \n     school is being urged to expand its manpower programs, the \n     Administration is requesting far less funds than Congress \n     authorized as recently as 1968 for these vital programs.\n       The impact of the proposed cuts will be felt in medical \n     schools, hospitals, research centers, and communities \n     throughout the nation. It will be measured in terms of cancer \n     research cut short, lives lost because coronary care units \n     are un-funded, special hardship for the poor, and the loss of \n     dedicated young students from careers in medicine and medical \n     research.\n       Seventh, I come to what I believe is the most significant \n     health principle that we as a nation must pursue in the \n     decade of the Seventies. We must begin to move now to \n     establish a comprehensive national health insurance program, \n     capable of bringing the same amount and high quality of \n     health care to every man, woman, and child in the United \n     States.\n       National health insurance is an idea whose time has been \n     long in coming. More than a millennium ago, Aristotle defined \n     the importance of health in a democratic society, when he \n     said:\n       ``If we believe that men have any personal rights at all as \n     human beings, then they have an absolute moral right to such \n     a measure of good health as society and society alone is able \n     to give them.''\n       Today, the United States is the only major industrial \n     nation in the world that does not have a national health \n     service or a program of national health insurance. The first \n     comprehensive compulsory national health insurance was \n     enacted in Prussia in 1854. Throughout the Twentieth century, \n     proposals have been periodically raised for an American \n     program, but never, until recently, with great chance of \n     success.\n       National health insurance was a major proposal of Theodore \n     Roosevelt during his campaign for the Presidency in 1912. \n     Shortly before the First World War, a similar proposal \n     managed to gain the support of the American Medical \n     Association, whose orientation then was far different than it \n     is today, During the debate on social security in the \n     Thirties, the issue was again raised, but without success.\n       Today, the prospect is better. In large part it is better \n     because of the popularity of Medicare and the fact that many \n     other great national health programs have been successfully \n     launched. The need for national health insurance has become \n     more compelling, and its absence is more conspicuous. In \n     part, the prospect is good because the popular demand for \n     change in our existing health system is consolidating urgent \n     and widespread new support for a national health insurance \n     program as a way out of the present crisis.\n       For more than a year, I have been privileged to serve as a \n     member of the Committee for National Health Insurance, \n     founded by Walter Reuther, whose goal has been to mobilize \n     broad public support for a national health insurance program \n     in the United States. Two months ago in New York City, the \n     Reuther Committee sponsored a major conference, attended by \n     officers and representatives of more than 65 national \n     organizations, to consider a tentative blueprint for\n\n[[Page S13305]]\n\n     a national health insurance program. At the time of the \n     conference, I commended Mr. Reuther for the extraordinary \n     progress his Committee has made. I look forward to the future \n     development of the program. Already, it offers. one of the \n     most attractive legislative proposals that is likely to be \n     presented for our consideration next year in Congress.\n       We must recognize, therefore, that a great deal of solid \n     groundwork has already been laid toward establishing a \n     national health insurance program. It is for this reason that \n     I believe it is time to transfer the debate from the halls of \n     the universities and the offices of professors to the public \n     arena--to the hearing rooms of Congress and to the offices of \n     your elected representatives.\n       Early next year, at the beginning of the second session of \n     the 91st Congress, I intend to introduce legislation \n     proposing the sort of comprehensive national health insurance \n     legislation that I believe is most appropriate at the current \n     stage of our thinking. The mandate of the Medicaid Task Force \n     in the Department of Health, Education and Welfare has been \n     expanded to investigate this area, and I urge the \n     Administration to prepare and submit its own proposals.\n       Senator Ralph Yarborough of Texas has told me that, as \n     Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Health, he will \n     schedule comprehensive hearings next year on national health \n     insurance. Our immediate goal should be the enactment of \n     legislation laying the cornerstone for a comprehensive \n     health insurance program before the adjournment of the \n     91st Congress. This is an issue we can and must take to \n     the people. We can achieve our goal only through the \n     mobilization of millions of decent Americans, concerned \n     with the high cost and inadequate organization and \n     delivery of health care in the nation.\n       Last week on the floor of the Senate, we witnessed the \n     culmination of what has been one of the most powerful \n     nationwide legislative reform movements since I joined the \n     Senate--the taxpayers' revolution. It now appears likely that \n     by the end of this month, there will be laid on the \n     President's desk the best and most comprehensive tax reform \n     bill in the history of the Federal income tax, a bill that \n     goes far toward producing a more equitable tax system.\n       We need the same sort of national effort for health--we \n     need a national health revolution, a revolution by the \n     consumers of health care that will stimulate action by \n     Congress and produce a more equitable health system.\n       Because of the substantial groundwork already laid, I \n     believe that we can agree on three principles we should \n     pursue in preparing an effective program for national health \n     insurance:\n       First, and most important, our guiding principle should be \n     that the amount and quality of medical care an individual \n     receives is not a function of his income. There should be no \n     difference between health care for the suburbs and health \n     care for the ghetto, between health care for the rich and \n     health care for the poor.\n       Second, the program should be as broad and as comprehensive \n     as possible, with the maximum free choice available to each \n     health consumer in selecting the care he receives.\n       Third, the costs of the program should be borne on a \n     progressive basis related to the income level of those who \n     participate in the program.\n       I believe there is no need now to lock ourselves into a \n     specific method of financing the insurance program. There are \n     distinct advantages and disadvantages to each of the obvious \n     alternative financing methods that have been proposed--\n     financing out of general revenues of the Treasury, out of tax \n     credits, out of the Social Security Trust Fund, or out of \n     another independent trust fund that could be created \n     specifically for the purpose.\n       At the present time, I lean toward a method of financing \n     that would be based on general Treasury revenues, with \n     sufficient guarantees to avoid the vagaries of the \n     appropriations process that have plagued the Congress so much \n     in recent years.\n       I recognize the obvious merit of the tax credit and social \n     security approaches. In particular, Social Security financing \n     offers the important advantage that it is a mechanism that \n     Americans know and trust. In the thirty-five years of its \n     existence, Social Security has grown into a program that has \n     the abiding respect and affection of hundreds of millions of \n     Americans. In 1966, it demonstrated its capacity to broaden \n     its horizon by its successful implementation of the Medicare \n     program. To many, therefore, Social Security is the obvious \n     vehicle to embrace a program for national health insurance, \n     and soothe the doubts and suspicions that will inevitably \n     besiege the program when it is launched.\n       At the same time, however, we must recognize the obvious \n     disadvantages of Social Security financing. Under the Social \n     Security system, the payroll tax is heavily regressive. The \n     poor pay far too high a proportion of their income to Social \n     Security than our middle or upper income citizens. Today, at \n     a time when Congress is about to grant major new tax relief \n     to all income groups, I believe it would be especially \n     inappropriate to finance a national health insurance program \n     through the conventional but regressive procedures of Social \n     Security, rather than through the progressive procedures of \n     the Federal income tax laws.\n       I wish to make clear, however, that I am not now rejecting \n     an approach that would finance national health insurance by a \n     modified approach through the Social Security System. By the \n     use of payroll tax exemptions and appropriate contributions \n     from the Federal. Government, it may be possible to construct \n     a program that will build in the sort of progression that all \n     Americans can accept. The important point here is that we \n     must discuss these possibilities in a national forum, and \n     weigh the alternatives in the critical light of open hearings \n     and national debate.\n       We must be candid about the costs of national health \n     insurance. In light of our present budgetary restrictions, \n     the price tags applied to the various health insurance \n     programs are too high. They range from about $10 billion for \n     ``Medicredit,'' the AMA proposal, to about $40 billion for \n     the Reuther proposal, It is therefore unrealistic to suppose \n     that a total comprehensive program can be implemented all at \n     once.\n       We can all agree, however, that it is time to begin. In \n     light of the fiscal reality, the most satisfactory approach \n     is to set a goal for full implementation of the program at \n     the earliest opportunity. I believe that the goal should be \n     1975. The legislation we enact should reflect our firm \n     commitment to this target date. Halfway through the decade of \n     the Seventies, we should have a comprehensive national health \n     insurance, program in full operation for all Americans.\n       I have already stated my view that legislation establishing \n     the program should be enacted next year. In January, 1971, we \n     should begin to phase-in a program that will reach out to all \n     Americans by the end of 1975, To meet that timetable, we \n     should establish coverage in the first year--1971--for all \n     infants, pre-school children, and adolescents in elementary \n     and secondary schools. In each of the following four years, \n     we should expand the coverage by approximately ten-year age \n     groups, so that by the end of 1975, all persons up to age 85 \n     will be covered by the program, and the existing Medicare \n     program can be phased in completely with the new \n     comprehensive insurance.\n       The idea of phasing in children first should receive wide \n     support, both from the population as a whole and from the \n     medical profession as well. As a nation today, the United \n     States is the wealthiest and most highly developed medical \n     society in the world, but we rank 14th among the major \n     industrial nations in the rate of infant mortality, and 12th \n     in the percentage of mothers who die in childbirth. In spite \n     of our wealth and technology, we have tolerated disease and \n     ill-health in generations of our children. We have failed to \n     eliminate the excessive toll of their sickness, retardation, \n     disability and death.\n       Equally important, we are already close to the level of \n     manpower needed to implement a national health insurance \n     program for our youth. American medicine is equal to the \n     challenge. We have a solid tradition of excellence in \n     pediatric training, with a strong and growing supply of \n     experienced pediatricians, pediatric nurses, and allied \n     manpower.\n       Moreover, by beginning our new program with youth and child \n     care, it will be easier for the medical profession to \n     implement the changes in the delivery system that must \n     accompany any effective national health insurance program. \n     And, the changes that we make in the delivery system for \n     pediatric care will give us valuable experience and insights \n     into the comparable but far more difficult changes that will \n     be necessary in the delivery of care to adults as the \n     insurance program is phased in over subsequent years.\n       Finally, by phasing in the insurance program over a period \n     of years, I believe we can avoid a serious objection that \n     will otherwise be raised--that national health insurance will \n     simply exacerbate our current inflation in medical costs by \n     producing even greater demand for medical care without \n     providing essential changes in the organization and delivery \n     system.\n       We know from recent experience that changes in the \n     organization and delivery of health care in the United States \n     will come only by an excruciating national effort. Throughout \n     our society today, there is perhaps no institution more \n     resistant to change than the organized medical profession. \n     Indeed, because the crisis is so serious in the organization \n     and delivery of health care, there are many who argue that we \n     must make improvements here first, before we can safely \n     embark on national health insurance.\n       I believe the opposite is true. The fact that the time has \n     come for national health insurance makes it all the more \n     urgent to pour new resources into remaking our present \n     system. The organization and delivery of health care is so \n     obviously inadequate to meet our current health crisis that \n     only the catalyst of national health insurance will be able \n     to produce the sort of basic revolution that is needed if we \n     are to escape the twin evils of a national health disaster or \n     the Federalization of health care in the Seventies. To those \n     who say that national health insurance won't work unless we \n     first have an enormous increase in health manpower and health \n     facilities and a revolution in the delivery of health care, I \n     reply that until we begin moving toward national health \n     insurance, neither Congress nor the medical profession will \n     ever take the basic steps that are essential to reorganize \n     the system. Without national health insurance to galvanize us \n     into action, I fear that we will simply continue to patch the \n     present system beyond any reasonable hope of survival.\n       The need for comprehensive national health insurance and \n     concomitant changes in the organization and delivery of \n     health\n\n[[Page S13306]]\n\n     care in the United States is the single most Important issue \n     of health policy today. If we are to reach our goal of \n     bringing adequate health care to all our citizens, we must \n     have full and generous cooperation between Congress, the \n     Administration, and the health profession. We already possess \n     the knowledge and the technology to achieve our goal. All we \n     need is the will. The challenge is enormous, but I am \n     confident that we are equal to the task.\n\n  Mr. KIRK. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and ask unanimous \nconsent that the time in the quorum call be divided equally between the \nmajority and minority.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act and to encourage my \ncolleagues to support this effort to address our health care system's \nimmediate and long-term challenges in a fiscally responsible manner.\n  For decades, attempts have been made to reform the way our health \ncare system works, but only incremental changes have been made. The \nresult is a broken system where costs are rising out of control and \nmillions of Americans are priced out of the health insurance market.\n  In the last 8 years, health care premiums have grown four times \nfaster than wages. If health care costs continue to rise at the current \nrates, without reform, it is projected that the average South Dakota \nfamily will be paying nearly $17,000 in yearly premiums by 2016. That \nis a 74-percent increase over the current premium costs that so many \nalready struggle to afford.\n  Throughout the ongoing health reform discussion, I have heard from \nfar too many South Dakotans who currently face barriers in accessing \nquality health care. This can be due to exorbitant out-of-pocket costs, \nhaving no insurance coverage, being denied coverage by insurance \ncompanies, or limited or no health care providers in their area. The \nPatient Protection and Affordable Care Act addresses these barriers in \npart by extending access to affordable and meaningful health insurance \nto all Americans.\n  This legislation stands up on behalf of the American people and puts \nan end to insurance industry abuses that have denied coverage to hard-\nworking Americans when they need it most. Insurance companies will no \nlonger be able to deny coverage for preexisting conditions and will not \nbe able to drop coverage just because a patient gets sick. Reform will \nensure that families always have guaranteed choices of quality, \naffordable health insurance whether they lose their job, switch jobs, \nmove, or get sick.\n\n  The bill allows Americans to shop for the best health care plan to \nmeet their needs and provides tax credits to help those who need \nassistance. It strengthens our health care workforce, improves the \nquality of care, and reduces waste, fraud, and abuse in the health care \nsystem.\n  Every American is adversely affected in some fashion by the \nshortcomings of our existing system, and far too many have a false \nsense of security. The system costs us lives, and it costs us money. If \nwe fail to act, health care costs will consume a greater and greater \nshare of our Nation's economy and have tremendous potential to cripple \nour Nation's future.\n  The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act puts our Nation on a \nmore sustainable financial path. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice projects that this health reform bill will reduce the Federal \ndeficit by $130 billion in the next 10 years and as much as $650 \nbillion in the decade after that. CBO also projects that this bill will \nresult in health care coverage for more than 94 percent of legal \nresidents in our Nation. Our citizens deserve this basic security, \nwhile improving current Medicare benefits.\n  This bill is the product of months of research, committee \ndeliberation, and bipartisan negotiation. I have listened to some of my \ncolleagues' claims that they support health reform yet object to this \napproach. These protests echo those made nearly 50 years ago when a new \nprogram called Medicare was proposed to provide meaningful health \nbenefits to seniors. The increasing cost of health care is \nunsustainable and the do-nothing approach hurts all Americans by \nrobbing us of this historic opportunity to stop talking about the \nproblems and finally find a solution.\n  This bill is not perfect, but a ``yes'' vote will allow the \nconference committee a chance to improve it. The United States is the \nonly Nation among industrialized democracies to not have some form of \nnational health care. Yet the Senate Republican Party is attempting to \ndeny us the right to vote this historic legislation up or down. They \nwant to kill it even before it has the chance to go to conference.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Patient Protection and Affordable \nCare Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time be charged \nequally.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Ohio is recognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Thank you, Mr. President. I have been coming to the \nfloor to remind my colleagues and the American people about the fiscal \nrealities our Nation faces and to explain how this health reform \nlegislation would make our fiscal situation worse and our economy \nsuffer even more. I have been here before to highlight how this health \ncare bill is chock-full of budget gimmicks to hide its true \nunmanageable costs.\n  As I have said before on the floor of the Senate, as a former mayor \nand a former Governor, many people have come to me over the years and \nsaid: Mayor, you have to do this; Governor, you have to do this. The \nplea they had was genuine, and the need they expressed was genuine, but \nthe fact is we couldn't afford what they were asking us to do, and I \nhad to say no. Unfortunately, this legislation, in my opinion, will \nincrease the cost of health care, drive up our national debt, and \ncontribute to unbalanced budgets as far as the eye can see in the \nUnited States.\n  As a former Governor and chairman of the National Governors \nAssociation, the past chairman of the National League of Cities, one \ngimmick I am particularly concerned about is the one that puts 14 \nmillion additional individuals into the Medicaid Program and then asks \nthe States to pick up a portion of the tab. I am very familiar with \nwhat unfunded mandates can do to State and local governments, and I \nwish to highlight some of the potential consequences of the Medicaid \nexpansion for my colleagues.\n  At a $374 billion cost to Federal taxpayers, the health care bill \nbefore us would expand Medicaid coverage to all people under 133 \npercent of the Federal poverty level. Because Medicaid costs are shared \nby the Federal and State governments, the States will be on the hook \nfor $25 billion of this expansion during the first 10 years.\n  To put the $25 billion into perspective, let me spend a minute \nexplaining the current fiscal situation of most States in this country. \nMost States such as my State--and I am sure the same is true in the \nPresiding Officer's State--are struggling to make ends meet. I have \nnever seen anything like it in my entire life.\n  According to the National Governors Association, the States are in \nthe deepest and longest economic downturn since the Great Depression. \nIn the first two quarters of 2009, State revenues were down 11.7 and \n16.6 percent, respectively. At the same time, Medicaid spending is \ngrowing, which already makes up, on average, approximately 22 percent \nof States' budgets, and enrollment in the program is skyrocketing at \nthe levels it is today because more and more people are becoming \neligible for Medicaid under the current Federal law.\n  In Ohio, for example, where the unemployment rate is hovering around \n10.5 percent, 154,000 Ohioans enrolled in the Medicaid Program in the \nlast year alone, an 8-percent increase over last year. This is hard to \nbelieve, but Medicaid now provides health coverage to nearly 2 million \nOhioans, almost one out of five residents. Unbelievable.\n  Recognizing this increased demand, States have had some help from the \nFederal Government. Earlier this year,\n\n[[Page S13307]]\n\nCongress provided $87 billion in Federal aid to States in the so-called \nstimulus bill to help States deal with Medicaid costs. Yet this money \nwas not intended to last forever. As it stands right now, in December \n2010, States will face--that is next December--States will face a steep \nbudget cliff when the temporary Medicaid payments coming from the \nstimulus package expire. In facing these realities, Governors across \nthe country are already wondering how they will cover the cost of their \nexisting programs.\n  I recently met with Ray Scheppach, who is the executive director of \nthe National Governors Association. He said: Senator, Governor, Mayor, \nwe are going to need some help when the money runs out or we will not \nbe able to handle the Medicaid challenges we have.\n  Not surprisingly, my State's current Governor, Ted Strickland, a \nDemocrat, has told me if Medicaid is expanded, he hopes the Federal \nGovernment will assume most, if not all, the costs. In fact, he told \nthe Columbus Dispatch that he has warned officials in Washington that \n``with our financial challenges right now, we are not in a position to \naccept additional Medicaid responsibilities.''\n  I suspect that almost every Governor in the country would make that \nsame statement to us in the Senate. By the way, this is both Republican \nand Democratic Governors.\n  I ask: How can we in good conscience move forward with this bill and \nthe new mandate it places on States? How can we force the States to \nmake the difficult choices that we are unwilling or unable to make in \nWashington? Pass it on to them, we will pay for it a while, and then \nyou guys pick up the cost.\n  I served the people of Ohio as Governor for 8 years, and I was forced \nto cut my budget in the beginning four times. I will never forget it. \nThere were about 5,000 people outside my office screaming because we \nhad made it more difficult or increased the cost of tuition for our \ncolleges. I had to make countless difficult decisions across the board \nto be fiscally responsible. I understand the demands of soaring health \ncare costs, and as I called that program then, it devoured--Medicaid \ndevoured up to 30 percent of our State budget, and I referred to it as \nthe Medicaid Pac-Man. I think some people remember Pac-Man. That was \nthe Pac-Man just eating up money like crazy. It took away money from \nprimary and secondary education, higher education, roads, bridges, \ncounty and local government projects, and safety service programs that \nwe wanted to provide for the citizens of Ohio. We had to do it. It was \na mandate. It just sucked up that money, and that meant we didn't have \nmoney for higher education, secondary and primary education, and some \nof the other responsibilities of the State.\n\n  With this experience, I became particularly concerned with the cost \nof Federal mandates, and I worked tirelessly with State and local \ngovernments to help pass the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. In fact, the \nfirst time I ever set foot on the floor of the Senate is the day the \nunfunded mandates bill passed the Senate. It was a wonderful day for \nOhio and for this country. I was in the Rose Garden representing State \nand local governments when President Clinton signed the legislation \ninto law in 1995.\n  After that experience, you can imagine how it pains me to be standing \nhere today debating legislation that provides for the largest single \nexpansion of the Medicaid Program in our country's history and a \nbrandnew fiscal liability for States at a time when the States can \nleast afford it. I have serious concerns if this bill becomes law and \nStates are required to take on more just as the extra stimulus funds \ndisappear--which they are going to have to do or we will have to come \nup with the money--Congress will be forced to spend billions more to \nkeep the Medicaid safety net from failing completely in the not too \ndistant future.\n  So what I am basically saying is that when the stimulus money ends in \nDecember of next year, the Governors are going to be down here with a \nbathtub asking us to fill it because if we don't do it, they are going \nto have to knock off thousands of people, millions in the country, \nbecause they don't have the money to provide for the program.\n  Now, providing extra dollars to States--and I predict it is going to \nhappen. It will become an annual ritual for Congress, just as the \ndoctors fix has become an annual ritual for doctors. Every year they \ncome in. We are not going to cut the annual reimbursement. Next year it \nis 23 percent, I think. We are not going to fill the hole, and the \nGovernors are going to be asking for the same kind of help. It is not \nonly a mandate for them, it is going to become a mandate for us at a \ntime when we are least able to handle anything like that.\n  So as a former Governor and a former mayor, a former county \ncommissioner, I urge my colleagues to consider the impact this bill \nwill have on their respective States. Think about it. Talk to your \nGovernors. See what it is going to do to your States. I hope each of my \ncolleagues will give careful thought to the potentially devastating \neffects it could have on each of their State budgets and to consult, as \nI said, with their Governors and to talk about the fact that if this \nhappens, what is going to happen in terms of the Pac-Man eating up more \nmoney in their State and their inability to take care of primary and \nsecondary education, higher education, and all of the other \nresponsibilities State governments have.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise today to address the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill for fiscal year 2010.\n  As my colleagues know, this afternoon the Senate received this \nmeasure from the House which represents a compromise between the bill \npassed by the House last July and what we passed this past October.\n  Since passage of the Senate measure, Vice Chairman Cochran and I and \nour staffs have spent countless hours in discussion with our colleagues \nin the House to thrash out the differences between our two bills. The \nproduct the Senate will consider represents the work of our \ndiscussions. While this is a House measure, I can assure my colleagues \nit is a very fair and balanced product.\n\n  The Defense appropriations portion of this measure totals $636.3 \nbillion in discretionary spending, including more than $128 billion for \nthe cost of our ongoing efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  In total, the Defense bill is $3.8 billion below the request of the \nPresident and within the subcommittee's allocation.\n  This bill represents the hard work over the past year of all the \nmembers of the Defense subcommittee. It contains funds that we believe \nwill best meet the needs of the men and women who volunteer to serve \nour Nation in the military. The bill provides funding to increase their \npay by 3.4 percent. It provides more than $30 billion to care for their \nhealth and the health of their families.\n  It provides support to families with loved ones serving in harm's way \noverseas and funding to ensure that their workplaces and quality of \nlife back home are protected.\n  Of equal importance, the funding in this bill ensures that our forces \nin the field have the equipment and other tools required to meet their \nmissions. Funding has been added to the President's request to provide \nfor more MRAP vehicles to protect our forces from IEDs in Afghanistan.\n  Funds are provided for more medical evacuation and combat rescue \nhelicopters to save our wounded troops. Funds have been added to \nsustain production of the C-17 Program so our forces in the field can \nbe adequately resupplied, no matter where they are based.\n  This bill enhances research in lifesaving technologies and increases \nfunds to care for our wounded personnel. It fully funds the priorities \nof Secretary Gates and our military commanders.\n  While I know some will criticize the fact that funds have been \nincluded at the request of Members of Congress, I remind my colleagues \nthat, in total, this amount is less than 1 percent of the funding in \nthe bill.\n  Moreover, all the so-called earmarks in the defense portion of this \nbill were in either the House or Senate bills. There are no \n``airdropped'' earmarks in the defense funding included in this \nmeasure.\n  In addition to the defense portion of the bill, the House has added a \nlittle\n\n[[Page S13308]]\n\nmore than 1 dozen provisions to provide a 2-month safety net to \nunemployed and nearly impoverished Americans and to extend critical \nprovisions which are set to expire this month.\n  For individual Americans, provisions were included to extend, through \nFebruary 28, 2010, expiring unemployment insurance benefits that were \nestablished in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act.\n  Likewise, provisions were included to extend the 65-percent COBRA \nhealth insurance subsidy from 9 to 15 months for individuals who have \nlost their jobs and to extend the job lost eligibility date also \nthrough February 28, 2010.\n  Further, a provision was included to freeze the Department of Health \nand Human Services' poverty guidelines at 2009 levels in order to \nprevent a reduction in eligibility for programs such as Medicaid, food \nstamps, and school lunch programs through March 1 of next year.\n  This provision keeps struggling families from falling through the \ncracks.\n  In addition, provisions were included to provide $125 million to \nextend the Recovery Act program for small businesses. The program \nreduces lending fees charged to borrowers under the Small Business \nAdministration's guaranteed loan programs and increases the Federal \nguarantee on certain small business loans.\n  The Recovery Act supported a resurgence in SBA small business \nlending, but funds were exhausted in November. The additional funding \nin this bill will help support lending for small businesses during the \neconomic recovery by continuing fee relief for borrowers and \nencouraging lenders to extend credit to small businesses.\n  Further, this bill includes a short-term extension of the highway, \ntransit, highway safety and truck safety programs. Without this \nextension, the highway program would be brought to a standstill and the \nDepartment of Transportation would be unable to reimburse States for \neligible expenses.\n  In addition, several agencies--including the Federal Highway \nAdministration, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and \nthe Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration--would not have the \nfunds necessary to pay their employees.\n  This is not your typical end-of-the-year Christmas tree; to the \ncontrary, it is the bare minimum of programs which must be continued to \nprovide for our less fortunate and our struggling small businesses.\n  It also allows for a 2-month extension of laws such as the PATRIOT \nAct, in order to allow more time for our authorizing committees to come \nto agreement on more permanent legislation.\n  The House has passed a compromise measure and forwarded it to the \nSenate because of the calendar. Today is December 16, and our \nDepartment of Defense has been operating on a continuing resolution for \nmore than 2 months.\n  It is time we get on with the process and get this bill to the \nPresident. It is a good measure. Our troops deserve our support. Let's \nshow we support those who volunteered to serve all of us by voting \ntoday to send this bill to the President.\n  As I close, I wish to thank the Defense Subcommittee staff for their \ndedication and hard work in putting this bill together. I wish to put \ninto the Record the names of these staff members who have worked on \nthis bill in a bipartisan fashion. They are:\n\n       Charlie Houy, Nicole Diresta, Kate Fitzpatrick, Katy Hagan, \n     Kate Kaufer, Ellen Maldonado, Rachel Meyer, Erik Raven, Gary \n     Reese, Betsy Schmid, Renan Snowden, Bridget Zarate, Rob \n     Berschinski, Stewart Holmes, Alycia Farrell, Brian Potts, \n     Brian Wilson and Tom Osterhoudt.\n\n  Mr. President, it is my pleasure and privilege to be chairman of the \ncommittee. It is a great honor. I wish to make certain we express our \ngratitude to all these staff people. Without them, I would not be \nstanding here at this moment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I am glad I was here to hear the remarks \nof the distinguished Senator from Hawaii. I serve on that subcommittee \nof Defense Appropriations with him and get to observe, at close range, \nthe skill and effort and courtesy that is reflected in his service as \nchairman of our committee. It is a pleasure to serve with him and it is \nan honor. He has provided leadership and cooperation in working with \nall Senators--not just members of our committee--to move forward in \ncarrying out of duties by the Department of Defense through our \nappropriations process.\n  It is very important that the Senate approve, as soon as possible, \nthe funding that is contained in the bill that our committee has \nreported to the Senate. It will help support and provide the resources \nnecessary to carry out the missions of our men and women have in \nAfghanistan, Iraq, and around the world, safeguarding our freedom, \nprotecting our security interests.\n  The Department of Defense is now operating under a continuing \nresolution that expires on Friday. This is an inefficient way of \nmanaging the support for our Department of Defense. It causes too much \neffort to be made by employees and men and women in the Defense \nDepartment, focusing on management, how to manage day-to-day operating \nexpenses dealing with the challenges that too few dollars are provided \nin a way that gives people time to plan and then execute efficiently \ntheir missions and responsibilities.\n  This affects the support that is available to the men and women who \nare overseas and in harm's way.\n  The act contains funds necessary to provide medical care as well as \nfamily support for members of our Armed Forces and their families. \nDuring this time of war, it is very important that every effort be made \nto provide good medical care for those who are injured and wounded \nserving our country.\n  It is also important we support the families. There are funds in this \nlegislation that do just that, trying to address the stresses that are \nassociated with combat and deployment and separation.\n  I am disappointed the normal process has been circumvented, or at \nleast delayed, and the other body has not appointed conferees to the \nDefense Appropriations conference committee. It is a disappointment \nalso that the Defense Appropriations bill is used as a vehicle to move \nother initiatives that seem to be slowing down the process. These \nmeasures should be considered separately and addressed in a more \nthoughtful way, based on their own merits, not on the legislation they \nare tied to, to carry them through the legislative process.\n  I think attaching nondefense-related legislation to the Defense \nAppropriations Act for this fiscal year has been a mistake. It has been \nunnecessary, unfortunate, and it has resulted in delays and \nuncertainty.\n  I am sure there are Senators who can make suggestions for improving \nthis bill. We are open to hear those concerns and do our best to \nrespond to the suggestions from all Senators. We don't individually \nsupport all aspects of the agreement, but we think that, in total, it \nis a good bill. It ought to be passed, and it ought to be passed as \nsoon as possible in recognition of our respect for our service members \nand their families.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, there is nothing in rule XLIV which \ngoverns a message between the Houses in regard to disclosing earmarks. \nHowever, as chairman of the Appropriations Committee it is my belief \nthat the committee should none the less attest that all earmarks have \nbeen fully disclosed. Accordingly I note that in the bill H.R. 3326 as \npassed by the House and explained in the statement offered by the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Defense of the House of Representatives \non December 16, 2009, each earmark in the bill has been disclosed in \naccord with rule XLIV.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, section 401(c)(4) of S. Con. Res. 13, the \n2010 budget resolution, permits the Chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee to adjust the section 401(b) discretionary spending limits, \nallocations pursuant to section 302(a) of the Congressional Budget Act \nof 1974, and aggregates for legislation making appropriations for \nfiscal years 2009 and 2010 for overseas deployments and other \nactivities by the amounts provided in such legislation for those \npurposes and so designated pursuant to section 401(c)(4). The \nadjustment is limited to the total amount of budget authority specified \nin section 104(21) of S. Con. Res. 13. For 2009, that limitation is \n$90.745 billion, and for 2010, it is $130 billion.\n\n[[Page S13309]]\n\n  The Senate is considering H.R. 3326, the Department of Defense \nAppropriations Act, 2010. That legislation includes amounts designated \npursuant to section 401(c)(4). Since this is the last of the 12 regular \nappropriations bills for 2010, I am revising previous adjustments made \nto the discretionary spending limits and the allocation to the Senate \nCommittee on Appropriations for discretionary budget authority and \noutlays to reflect the final amount of designations made pursuant to \nsection 401(c)(4). When combined with all previous adjustments, the \ntotal amount of adjustments for 2010 is $130 billion in discretionary \nbudget authority and $101.178 billion in outlays. In addition, I am \nalso further revising the aggregates for 2010 consistent with section \n401(c)(4) to reconcile the amount of outlays estimated by the \nCongressional Budget Office for designated funding with the amount \noriginally assumed in the 2010 budget resolution.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the following revisions to S. Con. Res. \n13 be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\nCONCURRENT RESOLUTION ON THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010--S.

The Republican leader is recognized.\n\n\n                           Setting Precedent\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise to make some observations about \na matter that occurred in the Senate earlier this afternoon.\n  The plain language of the Senate precedent, the manual that governs \nSenate procedure, is that unanimous consent of all Members was required \nbefore the Senator from Vermont could withdraw his amendment while it \nwas being read--unanimous consent.\n  Earlier today, the majority somehow convinced the Parliamentarian to \nbreak with the longstanding precedent and practice of the Senate in the \nreading of the amendment.\n  Senate procedure clearly states:\n\n       Under rule 15, paragraph 1, and Senate precedents, an \n     amendment shall be read by the clerk before it is up for \n     consideration or before the same shall be debated unless a \n     request to waive the reading is granted.\n\n  It goes on to state that:\n\n       . . . the reading of which may not be dispensed with, \n     except by unanimous consent, and if the request is denied, \n     the amendment must be read and further interruptions are not \n     in order.\n  Nothing could be more clear.\n  You may have heard that the majority cites an example in 1992 when \nthe Chair made a mistake and allowed something similar to happen. But \none mistake does not a precedent make.\n  For example, there is precedent for a Senator being beaten with a \ncane in the Senate. If mistakes were the rule, then the caning of \nSenators would be in order. Fortunately for all of us, it is not.\n  It is now perfectly clear that the majority is willing to do \nanything--anything--to jam through a 2,000-page bill before the \nAmerican people or any of us have had a chance to read it, including \nchanging the rules in the middle of the game.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \ndecision to move the remaining detainees held at Guantanamo Bay Naval \nfacility, or Gitmo, to the Thomson Correctional Center in Illinois.\n  The decision to transfer Gitmo detainees to the heartland of our \ncountry is irresponsible, a waste of taxpayer dollars, and contrary to \nthe wishes of the American people.\n  Congress has included language permitting the transfer or detention \nof Gitmo detainees to the United States only under certain limited \nconditions in every relevant appropriations bill passed this year, \nincluding the recently passed Omnibus Appropriations Act. That is one \nof the reasons I voted against every single one of those bills.\n  The President now has made the decision to purchase the Thomson \nCorrectional Center from the State of Illinois for the purpose of \ntransferring and detaining Gitmo detainees.\n  Further, the President stated he will need to expend millions of \nadditional dollars renovating and securing the facility when much has \nalready been invested in the state-of-the-art facility at Guantanamo \nBay. This unnecessary spending is an abuse of our tax dollars and one \nthat holds dire national security consequences.\n  The administration claims that many of these detainees will continue \nto be held by the military in the same prison where the Department of \nJustice will hold average, ordinary criminals. What the administration \nfails to tell the American people is that these detainees will obtain \nthe same rights as U.S. citizens the moment they step inside the United \nStates. We have already seen detainees attempt to gain these same \nrights as Americans in our courts and have seen the courts grant them \nlimited rights without them being inside the United States.\n  In habeas corpus cases where the court has ruled, 30 out of 38 Gitmo \ndetainees have been found to be unlawfully detained and their release \nhas been ordered. After reviewing the classified biographies on some of \nthese individuals, it is clear from these decisions that the courts are \nnot in a position to judge matters of war and cannot when they are \nbound by our criminal justice system. It is not designed to handle war \ncriminals.\n  The courts do not adequately consider the threat these individuals \npose to U.S. interests or will pose in the future when they return to \nterrorism. President Obama cites the authorization for the use of \nmilitary force as legal justification for continuing the detention of \nthese terrorists. However, the courts have already indicated that these \ndetainees cannot be indefinitely held. I wonder if the administration \nconsidered this when it decided to move Gitmo detainees to the United \nStates.\n  This administration may face the same problem as the last \nadministration did in justifying to a U.S. court the continuing \ndetention of these terrorists. Only this time, the court will have a \nremedy.\n  It is foreseeable that some, and possibly many, of those detainees \nwill be ordered released by our courts. The administration has tried to \nassure the public that our immigration laws will prohibit the release \nof those individuals into the United States. But, once again, this \nadministration fails to appreciate the limits of our legal system.\n\n[[Page S13310]]\n\nOnce these detainees are physically present in the United States, prior \njudicial precedent indicates that the government can only detain an \nindividual while immigration removal proceedings are ongoing for a \nmaximum of 6 months. If a detainee cannot be transferred or deported, \nthey will be released, freed into the United States, after 6 months. \nThis is much more than just moving Guantanamo north.\n  On the other hand, if the administration is able to secure the \ntransfer of these detainees to another country, we can be sure to watch \nthe recidivism rates rise. The Department of Defense's last \nunclassified fact sheet on recidivism reported that 14 percent of the \nformer Gitmo detainees returned to terrorism after their release or \ntheir transfer. This is almost one out of every seven detainees \ntransferred. This number is much larger now after 8 months and \ncountless transfers of the most serious terrorists.\n  Some of the detainees transferred openly admit their affiliation with \na terrorist organization or that they were combating U.S. forces in \nAfghanistan. Confirming this, two former Gitmo detainees transferred to \nSaudi Arabia announced earlier this year that they were now the leaders \nof al-Qaida in the Arabian peninsula. Another detainee, Ali bin Ali \nAleh, lived with Abu Zubaydah in Pakistan and was identified on a list \nof names in Khalid Shaikh Mohammed's possession when KSM was captured. \nAli bin Ali Aleh was determined not to be an enemy combatant and \nordered to be released by a U.S. court in May of this year. He was \ntransferred to Yemen in September.\n  Maybe some of my colleagues have seen the recent headlines indicating \nthat some European countries are willing to accept these detainees. In \nfact, detainees have recently been transferred to Belgium, Ireland, \nHungary, and Italy. However, the American people are not fooled by \nthese headlines. Of the 779 detainees held since 2001 at Guantanamo \nBay, our European partners have accepted only 37. The vast majority of \ndetainees--almost 400--have been transferred to four countries: \nAfghanistan, Saudi Arabia, Pakistan, and Yemen. These four countries \nare either currently in conflict or actively combating al-Qaida. In all \nfour of these countries, the threat from al-Qaida and associate \nmilitants has done nothing but increase over the past few years. Yet \nthe United States is sending back hundreds of terrorists to the most \nvolatile regions of the world--South Asia, which poses the greatest \nterrorist threat currently to the homeland and to the Arabian \npeninsula, which I believe will present itself as the next greatest \nthreat to the United States.\n  The decision to move these terrorists to the United States may force \nthe administration to choose between freeing terrorists into Illinois \nor transferring them back to the center of the battle. Is this the \npolicy position we want to put our country in while we are still \ncombating terrorism?\n  No one doubts the security of our prisons to safely hold these \nindividuals. I doubt the ability of our laws and judicial system to \nensure that these terrorists are convicted or kept in prison. \nProhibiting the detainees from entering the United States is the only \nguarantee. However, the decision to move the remaining terrorists at \nGitmo to the heart of this country shattered any remaining hope for \nthis guarantee. This is yet another step in a series of poor policy \ndecisions which is leading our country in the wrong direction.\n  I am disappointed by this decision, obviously. But I can only imagine \nhow the residents of Illinois feel about it. I know Georgians would not \nbe pleased with housing over 200 of the most serious and hardened \nterrorists in the world in their backyard.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I wish to respond to my friend from \nGeorgia, who just stepped off the floor, about the transfer of \ndetainees from Guantanamo because he misstated a few things that I do \nnot want to stay on the record.\n  First, he suggested that these detainees would be freed in Illinois. \nNot so. The plan of this administration is not to free them; the plan \nis to imprison them in the most secure prison in the United States of \nAmerica. It is in Thomson, IL, 150 miles from Chicago. I was there a \nfew weeks ago. It is a supermax prison built 7 years ago and never \nfully occupied. Now they are going to build an additional fence around \nit. It will be more secure than any prison in America. They will be \nfreed into the most secure prison in America and they are not coming \nout until such time as there is a resolution of whatever their issues \nmay be or they pass away.\n  I might also say that the current law in the United States prohibits \nthe President of the United States from releasing these detainees in \nthe United States. Those statements by the Senator from Georgia are \njust flat incorrect.\n  He is entitled to his position--and others share it--that we should \nnot close Guantanamo. I believe we should. On my side of this argument \nwould be the following people who have called for the closure of \nGuantanamo: President George W. Bush; Secretary of State and former \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Colin Powell; Secretary of \nDefense under President Bush and under President Obama, Robert Gates; \nformer Secretary of State and domestic policy adviser Condoleezza Rice; \nGEN David Petraeus, and 33 other generals, in addition to President \nBarack Obama.\n  This argument that closing Guantanamo endangers the United States \nignores the obvious. The people entrusted with the responsibility of \nprotecting the United States have called for the closure of Guantanamo. \nYesterday, Robert Gibbs, press secretary to President Obama, was asked \nabout this decision to transfer. He said that on more than 30 \noccasions--I am not sure of the timeframe, whether it was this year or \na longer period of time--but on more than 30 occasions, they have found \ndirect linkage of terrorist recruitment activity and the use of \nGuantanamo as an illustration of why people needed to convert to \nterrorism around the world. It is still being actively used for \nrecruitment.\n  If the Senator from Georgia would go back a few weeks and read \nNewsweek magazine, one of their reporters was captured in Tehran and \nheld in captivity for almost 4 months. He told a story of how he was \nfirst incarcerated in a prison in Tehran. As he arrived, his jailer \nsaid to him: Welcome to Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo, American.\n  So for us to believe that the rest of the world does not have a \nnegative image of Guantanamo and it is not being used against our \ntroops is to ignore the obvious.\n  There are some in this body who are hidebound to keep Guantanamo open \nat any costs. I will tell you, the cost is too high. If the \ncontinuation of Guantanamo means danger to our troops, we owe it to \nthem to close it. Presidents have reached that conclusion, people in \ncharge of national security have reached that conclusion, and we should \nas well.\n  Then there is this notion about the danger of incarcerating \nterrorists in the United States. For the record, over 350 convicted \nterrorists are currently imprisoned in the United States, all over the \nUnited States. In my home State of Illinois, 35 convicted terrorists \nare in prison today. The most recent incarceration involves a man \narrested shortly after 9/11 in Peoria, IL, an unlikely hotbed of \nterrorism and spy activity, but, in fact, this man going to school in \nPeoria, IL, through his communications was linked with al-Qaida. He \nserved time in a Navy brig in South Carolina, if I am not mistaken, and \neventually was tried in the courts of Peoria, IL, convicted and now \nincarcerated in Marion, IL, in southern Illinois.\n  I heard not one word of criticism when this took place under the \nprevious administration. The belief was this man had to answer for the \ncrimes he was charged with and serve time in our prison system as a \nresult of it. Never--not once, not one time--did I ever hear any \nCongressman of either political party say: Boy, it is unsafe to try him \nin Peoria or it is unsafe to incarcerate him in southern Illinois. It \nhas never been said.\n\n[[Page S13311]]\n\n  What happens to these people when they go into our supermax prisons, \nwhere no one has ever escaped? They disappear, as they should. They are \nwhere they ought to be--isolated and away from causing harm to anyone.\n  When President Obama was looking for an alternative to Guantanamo, we \ncame forward. One of the mayors of a small town in Illinois--Thomson, \nIL--with just several hundred people living there, wrote to the \nGovernor of our State and to me and said: I have a big old prison the \nState built and never opened--built it in 2001. It has the capacity of \nseveral thousand prisoners, and the State could never afford to open \nit. We had hoped that this prison would create a lot of local jobs for \nus. Can you find a use for it at the Federal level?\n  The Obama administration took a hard look at this for a long period \nof time. Part of it was done confidentially, and then they came out \npublicly and said: We are seriously interested.\n  The Senator from Georgia said earlier: Well, the people of Illinois \nare against this.\n  Well, I would say to my friend from Georgia, come on down to Thomson, \nIL. Come down and see the people who are overwhelmingly supportive--and \nnot just Democrats, believe me. Local State representative Jim Sacia is \na Republican and a former FBI agent. He said we would be idiots not to \ntake this offer from the Federal Government. He is right. Three \nthousand jobs. I don't know that there is a Senator here if you said to \nhim: Would you be interested in 3,000 jobs in the midst of a recession, \nwho wouldn't stand up and say: Let's talk.\n  Well, we did. So it is 3,000 new jobs at this prison when it is \nopened as part of the Bureau of Prisons and part of the Department of \nDefense.\n  How many Guantanamo detainees will be sent there? Fewer than 100. We \nhave 35 in our prisons already. Life has not changed in my home State \nof Illinois, nor has it changed in any other State where they are \nincarcerated. It would not change in Thomson, IL. These people can be \nheld safely and securely. I trust our men and women in the military to \ndo that, and the Members of the Senate should do so as well.\n  These 3,000 jobs are going to be a Godsend to an area with 11 percent \nunemployment. First, there will be a lot of construction jobs, and we \ncan use those. Those are good-paying jobs for Americans right here at \nhome. Then those who work for the Bureau of Prisons are going to be \npaid a good salary and receive good benefits, the kind of salary you \ncan use to build a family, a community, a neighborhood. These will be \npeople who will be buying homes--3,000 of them. They will be buying \nhomes, cars, shopping for appliances, and going to the local shopping \nmalls. Is that going to be good for the economy? You bet it is. It is \njust what we need, and it is just what this area of the State wants. \nThis argument that we somehow will oppose it is just wrong.\n  There is a local Congressman, who is a friend of mine--a Republican \nCongressman--who opposes it. We have talked about it. We just don't see \neye to eye on it. But even in Rockford, IL, the largest city in his \ndistrict, which is northeast of Thomson, the city council in Rockford \npassed a resolution of approval of this Thomson prison, 12 to 2. In \ncounty after county, State and local governments--I should say local \ncounty governments are coming out in favor of this Thomson prison. \nThose who come to the Senate floor and argue otherwise don't know the \nfacts. When they know the facts, they will realize we are prepared to \ndo this.\n  Now the question is whether the Senate will stand behind the \nPresident, stand behind our security advisers who believe this is in \nthe best interest of the United States. I think it is. It isn't the \nfirst time Illinois has been called on to do something extraordinary \nfor our country. The first supermax prison in our Federal system was \nbuilt in Marion, IL, years and years ago. There was controversy. This \nwas the most secure prison in America. But I will tell you, the people \nof southern Illinois rallied behind it. It has been a prison with a lot \nof great professionals who have worked there. They have done their jobs \nand done them well.\n  When I go down to Marion, IL, and talk to them about Guantanamo \ndetainees, they say: Senator, listen. Send them here. We will take care \nof them. We can point out among those who are incarcerated at Marion \nprison those who were engaged in al-Qaida terrorism, Colombian drug \ngangs, Mexican drug cartels, some of the meanest, toughest most violent \ngang bangers from the cities in the Midwest--and they are held safely \nevery day.\n  I will tell you, when I hear people say they do not trust our prison \nsystem to hold a handful or 50 or whatever the number may be--less than \n100--of these Guantanamo detainees, they ought to meet the men and \nwomen who do it every single day in America, and do it well. They \nshould realize these detainees will be held by our military, the \nDepartment of Defense employees. Those are the ones we can trust to do \nit.\n  So I would urge my friends and others who have spoken earlier--\nSenator McConnell came to the Senate floor earlier. It has become, \nunfortunately, a party position now that it is a bad idea. Earlier, \nSenator McCain and Senator Graham on the Republican side of the aisle \ndidn't argue against the transfer of these detainees. They understand \nthese prisoners aren't larger than life. They have been in prison for 8 \nyears. Frankly, I don't know how much longer they will stay there. But \nas long as they are a threat to the United States, they will.\n  Madam President, I would like to at this point address an issue which \ncame up earlier on the Senate floor.\n  Something unusual happened on the floor of the Senate today, Madam \nPresident. It happens but rarely. Under the rules of the Senate, \namendments and bills can be read, if a Member requests, and we usually \nask unanimous consent to dispense with the reading. And, routinely, \nthat is done. It is done every day on scores of different things.\n  Today, Senator Sanders of Vermont offered an amendment near and dear \nto his heart on single-payer health care reform, and it turned out to \nbe a voluminous amendment--800 pages long. When the time came to ask \nconsent that it not be read, there was an objection from Senator Coburn \nof Oklahoma. He insisted that it be read. Our poor clerking staff up \nhere--the clerks of the Senate--started reading this bill, and they \nread on for almost 2 hours or more.\n  As they were reading it, it came to our attention that Senator \nSanders of Vermont had authority under the Senate rules to withdraw his \namendment and to stop the reading of the amendment.\n  I wasn't aware of that because I can't recall that has ever happened \nsince I have been here. But I made a point--since many years ago I was \na parliamentarian of the Illinois State Senate and tried to at least \nread the rules from time to time--to turn to rule XV, section 2, in the \nStanding Rules of the Senate, and here is what it says:\n\n       Any motion, amendment, or resolution may be withdrawn or \n     modified by the mover at any time before a decision, \n     amendment or ordering of the yeas and nays, except a motion \n     to reconsider, which shall not be withdrawn without leave.\n\n  In other words, until action was taken on the Sanders amendment, he \nhad the authority under rule XV, paragraph 2 to withdraw his amendment, \nwhich he did.\n  Some have come to the floor and protested and said this was \nextraordinary, and it can't be backed up by the Senate rules. But I \nrefer them to this rule, which is explicit, and that no action had \ntaken place on this amendment other than the introduction of the \namendment and reading. So, as it says here, ``any time before a \ndecision, amendment, or ordering of the yeas and nays.'' I think that \nis a clear case.\n  I have since read an earlier ruling by the Chair relative to the same \nrule that goes back several decades, so the ruling of the Chair today, \nor at least the finding of the Chair, was consistent with the rules of \nthe Senate. But the strategy that came out in the ordering of this \namendment to be read is pretty clear when it comes to health care. The \nRepublican strategy is clear to anyone who is watching the debate: They \ndo not want amendments. In fact, they just don't want us to vote on \nhealth care reform. There comes a time when people make the best \narguments they can and the Senate makes a decision, and that is what we \nare facing. That is what we want. We would like to do that in a timely \nfashion.\n\n[[Page S13312]]\n\n  Members here believe we can do that in a responsible way and move \nthis health care reform bill to a point of a vote--a cloture vote, with \na 60-vote requirement--and do that in a way that we can find the \nsentiment in the Senate on this important measure and just maybe go \nhome for Christmas, which a lot of us would like to do. We have been \naway from our families for quite a while.\n  During the course of this debate, we have been spending a lot of time \non the bill itself. I usually like to give people an idea by holding up \nthis 2,074-page bill. It took a lot of work to get to this point. The \nmanagers' amendment to this will be several hundred pages, I imagine.\n  People say: Why is it so big? It is big because we are changing the \nhealth care system in America, which is one-sixth of our economy. You \ncan imagine all the different moving parts in this complicated health \ncare system that we address with this bill.\n  During this period of time, the Republicans have not offered any \nalternative or substitute. I thought that would be their first motion, \nto come forward and say: That is the Democratic plan to change the \nhealth care system in America, but you should see the Republican plan, \nhow much better it is. They didn't do that because there is no \nRepublican alternative. There is no Republican substitute.\n  Last week, when I went to the Senate Republican Web site--and I \ninvite people to do the same--I found there was only one bill printed \nthere on health care reform. It was the Democratic bill, not any bill \nthat has been offered by the Republican side. The reason is this is \nhard work. Putting a bill like this together, getting experts to look \nat it and decide whether it is going to save money or cost money, it \ntakes time. We have taken that time to do it, and do it right, and they \nhave not. So they are either not up to the challenge of preparing an \nalternative bill, or they are content with the current system.\n  I guess some people are content with the current system. Among those \nwho are content with it are the CEOs of health insurance companies. \nThey like this system. They make a lot of money. They do it at the \nexpense of a lot of people who need health care and end up being turned \ndown. So, unfortunately, the Republicans have no constructive proposals \nto improve our bill. Each and every amendment, almost without \nexception, has been to send the bill back to committee; to stop working \non it, and let's do this another day. All they want to do on the bill \nis to delay it, as they tried to do today with the reading of the \nSanders amendment.\n  Senator Judd Gregg of New Hampshire is a friend of mine. He and his \nwife Kathy and my wife Loretta and I have traveled together on official \nbusiness of the Senate. I like him. He is a smart guy. He is going to \nretire, and he, in his wisdom, decided to leave a playbook for the \nRepublican side of the aisle, which they shared. It is page after page \nof ways to slow down and stop the Senate from acting. Senator Gregg is \nentirely within his rights as a Senator to do it. What I read in his \nmemo was accurate, but the intent and motive are clear: He wanted to \nstop this bill from moving in order, and that became the real cause on \nthe Republican side of the aisle. They took a page out of Senator \nGregg's playbook today with Senator Coburn's demanding the amendment be \nread. But it didn't work.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord a colloquy between former Senators Adams and Packwood on the \nfloor of the Senate on September 24, 1992.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                        Tax Enterprise Zones Act\n\n              (Senate--September 24, 1992), [Page: S14919]\n\n       The Senate continued with the consideration of the bill.\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is \n     recognized.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 3173\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to deny the \nbenefits of certain export subsidies in the case of exports of certain \n  unprocessed timber, and to establish rural development programs for \ncertain rural communities and small businesses that have been adversely \n    affected by a declining timber supply and changes in the timber \n                   industry in the Pacific Northwest)\n\n       Mr. ADAMS. Mr. President, I send an amendment to the desk \n     and ask for its immediate consideration.\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n       The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n       The Senator from Washington [Mr. Adams] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 3173.\n       Mr. ADAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \n     reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n       Mr. PACKWOOD. Mr. President, I object.\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard. The clerk will \n     read the amendment.\n       The assistant legislative clerk continued reading the \n     amendment.\n       Mr. ADAMS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \n     further reading of the amendment be dispensed with.\n       Mr. PACKWOOD. I object.\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n       Mr, ADAMS. Mr. President, parliamentary inquiry? I have a \n     parliamentary inquiry of the Chair. Is it in order, during \n     the reading of the amendment, without it being dispensed \n     with, for the floor leader and the opponent of the amendment \n     to have a discussion?\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. The regular order, as the Chair is \n     advised by the Parliamentarian, is that the amendment is to \n     be read because objection has been heard to the unanimous-\n     consent request.\n       The clerk will read the amendment.\n       The assistant legislative clerk continued reading the \n     amendment.\n       Mr. ADAMS. Mr. President, I ask permission to withdraw the \n     amendment.\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a right to withdraw \n     the amendment.\n       Mr. ADAMS. I withdraw the amendment.\n       The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is withdrawn.\n       The amendment (No. 3173) was withdrawn.\n       The text of the amendment (No. 3173) is as follows:\n       At the end of title VIII, insert the following new \n     sections:\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Incidentally, Madam President, that is the colloquy I \nreferred to earlier where the Chair made exactly the same ruling on \nthat day as was made today, the finding in terms of rule XV, paragraph \n2.\n  I also ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nmemorandum prepared by Senator Gregg for the Republican side of the \naisle concerning the rights of the minority in the Senate, which I have \nmentioned earlier, and largely includes the rights to slow down and \nstop the activity of the Senate.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n  Foundation for the Minority Party's Rights in the Senate (Fall 2009)\n\n       The Senate rules are designed to give a minority of \n     Senators the right to insist on a full, complete, and fully \n     informed debate on all measures and issues coming before the \n     Senate. This cornerstone of protection can only be abrogated \n     if 60 or more Senators vote to take these rights away from \n     the minority.\n       I. Rights Available to Minority Before Measures are \n     Considered on Floor (These rights are normally waived by \n     Unanimous Consent (UC) when time is short, but any Senator \n     can object to the waiver.)\n       New Legislative Day, An adjournment of the Senate, as \n     opposed to a recess, is required to trigger a new legislative \n     day. A new legislative day starts with the morning hour, a 2-\n     hour period with a number of required procedures. During part \n     of the ``morning hour'' any Senator may make non-debatable \n     motions to proceed to items on the Senate calendar.\n       One Day and Two Day Rules--The 1-day rule requires that \n     measures must lie over one ``legislative day'' before they \n     can be considered. All bills have to lie over one day, \n     whether they were introduced by an individual Senator (Rule \n     XIV) or reported by a committee (Rule XVII). The 2-day rule \n     requires that IF a committee chooses to file a written \n     report, that committee report MUST contain a CBO cost \n     estimate, a regulatory impact statement, and detail what \n     changes the measure makes to current law (or provide a \n     statement why any of these cannot be done), and that report \n     must be available at least 2 calendar days before a bill can \n     be considered on the Senate floor. Senators may block a \n     measure's consideration by raising a point of order if it \n     does not meet one of these requirements.\n       ``Hard'' Quorum Calls--Senate operates on a presumptive \n     quorum of 51 senators and quorum calls are routinely \n     dispensed with by unanimous consent. If UC is not granted to \n     dispose of a routine quorum call, then the roll must continue \n     to be called. If a quorum is not present, the only motions \n     the leadership may make are to adjourn, to recess under a \n     previous order, or time-consuming motions to establish a \n     quorum that include requesting, requiring, and then arresting \n     Senators to compel their presence in the Senate chamber.\n       II. Rights Available to Minority During Consideration of \n     Measures in Senate (Many of these rights are regularly waived \n     by Unanimous Consent.)\n       Motions to Proceed to Measures--with the exception of \n     Conference Reports and Budget Resolutions, most such motions \n     are fully debatable and 60 votes for cloture is needed to cut \n     off extended debate.\n\n[[Page S13313]]\n\n       Reading of Amendments and Conference Reports in Entirety--\n     In most circumstances, the reading of the full text of \n     amendments may only be dispensed with by unanimous consent. \n     Any Senator may object to dispensing with the reading. If, as \n     is often the case when the Senate begins consideration of a \n     House-passed vehicle, the Majority Leader offers a full-text \n     substitute amendment, the reading of that full-text \n     substitute amendment can only be waived by unanimous consent. \n     A member may only request the reading of a conference report \n     if it is not available in printed form (100 copies available \n     in the Senate chamber).\n       Senate Points of Order--A Senator may make a point of order \n     at any point he or she believes that a Senate procedure is \n     being violated, with or without cause. After the presiding \n     officer rules, any Senator who disagrees with such ruling may \n     appeal the ruling of the chair--that appeal is fully \n     debatable. Some points of order, such as those raised on \n     Constitutional grounds, are not ruled on by the presiding \n     officer and the question is put to the Senate, then the point \n     of order itself is fully debatable. The Senate may dispose of \n     a point of order or an appeal by tabling it; however, delay \n     is created by the two roll call votes in connection with each \n     tabling motion (motion to table and motion to reconsider that \n     vote).\n       Budget Points of Order--Many legislative proposals (bills, \n     amendments, and conference reports) are subject to a point of \n     order under the Budget Act or budget resolution, most of \n     which can only be waived by 60 votes. If budget points of \n     order lie against a measure, any Senator may raise them, and \n     a measure cannot be passed or disposed of unless the points \n     of order that are raised are waived. (See http://\nbudget.senate.gov/republican/pressarchive/PointsofOrder.pdf)\n       Amendment Process\n       Amendment Tree Process and/or Filibuster by Amendment--\n     until cloture is invoked, Senators may offer an unlimited \n     number of amendments--germane or non-germane--on any subject. \n     This is the fullest expression of a ``full, complete, and \n     informed'' debate on a measure. It has been necessary under \n     past Democrat majorities to use the rules governing the \n     amendment process aggressively to ensure that minority \n     Senators get votes on their amendment as originally written \n     (unchanged by the Majority Democrats.)\n       Substitute Amendments--UC is routinely requested to treat \n     substitute amendments as original text for purposes of \n     further amendment, which makes it easier for the majority to \n     offer 2nd degree amendments to gut 1st degree amendments by \n     the minority. The minority could protect their amendments by \n     objecting to such UC's.\n       Divisible Amendments--amendments are divisible upon demand \n     by any Senator if they contain two or more parts that can \n     stand independently of one another. This can be used to fight \n     efforts to block the minority from offering all of their \n     amendments, because a single amendment could be drafted, \n     offered at a point when such an amendment is in order, and \n     then divided into multiple component parts for separate \n     consideration and votes. Demanding division of amendments can \n     also be used to extend consideration of a measure. Amendments \n     to strike and insert text cannot be divided.\n       Motions to Recommit Bills to Committee With or Without \n     Instructions--A Senator may make a motion to recommit a bill \n     to the committee with or without instructions to the \n     Committee to report it back to the Senate with certain \n     changes or additions. Such instructions are amendable.\n       After Passage: Going to Conference,Motions to Instruct \n     Conferees, Matters Out of Scope of Conference\n       Going to Conference--The Senate must pass 3 separate \n     motions to go to conference: (1) a motion to insist on its \n     amendments or disagree with the House amendments; (2) a \n     motion to request/agree to a conference; and (3) a motion to \n     authorize the Chair to appoint conferees. The Senate \n     routinely does this by UC, but if a Senator objects the \n     Senate must debate each step and all 3 motions may be \n     filibustered (requiring a cloture vote to end debate).\n       Motion to Instruct Conferees--Once the Senate adopts the \n     first two motions, Senators may offer an unlimited number of \n     motions to instruct the Senate's conferees. The motions to \n     instruct are amendable--and divisible upon demand--by \n     Senators if they contain more than one separate and distinct \n     instruction.\n       Conference Reports, Out of Scope Motions--In addition to \n     demanding a copy of the conference report to be on every \n     Senator's desk and raising Budget points of order against it, \n     Senators may also raise a point of order that it contains \n     matter not related to the matters originally submitted to the \n     conference by either chamber. If the Chair sustains the point \n     or order, the provision(s) is stricken from the conference \n     agreement, and the House would then have to approve the \n     measure absent the stricken provision (even if the House had \n     already acted on the conference report). The scope point of \n     order can be waived by 60 Senators.\n       Availability of Conference Report Language. The conference \n     report must be publicly available on a website 48 hours in \n     advance prior to the vote on passage.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I would just say that when Senator \nMcConnell came to the floor after the ruling and the decision of the \nChair, he said the plain language of the Senate precedent--the manual \nthat governs Senate procedure--is that unanimous consent of all Members \nwas required before the Senator from Vermont could withdraw his \namendment while it was being read. He said it required unanimous \nconsent. But that is not what the language of the Senate rules say that \nI have read. They say a Senator has, as a matter of right under rule \nXV, paragraph 2, to withdraw his amendment before action is taken. In \nthis case, as I mentioned earlier, the argument back in 1992 backs up \nthe Parliamentarian's decision in that interpretation of the rule.\n  So I would say it didn't work today to stop or slow down the Senate. \nCurrently, we are not technically debating health care reform. What is \nbefore us now is the Department of Defense appropriations bill from the \nHouse, which I hope we can move on quickly. I think it is not \ncontroversial. It is a matter of finding money for our troops who are \nrisking their lives overseas and supporting their families at home and \nproviding health care for members of the military and their families. I \ndon't think there is much debate about that.\n  It also extends the unemployment benefits that people need across \nAmerica, which passed with a 97-to-0 vote, if I am not mistaken, not \nthat long ago--the last time it was considered. So these are matters \nwhich should move along, and we should be able to do it in a fairly \nstraightforward way. I would hope we can show some bipartisanship when \nit comes to our men and women in uniform and approve the Department of \nDefense appropriations bill, which does not contain anything \ncontroversial beyond what I have just described. We can then get back \nto the health care reform bill. I think it is important that at some \npoint we bring this to a vote, to find if we indeed have the 60 votes \nfor health care reform. I sincerely hope we do.\n  I will close by saying this health care reform bill has its critics, \nbut it also has several features which can't be denied.\n  The first of those features that have been verified by the \nCongressional Budget Office: This bill does not add to the deficit of \nthe United States; it reduces the deficit by $130 billion over 10 years \nand $650 billion, moreover, the following 10 years.\n  We have also received reports from the Congressional Budget Office \nthat the result of this bill will be a decline in the increase in the \ncost of health insurance premiums--something we desperately need.\n  It is a bill that will also extend health insurance coverage to 30 \nmillion more Americans who do not have it today--50 million uninsured \nAmericans; 30 million of them, 60 percent of them, will have the \nprotection of health insurance coverage. Ninety percent of Americans \nwill have health insurance coverage--the highest percentage in the \nhistory of the United States of America--as a result of this bill.\n  This bill addresses directly the issue of whether health insurance \ncompanies can continue to deny coverage when people need it the most. \nWe know stories from our own life experience and our families' and \npeople who write to our offices, that people in the most need of health \ninsurance protection are often turned down by the companies. They pore \nthrough the applications and say: You failed to disclose a preexisting \ncondition. They say: Your amount of coverage has lapsed; your child is \ntoo old to be covered by your family plan--the list goes on and on.\n  Finally, some of the most egregious abuses by health insurance \ncompanies are addressed in this bill, and consumers across America are \ngiven the legal power to fight back and the legal power to be \nprotected. That is why this bill is important and why it is worth \npassing, all the criticism notwithstanding.\n  I might also say that it is a bill that is critically important for \nthe future of Medicare. If we do nothing, Medicare is going broke in 7 \nor 8 years, but we are told this bill will extend the life of Medicare \nup to 10 more years. That is good news, to put Medicare on sound \nfinancial footing, so our seniors like that.\n  The majority leader of the Senate came to the floor 2 days ago to \nannounce something else that will be part of the conference committee \nhere. The so-called doughnut hole, that gap in coverage for \nprescription drugs under\n\n[[Page S13314]]\n\nMedicare, is going to be filled so that seniors will no longer have \nthat period of uncertainty where their bills have reached a level where \nthey are disqualified from payment--the so-called doughnut hole. It \nwill be filled. It will give them peace of mind that if they have \nexpensive pharmaceuticals, they will have no interruption in coverage \nin the future when it comes to those pharmaceuticals.\n  For seniors, these are two major things--to put Medicare on sound \nfinancial footing and to fill the doughnut hole under the Medicare \nprescription part of the program.\n  It also is going to give seniors for the first time access to the \nkind of preventive care--regular checkups--they need for peace of mind \nand so doctors and professionals can catch problems before they get \nworse.\n  This bill is a positive bill, a positive step forward.\n  Yesterday, we had a chance as a Senate Democratic caucus to meet with \nPresident Obama. We went to the White House, the Executive Office \nBuilding, and the President talked to us about what this bill means. He \nreminded us that seven Presidents have tried to do this and failed. He \ntold us when he started this trek that he wanted to be the last \nPresident to deal with health care reform because he wanted to get it \ndone. I feel the same way. I think the American people feel the same \nway.\n  I am sure there is confusion. There have been a lot of misstatements \nmade about death panels and things that really have no basis in fact. \nBut people should be confident that when the AARP, the American \nAssociation of Retired Persons, stands up and says this is a good bill \nfor the seniors in America under Medicare and Social Security and for \ntheir families; when medical professionals, doctors and medical \nprofessionals, stand up and say this is a good bill, that we have the \nkind of support we need to say to the American people that this is an \nimportant step forward in health care protection in America.\n  It is time for us to make history and pass this bill. Let's do it and \ndo it in time for Members to enjoy Christmas with their families.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/16/senate-section/article/S13314-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13314]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, I wish to draw the attention of \nmy colleagues to the retirement of Jerahmiel S. Grafstein from the \nCanadian Senate.\n  As a member and now as Chairman of the Helsinki Commission, I have \nhad the privilege to know and work with Jerry Grafstein over the years \nthrough participation in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization \nfor Security and Cooperation in Europe--the OSCE. I know that my \ncolleague from Ohio, Senator Voinovich, also knows Jerry well, having \njust worked with him on a resolution at this year's Annual Session of \nthe Assembly in Vilnius, Lithuania, on combating anti-Semitism. I \nsuspect that many of my other Senate colleagues have also worked with \nhim over the years, as have many of our colleagues in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n[[Page S13316]]\n\n  Anybody who has met Senator Grafstein immediately recognizes him as a \nman of tremendous energy, deep commitment and brilliant mind. \nCommenting on Jerry's career, one of his Canadian Senate colleagues \nnoted the daunting task of paying tribute ``to a force of nature \ndisguised as a person.'' A successful lawyer, businessman and member of \nthe Liberal Party, he was summoned to the Canadian Senate in 1984. \nJerry Grafstein's accomplishments over the next 25 years of public \nservice are much more than I can relay here.\n  I do, however, want to highlight Jerry's prominent work with the 56 \ncountries, 300 member OSCE Parliamentary Assembly. Serving for 6 years \nas the Assembly's treasurer and then, with me since 2007, as one of \nnine Vice Presidents, Jerry has understood the potential of this \nmultilateral parliamentary forum to promote human rights, democracy and \ntolerance. Such a vital forum, however, does not just magically appear \nfor the world's benefit. Someone has to take the time to make it \nfunction by participating as an officer, attending countless \norganizational meetings and, for us and our Canadian neighbors, \ntraveling frequently across the Atlantic to do so. Jerry was one who \nrose to the challenge and then some.\n  Even as he helped on organizational matters, Jerry Grafstein found \nmore time than most others to focus on substance. First and foremost, \nhe has helped to lead the charge against rising anti-Semitism across \nEurope and around the world. Diplomacy has a tendency to soften the \ncriticism and downplay the negative, often until it is too late, but \nJerry has helped to ensure that the OSCE did not shy away from dealing \ndirectly with this and other manifestations of hate and prejudice that \ndangerously confront far too many societies. Today, thanks to the \nvigilance of Jerry Grafstein and others, efforts to promote greater \ntolerance are now a solid, ongoing and vital aspect of the OSCE's work.\n  This distinguished Senator from Canada also found time to participate \nand help lead OSCE PA missions observing elections and referenda in \nplaces like Russia, Ukraine, Georgia and Montenegro. By being an \ninternational observer, he became a witness to history and, in my view, \nhelped history forward and make the world a more democratic place.\n  In all his public endeavors, Jerry Grafstein has been a close friend \nof the United States of America. He has helped over the years to \ndevelop the bilateral dialogue between the U.S. Congress and the \nCanadian Parliament. He has come here to Washington on many occasions, \nincluding as a participant in Helsinki Commission events. He has always \nmade clear that he is Canadian and proud of the country he represents, \nbut that has never kept him from developing areas of common interest \nand seeking points of agreement even on some issues where our national \nviews may otherwise diverge.\n  Jerry Grafstein has been and will remain a close personal friend as \nwell, always concerned, always engaging, never pretentious. I wish him \nand his wife Carole the very best. Although he deserves some time off, \nI am confident that he will remain prominent in the life of the vibrant \ncity of Toronto.\n  In noting the many accomplishments of Jerahmiel Grafstein and \nthanking him for his commitment to public service, I respectfully \nborrow the Canadian Senate's tradition and join his colleagues in \nsaying: ``Hear, Hear!'' On a personal level, I believe I speak for \nnumerous colleagues of my own in saying that Jerry will be missed, and \nalways welcome to come and visit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/16/senate-section/article/S13316-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13316]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TRIBUTE TO TOMAS VILLANUEVA\n\n Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, today I would like to take a \nmoment to recognize a very special advocate, activist, and champion for \nequal rights in my home State of Washington on his birthday.\n  Tomas Villanueva has been a farmworkers, warehouse packers, and other \neconomically disadvantaged laborers advocate since the early 1960s. \nTomas was one of the first people involved in the United Farmworkers \nUnion in my home State and has fought for years to ensure that workers \nare treated with dignity, respect, and under the protections of the \nlaw.\n  Tomas' involvement with the human rights movement began in the early \n1960s when he was inspired by UFW leader Cesar Chavez. And since that \ntime, Tomas has fought for numerous causes and people while maintaining \nhis reputation as a kind, generous, compassionate and humble leader.\n  Tomas has also been a close friend and partner of mine for a very \nlong time. He has helped my staff and I recognize the depth of the \ndifficult conditions that farmworkers face, and has been a consistent \nvoice in fighting to improve conditions through the legislative \nprocess.\n  Farmworker housing is a moral issue, an economic issue, and a family \nissue. Too many workers and their families face very difficult living \nconditions. Some live in their cars. Others share run-down, overcrowded \nrooms with other families. These are not the kinds of living conditions \nwe can tolerate in the United States in the 21st century. They are \ncertainly not suitable for the people who help put food on our tables \nand who keep our State's economy strong. Tomas knows that we can and \nmust do better.\n  Tomas Villanueva was 14 when his family emigrated from Mexico. After \nfollowing the crops for three years, the family settled in Toppenish, \nWashington in 1958. Tomas spent the next several years working various \njobs before earning a high school GED and enrolling in Yakima Valley \nCollege.\n  Hearing about Caesar Chavez's United Farm Workers movement, Tomas \ntravelled to California in 1967 to learn about organizing. Returning to \nthe Yakima Valley, he helped found the United Farm Worker Cooperative, \none of the very first Chicano organizations in the State of Washington.\n  From 1967 to 1974, Tomas devoted himself to farm worker organizing \nand Chicano movement activism. Out of these efforts came the Yakima \nValley Farmworkers Clinic, the United Farm Workers Service Center, a \nwave of hop harvest strikes in 1969, 1970, 1971, and a successful grape \nboycott.\n  In 1974, Tomas started a construction company with his father and \nbrothers, but in the 1980s he was back in the union movement. In 1986 \nhe became the first president of the newly formed United Farm Workers \nof Washington State. Today he lives in Toppenish and remains active in \nState and local politics.\n  Tomas Villanueva continues to be a valued friend, hard-working \npartner, and widely-respected leader in his community. I am so pleased \nto recognize his lifetime of achievements on this special day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/16/senate-section/article/S13316-2", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S13316-S13317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         RECOGNIZING SUTHERLAND WESTON MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, as we approach the holiday season, \nwe are frequently reminded of the generosity and warmth that Americans \ndemonstrate year in and year out at this most festive time. In \nparticular, we often hear stories of employees at local businesses who \ngraciously donate their time and efforts to help the less fortunate. \nThis week I wish to recognize the employees of one such company who \nconsistently work to improve the lot of everyone in their community.\n  Sutherland Weston Marketing Communications of Bangor is a cutting-\nedge firm that specializes in a host of marketing topics, including \npublic relations, media, and branding. Specifically, the company helps \nits customers design memorable flyers and mailers, effective television \nadvertisements, and state-of-the-art Web sites, and teaches them the \nincreased value of employing popular social media, such as Facebook and \nTwitter, in their marketing decisions. Since its inception in 2005, \nSutherland Weston has assisted dozens of clients throughout Maine \nseeking ways to enhance their image and broaden their customer base. \nAmong them are local small businesses such as Maine Wood Concepts of \nGuilford and Raye's Mustard Mill of Eastport; organizations like the \nBangor Symphony Orchestra; and institutions such as the University of \nMaine.\n  Furthermore, members of the Sutherland Weston team participate \nregularly in conferences and seminars to better educate the public on \nhow to maximize marketing strategies. One such event is the Social \nMedia 101 seminar, held this past March, where the firm's owners--\nElizabeth Sutherland\n\n[[Page S13317]]\n\nand Cary Weston--presented a workshop designed at increasing the \nprofessional use of sites such as Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn.\n  The nine employees of Sutherland Weston are also active members of \nthe greater Bangor community, contributing to various philanthropic \nendeavors on a regular basis. This past June, the company took part in \nthe 25th Trek Across Maine in support of the American Lung Association. \nThe ``Green Marketeers,'' including Sutherland Weston employees, \nspouses, and friends, took to their bicycles for the 180-mile trip from \nBethel's Sunday River mountain to the coastal town of Belfast, raising \nnearly $8,000 in pledges along the way.\n  Additionally, in recognition of the true meaning of Christmas, the \ncompany's employees donated time and talent this year to creating a \nnew, user-friendly Web site called Christmas is for Kids, a critical \nprogram that facilitates donations of holiday gifts for underprivileged \nchildren across Maine. The Web site allows users to find the name and \nhometown of a child, as well as the specific gift he or she is \nrequesting, adding a personal touch to the experience. Donors indicate \nwhich gift they are willing to purchase so that it can be removed from \nthe listing, doing their best to ensure that no child is left out. \nSeveral sponsors have suggested that because of Sutherland Weston's \nnoteworthy Web site, 2009 may be the most successful season in the \nprogram's 27-year history.\n  As we look forward to celebrating the upcoming holidays with our \nloved ones, let us take a moment to remember those experiencing sorrow \nduring this joyous season. And let us also recognize those who are \nworking in every community across the country to make someone's day \nbrighter through deeds great and small. I thank Elizabeth Sutherland, \nCary Weston, and everyone at Sutherland Weston Marketing Communications \nfor their selfless gift this holiday season, and wish them continued \nsuccess in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/16/senate-section/article/S13317-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13317]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 11:49 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 1084.

JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mr. McCain, and Mr. Feingold):\n  S. 2886. A bill to prohibit certain affiliations (between commercial \nbanking and investment banking companies), and for other purposes; to \nthe Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to be joining my friend and \ncolleague from Washington, Senator Cantwell, to introduce the Banking \nIntegrity Act of 2009. My reasons for joining this effort are simple--I \nwant to ensure that we never stick the American taxpayer with another \n$700 billion tab to bail out the financial industry. If big Wall Street \ninstitutions want to take part in risky transactions--fine. But we \nshould not allow them to do so with federally insured deposits.\n  Paul Volcker, a top economist in the Obama administration and former \nFederal Reserve Chairman, wants the nation's banks to be prohibited \nfrom owning and trading risky securities, the very practice that got \nthe biggest ones into deep trouble in 2008. The administration is \nsaying no, it will not separate commercial banking from investment \noperations. Mr. Volcker argues that regulation by itself will not work. \nSooner or later, the giants, in pursuit of profits, will get into \ntrouble. The administration should accept this and shield commercial \nbanking from Wall Street's wild ways. ``The banks are there to serve \nthe public,'' Mr. Volcker said, ``and that is what they should \nconcentrate on. These other activities create conflicts of interest. \nThey create risks, and if you try to control the risks with \nsupervision, that just creates friction and difficulties'' and \nultimately fails.\n  The bill we are introducing today precludes any member bank of the \nFederal Reserve System from being affiliated with any entity or \norganization that is engaged principally in the issue, flotation, \nunderwriting, public sale or distribution of stocks, bonds, debentures \nor other securities. Essentially, commercial banks may no longer \nintermingle their business activities with investment banks. It is that \nsimple.\n  Since the repeal of the Glass Steagall Act in 1999, this country has \nseen a new culture emerge in the financial industry: one of dangerous \ngreed and excessive risk-taking. Commercial banks traditionally used \npeople's deposits for the constructive purpose of main street loans. \nThey did not engage in high risk ventures. Investment banks, however, \nmanaged rich people's money--those who can afford to take bigger risks \nin order to get a bigger return, and who bore their own losses. When \nthese two worlds collided, the investment bank culture prevailed, \ncutting off the credit lifeblood of main street firms, demanding \ngreater returns that were achievable only through high leverage and \nhuge risk taking, and leaving taxpayers with the fallout.\n  When the glass wall dividing banks and securities firms was \nshattered, common sense and caution went out the door. The new mantra \nof ``bigger is better'' took over--and the path forward focused on \nshort-term gains rather than long-term planning. Banks became \noverleveraged in their haste to keep up in the race. The more they \nlent, the more they made. Aggressive mortgages were underwritten for \nunqualified individuals who became homeowners saddled with loans they \ncouldn't afford. Banks turned right around and bought portfolios of \nthese shaky loans.\n\n  Sub-prime loans made up only five percent of all mortgage lending in \n1998, but by the time the financial crisis peaked in late 2008, they \nwere approaching 30 percent. Since January 2008, we have seen 159 state \nand national banks fail. In my home State of Arizona, five banks have \nshut their doors, leaving small businesses scrambling to find credit \nfrom other banks that may have already been overleveraged.\n  Banks sold sub-prime mortgages to their affiliates and other \nsecurities firms for securitization, while other financial institutions \nmade risky bets on these and other assets for which they had no \nfinancial interest. As the market grew bigger, its foundation became \nshakier. It was like a house of cards waiting to fall, and fall it did.\n\n[[Page S13322]]\n\n  In October 2008, the financial system was on the brink of collapse \nwhen Congress was forced to risk $700 billion of taxpayer dollars to \nbail out the industry. These financial institutions had become ``too \nbig to fail.'' In fact, the special inspector general of the Troubled \nAsset Relief Program, TARP, testified before Congress earlier this year \nthat ``total potential Federal Government support could reach $23.7 \ntrillion'' to stabilize and support the financial system. Ironically, \nsome of these ``too big to fail'' institutions have now become even \nbigger. An editorial from yesterday's New York Times stated:\n\n       The truth is that the taxpayers are still very much on the \n     hook for a banking system that is shaping up to be much \n     riskier than the one that led to disaster.\n       Big bank profits, for instance, still come mostly courtesy \n     of taxpayers. Their trading earnings are financed by more \n     than a trillion dollars' worth of cheap loans from the \n     Federal Reserve, for which some of their most noxious assets \n     are collateral. They benefit from immense federal loan \n     guarantees, but they are not lending much. Lending to \n     business, notably, is very tight.\n       What profits the banks make come mostly from trading. Many \n     big banks are happy to depend on the lifeline from the Fed \n     and hang onto their toxic assets hoping for a rebound in \n     prices. And the whole system has grown more concentrated. \n     Bank of America was considered too big to fail before the \n     meltdown. Since then, it has acquired Merrill Lynch. Wells \n     Fargo took over Wachovia. JPMorgan Chase gobbled up Bear \n     Stearns.\n       If the goal is to reduce the number of huge banks that \n     taxpayers must rescue at any cost, the nation is moving in \n     the wrong direction. The growth of the biggest banks ensures \n     that the next bailout will have to be even bigger. These \n     banks will be more likely to take on excessive risk because \n     they have the implicit assurance of rescue.\n\n  Excess was a common theme for banks/financial institutions in the \nmid-2000s--excessive risk, excessive bonuses. Times were good at \nMerrill Lynch in 2006 when the firm's risky mortgage business was \nbooming. The firm made record earnings of $7.5 billion that year and \npaid out bonuses of $5 billion to $6 billion. Fast forward to late 2008 \nwhen Merrill's gambling left it in deep financial despair with losses \nexceeding $27 billion. Yet we witnessed the firm pay out another $3.6 \nbillion in bonuses just before it was acquired by Bank of America.\n  Merrill Lynch wasn't alone in excess and greed. Citigroup posted a \nnet loss of nearly $28 billion in 2008, yet paid out $5.3 billion in \nbonuses. Although Goldman Sachs earned only $2.3 billion, it paid out \n$4.8 billion in bonuses. Morgan Stanley earned $1.7 billion, and paid \nout nearly $4.5 billion in bonuses. JPMorgan Chase earned $5.6 billion \nand paid $8.7 billion in bonuses. If a company doesn't make money, how \ncan it pay these bonuses? In this case, each of these firms was a \nrecipient of billions in taxpayer-funded TARP money.\n  The Federal Government has set a dangerous precedent here. We sent \nthe wrong message to the financial industry: you engage in bad, risky \nbusiness practices, and when you get into trouble, the government will \nbe there to save your hide. Many would call it a moral hazard. I call \nit a taxpayer-funded subsidy for risky behavior.\n  The consolidation of the banking world was also riddled with \nconflicts of interest, despite the purported firewalls that were put \ninto place. If an investment bank had underwritten shares for a company \nthat was now in financial trouble, the investment bank's commercial arm \nwould feel pressure to lend the company money, despite the lack of \nmerits to do so. The Banking Integrity Act of 2009 would eliminate some \nof these conflicts.\n  Today, it is time to put a stop to the taxpayer-financed excesses of \nWall Street. No single financial institution should be so big that its \nfailure would bring ruin to our economy and destroy millions of \nAmerican jobs. This country would be better served if we limit the \nactivities of these financial institutions. Banks should accept \nconsumer deposits and invest conservatively, while investment banks \nengage in underwriting and sales of securities.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD:\n  S. 2890. A bill to amend the Buy American Act to increase the \nrequirement for American-made content, to tighten the waiver \nprovisions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nhelp American workers and companies.\n  The bill that I am introducing, the Buy American Improvement Act, \nfocuses on the Federal Government's responsibility to support domestic \nmanufacturers and workers and on the role of Federal procurement policy \nin achieving this goal. The reintroduction of this bill, which I first \nintroduced in 2003, is part of my ongoing efforts to support American \nworkers and manufacturing.\n  The Buy American Act of 1933 is the primary statute that governs \nFederal procurement. The name of this law accurately describes its \npurpose: to ensure that the Federal Government supports domestic \ncompanies and domestic workers by buying American-made goods. \nRegrettably, this law contains a number of loopholes that make it too \neasy for government agencies to buy foreign-made goods.\n  My bill, the Buy American Improvement Act, would strengthen the \nexisting law by tightening its waiver provisions. Currently, the heads \nof Federal departments and agencies are given broad discretion to waive \nthe act and buy foreign goods with little or no accountability. We \nshould ensure that the Federal Government makes every effort to give \nFederal contracts to companies that will perform the work domestically. \nWe should also ensure that certain types of industries do not leave the \nU.S. completely, thus making the Federal Government dependent on \nforeign sources for goods, such as plane or ship parts, that our \nmilitary may need to acquire on short notice.\n  With unemployed workers in the U.S. facing a double-digit \nunemployment rate, the highest rate since 1983, it is critical Congress \nback efforts to support American workers. Many unemployed American \nworkers are currently facing persistently long periods of unemployment; \ndata from the Department of Labor showed that in October of this year, \nover 35 percent of unemployed workers had been without jobs for at \nleast 27 weeks. Since December of 2007, the number of unemployed \nworkers in the U.S. has grown by over 8 million, with manufacturing and \nconstruction workers being particularly hard-hit. We need to do all we \ncan to promote fiscally responsible Federal policies that support the \ncreation of American jobs to help get the unemployed and Funderemployed \nback to work. A strong Buy American Act should be part of the Federal \neffort to create and retain American jobs.\n  During another period of economic upheaval in the 1930s, Congress \npassed a series of laws designed to promote job growth in the U.S., \nincluding the Buy American Act of 1933, 41 U.S.C. Sec. 10a-10d. The Buy \nAmerican Act requires the Federal Government to support domestic \nmanufacturers and workers by purchasing American-made goods. Over the \nyears, other domestic sourcing legislation has been passed to help \nsupport American industry, including the Buy America Act, 23 U.S.C. \nSec. 313, which applies to Federal transportation funding. In addition, \nCongress included domestic sourcing requirements in the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act, P.L. 111-5, earlier this year because it \nrecognized the importance of supporting American workers and American \nindustry. My legislation would help American industry by making it more \ndifficult to waive the Buy American Act and help ensure the Federal \nGovernment does all it can to support American workers.\n  I have a long record of supporting efforts to help taxpayers get the \nmost bang for their buck and opposing wasteful Federal spending. I \ndon't think anyone can argue that supporting American jobs is \n``wasteful.'' We owe it to American manufacturers and their employees \nto make sure they get a fair shake. I would not support awarding a \ncontract to an American company that is price-gouging, but we should \nmake every effort to ensure that domestic sources for goods needed by \nthe Federal Government do not dry up because American companies have \nbeen slightly underbid by foreign competitors.\n  The gaping loopholes in the Buy American Act and the trade agreements \nand defense procurement agreements that contain additional waivers of \ndomestic source restrictions have combined to weaken our domestic\n\n[[Page S13323]]\n\nmanufacturing base by allowing--and sometimes actually encouraging--the \nFederal Government to buy foreign-made goods. Congress can and should \ndo more to support American companies and American workers. We must \nstrengthen the Buy American Act and we must stop entering into bad \ntrade agreements that send our jobs overseas and undermine our own \ndomestic preference laws.\n  By strengthening Federal procurement policy, we can help to bolster \nour domestic manufacturers during these difficult times. As I have \nrepeatedly noted, Congress cannot simply stand on the sidelines while \ntens of thousands of American manufacturing jobs have been and continue \nto be shipped overseas. While there may be no single solution to this \nproblem one way in which Congress should act is by strengthening the \nBuy American Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REID (for himself, Mr. Ensign, Mrs. Feinstein, and Mrs. \n        Boxer):\n  S. 2891.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this part to implement \n     reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care \n     liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. _13.

against a health care \n     provider or a health care institution regardless of the \n     theory of liability on which the claim is based, or the \n     number of claimants, plaintiffs, defendants,

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this part to implement \n     reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health care \n     liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. _13.

A court may allow a claimant to file an amended \n     pleading for punitive damages only upon a motion by the \n     claimant and after a finding by the court, upon review of \n     supporting and opposing affidavits or after a hearing, after \n     weighing the evidence, that the claimant has established by a \n     substantial probability that the claimant will prevail on the \n     claim for punitive damages.\n       (3) Separate proceeding.--At the request of any party in a \n     health care lawsuit, the trier of fact shall consider in a \n     separate proceeding--\n       (A) whether punitive damages are to be awarded and the \n     amount of such award; and\n       (B) the amount of punitive damages following a \n     determination of punitive liability.\n\n     If a separate proceeding is requested, evidence relevant only \n     to the claim for punitive damages, as determined by \n     applicable State law, shall be inadmissible in any proceeding \n     to determine whether compensatory damages are to be awarded.\n       (4) Limitation where no compensatory damages are awarded.--\n     In any health care lawsuit where no judgment for compensatory \n     damages is rendered against a person, no punitive damages may \n     be awarded with respect to the claim in such lawsuit against \n     such person.\n       (b) Determining Amount of Punitive Damages.--\n       (1) Factors considered.--In determining the amount of \n     punitive damages under this section, the trier of fact shall \n     consider only the following:\n       (A) the severity of the harm caused by the conduct of such \n     party;\n       (B) the duration of the conduct or any concealment of it by \n     such party;\n       (C) the profitability of the conduct to such party;\n       (D) the number of products sold or medical procedures \n     rendered for compensation, as the case may be, by such party, \n     of the kind causing the harm complained of by the claimant;\n       (E) any criminal penalties imposed on such party, as a \n     result of the conduct complained of by the claimant; and\n       (F) the amount of any civil fines assessed against such \n     party as a result of the conduct complained of by the \n     claimant.\n       (2) Maximum award.--The amount of punitive damages awarded \n     in a health care lawsuit may not exceed an amount equal to \n     two times the amount of economic damages awarded in the \n     lawsuit or $250,000, whichever is greater.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--\n       (1) Effect on health care access and costs.--Congress finds \n     that our current civil justice system is adversely affecting \n     patient access to health care services, better patient care, \n     and cost-efficient health care, in that the health care \n     liability system is a costly and ineffective mechanism for \n     resolving claims of health care liability and compensating \n     injured patients, and is a deterrent to the sharing of \n     information among health care professionals which impedes \n     efforts to improve patient safety and quality of care.\n       (2) Effect on interstate commerce.--Congress finds that the \n     health care and insurance industries are industries affecting \n     interstate commerce and the health care liability litigation \n     systems existing throughout the United States are activities \n     that affect interstate commerce by contributing to the high \n     costs of health care and premiums for health care liability \n     insurance purchased by health care system providers.\n       (3) Effect on federal spending.--Congress finds that the \n     health care liability litigation systems existing throughout \n     the United States have a significant effect on the amount, \n     distribution, and use of Federal funds because of--\n       (A) the large number of individuals who receive health care \n     benefits under programs operated or financed by the Federal \n     Government;\n       (B) the large number of individuals who benefit because of \n     the exclusion from Federal taxes of the amounts spent to \n     provide them with health insurance benefits; and\n       (C) the large number of health care providers who provide \n     items or services for which the Federal Government makes \n     payments.\n       (b) Purpose.--It is the purpose of this subtitle to \n     implement reasonable, comprehensive, and effective health \n     care liability reforms designed to--\n       (1) improve the availability of health care services in \n     cases in which health care liability actions have been shown \n     to be a factor in the decreased availability of services;\n       (2) reduce the incidence of ``defensive medicine'' and \n     lower the cost of health care liability insurance, all of \n     which contribute to the escalation of health care costs;\n       (3) ensure that persons with meritorious health care injury \n     claims receive fair and adequate compensation, including \n     reasonable noneconomic damages;\n       (4) improve the fairness and cost-effectiveness of our \n     current health care liability system to resolve disputes \n     over, and provide compensation for, health care liability by \n     reducing uncertainty in the amount of compensation provided \n     to injured individuals; and\n       (5) provide an increased sharing of information in the \n     health care system which will reduce unintended injury and \n     improve patient care.\n\n     SEC. 10103.

means \n     objectively verifiable monetary losses incurred as a result \n     of the provision of, use of, or payment for (or failure to \n     provide, use, or pay for) health care services or

care liability claim concerning the \n     provision of health care goods or services affecting \n     interstate commerce, or any health care liability action \n     concerning the provision of (or the failure to provide) \n     health care goods or services affecting interstate commerce, \n     brought in a State or Federal court or pursuant to an \n     alternative dispute resolution system, against a health care \n     provider or a health care institution regardless of the \n     theory of liability on which the claim is based, or the \n     number of claimants, plaintiffs, defendants, or other \n     parties, or the number of claims or causes of action, in \n     which the claimant alleges a health care liability claim.\n       (10) Health care liability action.--The term ``health care \n     liability action'' means a civil action brought in a State or \n     Federal Court or pursuant to an alternative dispute \n     resolution system, against a health care provider or a

The \n     calculation shall not include an estimate of the change in \n     federal interest payments.\n       (2) Federal budgetary commitment to health care.--The term \n     ``Federal budgetary commitment to health care'' refers to the \n     sum of net Federal outlays for all Federal programs and tax \n     preferences for health care.\n       (3) OMB proposal.--The term ``OMB proposal'' refers to the \n     proposed legislative language and such proposal as \n     subsequently modified, if modified by amendment in either \n     House required under subsection (e)(2)(C) to carry out \n     recommendations pursuant to subsection (e)(2)(A).\n       (4) Savings target.--The term ``savings target'' refers to \n     the net total provided under subsection (d)(1) for the period \n     2010 through 2019.\n       (c) CBO Advisory Reports.--Starting on October 1, 2012, and \n     every 2 years thereafter, through October 1, 2018, not later \n     than 60 days after the start of the fiscal year, the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) shall submit an updated \n     advisory report to Congress and the President. The updated \n     report shall include a detailed estimate of the budgetary \n     effects of this Act based on the information available for \n     the period 2010 through 2019, as well as information on the \n     budgetary effects for the period 2020 through 2029.\n       (d) OMB Cost Estimate Reports.--\n       (1) Initial cost estimate report.--Not later than 60 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Director of the \n     Office of Management and Budget (OMB) shall submit to \n     Congress a report containing an estimate of the budgetary \n     effects of this Act for 2010 through 2019, as well as \n     information on the budgetary effects for 2020 through 2029. \n     The estimate of net savings produced by this Act for the \n     period 2010 through 2019 period shall serve as the savings \n     target for future cost estimate reports, provided that the \n     OMB estimate is not less than the final CBO estimate of net \n     savings produced by this Act made by CBO prior to its \n     enactment. If the savings estimated by OMB is less than the \n     amount estimated by the CBO, then the estimate of net savings \n     produced by the CBO shall serve as the savings target.\n       (2) Updated cost estimate reports.--Starting on October 1, \n     2012, and every 2 years thereafter, through fiscal year 2019, \n     OMB shall reestimate the budgetary effects of this Act based \n     on the information available at that time.

A motion to proceed is in order even though a \n     previous motion to the same effect has been disagreed to. All \n     points of order against the motion to proceed to the OMB \n     proposal are waived. The motion to proceed is not debatable. \n     The motion is not subject to a motion to postpone.

If the House-passed OMB proposal is identical to \n     the Senate-passed OMB proposal, the vote on passage of the \n     OMB proposal in the Senate shall be considered to be the vote \n     on passage of the OMB proposal received from the House of \n     Representatives. If it is not identical to the House-passed \n     OMB proposal, then the Senate shall be considered to have \n     passed the OMB proposal of the House as amended by the text \n     of the Senate OMB proposal.\n       (E) Consideration in conference.--Upon passage of the OMB \n     proposal, the Senate shall be deemed to have insisted on its \n     amendment and requested a conference with the House of \n     Representatives on the disagreeing votes of the two Houses, \n     and the Chair be authorized to appoint conferees on the part \n     of the Senate, without any intervening action.\n       (F) Action on conference reports in senate.--\n       (i) Motion to proceed.--A motion to proceed to the \n     consideration of the conference report on the OMB proposal \n     may be made even though a previous motion to the same effect \n     has been disagreed to.\n       (ii) Consideration.--During the consideration in the Senate \n     of the conference report (or a message between Houses) on the \n     OMB proposal, and all amendments in disagreement, and all \n     amendments thereto, and debatable motions and appeals in \n     connection therewith, debate (or consideration) shall be \n     limited to 10 hours, to be equally divided between, and \n     controlled by, the majority leader and minority leader or \n     their designees.

I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. Res. 376, submitted earlier today.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 376) honoring the 60th anniversary of \n     the establishment of diplomatic relations between the United \n     States and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, the 10th \n     anniversary of the accession to the throne of His Majesty \n     King Abdullah II Ibn Al Hussein, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, today, I am supporting this resolution \nto honor the 60th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic \nrelations between the U.S. and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, as well \nas to honor the 10th anniversary of His Majesty King Abdullah II Ibn Al \nHussein's accession to the throne. I am pleased to be joined in this \nendeavor by Senator Gregg.\n  Since establishing diplomatic relations, Jordan has worked together \nwith the U.S. towards the mutual goal of peace in the Middle East. In \n1994, King Hussein and Prime Minister of Israel, Yitzhak Rabin, signed \nthe Jordan-Israel peace treaty, ending nearly 50 years of war between \nthe two countries. The government of Jordan has been an instrumental \npartner in the fight against al-Qaida and terrorism. As a result, the \npeople of Jordan have also suffered devastating losses at the hands of \nterrorists.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor to \nthis legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I ask unanimous consent that the resolution be agreed to,\n\n[[Page S13341]]\n\nthe preamble be agreed to, the motions to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable, with no intervening action or debate, and any statements be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 376) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 376\n\n       Whereas the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan achieved \n     independence on May 25, 1946;\n       Whereas the United States recognized Jordan as an \n     independent state in a White House announcement on January \n     31, 1949;\n       Whereas diplomatic relations and the American Legation in \n     Jordan were established on February 18, 1949, when United \n     States diplomat Wells Stabler presented his credentials as \n     Charge d'Affaires in Amman;\n       Whereas, for 60 years, the United States and Jordan have \n     enjoyed a close relationship and have worked together to \n     advance issues ranging from the promotion of Middle East \n     peace to advancing the socio-economic development of the \n     people of Jordan, as well as the threat to both posed by al \n     Qaeda and violent extremism;\n       Whereas, from 1952 to 1999, King Hussein charted a moderate \n     path for his country;\n       Whereas, for decades, the United States has been Jordan's \n     strongest international partner;\n       Whereas, throughout his reign, King Hussein looked for \n     opportunities to realize his dream of a more peaceful Middle \n     East by working to solve intra-Arab disputes and engaging \n     successive Prime Ministers of Israel in the search for peace;\n       Whereas King Hussein and Prime Minister of Israel Yitzhak \n     Rabin signed the historic Jordan-Israel peace treaty in 1994, \n     ending nearly 50 years of war between the neighboring \n     countries;\n       Whereas the United States lost a close friend and a crucial \n     partner when King Hussein passed away in 1999;\n       Whereas King Hussein was succeeded by his son, King \n     Abdullah II, who has continued his father's work to improve \n     the lives of the people of Jordan while also seeking to bring \n     peace to the region;\n       Whereas, in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, \n     terrorist attacks, the Government of Jordan has been an \n     instrumental partner in the fight against al Qaeda, has \n     provided crucial assistance in Iraq, and has shouldered a \n     heavy burden in providing refuge to a significant portion of \n     the Iraqi refugee population;\n       Whereas, through his 2004 Amman Message, King Abdullah II \n     has been a leading Arab voice in trying to reaffirm the true \n     path of Islam;\n       Whereas, in November 2005, al Qaeda terrorists struck three \n     hotels in Amman, Jordan, thereby uniting the people of Jordan \n     and the United States in grief over the lives lost at this \n     act of terrorism; and\n       Whereas King Abdullah II begins his second decade on the \n     Hashemite throne by redoubling his efforts for peace in the \n     region as the Jordan-United States partnership enters its \n     seventh decade: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the 60th anniversary of the close \n     relationship between the United States and the Hashemite \n     Kingdom of Jordan;\n       (2) expresses its profound admiration and gratitude for the \n     friendship of the people of Jordan;\n       (3) congratulates His Majesty King Abdullah II on 10 years \n     of enlightened and progressive rule; and\n       (4) shares the hope of His Majesty King Abdullah II and the \n     people of Jordan for a more peaceful Middle East.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/12/16/senate-section/article/S13341-1", "month": "12", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S13341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ORDERS FOR THURSDAY, DECEMBER 17, 2009\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
