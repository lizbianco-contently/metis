Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                       EPA's Endangerment Finding\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I am on the floor to express some concerns \nI have concerning Guantanamo Bay and the efforts of some people, for no \nreason that I can understand, who want to close it. However, before \ndoing that, another matter is happening right now.\n  On Friday of last week, the administration set in motion a ticking \ntimebomb with its release of an endangerment finding for carbon dioxide \nand five other greenhouse gases. The ruling proposes that carbon \ndioxide is a dangerous pollutant that threatens the public health and \nwelfare, and therefore must be regulated under the 1970 Clean Air Act.\n  This so-called endangerment finding sets the clock ticking on a vast \narray of regulations and taxes on small businesses throughout America \nthat would be devastating. They claim, at least for now, to attempt to \norganize the chaos by limiting it to motor vehicles, which is a bad \nenough option considering the state of the auto industry to which we \nare all so sensitive with what is happening. Any attempt to stretch the \nClean Air Act to regulate these gases illustrates a kind of game of \nRussian roulette this administration is playing with the American \neconomy. We start with the auto industry. I can assure you, it is not \ngoing to end up there.\n  They are presenting policymakers with a false choice: Using an \noutdated, ill-equipped, economically disastrous option under the Clean \nAir Act or, to pick another bad option, cap and trade.\n  What they are saying is we are either going to find this endangerment \nfinding, which will allow us to go ahead under the Clean Air Act \nprovisions of 1970, or we are going to then start something that would \nbe almost the same thing as cap and trade, except it will be done \nthrough the Executive and it will be done through the Clean Air Act \namendments so we will have no control of it, in terms of doing it \nthrough legislation. As you know, there are several cap-and-trade \nschemes that are up there.\n  Last Friday, a week ago today, the Wall Street Journal, in an \neditorial, commented on this false choice. I agree with them. I will be \nquoting now from the Wall Street Journal, a week ago today. They said:\n\n       Still, why confine the rule only to cars and trucks? By the \n     EPA's own logic, it shouldn't matter where carbon emissions \n     come from. Carbon from a car's tailpipe is the same as carbon \n     from a coal-fired power plant. And transportation is \n     responsible for only 28 percent of U.S. emissions, versus 34 \n     percent for electricity generation. Ms. Jackson is clearly \n     trying to limit the immediate economic impact of her ruling, \n     so as not to ignite too great a business or consumer \n     backlash.\n       But her half-measure is also too clever by half. By finding \n     carbon a public danger, she is inviting lawsuits from \n     environmental lobbies demanding that EPA regulate all carbon \n     sources. Massachusetts and two other states have already sued \n     in federal court to force the EPA to create a NAAQS for \n     CO2.\n\n  We have gone through a NAAQS process with particulate matter and we \nknow how that works.\n  For further background on this matter, let me explain. The history \nbehind the EPA's endangerment finding dates back to 1999, when the \nInternational Center for Technology Assessment, joined by Greenpeace, \nthe Green Party of Rhode Island, Earth Day Network, and 15 other \norganizations--far leftwing organizations, I might add--filed a \npetition with EPA, demanding it regulate greenhouse gas emissions from \nnew motor vehicles. These groups urged the EPA Administrator to reduce \nthe effects of global warming by regulating the emissions on greenhouse \ngases for ``new motor vehicles.''\n\n  In the landmark Supreme Court case of Massachusetts v. EPA, they \nsuccessfully argued that auto emissions were causing global warming, \nwhich in turn was eroding the coastline of Massachusetts. The remedy, \nthey said, was to control greenhouse gas emissions from cars. All this \nbegs the obvious question: What effect would EPA regulation of tailpipe \nemissions actually have on global temperatures?\n  In recent testimony before the House Ways and Means Committee on the \nclimate impacts of regulating carbon emissions, Dr. John Christy of the \nUniversity of Alabama--that is at Huntsville--found that such \nregulations would be ``an undoubtedly expensive proposition'' and would \nhave ``virtually no climate impact.'' Christy calculated this using the \nIPCC climate models. Let's keep in mind that is the United Nations \nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that has been very biased in \nthis whole thing and actually started the whole issue, the concept that \nanthropogenic gases--CO2, methane--are causing climate \nchange or causing global warming.\n  Christy calculated, using the IPCC climate models, that even if the \nentire country adopts these rules, the necessary impact would be at \nmost one-hundredth of 1 degree by the year 2100.\n  Further, he said:\n\n       Even if the entire world did the same, the effect would be \n     less than 4/100 of a degree by 2100, an amount so tiny we \n     can't even measure it. . . .\n\n  This is what Dr. John Christy has said. It is almost exactly the same \nthing as back during the Clinton administration, when we had Al Gore as \nVice President. He called upon someone to put together--at that time we \nwere coming this close to ratifying the Kyoto convention. He said: We \nwant you to do a study and say if we were to ratify the Kyoto \nconvention and all other countries that are developed nations would do \nthe same thing, how much would it reduce the temperature in 50 years.\n  They did the study and found out it was 7/100 degrees Celsius. They \ntried to hide that thing, but we did find it. That is exactly the same \nthing Dr. Christy said here, what he discovered and testified to last \nweek.\n  Once the EPA makes a finding that greenhouse gases endanger public \nhealth and welfare under the Clean Air Act, who specifically would be \naffected? As EPA's Advance Notice for Proposed Rulemaking makes clear--\nthat is taking place right now--it makes it clear that an endangerment \nfinding would lead to regulations covering nearly every facet of the \nAmerican economy.\n  In reading through comments filed in the regulatory docket, one is \nstruck by how broadly the Clean Air Act would apply once an \nendangerment finding is made--especially previous sources that have \nnever come under control of the Act. EPA received thousands of public \ncomments from various industries and groups that expressed concern and \noutright opposition--on issues of cost, competitiveness, jobs, and \nadministrative complexity--to greenhouse gas regulation under the CAA.\n  The following excerpts, taken from comments filed by the ANPR--the \nAmerican Association of Housing Services for the Aging--speak for \nthemselves.\n\n       The members of AAHSA . . . help millions of individuals and \n     their families every day through mission-driven, not-for-\n     profit organizations dedicated to providing the services that \n     people need, when they need them, in the place they call \n     home. Our 5,700 member organizations, many of which have \n     served their communities for generations, offer the continuum \n     of aging services: adult day services, home health, community \n     services, senior housing, assisted living residences, \n     continuing care retirement communities and nursing homes.\n       AAHSA opposes regulation of greenhouse gases under the \n     Clean Air Act. The Clean Air Act is not suited to regulate \n     greenhouse gases, as the EPA administrator and several other \n     federal agencies have opined. In addition, if the EPA \n     regulates greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act, many \n     AAHSA members could be subject to costly and burdensome Clean \n     Air Act programs. For example, health care facilities with \n     51,000 square feet or greater would be subject to the \n     Prevention of Significant Deterioration (PSD) permitting \n     requirements. This would require such facilities to get a PSD \n     permit prior to new construction or modifications . . . \n     Finally, there is also the possibility that health care \n     facilities would need to obtain Title V operating permits \n     from the EPA one year from when greenhouse gases become \n     regulated, which would add to the already stressed budgets of \n     nonprofit health care facilities.\n\n  Here is another one--Family Dairies USA. This is testimony just a \nweek ago.\n\n       Family Dairies USA is a dairy cooperative with 3600 members \n     located in a six state area in the Upper Midwest of the \n     United States.\n       Our members are involved in production agriculture, meaning \n     that a majority of them produce the corn that feeds the cows \n     that produce the milk which feed the Nation. We are opposed \n     to current regulations relating to greenhouse gases under the \n     Clean Air Act as it relates to production agriculture.\n\n  Now, this would be of interest to any of the Members who are from \nagricultural States such as my State of Oklahoma. I am quoting now from \nthis organization:\n\n\n[[Page S5001]]\n\n\n       Title V requires that any entity emitting more than 100 \n     tons per year of regulated pollutant must obtain a permit in \n     order to continue to operate. EPA has no choice but to \n     require those permits once an endangerment finding is made.\n\n  In other words, they have to do this. This is not something that is \nan option.\n\n       USDA, [the U.S. Department of Agriculture,] has stated that \n     an operation with more than 25 dairy cows emits more than 100 \n     tons of carbon and would have to obtain permits under Title V \n     in order to continue to operate if greenhouse gasses are \n     regulated.\n       Title V is administered by the States, and permit fees \n     (tax) vary from state to state. EPA sets a ``presumptive \n     minimum rate'' for permits, and that rate is $43.75 per ton \n     for 2008-2009. For states charging $43.75 per ton, the cow \n     fee (tax) for dairy would be $175 a cow.\n       The cow tax would impose a significant added cost for our \n     dairy farmers that cannot easily be absorbed . . . Imposition \n     of the tax will cause many operators to go out of business \n     and would likely raise prices.\n\n  Obviously, it would. That is quoting from Family Dairies USA.\n  Mark Magney, president of Magney Construction:\n\n       We are a mid-sized construction firm--\n\n  This is testimony from last week--\n\n     we employ 30 full time staff and have been in business since \n     1994. We primarily engage in the construction of water and \n     wastewater treatment facilities throughout the upper Midwest. \n     We believe the Clean Air Act is ill-suited for regulating \n     greenhouse gas emissions, and that the EPA should not move \n     forward with the proposed rule or other regulation of \n     greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act. Doing so \n     could easily delay, if not halt, all future building and \n     highway construction.\n\n  New construction and renovation are vital to our economy and to the \nfuture improvement of our environmental performance of our Nation's \ninfrastructure and must be allowed to continue.\n  This is serious because right now we are looking at reauthorizing the \nTransportation bill. The last time we did it was 2005. That was a \n$287.4 billion bill for a 5-year reauthorization. Now we are up for \nreauthorization in 2009, and we are right now trying to figure out what \nto do about America's infrastructure. What we do not need is to have \nthis additional regulation increase the cost of construction of the \nroads and the bridges that are so desperately needed.\n  According to Peter Glaser, a national legal expert on the Clean Air \nAct, an endangerment finding will lead to new EPA regulations covering \nvirtually everything, including ``office buildings, apartment \nbuildings, warehouse and storage buildings, educational buildings, \nhealth care buildings such as hospitals, and assisted living \nfacilities, hotels, restaurants, religious worship buildings, public \nassembly buildings, supermarkets, retail malls, agricultural \nfacilities, and many others.''\n  An array of new development projects could be delayed, perhaps for \nseveral years, causing ``an economic train wreck.'' This conclusion was \nsupported recently by the Heritage Foundation's Center for Data \nAnalysis, which found that EPA's new carbon regulations would destroy \nover 800,000 jobs and result in a cumulative GDP loss of some $7 \ntrillion by 2029.\n  The administration and other groups have recently argued that these \nare only scare tactics and that no one is asking EPA to do this. They \nargue, in fact, that EPA has already figured out ways it can avoid \nsweeping in small sources of CO2. That is what they always \nsay. ``Well, this is just the big guys, not the little guys.'' I think \nwe all know better.\n  However, when Republicans on the EPW Committee asked the \nadministration's nominee who is set to head the office where the \nendangerment finding and regulations following it will be proposed, how \nthey plan to manage this, we have not gotten a straight answer yet. I \nknow this because I am the ranking member on the EPW Committee, and we \nare going through the nomination and the confirmation process.\n  I have been very cooperative. I certainly supported Lisa Jackson and \nothers, even though I do not agree with them philosophically. But we \nare not getting straight answers because no one wants to get out on \nthat limb. They do not want to admit we are going to regulate \neverything if this comes along.\n  Our reason to question is not based on scare tactics. Staff uncovered \nsome comments in the proposed record that argued quite differently. The \nConservation Law Foundation, in their comments on EPA's Advanced Notice \nof Proposed Rulemaking--that is what we are in the middle of now, on \ngreenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act--did ask EPA to \nregulate such sources. Moreover, both groups asserted that EPA is \nrequired by law--it is not optional but required by law--to apply the \nPSD program to sources emitting above 100 to 250 tons per year. No \nexceptions to that. Pretty scary.\n  The Center for Biological Diversity argued:\n\n       While it is uncontroversial that EPA should prioritize the \n     largest pollution sources first, one of the reasons that the \n     NSR program will be such an effective tool for reducing \n     greenhouse gas emissions is that it applies to a wide variety \n     of sources that will emit in excess of the applicable \n     statutory threshold of 250 or 100 tons per year.\n\n  So they are admitting this is the case. They argued:\n\n       As a threshold matter, the asserted belief of EPA officials \n     that the statutory requirements are burdensome or not \n     ``efficient'' as they should be simply does not excuse the \n     agency from following the law. The EPA has no authority to \n     weaken the requirements of the statute simply because its \n     political appointees do not like the law's requirements.\n\n  But can't EPA just invent new thresholds?\n\n       Several of the suggestions that EPA has advanced are \n     outside the scope of its authority. The EPA has no authority \n     to set higher greenhouse gas major source cutoffs and \n     significance levels.\n\n  That is something that is pretty scary. I think what we need to \nunderstand is that we are looking at the United States of America. I \nhave been on this floor now for 9 years, starting way back when we were \nconsidering ratification of the Kyoto Treaty. And I have to say, at \nthat time I was the chairman of the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee. Republicans were a majority and I was chairman. I assumed \nthat manmade gases, anthropogenic gases, CO2, methane, were \ncausing global warming because that is what everybody said, until the \nWharton School of Economics came out with the Wharton Econometric \nSurvey.\n  In this survey they found--they answered the question: What would it \ncost if we in the United States signed the Kyoto Treaty and lived by \nits emissions requirements?\n  The range was between $300 and $330 billion a year. After all of \nthese things our new President has been doing with the big spending and \na $3.5 trillion budget and tripling the public debt in the next 10 \nyears, we do not think about $300 billion being that much, but it \nreally is. We are talking about $3,000 a family in my State of \nOklahoma. Actually, it exceeds that.\n  So I thought at that time, if there is some doubt as to the science, \nwe better find out about it because if we are going to sign that \ntreaty, that is what it is going to cost people in America. We started \nchecking. We found a lot. The whole thing started with the IPCC from \nthe United Nations. They would love nothing more than to have some big \nglobal tax and not have to be accountable to individual countries. \nMaybe that was not their motive, I don't know.\n  I do know this: We started looking at the science only to find out \nmany of the people who were the leaders in other countries--names come \nto my mind such as David Bellamy from the UK. He was with Al Gore 10 \nyears ago marching up and down the streets saying: Global warming is \ngoing to kill everybody. Now he is one of the premiere scientists in \nthe UK. He is now actually on my side in terms of being skeptical as to \nthe science.\n\n  The same thing is true with Nir Shaviv in Israel, with Claude Allegre \nin France, a very well known socialist, one with whom I do not agree on \nanything except his new position which has now refuted this idea that \ngreenhouse gases are caused--that global warming is caused by manmade \ngases. So with all of those changes, I suggest any of my colleagues \nhere who would like to see documentation, I have my Web site \ninhofe.senate.gov. On this Web site we cite all of the over 700 \nscientists who were on the other side of this issue and have now joined \nthe skeptics list.\n  The reason they are trying to regulate greenhouse gases under the \nClean Air Act is because they know they cannot get it passed in this \nChamber. In the House it probably would get passed.\n\n[[Page S5002]]\n\nThe House has never had occasion to debate this issue. They have not \nhad it. We have had it four times. We had it in the Kyoto Treaty, we \nhad it in the McCain-Lieberman bill, the Warner-Lieberman bill, and we \nhad it in the Sanders-Boxer bill.\n  If we stop and look at the trend, more and more of my colleagues are \nrealizing now that the science is not there, but the economics is \nthere. If we look at what happened back in 2005, 2005 I chaired the \ncommittee, so it was my responsibility to defeat it. That was the \nMcCain-Lieberman bill. We had, at that time--it was going to be about a \n$340 billion tax increase for the American people, and we debated it \nfor 5 days, 10 hours a day. I stood right here at this desk for 50 \nhours, and we could only get two or three Senators to come down and \nparticipate and help me on my side. But we defeated it because people \ndid not want to have to go home and explain to people that on dubious \nscience they are passing this huge tax increase.\n  Then we fast-forward to 2008. In 2008, it was totally different \nbecause that was the Warner-Lieberman bill that was even a more \naggressive bill in terms of its emission requirements. MIT had a value \nof that somewhere around $366 billion a year. So that would be another \nhuge tax increase.\n  What happened in that 3-year period? In 2008, it did not take 5 days \nto defeat it, it happened in 2 days. There were 23 Senators who came \ndown and helped me on the Senate floor. Why are so many people \nconcerned about this, so many Senators and House Members, about getting \ninto this issue? They will vote right, but they do not want to talk \nabout it because they have huge amounts of money--moveon.org, George \nSoros, Michael Moore, they put in--what I call the Hollywood elitists, \nthey put in millions of dollars a year and consequently there are a lot \nof Members who are afraid of this issue.\n  But there are only 39 votes at most. They need 60 votes. It is not \ngoing to pass. Since this is not going to pass the Senate, they are \ngoing to try to do as much as they can under regulations and provisions \nof the Clean Air Act.\n\n\n                             Guantanamo Bay\n\n  Mr. President, just briefly I want to share my findings. I only wish \nevery Member of the Senate would take the time to go down to Guantanamo \nBay and spend some time down there because if they do they would come \nback asking the question: Why in the world would we close this prison?\n  Even media that has been very unfriendly--the liberal media would \nlike to close anything having to do with the military or having to do \nwith prisons--came back and said: Wait a minute, there is a premiere \nfacility down there. There has never been a documented case of any kind \nof waterboarding, any kind of torture. The conditions of the detainees \ndown there are such that everyone down there understands they are being \ntreated better than they should be treated.\n  Did you know we actually have one doctor or medical practitioner for \neach two detainees down there? Let's keep in mind who they are. These \nare detainees. They are not prisoners of war; they are terrorists. Many \nof them have killed a lot of Americans. They are down there right now.\n  Anticipating that there might be a problem keeping that facility \nopen, we are down now to 245 detainees in Gitmo, 245. Of the 245--I \nbelieve this is about a week old, but I think it is still accurate--\nthere are 170 of them who cannot be sent back to their countries \nbecause their countries would not repatriate them. They will not allow \nthem to come back.\n  Of the 170, some 110 are rough, tough guys. We are talking about \nKhalid Mohammad, who is the instigator of 9/11. We are talking about \nsome really bad guys. So the position that the Obama administration \nfirst took, and this came out during the inaugural address, and I \nagreed with him at that time, he said:\n\n       Well, we would like to close it, but we want to wait and \n     make sure we can take care of adjudicating and take care of \n     these detainees in some other facility.\n\n  That was pretty responsible. I disagreed that we should close it \nbecause it is one of the few good things we have. We don't get many \ngood deals in America. That has only cost us $4,000 a year since 1903. \nName another bargain like that.\n  Now the alternatives are this: If they close it and don't do anything \nto handle how they will adjudicate these cases, they could end up in \nour court system. I am not a lawyer. I am one of the few nonlawyers in \nthis Chamber. We know the rules of evidence are different in a tribunal \nthan in a court case. Very likely, it would be almost impossible to get \na conviction. Consequently, a lot of these guys could be turned loose.\n  Right now, half the States have passed something in their \nlegislatures--my State of Oklahoma has--saying we don't want any \nterrorists loose in the United States. They even proposed that there \nare 17 areas in America where we could detain these people. One of them \nhappens to be Fort Sill in Oklahoma. I went down to that facility. \nSergeant Major Carter, a young lady who is in charge, was saying: I \nspent 2 years in Gitmo. Why in the world would we close that down? We \ncan't handle that kind of thing. We don't have the same kind of \nfacilities here.\n  The arguments are not real in terms of any kind of abuse. They have \nbetter medical care than they have ever had before. By their own \nstatements, it is better food than they have ever had before. Besides, \nthere is no place else. If we look at what they are doing and the \nalternatives, we really don't have a choice. If only people in this \nChamber and likewise in the House would recognize that we are going to \nhave to come up with some kind of an alternative before we close it \ndown. We spent $12 million. It took 12 months to build. I can't \nremember the name, but it is a courthouse in Gitmo. That is where they \nhandle the tribunals. The rules of evidence are such that they can't do \nit in our court system. They have already shut that down, so they are \nnot trying these people now. They should be, but they are not. There is \nno place else. It is not just the 245 who are there, but, with the \nescalation of what we are doing in Afghanistan--I was there last week--\nI can assure my colleagues, there will be more detainees who will come \nin. We will have to figure out something to do with the rest of them. \nThere is no place else.\n  I only wish that anyone who is supporting the position of closing \nGitmo would answer two questions. First, why? What is the possible \nreason for closing it? No. 2, what are we going to do with the \ndetainees if we do?\n  I yield the floor and express my appreciation to the Senator from \nConnecticut for giving me the time this morning.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, the pending business before the Senate is S. \n896, the Helping Families Save Their Homes Act. I would like to take a \nfew minutes and review the provisions of this bill that Senator Shelby \nof Alabama and I have offered in the form of a substitute. It is \nsimilar to the original bill, but there are some changes. We have been \ntold there are somewhere in the neighborhood of a dozen amendments, \nmaybe a little less, that our colleagues have proposed. We are trying \nto work out a finite list of amendments, to consider them on Monday, \nwith the hope of getting to conclusion of this bill either by Monday or \nTuesday--Monday may be a little optimistic but by Tuesday to be able to \ncomplete work before moving on to other business.\n  This is a very important piece of legislation. Many of our residents \nand citizens are deeply concerned about the foreclosure problems. I \nhave repeated the numbers over and over. I suspect many people are \naware, but 10,000 people a day run the risk of losing their homes \nthrough default or the auction process. Those numbers have not been \nshrinking at all. In fact, there are estimates that the numbers may \nactually increase.\n  We have tried over the last 2 years any number of steps to reduce and \nmitigate the foreclosure problem, including inviting the major lending \ninstitutions to step up and voluntarily talk about mitigation. That \nprocess began as early as the late winter of 2007 and the spring of \n2007. Regretfully, those institutions did little or nothing to try to \nmitigate this problem.\n  In fact, the previous administration refused to accept the magnitude \nof the problem, despite overwhelming evidence, even in early 2007, that \nthe foreclosure issue was going to mushroom\n\n[[Page S5003]]\n\nfar beyond early predictions. Of course, that is exactly what has \nhappened.\n  Today, most analysts tell us that while there are a lot of elements \nthat contributed to the present condition the economy is in, no one \ndisagrees that a major source of economic hardship began with the \nresidential real estate market. This problem will not be solved until \nwe get to the bottom of it. While there are a lot of other issues to \ntalk about, and we are doing that, until this issue of keeping people \nin their homes at rates and mortgages they can afford is resolved, this \nproblem will persist.\n  The legislation Senator Shelby and I offer, along with the support of \ncommittee members--and I note the Presiding Officer is a very \ndistinguished member of the committee--is to try to offer some relief. \nI will explain briefly the provisions of the bill. I invite my \ncolleagues to review it and, hopefully, be supportive on Monday or \nTuesday when we try to reach final passage.\n  We expand the ability of the Federal Housing Administration and rural \nhousing to modify loans. Servicers of the Federal Housing \nAdministration and rural housing do not have the same ability to modify \nthese Federal Housing Administration or USDA loans as they do for non-\nGovernment loans they service. Our legislation authorizes the \nDepartment of Housing and Urban Development and the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture to give these servicers the opportunity and incentive to \nparticipate in the Obama Loan Modification Program or to otherwise \nmodify the loans in ways that are not presently available to distressed \nhomeowners, including reducing interest rates, reducing principal, or \nstretching out the terms of these Government-insured loans. This is a \nmajor provision of the bill. To be able to provide the FHA and USDA \nwith the authority to expand these opportunities can bring a tremendous \namount of relief to people under those programs.\n  Secondly, we expand the access to the HOPE for Homeowners Act. This \nwas legislation we adopted last summer. The legislation makes a number \nof changes to the HOPE for Homeowners Program to make it more user \nfriendly and effective, including the option to lower fees, \nstreamlining borrower certification requirements, giving the Secretary \nof Housing and Urban Development limited discretion to determine the \namount and the distribution of future appreciation. It bans \nmillionaires from the program and allows for incentive payments to \nservicers and originators who participate in the program.\n  The HOPE for Homeowners Act that passed overwhelmingly here, while \nthe intentions for the bill were high, the reality is, the bill didn't \neven come close to achieving the goals those of us who crafted it \nthought it would. We have listened to a lot of people over the last \nnumber of months as to what could be done to make the proposal more \neffective and efficient to reach more people. The proposals I have \nmentioned were the ideas we have accumulated that we believe, and \nothers believe, should make the program far more effective. It will not \nsolve all the foreclosure problems, but it will be a major step in the \nright direction.\n  Thirdly, the bill creates more enforcement tools for the Federal \nHousing Administration to eliminate bad lenders. The bill empowers the \nSecretary of HUD to expeditiously drop lenders that break Federal \nHousing Administration rules, including, one, by authorizing the \nDepartment of Housing to go after lenders that break the rules but then \nwithdraw from the program to avoid enforcement actions. We put a stop \nto that. We crack down on the misuse of FHA insurance issued on \nmortgages originated through unapproved third-party entities, and we \nauthorize HUD to impose penalties on entities that misuse the Federal \nHousing Administration Ginnie Mae designations, another important \nhousing program.\n\n  Fourth, this bill provides a safe harbor for servicers who modify a \nloan consistent with the Obama plan or refinance a borrower into a HOPE \nfor Homeowners loan. This is a somewhat controversial provision because \nwe end up having a contest between investors and bankers.\n  The problem is simply this: Even as more and more homeowners have \nfallen behind in their loans, the response of loan servicers has been \ninadequate to the issue. In part, their reason for not responding is \nbecause they fear they will be sued by investors or competing interests \nfor doing so. The House of Representatives passed a very broad safe \nharbor provision, very similar to the one our colleague from Florida, \nSenator Martinez, offered and passed by a voice vote in this body as \npart of the Senate-passed stimulus bill several months ago. The \nprovision was dropped in conference. The safe harbor provision in this \nbill is much more narrowly drawn than was the proposal by Senator \nMartinez. I thank him for it. He was very creative in offering the \nidea, but there were concerns raised that it was too broad, that we \nshould make it more narrow in its application. So as to not \ndisadvantage investors where they have a legitimate complaint and \nprovide a safe harbor for those who don't deserve it, the safe harbor \nwe crafted is much more narrowly drawn than the House provision or the \none that passed the Senate in order to ensure that only servicers that \nprovide modification consistent with the Obama plan get the benefit of \nthe safe harbor.\n  In addition, this bill ensures that the HOPE for Homeowners \nrefinances are covered as well. That will not satisfy all of the \ninvestor community, but it is far better than what was in the House \nbill or previously authored.\n  The fifth provision of this bill authorizes an additional $130 \nmillion for foreclosure prevention activities. We owe a special thanks \nto the majority leader, Senator Reid, for its inclusion. He has been \nconsistent over the months that I have been involved in these issues \nsince becoming chairman of the Banking Committee 2 years ago, along \nwith Senator Schumer and others, about providing additional resources \nfor counseling. This bill provides these additional moneys. We have \nfound in the past that where consumers are aware of what is available \nto them and they get advice as to how to proceed, we are able to reduce \nthe problems of people losing their homes. Once you are in the \nforeclosure legal web, it is very difficult to help people. Once you \nare in that court setting, it is hard. So the goal is to try to catch \nindividuals who qualify for some assistance, who would qualify for some \nrelief before they end up in the legal bureaucracy. That is why \ncounseling services have been so valuable over the last number of \nmonths, because they have been overwhelmed by the amount of work.\n  I know in my case, the head of my office in Connecticut, who has been \nwith me for many years, literally every morning he arrives at work, he \nhas e-mails--30, 40, 50 a day--from constituents seeking help because \nthey fear they are about to lose their homes. I know other \ncongressional offices as well as, of course, counselors are also being \ninundated with requests for help. Obviously, getting good counseling, \ngood solid advice, is important. Senator Reid has provided a very \nvaluable contribution to this legislation with this proposal.\n  The sixth provision of this bill extends the $250,000 deposit \ninsurance level for 4 years. Presently, that level would expire at the \nend of this year under an agreement reached earlier with the \nChairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. Most people \nare aware that normally deposits are insured up to $100,000 per \naccount. However, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act increased \ncoverage through the end of this year. This legislation extends the \nhigher deposit insurance limit for banks, thrifts, and credit unions to \nthe year 2013.\n  Deposit insurance has been a stabilizing force in our banking system \nsince its inception in 1933. It is worth noting that the Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation originated in the Depression years. There \nwere three things done at that time that had as much to do with the 60 \nyears of relative stability in our economy. One was the formation of \nthe Securities Exchange Commission, which played a very valuable role \nin beginning to govern those markets and to prohibit or limit some of \nthe wildcatting that went on that created in good part the Depression \nof the 1930s.\n  Secondly was Glass-Steagall, which has been controversial with the \nseparation of commerce and banking. We have begun to blur those lines. \nI was\n\n[[Page S5004]]\n\ninvolved in that effort back a number of years ago when we dealt with \nthe Community Reinvestment Act. Like everyone else in this Chamber, I \nsuspect if we were all asked if we could have anything back and redo, I \nwish that was one we could go back and revisit. Candidly, it seemed \nreasonable at the time, the firewalls. But, frankly, I think we could \nhave done a little more to protect and separate those activities.\n  Third, in addition to the SEC and Glass-Steagall was the FDIC, the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation--the run on banks. The very day \nFranklin Roosevelt took office in March of 1933--do not hold me to this \nnumber, but something like 5,000 banks declared a holiday, and there \nwas a substantial run. People were frightened they were going to lose \nthe savings they had accumulated, the deposits they had invested or put \nin these banks.\n  The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, providing that insurance \nto people that their accounts would be protected in an economic \ndifficulty, had as much to do, if anything, in providing the kind of \nstability we have seen over the years. But that level of $100,000 has \nbeen around for a while. I forget how long, but it goes back several \ndecades--well, 1980. My good friend and colleague in the Chamber, \nJonathan Miller, tells me it has probably been since the 1980s for the \n$100,000, maybe even earlier. So there has been a desire to move this \nlevel up with good cause, even in the absence of the predicaments we \nare in.\n  So for those reasons, we raised it. I, for one, would have preferred \nwe almost make it permanent--the $250,000--but others wanted to \nrestrain this by the amount of time, and I respect their judgment. So \nthere was a debate whether it should be 1 year or permanent. We settled \non 4 years. My sense is, we are not going to roll this back in 4 years; \nit is going to be at least $250,000.\n  So for those out there who are concerned about whether there is \nenough certainty in all of this, while I know they would have preferred \na permanent increase, when you are serving with 99 other colleagues \nhere and you are trying to get things done, you have to make some \ncompromises. So the chairman would have liked it permanent, some of my \ngood friends in this Chamber wanted far less than that, and we settled \non 4 years. That is the reason that timeframe has come up.\n  This is going to be tremendously important. The significant extension \nof the increase in deposit insurance will be especially helpful to \nsmaller financial institutions in our respective States that are \nworried there would be a run from these institutions, including \ncommunity banks that derive 85 to 90 percent of their funding from \ndeposits.\n  So to the community bankers across the country that rightly have been \ndisappointed that every time we talk about banks, we fail to \ndistinguish between the more conservative, responsible activities of \nour community bankers across the country and the activities of other \nfinancial institutions that have had far less than that level of \nresponsibility--so to our friends in the community banking system \nacross the United States: We heard you on this. Many of you would have \npreferred a permanent raising. I agree with you about that, but this is \nthe best I could do with this bill. It will not roll back, in my view. \nEventually, I think we will make this permanent. For the time being, it \nis 4 years.\n  By helping community banks protect and grow their deposit bases, this \nlegislation contributes to the effort to improve the availability of \ncapital for lending. That, of course, affects small businesses, \nmicrobusinesses, and our constituents across the country. So while this \nis seen as some security and stability, particularly in the community \nbanking system, this also is very important to small businesses and \ninvestors and depositors as well. That is why this legislation needs to \nbe seen in the full context of those who will benefit from it--not only \nthose facing foreclosure but obviously businesses that need borrowing, \nneed that capital to stay alive, let alone try to expand and grow \nduring these difficult times.\n  The eighth provision of this bill increases the permanent borrowing \nauthority for both the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the \nNational Credit Union Administration. The bill increases the permanent \nborrowing authority for the FDIC from $30 billion to $100 billion. It \nhas been since the 1990s--I think 1991, if I am not mistaken, was the \ntime we settled on the $30 billion. It has been since then that there \nhas been--actually long before this economic crisis--a desire to raise \nthat borrowing authority level. So in this bill, we raise the authority \nfrom $30 billion to $100 billion. In the credit unions, we raise it to \n$6 billion.\n  We establish temporary additional borrowing authority from the $100 \nbillion to $500 billion in the case of the FDIC and from $6 billion to \n$30 billion in the case of the National Credit Union Administration, to \nwhich the regulators may gain access only with--by the way, you only \nget beyond that $100 billion with the FDIC or beyond the $6 billion if \nyou are part of the National Credit Union Administration if you are \nable to get the following agreements: The regulators may gain access \nonly with a two-thirds vote by the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation or the National Credit Union Administration, a two-thirds \nvote by the Federal Reserve Board, and agreement by the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, in consultation with the President of the United States. \nAgain, you have to have a two-thirds vote by the Federal Reserve Board, \na two-thirds vote by the FDIC or National Credit Union Administration, \napproval by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation with the \nPresident of the United States. I hope my colleagues would feel those \nare enough safeguards that you would not find regulators being able to \nraise those amounts without going through some significant hoops, and \nthe circumstances would have to be such that these various offices \nwould agree.\n  FDIC--Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation--Chairman Sheila Bair has \nsaid that the temporary authority would allow the FDIC to reduce the \nspecial assessments on banks by as much as 50 percent, increasing \nlending by as much as $75 billion.\n  Again, going back to our banking community and their concerns about \nassessments, the fact that we are doing it, reducing those assessments \nby as much as 50 percent, is no small achievement. Again, it is real \nrelief. By doing so, there is the likelihood these institutions can \nprovide additional lending because those assessments will not be too \nhigh, which helps small businesses and borrowers across the country. \nAgain, it is not unlike raising insurance levels.\n  We think these provisions will also make a great contribution to \ngetting lending going again. The one thing we all hear from our \nconstituents over and over again is: We are having a hard time \naccessing capital. So we hope these provisions will provide some \nadditional relief in that area.\n  The ninth provision of this bill stretches out the payment of \nassessments to rebuild the bank, thrift, and credit union deposit \ninsurance funds to 8 years. This is a very important provision. Again, \nit goes and relates to the last two provisions I talked about because, \nagain, while we think we are providing some relief in terms of the \namount of assessments, over what period of time you have to pay them is \nalso a critical issue for these smaller lending institutions. By doing \nwhat I have just suggested--stretching it out to 8 years--community \nbanks and credit unions will be able to devote more of their resources \nto making loans in the communities they serve.\n  This provision is especially important for credit unions because of \nthe way their deposit insurance system is structured; otherwise, these \ninstitutions would have to rebuild their fund in 1 year, which could \nlead to a severe reduction in lending. So it is a major provision for \nboth community banks and credit unions but particularly in the case of \ncredit unions.\n  The 10th provision of the bill improves the FDIC's systemic risk \nspecial assessment authority. Again, it is related to the last three \nprovisions I have mentioned. The Government's recent use of its \nsystemic risk authority benefited large bank holding companies and \ntheir nonbank affiliates, shareholders, and creditors as well. Yet to \nrecover any losses from systemic risk, the FDIC may now only charge \nbanks and thrifts themselves. Obviously, this would unfairly burden \ncommunity and other traditional banks, particularly\n\n[[Page S5005]]\n\nthose with few or no nonbank activities.\n\n  What we have done in this bill would allow the FDIC, with the \nTreasury Secretary's concurrence, to directly assess bank holding \ncompanies if they stand to benefit from the Government's actions and \ncorrespondingly to reduce the cost to our community banks. Again, this \nis a major provision. It is a technical one, maybe, to many, but again, \nsince a lot of these institutions do not have any nonbanks--and \ntherefore run the risk in the absence of this provision--they could end \nup being assessed for those charges. This would allow the Secretary of \nthe Treasury and the regulators to seek those assessments for the \ninstitutions that ought to be assessed since they are the ones \nbenefiting from that program.\n  So these provisions, while they are technical in nature, I say to my \ncolleagues--and they are not the kinds of issues you can explain \nnecessarily in a quick sentence before a townhall meeting--let me tell \nyou, they are very important. Are they going to solve the economic \ncrisis? Absolutely not. Are they going to make a difference? \nAbsolutely. Absolutely. So while this bill does not get the same degree \nof notoriety that others have, it is a critical component to getting \nour economy moving again.\n  For those of you who have heard--as I have heard over and over--from \nour community bankers, our community small businesses: Where is the \nlending, we think this bill, while it is not going to cause a floodgate \nto open in terms of lending, it lifts a lot of those barriers and \nrestraints that people have otherwise felt when it comes to lending \npractices.\n  So do some of these community banks and thrifts and credit unions \nbenefit as a result of this? Yes, they do. But let me remind you, when \nthey do, the borrowers, the homeowners, the small businesses who are \ndesperate for that lending, that capital, or to mitigate foreclosure, \nare a direct beneficiary of this legislation. So this is a bill where \nliterally both the lending institutions and the borrowers are direct \nbeneficiaries, and one of the reasons I think it is so important we try \nto adopt this as quickly as we can.\n  My hope is that on Monday or Tuesday we will be able to handle a few \nof these amendments, some of which have nothing to do with this bill. \nWe have to deal with the TARP money and others things, and I appreciate \npeople's concerns about that issue. But let's not miss an opportunity \nnow to get this right.\n  If this bill becomes loaded down with a lot of other amendments--and \nI am always hesitant to speak for the majority leader, but in my \nconversations with him, he has indicated he is not going to spend \nforever on this. We will come back to it--recognizing that at some \npoint, whether it is later this summer or next fall or maybe next \nwinter, we could come back to this, I think that would be a tragedy \nbecause I think we can get this done. Senator Shelby and I have worked \nhard on a bipartisan basis to put this legislation together. We have a \nvery good Banking Committee that has worked on this legislation as \nwell. And I think we would miss an opportunity not to get this done.\n  So to my colleagues who would like to bring up a lot of other \nissues--and I do not question their motives or sincerity behind those \nideas that have little or nothing to do with this--I would urge \nrestraint or we may run the risk of losing an opportunity to get this \nbill done.\n  There are a lot of other matters before this body that the leader has \nto get up for consideration. He cares deeply about this issue, as I \nhave evidenced by the fact that he has contributed directly to this \nbill. But he also has other matters that deserve our attention. He has \nprovided me the opportunity, along with Senator Shelby, to get this \nbill done. Let's not miss this opportunity.\n  People talk about bipartisanship, working together. That is exactly \nwhat Senator Shelby and I have done with our respective staffs to \nproduce this product. It is not exactly everything Senator Shelby would \nagree on. It is not everything I would agree on. But together we feel \nthis is a product that deserves the support of our colleagues.\n  Let me, lastly, if I can, suggest to you that there are a number of \nvery diverse groups that support our efforts. The Center for \nResponsible Lending is a strong advocate of this bill. The Credit Union \nNational Association supports this bill. The Independent Community \nBankers Association strongly supports this bill. The National Consumer \nLaw Center supports this legislation. The American Bankers Association, \nthe National Association of Consumer Advocates supports this bill, the \nFinancial Services Roundtable, and the Housing Policy Council. To those \nwho think this is just another list of organizations, let my remind \nthose who are not familiar with these organizations, that is a very \ndiverse list. You do not normally find consumer groups and the American \nBankers Association, community bankers and the Center for Responsible \nLending all agreeing on a bill. Yet that is exactly what has occurred \nwith this legislation. So if you have any doubts about the importance \nof it, I would invite my colleagues to contact any of these \norganizations and ask them how significant this bill is.\n  Technical, it may be, in nature, and yet it is these technical \ncorrections and improvements which can make a difference in the lives \nof our fellow citizens who are anxious--to put it mildly--that we step \nup and get the job done, get our economy moving again, restore our \noptimism and confidence as a people, and provide the kinds of steps \nthat will move us in that direction.\n  Mr. President, lastly, I ask unanimous consent that letters of \nendorsement from various organizations I have just recited be printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                      Credit Union\n\n\n                                         National Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 30, 2009.\n       Members of the United States Senate: On behalf of the \n     Credit Union National Association (CUNA), I am writing in \n     support of the Dodd Substitute Amendment to S. 896. CUNA is \n     the largest credit union trade association, representing \n     nearly 90% of America's 8,000 state and federally chartered \n     credit unions and their 92 million members.\n       CUNA strongly supports the Dodd amendment, which includes a \n     number of provisions aimed at helping credit unions continue \n     to help their members weather the financial crisis and \n     maintain member confidence in credit unions. We appreciate \n     Chairman Dodd's willingness to work with us to address credit \n     unions' concerns. We encourage you to support the Dodd \n     amendment when it is considered later this week. Credit \n     unions consider this a critical vote.\n       The Dodd amendment would extend until the end of 2013 the \n     increase in deposit insurance coverage ($250,000) for the \n     National Credit Union Share Insurance Fund (NCUSIF) that \n     Congress enacted on a temporary basis as part of the \n     Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008. This provision \n     is an important step that will help maintain member \n     confidence in credit unions.\n       The Dodd amendment also includes a number of provisions \n     aimed at helping credit unions manage the impact of the \n     financial crisis on the credit union system. Even though \n     credit unions use strong underwriting standards to make loans \n     to their members and keep most of their mortgages in \n     portfolio, no financial institution is immune from the \n     current economic situation. Corporate credit unions, which \n     provide payment, settlement, investment and other services \n     for natural person credit unions, have been particularly hard \n     hit by the economic maelstrom.\n       On March 20, the National Credit Union Administration \n     (NCUA) placed two corporate credit unions--U.S. Central and \n     Western Corporate Federal Credit Union (Wescorp)--into \n     conservatorship. The losses at the two corporate credit \n     unions were created by declines in the value of mortgage-\n     backed securities in which they invested. Although these \n     securities were originally AAA-rated and appeared prudent \n     when the investments were made, market developments proved to \n     the contrary. Despite these investment losses, the payment \n     and settlement services provided by these corporate credit \n     unions continue to be offered on a very sound basis.\n       The credit union system itself is covering the losses on \n     these corporate credit union investments by way of a \n     significant NCUSIF insurance assessment on all federally \n     insured natural person credit unions. Under current law, \n     credit unions must replenish their NCUSIF deposits equal to \n     1% of their insured shares on an annual basis and are also \n     subject to premium charges when the fund drops below a 1.2% \n     equity ratio. While credit unions expect to pay for the \n     corporate credit union problem themselves, they would like to \n     spread the losses over time, as banks are permitted to do for \n     their insurance costs under current law.\n       The Dodd amendment would increase NCUA's borrowing \n     authority from Treasury from $100 million to $6 billion, with \n     the ability to borrow as much as $30 billion in exigent \n     circumstances through December 2010. The amendment also \n     establishes a Temporary Corporate Stabilization Fund that\n\n[[Page S5006]]\n\n     would also help NCUA to spread out credit unions' insurance \n     costs over seven years. Spreading these costs over multiple \n     years means that credit unions can use the funds, that \n     otherwise would have been used to pay the assessment \n     immediately, to make credit available to their members. CUNA \n     strongly supports both the additional borrowing authority for \n     NCUA as well as the establishment of the Temporary Corporate \n     Stabilization fund.\n       Time is of the essence. We appreciate the Senate's timely \n     consideration of the Dodd amendment and hope it will be \n     enacted expeditiously.\n       On behalf of America's credit unions, thank you very much \n     for your consideration. Please support the Dodd amendment.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Daniel A. Mica,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 30, 2009.\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd, Chairman,\n     Hon. Richard Shelby, Ranking Member,\n     Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby: We write to \n     express our support for two provisions of S. 896 that would \n     remove significant obstacles to economically rational loan \n     modifications. One would explicitly allow servicers to modify \n     loans where the modification results in a net benefit to the \n     investors as a whole. The other would make homeowners whose \n     loans are insured or guaranteed by FHA, VA or USDA eligible \n     for the same type of affordable loan modifications that other \n     borrowers may receive under the Administration's modification \n     program. The foreclosure problem is so severe that multiple \n     responses are needed, including these two. These amendments \n     are modest, tightly drawn provisions that provide the \n     incentives or authority needed to avoid preventable \n     foreclosures.\n       New projections of foreclosures on all types of mortgages \n     during the next five years estimate 13 million defaults. \n     Right now, more than one in ten homeowners is facing mortgage \n     trouble. Nearly one in five homes is underwater. With the \n     housing sector responsible for one in eight U.S. jobs, the \n     flood of new foreclosures will contribute to the growing \n     unemployment rates, further constrict consumer spending, and \n     severely reduce tax revenues at all levels of government.\n       Servicer safe harbor. Currently, foreclosures continue to \n     outpace the rate at which servicers are modifying loans, and \n     affordable modifications are particularly scarce for loans \n     that have been securitized. Servicers cite as one of the main \n     reasons for the lack of affordable modifications their \n     concern about being sued by investors if they modify too \n     aggressively--both because of restrictions in their contracts \n     with investors and because many modifications may advantage \n     one tranche of investors over another, even when benefiting \n     investors as a group. A ``safe harbor'' is needed to allow \n     servicers attempting to do the right thing the cover to make \n     economically rational modifications that benefit the \n     investors as a whole.\n       The servicer safe harbor provision in S. 896 is narrowly \n     drawn, addressing modifications alone, and not origination \n     issues, fraud or any other issue. It provides a safe harbor \n     only for modifications that are affordable in accordance with \n     Treasury guidelines, and only those where the net present \n     value of the modification exceeds recovery through \n     foreclosure, according to Treasury's prescribed calculations. \n     So its effect will be to prevent ``tranche warfare'' and \n     other obstacles from standing in the way of sound, \n     economically rational modifications.\n       Voluntary modifications on FHA/VA/USDA loans. A second \n     needed provision addresses modifications of FHA, VA and USDA \n     insured and guaranteed loans. While private label securities \n     are at the heart of the foreclosure crisis, 10 percent of \n     seriously delinquent loans are government loans. There are \n     currently two significant obstacles to modifying these loans \n     when homeowners can no longer afford monthly payments, often \n     due to lost income in today's struggling economy. First, \n     servicers bear all the cost of modifying these loans, which \n     serves as a disincentive to modification. Second, servicers \n     have no statutory authority to offer more aggressive \n     modifications in line with the Administration's HAMP program. \n     The relevant provisions would address both of these problems \n     by offering servicers incentives to modify government loans \n     and giving them the authority to place borrowers in the same \n     types of affordable modifications available to homeowners \n     whose loans aren't insured or guaranteed by FHA, VA or USDA.\n           Sincerely,\n     Center for Responsible Lending,\n     National Association of Consumer Advocates,\n     National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low-income \n     clients).\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                        Federal Credit Unions,\n\n                               Arlington, Viginia, April 30, 2009.\n     Re Support Dodd-Shelby Substitute to S. 896.\n\n     Hon. Christopher Dodd,\n     Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Ranking Member Shelby: on behalf of \n     the National Association of Federal Credit Unions (NAFCU), \n     the only trade association exclusively representing the \n     interests of our nation's federal credit unions, I am writing \n     in support of your proposed substitute amendment to S. 896, \n     the ``Helping Families Save Their Homes Act of 2009.'' NAFCU \n     welcomes this important piece of legislation and would like \n     to offer a few comments regarding the bill.\n       NAFCU urges the adoption of the corporate credit union \n     stabilization fund proposal recently released by the National \n     Credit Union Administration and contained in the amendment. \n     We also applaud the adoption of a longer time frame regarding \n     the repayment of the National Credit Union Share Insurance \n     Fund (NCUSIF). By lengthening the repayment terms to 8 years, \n     Congress ensures credit unions will be able to focus more of \n     their resources to making loans that will strengthen the \n     economy, rather than having to divert resources to rebuild \n     the NCUSIF. These changes will relieve pressure on natural-\n     person credit unions from pending NCUSIF premiums and allow \n     them to provide consumer and small business loans to help the \n     economy. We would also support extending the repayment period \n     for the corporate stabilization fund from the proposed seven \n     years to eight years.\n       While NAFCU is pleased to see an increase in emergency \n     borrowing authority for the NCUSIF to $30 billion, we would \n     urge the Senate to adopt a higher initial borrowing authority \n     of $10 billion. This change is long overdue, since the \n     current level of $100 million was established in 1971, and \n     has not been modified for the growth of credit unions and \n     their member deposits over time. While NCUA's initial request \n     for borrowing authority was only $6 billion, we believe more \n     prudent action would be to enact an amount of $10 billion, \n     since the $6 billion figure would only cover what is \n     currently known to be needed for the present corporate credit \n     union crisis, and does not cover additional amounts that may \n     arise. This new amount of $10 billion would not preclude the \n     NCUA from only borrowing $6 billion, but rather it would \n     allow them the flexibility to deal with the current \n     situation. The extended emergency borrowing authority of $30 \n     billion will help ensure the NCUA has the tools it needs \n     should a new crisis emerge in these difficult times and is an \n     important addition to the legislation.\n       Finally, as part of the Emergency Economic Stabilization \n     Act of 2008, Congress increased the coverage on FDIC and \n     NCUSIF insured accounts to $250,000 through December 31, \n     2009. This change serves to maintain public confidence in \n     insured depository institutions in the current economic \n     environment. The proposed amendment would extend the higher \n     insurance level for four more years to 2013. While this \n     extension would ease confusion many credit unions and their \n     members already have about the pending sunset on December \n     31st, we believe that this new level should be made \n     permanent.\n       NAFCU thanks you for your time and consideration regarding \n     these matters. Should you have any questions or require any \n     additional information please do not hesitate to contact me \n     or Brad Thaler, NAFCU's Director of Legislative Affairs, at \n     703-522-4770.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Fred R.

Chris Dodd,\n     Chairman, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Richard Shelby,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban \n         Affairs, Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Dodd and Senator Shelby: we are writing in \n     support of your legislation, S. 896, the ``Helping Americans \n     Save Their Homes'' Act. The Financial Services Roundtable and \n     its Housing Policy Council believe this legislation will help \n     at-risk homeowners stay in their homes and make government \n     and private sector foreclosure prevention efforts more \n     effective.\n       Mortgage servicers are working hard to assist troubled \n     homeowners and prevent foreclosures whenever possible. \n     Private sector efforts are providing 250,000 workouts for \n     troubled homeowners each month. However, difficult conditions \n     in the housing market and the overall economy are causing \n     hardship for more homeowners. Additional support for loan \n     modifications and other foreclosure prevention efforts are \n     needed and this legislation will provide it.\n       The Helping Americans Save their Homes Act will provide \n     additional tools to help at-risk homeowners. Two of the most \n     important provisions in the bill are:\n       Expanding Access to the HOPE for Homeowners (H4H) Program. \n     This legislation makes a number of needed changes to the Hope \n     for Homeowners Program to make it more accessible and \n     attractive for homeowners and lenders to utilize.\n       Providing a safe harbor for servicers that modify a loan \n     consistent with the President's Making Home Affordable plan \n     or refinance a borrower into a HOPE for Homeowners (H4H loan. \n     This legislation will provide additional protection to \n     mortgage servicers who provide loan modifications to\n\n[[Page S5007]]\n\n     borrowers consistent with the standards in the President's \n     Making Home Affordable loan modification program. This \n     protection, consistent with the goal of protecting investors' \n     interests will promote more streamlined loan modification \n     efforts.\n       We also support the legislation's efforts to increase FHA's \n     ability to eliminate bad lenders from the program. In \n     addition, we support the authorization of additional funding \n     for foreclosure prevention counseling and for advertising to \n     educate borrowers and prevent mortgage scams. Counseling for \n     homeowners and combating scams are critical part of the \n     industry's HOPE NOW Alliance foreclosure prevention efforts \n     and the provisions of this bill will provide more support to \n     non-profit counselors to enable them to assist homeowners and \n     to educate homeowners to help them resist mortgage rescue \n     scams.\n       The Financial Services Roundtable and Housing Policy \n     Council strongly support this important legislation and we \n     urge the Senate to approve it. Thank you for considering our \n     views.\n           With best wishes,\n                                                   John H.

It improves the Hope for Homeowners \n     Program to make it more accessible for lenders and better \n     able to help homeowners avoid foreclosures.\n       ABA urges the Senate to pass this important legislation \n     without extraneous amendments, and we look forward to working \n     with you to have it enacted into law as quickly as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Floyd E.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n             honoring foreign service officer brian adkins\n\n  Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, today is Foreign Affairs Day. Each year, as \npart of this special day, the American Foreign Service Association and \nthe Department of State honor Foreign Service personnel who have lost \ntheir lives while serving our Nation overseas in the line of duty or \nunder heroic or other inspirational circumstances. This year's Memorial \nPlaque Ceremony honors the life and service of Brian Adkins from \nWhitehall, OH, a Foreign Service officer who died on January 31, 2009, \nwhile serving in Ethiopia.\n  Brian, who would have turned 26 on February 2, 2009, joined the State \nDepartment in 2007 after receiving multiple degrees from George \nWashington University. Brian was quickly recognized for his \nintelligence and linguistic skill in seven languages, and the State \nDepartment assigned Brian as a consular officer to Addis Ababa, \nEthiopia, in the summer of 2008. Immersing himself in the language and \nculture of the region, Brian dedicated his time to building a greater \nunderstanding of American values in the region and to helping Americans \nabroad.\n  Outside of his service, Brian entertained his family, friends, and \ncoworkers as an accomplished violinist and cook. He was also a devoted \nCatholic who spent much of his free time volunteering and giving his \ntime to those in need.\n  It is with great pride that we honor Brian Adkins and his family \ntoday. We have lost a talented and committed civil servant whose \nexceptional life serves to remind us of the importance and meaning of \npublic service.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. President, for the first time in a long time, there is clear and \nwidespread consensus that to improve the health of Americans and the \nstrength of our Nation, we must act quickly and responsibly to reform a \nhealth care system that has failed far too many of our citizens.\n  The millions of uninsured, 45 million or so, and the tens of millions \nmore underinsured Americans and the thousands of businesses struggling \nto compete globally with rising health insurance costs expect us to \nfind a path forward.\n  With our Nation spending in excess of $2 trillion annually on health \ncare, with too much of our citizens only a hospital visit and a pink \nslip away from financial disaster, we cannot afford to squander this \nopportunity. We cannot settle for simply marginal improvements. \nInstead, we must fight in this Chamber for substantial reforms that \nwill significantly improve our health care system.\n  That is why this week 15 of my colleagues and I sent a letter to \nChairman Kennedy of the HELP Committee and Chairman Baucus, the \nchairman of the Finance Committee, making the case for giving Americans \na health insurance option not controlled by the health insurance \nindustry.\n  We must preserve access to employer-sponsored coverage for those who \nwant to keep their current plan, but that is clearly not enough. Again, \nwe want to preserve access for those Americans who have their own \nemployer-sponsored plan, if they decide to stay in that plan, giving \nAmericans a choice to go outside that with a private or public health \ninsurance plan and a good policy and good choices.\n  At a time when too many Americans are struggling to pay health care \ncosts, a public plan option--it is only an option--will make health \ninsurance more affordable.\n  The report released this week by Consumers Union found that 30 \npercent of the underinsured have out-of-pocket costs of $3,000 or more \nfor a single year.\n  A Health Affairs study similarly found that one-quarter of \nunderinsured people have deductibles of $1,000 or more. It is estimated \nthat half of all personal bankruptcies are caused, at least in part, by \nunpaid medical bills or illnesses.\n  A public plan option would limit out-of-pocket costs such as high \ndeductibles and large copayments and would not abandon people. At a \ntime when too many of our rural citizens are struggling to find \nquality, affordable health insurance, a public plan option will ensure \naccess in rural and underserved areas. Too often rural communities are \nlargely ignored by the private insurance market that targets the much \nmore profitable large metropolitan areas with more consumers.\n  Private plans too often neglect sparsely populated rural areas. \nInstead, a public plan would be consistently available in all markets, \nensuring that rural areas and our rural people are not left stranded. \nAt a time when too many Americans are losing their jobs--and therefore \nlosing their employer-sponsored health insurance--a public plan option \nwill ensure portability and ensure continuity of coverage.\n  A public plan would ensure that those facing employment changes: Loss \nof job, downsizing, plant closing, moving out of the country, whatever, \nthat those facing unemployment changes, those people would have a \nchoice to have quality, affordable coverage backed by the strength and \nthe reliability of the Federal Government.\n  A public plan, therefore, would not disappear when an American loses \ntheir job or when a marriage ends or when a dependent becomes an adult. \nAt a time when too many Americans simply do not have stable, reliable, \nadequate, affordable health insurance, a public plan option is vital to \nensuring the consumers have another choice.\n  Americans should have the choice of a public health insurance plan \nwhich would work to close the gaps in our\n\n[[Page S5008]]\n\npatchwork health coverage system. There are many ways to design a \npublic plan option for uninsured Americans and for underinsured \nAmericans. I stand ready to work with Chairman Baucus and Chairman \nKennedy. I stand ready to work with Senate and House colleagues on how \nbest to design this public plan option as part of our overall health \nreforms.\n  Health reform must include checks and balances, including private \ninsurance and a public insurance option for the Americans we serve.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to speak about the Casey-Leahy-\nSpecter-Gillibrand amendment to S. 896, the Helping Families Save Their \nHomes Act.\n  Last year, Congress included $4 billion in the Housing and Economic \nRecovery Act of 2008 for the redevelopment of abandoned and foreclosed \nhomes and residential properties, which was a crucial step toward \nhelping neighborhoods and communities recover from the devastating \nforeclosure crisis. In the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, \nCongress again recognized the value of the neighborhood stabilization \nprogram and the grants that go with it, known by the shorthand NSP \ngrants, by providing another $2 billion, this time in a competitive \ngrant program. When a program has that much support and is so widely \nrecognized as doing good, we want to make sure we give the \nbeneficiaries of the program as much flexibility in using resources to \nhelp our constituents as we can. That is what this amendment is about, \nto provide that kind of flexibility.\n  The amendment allows grantees to use up to 10 percent of neighborhood \nstabilization program funds for foreclosure prevention activities. That \nis, of course, defined by the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment. Predatory lending and the subprime mortgage crisis created \na wave of foreclosures that has swept the country since 2006. Many \ncommunities, however, fear a second wave that will result from the \nsevere loss of jobs in the economic downturn and the loss of value in \nhomes. Borrowers unable to make monthly payments due to unemployment \nwill not be able to refinance their homes because they have plummeted \nin value as a result of the housing market meltdown. My amendment would \noffer more flexibility to grantees to use these funds for this purpose.\n  I urge my colleagues, as we consider housing legislation this week \nand next, to be mindful that the foreclosure crisis is not over. \nForeclosure filings nationwide ballooned in March 2009, up 45 percent \nfrom a year ago, and in Pennsylvania we have had a total of 4,943 \nforeclosure filings in just the 1 month of March. The Durbin amendment \nthat was voted on yesterday, which was unfortunately defeated, would \nhave saved 1.7 million homes from foreclosure.\n  If we will not give borrowers the tools they need to save their \nhomes, at least we can continue to provide resources to State and local \ngovernments, community organizations, housing counselors, and the \nthousands of attorneys who volunteer their time and expertise to \nhelping homeowners and families in need.\n  I will continue to fight for funding for housing counseling and legal \nservices to help families. I am grateful to Senators Dodd and Shelby \nfor the underlying legislation which I believe is a step in the right \ndirection.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Senator Harkin in pertaining to the introduction of \nS. 953 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Roxana Saberi\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I have come to speak about the subject of \nenergy, but before I do that, I wish to speak about the issue of Roxana \nSaberi and the fact that she sits this morning in a 10-foot by 10-foot \ncell in Evin Prison just outside of Tehran, Iran.\n  Let me describe, as I have previously done so, this young woman. This \nis a picture of Roxana Saberi. She was born and raised and educated in \nFargo, North Dakota. Her father came to this country from the country \nof Iran about 35 years ago. As a result, Roxana, born and raised in \nthis country, is an American citizen. However, her father was an \nIranian citizen and has Iranian citizenship. Thus, this young woman is \nconsidered an Iranian citizen as well.\n  Let me tell you a bit about her. She was an all-star scholar, an all-\nstar athlete. She graduated from high school in Fargo, North Dakota. \nShe got a bachelor's degree. She competed in the Miss North Dakota \nPageant and was Miss North Dakota. She competed in the Miss America \nPageant and was one of the 10 finalists in the pageant. She went to \nNorthwestern University and got a master's degree at Northwestern \nUniversity. She then went to Cambridge, England, and in Cambridge \nreceived a master's degree in international studies. She worked for a \ntelevision station in North Dakota in the middle of all of that. Later, \nshe went to Iran because she was very interested in her heritage. While \nin Iran, she reported for National Public Radio and BBC in England. She \nreported for those entities and many others.\n  At the end of January of this year, she was arrested by the Iranian \nauthorities and put in prison. She was arrested, presumably for \npurchasing a bottle of wine. They threw her in prison. She was there \nincommunicado, unable to communicate with anyone for a good long while. \nShe was later told her arrest was not for purchasing a bottle of wine \nbut, rather, for reporting without a license--being a reporter and \nreporting without a license.\n  She was finally allowed about a 1-minute telephone call to her \nparents in the United States. Then she was allowed to see an attorney. \nThen they held a very brief, closed-door trial in Tehran, Iran and \nfound her guilty, sentencing her to eight years in prison for \nespionage.\n  The Iranian Government went from purchasing a bottle of wine which \njustified her arrest and detention in prison, to reporting without a \nlicense, to espionage, and to an 8-year prison sentence. Today, Roxana \nSaberi sits in a 10-foot by 10-foot cell with two other women in that \nprison.\n  I visited this week with the Swiss Ambassador to Iran, who came to \nthis country and stopped in to see me. The reason I mention the Swiss \nAmbassador is because we do not have an embassy in Iran nor do we have \nan ambassador there. We do not have diplomatic relations with this \ncountry, so the Swiss Embassy is our protectorate. So we have an \nintercessor. They have been working with us to talk with the Iranian \nofficials.\n  This is an unbelievable miscarriage of justice and needs to be \nrectified. The fact is, the Iranian officials should understand that \nthey have detained this young journalist and thrown her in prison. They \nhave charged her with espionage and sentenced her to eight years in \nprison, thus the spotlight of the world is on them. Their credibility \nis at stake.\n  I hope the Iranian officials will do the right thing: release her \nfrom prison and allow her to leave the country of Iran. It is past \ntime, long past the time for them to make the right judgment. They have \nmade a number of wrong judgments in recent weeks and months. This young \nwoman has been in prison since the end of January. It is a complete \nmiscarriage of justice. For them\n\n[[Page S5009]]\n\nto charge her with being a spy and find her guilty of espionage is \nalmost unbelievable. They know better than that. I call on the Iranian \nGovernment to release her from prison and allow her to leave the \ncountry of Iran.\n  Most governments in the world have now communicated with the country \nof Iran about this case. I hope we will not have to be talking about \nthis case much longer. I hope the Iranian authorities and its \nGovernment will do the right thing.\n  Roxana Saberi should not be in prison. She is a very accomplished \nyoung woman who was in the country of Iran because she treasured her \nheritage. Because she was in Iran, she was apparently arrested on what \nI believe are trumped-up charges and has been sentenced in a way that \ncompletely defies any reasonable sense of justice.\n  Again, my hope is Iranian officials will begin to do the right thing \nand do it very soon. I call on them to release this young woman from \nprison and allow her to leave the country of Iran.\n\n\n                             Energy Policy\n\n  Mr. President, I wish to talk about energy policy. There are so many \ndifferent issues we confront in this country, and we have been \nleapfrogging from one issue to another. We have a very serious \nfinancial crisis and financial collapse in this country. We have seen, \nmonth after month after month, 600,000, 650,000 people losing their \njobs, in an economy that has substantially collapsed, and we are hoping \nnow is at bottom. We are hoping we will begin to rebuild once again. \nBut when we talk about 3.7 million people having lost their jobs just \nsince this recession began. This is a very serious situation.\n  So the financial crisis that is one issue. On top of that, day after \nday we hear of other significant challenges--a crisis now that might \nturn out to be a pandemic dealing with swine flu, and requiring the \nU.S. Government to move very quickly to address that. I just described \none issue in Iran. The reality is that we have a country that wishes to \nbuild a nuclear weapon and imprisons innocent young women. Further, \nthere are concerns about North Korea and their actions in recent weeks. \nWe have no end to challenges. We are trying to figure out what and \nwhere we go with respect to Afghanistan and Pakistan. What do we do \nabout Iraq? How do we address the issue of terrorism? There is no end \nto the issues we face.\n  I have been in both Afghanistan and in Iraq and that region dealing \nwith, not only the internal issues of both countries which are very \ndifficult, but the issue of terrorism in the region is something very \nimportant to us.\n  My point is that we are working on many issues and all of them \ncritically important. But let me describe one issue that, if something \ncatastrophic happened some night about midnight, would put this country \nflat on its back. That concern is energy and our unbelievable \ndependence on foreign energy.\n  Let me put a chart up that shows oil consumption. This is a chart \nshowing the top oil consumers in the world. At the top of the chart is \nthe United States. The next largest is China and so forth. We put \nlittle straws in this planet and suck oil out. We suck 85 million \nbarrels of oil every day out of the Earth--85 million barrels a day! \nOne-fourth of it is needed for the United States. Think of that: One-\nfourth of everything that is taken out of this planet in the form of \noil is needed in this country. We have an unbelievable appetite for oil \nto turn into energy.\n  Another statistic: Of the 21 million barrels a day that we use in the \nUnited States, nearly 70 percent comes from outside our country. We are \n70 percent dependent on oil supplies from outside of our country. \nAnother statistic: Nearly 70 percent of all the oil that we use is used \nin the transportation sector. We get behind a steering wheel, put the \nkey in the ignition, get the seat real comfortable, put whatever we are \ngoing to put in the cup holder, and away we go using oil. As I said, 70 \npercent of that which we use is used in transportation, and nearly 70 \npercent of that which we use comes from outside our country.\n  Think through for a moment: If somehow terrorists interrupted the \nsupply of oil to this country or were able to destroy one of the major \nsupply lines or one of the major facilities in Saudi Arabia or \nelsewhere, then we would be in very significant difficulty. This \ndemonstrates how we are unbelievably dependent on oil.\n  I think we are going to continue to use oil, natural gas and fossil \nfuels in our future for a long time. We are going to need to use them \ndifferently by decarbonizing them and have less CO2 emitted, \nbut the fact is we are going to continue to use fossil energy. Much \nmore importantly, how do we, even as we continue to use that oil, make \nthe U.S. less dependent on that oil which others produce? Well, the way \nwe do that, it seems to me, is to define a different kind of energy \nfuture. To decide that, we are going to produce renewable energy and \nthat we are going to do so by maximizing the production of renewable \nenergy domestically. If we are producing a lot of energy from the wind \nand a lot of energy from the sun, or biomass or other alternatives, it \nmeans we need to import less oil. That is a fact.\n  We are going to have a lot of debates, and it wasn't too many months \nago on the floor of the Senate that we had folks coming with big signs \nthat said: Drill, baby, drill. Drill, baby, drill. The whole notion was \nyou have to drill more. Well, you know what, I am for drilling more. It \nmakes sense to me.\n  By the way, if you are going to drill more, the place you would go, \nit seems to me, is in the eastern Gulf of Mexico--where you have \nsubstantial opportunities to achieve more production. The only area \nthat has been newly opened in the Gulf of Mexico in recent years is \nsomething called lease 181, which four of us, myself, Senator Bingaman, \nthen-Senator Talent, and Senator Domenici introduced legislation to \nopen. It got narrowed some, but we got it done, and that became law. \nThey had a lease sale, and we now have the opportunity to get some \nenergy from lease 181, which is a reasonably small area in the eastern \ngulf.\n  My point is: We should drill more. Let us drill where it makes sense \nand add to our stock. But the fact is, that in itself will not solve \nour problems. Senator Voinovich and I introduced legislation in recent \nweeks called the National Energy Security Act of 2009. It is bipartisan \nand addresses a wide range of issues of things we have to do to address \nthis energy issue. Right now, in the authorization committee of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, we are beginning to write a new \nenergy bill as well, and I am pushing very hard to include those kinds \nof provisions in a new energy bill that will, I hope, come to the floor \nof the Senate reasonably soon.\n  Here are the kinds of things this represents--the achievements I \nthink we have to strive for in a new energy bill. It is what we have \nincluded in the National Energy Security Act. Number 1, reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil; Number 2, increase domestic production--and \nthat is not just oil but production of all sources of energy--Number 3, \nelectrify and diversify our vehicle fleet because as I indicated, 70 \npercent of our energy is used in transportation; and by doing this we \ncan move toward an electric drive future with respect to vehicles, and \nthen even beyond that, hydrogen fuel cells with respect to the long-\nterm future--Number 4, create a transmission superhighway; and, Number \n5, train the energy workforce of tomorrow.\n  The transmission superhighway is a critical part of this because we \ndon't have a transmission superhighway similar to the interstate \nhighway system in this country. We have a transmission system that is \nkind of like an old inner tube with patches on it. Much of it is old, \nwith some new, but it does not have a transmission capability that \nconnects all of America. What we need to do is maximize the potential \nof renewable energy.\n  How do we do that? Well, the wind blows especially hard from Texas to \nNorth Dakota. What you need to do is to capture that wind energy and \nmove it to where it is needed. For example in North Dakota, while it \ncan produce a lot of wind energy--the Department of Energy calls it the \nSaudi Arabia of wind--North Dakota doesn't need the additional wind \nenergy. But if it can produce it, it must move it to where it is \nneeded. From Texas to California, in the heartland of our country, \nwhere you can produce a lot of energy from the wind, you need to have a \nmodern grid that connects it to areas of the country that can use, and \nmust have, the product of that wind energy.\n\n[[Page S5010]]\n\n  I mean, this is simple. You take energy from the wind and, through a \nturbine, turn it into electricity. You can do a lot of things with it, \nbut most notably you would put it on a grid and move it to where it is \nneeded. Or you can, through electrolysis, separate hydrogen from water \nand store a hydrogen fuel from it.\n  This is an example of an interstate transmission system. We have all \nseen these. Actually, there are new technologies now that would allow \nit to be put underground and perhaps would be much more efficient and \nmuch less costly. But anyway, if you don't modernize the transmission \ngrid and create a superhighway of transmission capability connecting \nall of America, you cannot possibly maximize wind energy or solar \nenergy or biomass or others. You can't possibly do it. If we can get a \nbill to the floor of the Senate that is tepid or halting with respect \nto how we want to do this, or even whether we want to do it, we can \ntalk until we are blue in the face. But we will not have done this \ncountry any favors in maximizing the production of renewable energy.\n  I mentioned a transmission system. The transmission system is \nnecessary for wind and solar energy, and so on. Most of us now \nunderstand what this wind energy means. I know it was a fanciful idea \nnot too many years ago to talk about getting energy from the wind, but \nwith the new technology with respect to the turbines, you can put a big \nold tower up and some very large blades and you can grab energy from \nthe wind and produce electricity. Once you put that tower up, you can \nmake a few adjustments here or there, but for the next 30 years, you \nare going to be getting wind energy for virtually nothing. I understand \nwe have to talk about maintenance, but understand that wind is free.\n  By the way, free energy comes from sun as well. As we know, the wind \ncomes from different warming trends of the Earth, the sun shines all \nthe time and has an unbelievable amount of energy that it focuses on \nthe Earth, both in solar energy and wind energy. We need to harvest it \nand we need to take advantage of it with solar cells and a whole range \nof different approaches using solar and wind energy.\n  The only way it will work, however, is if we have, as I said, an \ninterstate transmissions system. This system has three components to it \nthat make it controversial: Who is going to plant it? Who is going to \nsite it? And who is going to pay for it? Now, let me give a statistic. \nIn the last 9 years, we have produced 11,000 miles of natural gas \npipeline in this country, moving natural gas all around the country. \nDuring those 9 years, we have been able to build only 640 miles of high \nvoltage transmission lines. Let me say that again. We have built 11,000 \nmiles of natural gas pipeline, and during the same period we could only \nbuild 640 miles of high voltage transmission lines.\n  Why is that? It is because it is hard to build transmission lines. \nNobody wants them to cross their interstate transmission lines. Talking \nabout interstate now. They have proven very difficult to build because \nyou have several different jurisdictions that have to give approval and \na good many of them simply say, ``Not in my back yard. Take a hike.'' \nWe have to address those issues. Is it controversial? Sure it is. But \nif we don't address it, I guarantee you this country can talk and talk \nand talk about moving toward more renewable energy, but we will never \nget there. We will not get there. Now, if we do that--move toward more \nrenewable energy and put it on transmission lines to move it where it \nis needed--it will allow us to move toward an electric drive future for \nour vehicles, which I think is very important.\n  I have often mentioned my first vehicle as a young kid was an \nantique--a 1924 Model T Ford. It is interesting--I will not tell the \nwhole story about my Model T Ford--but I restored it in 2 years as a \nyoung teenage kid. I loved to do that stuff. When I got it running \nagain, got it painted and all fixed up, it was a car that was \nserviceable, right? It was running. The Model T ran. The interesting \nthing about vehicles is that everything--everything--in a vehicle has \nchanged since they made a Model T--everything. It doesn't matter what \nyou talk about--tires, the radiator, the spark plugs, you name it--it \nhas all changed. There is now computer capability. But the one thing \nthat hasn't changed is the gas tank. The gas tank on that car that was \nbuilt nearly a century ago is the same as the gas tank on the current \nvehicle. You filled it the same way as you do now: You looked for a gas \npump, drove up there, stuck a hose in the tank and started pumping.\n  Nothing has changed about the way we fuel vehicles. But we have to \nchange that. If 70 percent of our oil is used in the vehicle fleet--in \ntransportation in this country--then we have to decide if we are going \nto be less dependent on Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Venezuela and Iraq \nand so on, and change the way we fuel vehicles.\n  Here is a picture of an electric drive vehicle. I don't quite know \nthe form, but we have electric drive vehicles on the road today. There \nis much more sophistication in the development of these vehicles. In my \nsubcommittee, I put in $2 billion in the economic recovery program for \ngrants for battery technology because we want to lead the world in \nbattery storage. That is part of the key to an electric drive future. \nWe want to lead the world in storage capacity.\n  Some of the electric vehicles, perhaps--whether you have plug-in \nvehicles, plug-in hybrids, there are all kinds of different \napproaches--will run on batteries, and when the battery runs a bit low, \nthere will be a tiny engine someplace that starts and provides some \nadditional charging for the battery. There are all kinds of different \napproaches, but the fact is we need to move in this direction, and I \nbelieve we will. But it will happen only if we decide as a country to \nembrace the policies that allow us to do it, and that is substantial \nadditional development of renewable energy--the capability of building \nan interstate transmission system and getting it done with high voltage \nwires. If we do all that, we can change our energy future. That is a \nfact.\n  I mentioned a few moments ago about drilling. The fact that I want to \nmaximize renewable energy doesn't mean I don't want to produce what we \nneed to produce, and that is additional oil and natural gas, and \ncontinue to use coal as we decarbonize the use of coal. But in the \nlegislation Senator Voinovich and I have introduced, we open the entire \neastern gulf for expansion of drilling. This is a very important area \nwhere there is substantial additional opportunity for drilling. It is \nnow closed, by the way. This little area, lease 181, is the area we \nopened, the four of us, by legislation in recent years. That is the \nonly area that has been opened. We need to do this, and we need to \ndemonstrate we are serious about energy and all forms of energy.\n  I have talked a lot about production and then moving it to where it \nis needed. Conservation is critically important, and in the legislation \nwe have introduced, we have substantial conservation capability as \nwell. But the fact is, when you save a barrel of oil, it is the same as \nproducing a barrel of oil. I believe we have great opportunity to \nconserve.\n  While I am speaking, there are a whole lot of folks who left their \nhomes to go to work today. They have all kinds of appliances plugged \nin. It is true at this point that the toaster is not pushed down, \ntoasting bread, you know. Many of the appliances are not actually \ntriggered, but they are still using some energy because they are \nplugged into the wall. At midnight and 2 o'clock and 4 o'clock in the \nmorning, almost every home is still heating water. You tell me the name \nof somebody who is going to shower at 3 a.m. The whole country is \nheating water at 2 a.m.--for what? The point is, we can do a lot more \nand do it a lot better through conservation. That deals with the issues \nof smart grid and smart metering and a whole range of issues of that \ntype.\n  If someone wonders whether all of this is important, I want to show \nyou this black spot on the map. This is a map of the United States of \nAmerica, and the lights show where electricity is used at night. You \ncan see the population centers. But over here, there is one big black \nhole. That is because it is August 14, 2003, and 50 million people lost \ntheir electricity. Do you see that? Ohio to New York, 50 million \nAmericans discovered the switch they used to flick up doesn't yield any \nenergy, the toaster they used to push down doesn't produce any energy; \nno energy at all,\n\n[[Page S5011]]\n\nand all of a sudden you have a huge dark spot for 50 million Americans. \nIf you wonder about the importance of this, I am talking about the \nreliability of a system for something we take advantage of every single \nday.\n  We are drafting a bill right now in the Energy Committee, and there \nis a great deal of disagreement about a renewable energy standard \nrequirement that at least 15 percent of electricity is produced from \nrenewables. That should not be controversial at all. In fact, I think a \ncouple dozen states have gone way beyond the Congress on this issue. \nThat should be a slam dunk, but it is not.\n  Building a transmission system--we are going to have a lot of \nopposition. But no country gets where it wants to go unless it sets a \ncourse. There is an old saying: If you don't care where you are, you \nare never lost. This country has to set a course and say: Here is where \nAmerica wants to head for a decade. If, at the end of that decade, we \nare not less dramatically dependent on foreign oil for this country's \nenergy needs, we are going to be held hostage for a lot of interests \naround this country. We need to do this, we need to do it right, and we \nneed to do it soon.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       As of late, the focus of our nation has been on the economy \n     and, more specifically, the price of oil and gasoline and the \n     effects it is having on normal Americans. Most media sources \n     are running stories on the terrible effects of $4-5 a gallon \n     of gas are having on the average American consumer and their \n     widespread financial hardships.\n       My sincere belief is that $4 or $5 a gallon gas while \n     putting a dent in the wallet is not causing widespread \n     financial hardship on the overwhelming majority of U.S. \n     citizens. The monthly increase for Joe Average is roughly in \n     the $25-100 range. This amount should be easily absorbed by \n     virtually everyone across the U.S. There are some people for \n     whom an increase this minor would cause them to fall into \n     bankruptcy, but they are the people who would most likely end \n     up in this same situation for one reason or another and who \n     have habits and a severe lack of financial and budgeting \n     skills that need changed more than just a little cheaper gas.\n       I have worked my entire professional life in the banking \n     industry and have had to foreclose on people who could not \n     afford to have increases in their needed expenses such as \n     utilities, transportation, healthcare or food during good \n     times, economically speaking. These are the same people who \n     could have absorbed these needed increases if they had merely \n     given up cable TV or their $150 per month cell phone. This is \n     the same issue we are facing today. Some sacrifices will need \n     to be made by Joe Average but Joe ought to be able to cut \n     back on non-necessities and absorb the extra costs. If Joe \n     Average refuses to make the changes to his daily habits, then \n     we should not bail him out of a situation that he put himself \n     in and refuses to change his ways in order to get out of.\n       The belief I have is that $4-5 gas will actually be a major \n     savior not only to the US but to the human race as a whole. \n     The high prices will force us to innovate and bring \n     technologies that have been available for years into the \n     mainstream, to decrease our overall use of non-renewable \n     energy and decrease our pollution levels. Even if one does \n     not buy into the notion of global warming, we all know that \n     breathing pollution is extremely harmful and expensive in \n     terms of healthcare costs. Many pollution problems can be \n     solved at the same time as our energy problems.\n       Significantly more money, in the multiple tens or hundreds \n     of billions of dollars, needs to be spent on emerging energy-\n     efficient technologies in order to secure a long term \n     solution to energy and pollution problems; not to put a \n     temporary band-aid on gas prices to win over a few votes. The \n     peoples of the world look to the US to be a leader and \n     innovator of new technologies and we have been sorely lacking \n     for many years.\n       Most European countries and Japan are vastly further ahead \n     both on efficiency and pollution control standards. We have \n     many bright scientists, engineers and entrepreneurs in this \n     country who have the ideas, goals and desires to accomplish \n     this task; what they lack is the financial access to get the \n     ideas into large-scale production. The U.S. vitally needs an \n     effort on the scale of the Manhattan Project or the Apollo \n     Program to get technology from its infancy and\n\n[[Page S5012]]\n\n     early adopter stages into a mature industry. These changes \n     will in no doubt be hard on the existing industries and \n     infrastructures as they make the changes needed to accomplish \n     this but the long term effects are going to be felt for many \n     generations to come and deserve to be done right. This is not \n     something that affects just the US, rich or poor or election \n     results; these changes need to be made for the entire human \n     race across the globe. The US has a chance to be the world \n     leader once again. If you wish to see some of these \n     technologies and how they can help people, pick up the July \n     2008 edition of Popular Science Magazine and see what is \n     already being done and what can be done to ensure an energy \n     independent, energy efficient and clean way of life.\n       In the short term, times will be tough for many Americans \n     and many people across the world as fuel, food and needed \n     goods prices increase. We are a tough people and we will make \n     the changes in our daily lives in the short term to get by, \n     most will have very little actual changes to our lifestyles. \n     What the American people and all people need is a change in \n     their way of life, change in transportation, our choice of \n     energy and our way of thinking. A great deal of the needed \n     technologies are already developed and merely need help \n     getting into the mainstream while others desperately need \n     funding and qualified help to transform ideas into products. \n     This is where the government needs to step in and be a leader \n     and savior by starting large scale programs tackling energy, \n     efficiency and pollution problems not pumping more oil or \n     subsidizing inefficient ethanol for a short term quick fix.\n       Please step forward not just as an Idahoan or an American \n     but as a leader of all people who honestly wants to promote \n     the greater good for all and get legislation moving to enact \n     large scale technological programs and set aside large scale \n     funding in the tens or hundreds of billions of dollars to \n     help lead the American people and the rest of the world into \n     a brighter new future.\n     Matt, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       It is my opinion that we as a nation need to take our \n     undying focus off of this petroleum problem and start \n     shopping around for a better, clearer, abundant and renewable \n     resource that can be used for fuel. It bothers me to see gas \n     going up so fast and always asking myself ``when will it \n     end?'' and know that so much of our tax money is [thrown] \n     away on programs very few of us proffer from. I am not saying \n     that all the nation's programs are pointless, but most can \n     use a good trim. So please explain to me why you would rather \n     fight Congress on the matter of lower fuel costs and not push \n     alternative fuels that so many of our own citizens can grow? \n     And what ever happened to hydrogen? Was that too obvious of a \n     choice that it got pushed aside? Or is it because it is so \n     abundant that no one could get rich off of it? It just makes \n     me sick to see where we are headed. So I will pretend that \n     you actually read this email and listened and you pretend to \n     be keeping our best interests in mind.\n       A worried citizen of the richest Nation on Earth,\n     Daniel.\n                                  ____\n\n       My son, with a family of seven, lives in Las Vegas and, \n     because of high gas prices, is now biking the eight miles to \n     work in over 100 degrees to save on gas. Their monthly fuel \n     budget has skyrocketed to $400 per month. My daughter works \n     30 miles away from her home for an auto dealership. They have \n     continually cut workers because people are not buying cars \n     due to the gas prices. They have recently cut a skeleton \n     staff down to four days a week to conserve on the gas \n     expended.\n       My husband and I are retired and are planning no new future \n     trips due to the expended fuel. I have never seen such an \n     economy. We are told that milk (a staple food) will soon be \n     $5 per gallon. How can growing families afford this? We will \n     soon be down to bread and water with the skyrocketing prices. \n     We are thoroughly fed up with both political parties for \n     allowing the nation to come to such a state. There is trouble \n     in every sector of the market but no one will do what is \n     right for the nation at large. All I can see is a downward \n     deep spiral of trouble ahead.\n       Thank you for listening.\n     Randa, Rigby.\n                                  ____\n\n       Here is what is going on here in Idaho and in other states \n     as well. A lot of Americans live in rural areas. We have to \n     get in our autos and drive rather it is to the work school \n     groceries. As for me, I live behind the Pocatello airport, \n     and drive 12 miles into the railroad depot to go to work. My \n     wife teaches school in American Falls, which is 28 miles from \n     home. Right now the summer school teachers are riding the \n     school bus from Bannock Peak truck stop into American Falls, \n     which really helps out. I live in eastern Power County, so \n     back and forth [with] school activities etc.\n       With high gas prices, I can only see it getting worse. It \n     is not like as in other countries [like] Europe, etc., where \n     I can step out my front door and get on the bus. [If I could] \n     ride my bike, I would; but we cannot so therefore I am \n     trapped into paying high gas prices. If gas was to go to $10 \n     a gallon, we would be down and out stuck! What is this \n     country going to do? We have got some real energy problems in \n     this country and it could take us down, recession or even \n     depression. Even the Union Pacific is affected by it; they \n     will not even let me out notch 5 on the throttle. Fuel, fuel, \n     fuel and the cost of fuel.\n     Merlin, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       Energy prices are certainly affecting many far and wide in \n     the U.S. Yet the writing is clearly on the wall and we, as a \n     country, must act quickly to adapt to a new energy world.\n       We can no longer afford ``business as usual'' policies that \n     heavily favor supply-side issues (extraction and generation). \n     We must look upon the tried and true principles of saving \n     (conservation) and diversification (alternative energies). \n     Both these strategies must be wholly embraced by elected \n     officials such as you if the country is to be lead out of a \n     worsening energy crisis and on to a path toward prosperity.\n       While generating more traditional fuels (oil) can help, it \n     is a short-term solution at best. Our 100+ year binge on \n     fossil fuel is now coming to a close. We must choose how this \n     transition will take place. It is clear that global demand is \n     outpacing global supplies, given the best scientific (not \n     political) assessments. While technology holds a great deal \n     of promise, it is clear that no such magic tech bullet yet \n     exists. We can no longer afford to stick our heads in the \n     sand.\n       We need to grab this energy lever with both hands--one for \n     conservation and one for clean alternative energy--and open \n     the door to a new, more competitive America. Anything short \n     of this exposed our country to great risk and makes a mockery \n     of our independence, our innovation, our global leadership \n     and our ability to recreate our future.\n       I hope you fully appreciate the decisions that face this \n     country and will choose to take leadership role in ushering \n     in a new day for America.

I have to use gas for my \n     welder when in the field and electricity will be a problem in \n     my small shop. I do not know if you are aware of the prices \n     of steel, but all across the board I pay more than double for \n     steel, welding rod and related items. Since my product is \n     made of steel, it's putting a huge bite in my ability to make \n     ends meet, let alone trying to get ahead. It is hitting me \n     hard enough to make me wonder how long before I have to fold.\n        It is nonsense that we have all the resources in this \n     great land to meet our needs without dependence on foreign \n     supplies of oil, but we are forbidden by agencies that are \n     run, it seems, by fanatics who have their own agenda and it \n     is not the welfare of the people who keep this country going. \n     Why are we not able to utilize our own oil fields and drill \n     for oil when we know where it is. I do not understand. It is \n     like watching a bunch of school kids fighting over who gets \n     to kick the ball first and for how many times when I see all \n     the nonsense going on in Washington.\n       Thanks for not being one of the spoiled brats in our \n     nation's capital.\n     Brian.\n                                  ____\n\n       Yes, gas prices have affected us dramatically. We are \n     farmers and thus live in a rural environment. With the rising \n     fuel prices, making a profit on our crops is extremely \n     difficult. As diesel rises, so do fertilizers and herbicides \n     and pesticides. They are three times more expensive than \n     three years ago. Freight for hauling crops is way up, and so \n     forth. Driving takes a huge bite out of our budget even \n     though we have cut back as much as we can. Remember when \n     America was first settled and they refused to buy from \n     England so that they would start to be productive and self-\n     reliant as a nation? Well, it worked did it not? We became \n     the richest and most prosperous Nation on earth. We do not \n     need other nations to survive. We can produce what we use \n     ourselves. We have got ourselves into this mess and we can \n     get out. Get Congress, the President and the Supreme Court to \n     stick with the specific responsibilities assigned to them by \n     the Constitution. Allow the free market to work as it should. \n     (Read Adam Smith's Wealth of Nations. The Founding Fathers \n     relied on this wisdom.) It would be sticky for a while but \n     Americans have always been tough. If we want America to \n     survive then we have to fix the problem. The Constitution has \n     the answers. America will crumble if we do not take serious \n     action. Thank you for your efforts!\n     MaryLynne.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am writing this in response to your letter on energy. I \n     live in a rural area, approximately 8 miles from the town of \n     Preston. Because of the distances involved in daily commuting \n     and other required driving, our fuel bill has more than \n     doubled in the last two years. Last month it was in excess of \n     $500.00. Gas has since risen more than .20 per gallon.\n       Income is not matching the rapid increase in cost of fuel \n     and this has greatly reduced the amount of discretionary \n     money that we have. Most of my neighbors have stated the \n     same. Those that have the least amount to spare are the ones \n     that are being hardest hit by the rising energy costs.\n       The federal government should allow and encourage all forms \n     of energy production: drilling for oil in the Gulf and \n     Alaska; relaxed regulations and tax breaks for new \n     refineries; streamlined permit process for new nuclear power \n     plants. The list is as endless as is the regulations that \n     have been imposed on the energy companies.\n       Thank you for your time.\n     Mike, Preston.\n                                  ____\n\n       I receive an email stating that you would like to have \n     Idahoans tell their stories about\n\n[[Page S5013]]\n\n     rising oil prices. I am a single mother of three, working \n     full-time as it is, but now thinking about taking on another \n     job because of the cost of gas. Our family has tried to plan \n     a week visit to the coast for the past few years, and the \n     cost of gas has controlled our plans! This is taking a toll \n     on my budget and our family, knowing that every month, there \n     is never any extra. The other option for me is to turn to a \n     welfare program. Which is more beneficial--more people on \n     welfare or using our oil reserves? What makes it most \n     frustrating is that the United States has the oil! Help us \n     out. I would like to travel somewhere with my children before \n     they are grown up and gone.\n     Sophia, Pocatello.\n                                  ____\n\n       With regards to your recent query about the effect of the \n     gas prices on our family: yes, the high prices have forced \n     changes on our family. We now combine trips to save fuel, and \n     I now commute to work by bicycle three times a week and am \n     losing weight doing it. We are putting much more pressure on \n     management to allow telecommuting.\n       Are these all bad things? Is this a drastic problem? No, \n     actually this is most probably a good thing. For the first \n     time in years we, as a nation, are using less gas. While it \n     will definitely have an impact on our lifestyle, the problem \n     can be mitigated by lifestyle changes (carpooling, mass \n     transit, cycling, downsizing to smaller vehicles). There are \n     many ways to do this and virtually every nation in the world \n     besides the U.S. has done it.\n       The real concern is two-fold, both of which can be \n     considered failures by our elected officials. First, the lack \n     of affordable mass transit. For years, our leaders have \n     refused to lead on this situation and instead buried their \n     heads in the sand, preferring to believe that gas will always \n     be at $1/gallon. Something like a 50c/gallon tax years ago \n     would have provided for an efficient infrastructure, reduced \n     the demand and possibly reduced the current price increases.\n       The second failure is the misguided use of ethanol in the \n     attempt to pretend that we are actually doing something to \n     reduce our emissions. This is in reality nothing more than a \n     subsidy to agri-business at the cost of increased food \n     prices. Corn ethanol is nothing but a smokescreen that is \n     contributing to increased food prices. If we are serious \n     about ethanol, then let us import sugar cane and make the \n     ethanol from the cane, or, even better, let us create ethanol \n     plants in the countries that grow the sugar cane. That way we \n     would be helping these countries, most of which are dirt \n     poor, provide employment and earn hard currency. In turn, we \n     would reduce our emissions without adding to the food price \n     increases.\n       Yes, I know that you wanted a lot of whine-a-grams so that \n     you could parade them in front of Congress and try and open \n     the Arctic Refuge to drilling to benefit the oil companies, \n     even though they are making obscene profits, but maybe we \n     should look at reality. Drilling offshore and in the Arctic \n     will not reduce prices. Oil companies have found that people \n     can afford $4/gallon gas and will manipulate the situation to \n     keep gas prices high. The only real solution is to reduce our \n     consumption. Let us provide business with incentives for \n     telecommuting and usage of green energy. Let us provide \n     communities with help and incentives for the creation of \n     bike-paths as well as options like light rail etc.\n       This way we can provide for the future, reduce emissions, \n     reduce demand for gas and in turn reduce oil and food prices. \n     But in order to do this we need to look beyond the old \n     mentality that got us here. Drill and consume, drill and \n     consume is no longer going to work. It will provide nothing \n     more than a short term minimal respite.\n       We look to you as one of our leaders to promote a long-term \n     viable solution. Thank you for your time in considering this.\n     Robert.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/01/senate-section/article/S5013-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5013]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                      TRIBUTE TO DR.

A bill to develop and promote a compressive plan for a \nnational strategy to address harmful algal blooms and hypoxia through \nbaseline research, forecasting and monitoring, and mitigation and \ncontrol while helping communities detect, control, and mitigate coastal \nand Great Lakes harmful algal blooms and hypoxia events; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Harmful Algal \nBlooms and Hypoxia Research and Control Amendments Act of 2009. This \nbill would enhance the research programs established in the Harmful \nAlgal Blooms and Hypoxia Research and Control Act of 1998 and \nreauthorized in 2004, which have greatly enhanced our ability to \npredict outbreaks of harmful algal blooms and the extent of hypoxic \nzones. But knowing when outbreaks will occur is only half the battle. \nBy funding additional research into mitigation and prevention of HABs \nand hypoxia, and by enabling communities to develop response strategies \nto more effectively reduce their effects on our coastal communities, \nthis legislation would take the next critical steps to reducing the \nsocial and economic impacts of these potentially disastrous outbreaks.\n  I am proud to continue my leadership on this important issue and I \nparticularly want to thank my counterpart on this key piece of \nlegislation, Senator Bill Nelson. My partnership with Senator Breaux on \nthe first two harmful algal bloom bills proved extremely fruitful, and \nI am pleased that Gulf of Mexico--whose coastal residents are severely \nimpacted by both harmful algal blooms, also known as HABs, and \nhypoxia--will continue to be so well represented as this program moves \ninto the future. I also want to thank the bill's additional co-\nsponsors, Senators Cantwell, Cardin, Vitter, Landrieu, Boxer and Levin \nfor their vital contributions. We all represent coastal States directly \naffected by harmful algal blooms and hypoxia, and we see first hand the \necological and economic damage caused by these events.\n  In New England blooms of Alexandrium algae, more commonly known as \n``red tide'' can cause shellfish to accumulate toxins that when \nconsumed by humans lead to paralytic shellfish poisoning, PSP, a \npotentially fatal neurological disorder. Therefore, when levels of \nAlexandrium reach dangerous levels, our fishery managers are\n\n[[Page S5015]]\n\nforced to close shellfish beds that provide hundreds of jobs and add \nmillions of dollars to our regional economy. Red tide outbreaks--which \noccur in various forms not just in the northeast, but along thousands \nof miles of U.S. coastline--have increased dramatically in the Gulf of \nMaine in the last 20 years, with major blooms occurring almost every \nyear.\n  In 2005, the most severe red tide since 1972 blanketed the New \nEngland coast from Martha's Vineyard to Downeast Maine, resulting in \nextensive commercial and recreational shellfish harvesting closures \nlasting several months at the peak of the seafood harvesting season. In \na peer-reviewed study, economists found that the 2005 event caused over \n$4.9 million in lost landings of shellfish in the State of Maine alone, \nand more than $20 million throughout New England.\n  Last year's outbreak of red tide tracked very closely the patter of \nthe 2005 event in both location and severity, but unlike in 2005 when \nnearly the entire coasts of Maine and Massachusetts were closed, \nresource managers had improved testing capabilities in place that \nallowed many localized areas to remain open. Such procedures were a \ndirect result of programs established by the Harmful Algal Blooms and \nHypoxia Research and Control Acts of 1998 and 2004.\n\n  Most recently, on April 22, 2009 researchers at Woods Hole \nOceanographic Institution and North Carolina State University announced \nthe potential for ``red tide'' in the Gulf of Maine this season is \nexpected to be ``moderately large'', based on a regional seafloor \nsurvey of Alexandrium abundance. This survey revealed that levels of \nAlexandrium are currently higher than those observed just prior to the \n2005 red tide. Just a few days ago, officials from the Maine Department \nof Resources Marine Biotoxin Monitoring Program closed a large parcel \nof the Maine coast to the harvest of mussels, oysters, and carnivorous \nsnails due to the presence of PSP. The current trend of increasing \nfrequency and intensity of red tide events in new England waters is \njust one example of the need to further enhance our ability to provide \ndetailed forecasting and testing measures. The quick response time \nthese capabilities enable will greatly reduce the economic impact such \noutbreaks impose on our coastal communities.\n  While we have made great strides in bloom prediction and monitoring, \nit is clear that these problems have not gone away, but rather \nincreased in magnitude. Harmful algal blooms remain prevalent \nnationwide, and areas of hypoxia, also known as ``dead zones'' are now \noccurring with increasing frequency. Within a dead zone, oxygen levels \nplummet to the point at which they can no longer sustain life, driving \nout animals that can move, and killing those that cannot. The most \ninfamous dead zone occurs annually in the Gulf of Mexico, off the \nshores of Louisiana. In 2008, researchers determined that this dead \nzone extended over 12,875 square miles, making it the second largest \nsince measurements began in 1985. Dead zones are also occurring with \nincreasing frequency in more areas than ever before, including off the \ncoasts of Oregon, the Chesapeake Bay and Texas.\n  The amendments contained in this legislation would enhance the \nNation's ability to predict, monitor, and ultimately control harmful \nalgal blooms and hypoxia. Understanding when these blooms will occur is \nvital, but the time has come to take this program to the next level--to \ndetermine not just when an outbreak will occur, but how to reduce its \nintensity or prevent its occurrence all together. This bill would build \non NOAA's successes in research and forecasting by creating a program \nto mitigate and control HAB outbreaks.\n  This bill also recognizes the need to enhance coordination among \nstate and local resource managers--those on the front lines who must \nmake the decisions to close beaches or shellfish beds. Their decisions \nare critical to protecting human health, but can also impose \nsignificant economic impacts. The bill would mandate creation of \nRegional Research and Action Plans that would identify baseline \nresearch, possible State and local government actions to prepare for \nand mitigate the impacts of HABs, and establish outreach strategies to \nensure the public is informed of the dangers these events can present. \nA regional focus on these issues will ensure a more effective and \nefficient response to future events. And finally, this bill would, for \nthe first time, create a pilot program to examine harmful algal blooms \nand hypoxia in fresh water systems.\n  If enacted, this critical reauthorization would greatly enhance our \nNation's ability to predict, monitor, mitigate, and control outbreaks \nof HABs and hypoxia. Over half the U.S. population resides in coastal \nregions, and we must do all in our power to safeguard their health and \nthe health of the marine environment. The existing Harmful Algal Bloom \nand Hypoxia Program has done a laudable job to date, and this \nauthorization will allow them to expand their scope and provide greater \nbenefits to the Nation as a whole. I thank Senator Bill Nelson, and all \nof my cosponsors again for their efforts in developing this vital \nlegislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unamimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 952\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise today to introduce \nlegislation that will address an ongoing problem that adversely affects \nlocal communities and coastal areas around my home State of Florida and \nacross coastal and Great Lakes States.\n  Today, Senator Snowe and I, along with Senators Boxer, Cantwell, \nCardin, Landrieu, Levin and Vitter. introduced a bill that would \nreauthorize and enhance the Harmful Algal Bloom and Hypoxia Research \nand Control Act, HABHRCA, which was enacted in 1998 and reauthorized 5 \nyears ago. This act enabled critical monitoring, forecasting, and \nresearch activities that have greatly improved our understanding and \nprediction of harmful algal blooms, nuisance blooms like red drift, and \nlow-oxygen or hypoxia events that plague our estuaries and coastal \nwaters.\n  We have made great strides through HABHRCA to address this problem, \nbut there is more yet to do. Reports of harmful algal blooms in U.S. \nwaters and around the world have drastically increased over the past 3 \ndecades.\n  Harmful algae can produce potent toxins causing illness and death in \nhumans, fish, seabirds, marine mammals like manatees and dolphins, and \nother oceanic life. Other harmful algae are non-toxic to humans, but \ncan still cause damage to ecosystems, corals, fisheries resources, and \nrecreational facilities. Harmful algae also have a significant economic \nimpact. A 2006 study conservatively estimated that coastal harmful \nalgal blooms cost more than $82 million per year on average in the \nU.S., with the majority of impacts in the public health and commercial \nfisheries sectors.\n  Virtually every coastal state in the country is affected by harmful \nalgal blooms. For instance, toxins from harmful algae found in razor \nclams along the Pacific Coast eventually shut down Washington's clam \nfishery in 2002. This event resulted in $10-12 million in lost revenue. \nIn 2005, a red tide event in New England caused closures of shellfish \nharvesting to prevent paralytic shellfish poisoning in humans. These \nclosures resulted in approximately $18 million in lost shellfish sales \nin Massachusetts and $4.9 million in Maine. In Hawaii, macroalgal \nblooms, which impact coral reefs and local aesthetics, result in more \nthan $20 million in lost revenue every year due to reductions in real \nestate value, lost hotel business, and increased clean-up costs.\n  A particularly devastating and intense red tide struck the Gulf Coast \nof my home State of Florida in the summer of 2005, causing widespread \nanimal deaths as well as public health and economic problems. The St. \nPetersburg/Clearwater Area Convention and Visitors Bureau estimated \nupwards of $240 million in losses for the Tampa region as a result of \nthis bloom.\n  Scientists have told us that red tides are a lot like hurricanes--\ncomplex but natural phenomena that can have profound impacts on our \nenvironment and society. Although we may not be able to stop this \nnatural process, we can do more to predict it and take actions to \nminimize its impacts on our citizens and natural resources.\n  In April 2008, researchers predicted a severe outbreak of New England \nRed Tide, Alexandrium fundyense, which produces potent neurotoxins that \nare filtered by shellfish. When humans consume contaminated shellfish \nthey become extremely ill and can die without immediate medical \ntreatment. This was the first time that researchers could issue a \nprediction of this kind several weeks in advance. The 2008 prediction \nwas derived from a model based on 10 years of ecosystem research in the \nGulf of Maine. The prediction was remarkably accurate, and it allowed \nState managers and the shellfish aquaculture industry to plan for a \ndifficult season. By showing the news media and the public that the \nevent was expected and that state managers were prepared, the \nprediction may have also reduced the ``halo'' effect in which shellfish \nharvesting closures in one area reduce shellfish and fish sales from \nareas unaffected by toxicity. This prediction was made possible from \nresearch funded under programs authorized by HABARCA.\n  It is clear that harmful algal blooms and hypoxia events can have \ndevastating impacts on water and air quality, aquatic species, \nwildlife, and beach conditions, which in turn affect public health, \ncommercial and recreational fishing, tourism, and related businesses in \nour coastal communities. The question becomes, what can we do to stop \nthis? If we can't stop these events, how can we better plan for them \nand take steps to minimize the impacts?\n  We have learned from scientists and researchers that some harmful \nalgal blooms and red drift events can be triggered by excess nutrients \nfrom upland areas that wash into rivers and are delivered to the coast. \nBecause this problem often crosses political and geographic boundaries, \nwe must pursue solutions that are regional in nature and bring together \nexpertise from all levels of government, from academia, and from other \noutside groups who have a stake in keeping our coastal waters healthy, \nclean, and productive.\n  Senator Snowe and I have worked together to craft a bill that will \nnot only continue critical research on harmful algal blooms and \nhypoxia, but will help address some of these pressing needs that exist \non every coast--from the Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico, to the Pacific \nand the Great Lakes. Our bill will\n\n[[Page S5019]]\n\nhelp to integrate and improve coordination among the government's \nprograms that study and monitor these events. The bill also would \nimprove how regional, state, and local needs are considered when \nprioritizing research grants and developing related products. Most \nimportantly, this bill would focus new resources on translating \nresearch results into tools and products that state and local \ngovernments can use to help prevent, respond to, and mitigate the \nimpacts of these events.\n  Although we have made significant progress in identifying some of the \ncauses and consequences of harmful algal blooms and hypoxia since 1998, \nmuch work remains to find solutions that minimize the occurrence of \nthese events and enable our coastal communities to become resilient to \nthe impacts. This legislation to amend and reauthorize the Harmful \nAlgal Blooms and Hypoxia Act represents an important step toward \nrealizing those goals.\n  In closing, I would like to recognize Senator Snowe for her \nleadership on this issue. As the sponsor of both the original \nlegislation in 1998 and the 2004 amendments, her expertise on harmful \nalgal blooms and the impacts of these events on her constituents has \nproved invaluable as we developed the measure before us today. I look \nforward to working with Senator Snowe, in her role as ranking member of \nthe Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries, and Coast Guard Subcommittee of the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, as well as with \nChairman Cantwell and the other members of the subcommittee, to debate \nthis important legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 953. A bill to provide for the establishment of programs and \nactivities to increase influenza vaccination rates through the \nprovision of free vaccines; to the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I am introducing the Seasonal Influenza \nand Pandemic Preparation Act of 2009. The bill was given the number S. \n953. This bill would establish a nationwide free, voluntary influenza \nvaccination program, under which any individual in this country may \nreceive an annual influenza vaccine shot free of charge.\n  I offered this bill 3 years ago because at that time we started the \nprocess of building up our vaccine capacity. I will have more to say \nabout that. What is happening currently with H1N1 being almost at a \npandemic stage now, it brings home again what we need to do in this \ncountry to be prepared, and that is what this bill is about. Offering \nfree flu shots to everyone in the United States is a good idea in and \nof itself.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says an average of \nmore than 40,000 Americans die each year from flu-related diseases and \ncauses. Think about that: 40,000 Americans die every year due to flu-\nrelated causes. Seasonal flu is responsible for more than 31 million \noutpatient visits and more than 3 million days annually in the \nhospital. Seasonal flu costs the U.S. economy nearly $90 billion \nannually, including $10 billion in direct medical costs--$10 billion a \nyear just in direct medical costs. Think about that: 40,000 people \ndying every year, $10 billion in direct medical costs, $90 billion \nannually in lost productivity to our economy, over 3 million days in \nthe hospital every year, and this is seasonal flu.\n  We can significantly reduce all those numbers. In addition, there is \nsome evidence that people who are vaccinated each year against seasonal \nflu viruses actually build up a limited degree of resistance to \npandemic viruses. So strictly as a matter of prudent prevention, it is \ndesirable to maximize the number of Americans who are vaccinated \nagainst flu each year. By offering the vaccinations for free and making \nthem conveniently available, we would remove major barriers to more \nwidespread participation.\n  There is precedence for this. Medicare, right now, will pay for one \nseasonal flu shot for everybody on Medicare every year. So we already \nhave that out there. We just need to get it to the rest of the \npopulation.\n  There are other compelling reasons for establishing a nationwide \nvoluntary free flu vaccination program. Let me explain.\n  As chairman of the appropriations subcommittee that funds health \nprograms, I have taken the lead in the past in providing funding to \nprepare for a future flu pandemic. Since 2006, my subcommittee has \nprovided more than $6 billion to these activities.\n  As a consequence, while public health authorities in the United \nStates may have been surprised by the H1N1 virus outbreak, they have \nnot been caught unprepared. To the contrary, since 2006 we have \nundertaken very robust measures to prepare for exactly this kind of \noutbreak and potential pandemic.\n  First, we have made major investments in antivirals that can be given \nto a person once exposed and shows signs of the illness. We have made \nmajor investments in medical equipment, which are right now, as we \nspeak, being distributed nationally to our local public health \nauthorities across the country. Many of them are now in place. Many \nstarted going out earlier this week. I daresay that probably most, if \nnot all, of them are probably out there right now--from the stockpiles \nthat we built up. There are over 50 million doses of Tamiflu and \nRelenza that we built up in our stockpile. Well, not all of that, but \nmost of it, has gone out around the country to be prepared.\n  Second, we have stepped up our public health and surveillance \nactivities, which helped us to detect the H1N1 virus earlier than we \notherwise might have.\n  Third, we have increased the capacity of the Centers for Disease \nControl and Prevention to identify viruses and respond aggressively and \nvery immediately, including producing what is called a ``seed'' virus, \nnecessary for the development of a vaccine. That is being done right \nnow.\n  Fourth, we have also made major investments in building up our \nvaccine production capacity in the United States. Mr. President, when \nwe started on this in 2005, there was at that time only one plant in \nthe entire United States of America that could produce flu vaccines--\none. I believe it is located in Pennsylvania, and that was making \nvaccines based upon an old methodology of using eggs. We had to use \nmillions of eggs every year to produce that vaccine, and that takes a \nlong time.\n  There have been, in the research and development, processes by which \nwe can make cell-based vaccines. We can shorten the timeframe. That is \nnice, but we don't have any cell-based plants in the United States. In \nthe fiscal 2006 bill, we put over $3 billion out there to build these \nplants. They are being built now. So we are building up our vaccine \nproduction capacity and doing it in a way in which we can get the \nvaccines produced more rapidly.\n  Fifth, we have funded research into adjuvants. These are agents that \nincrease the vaccine's effectiveness. Let me put it this way. If we \nhave one dose of a vaccine, we might actually be able to cut that dose \ndown and give that one dose to four or five people by adding the \nadjuvant to it.\n  Lastly, we have worked with State and local public health agencies to \nboost their capacity to respond to a flu pandemic. We have done that, \nbut because of the economic downturn many of our State budgets have \nbeen slashed. In our States around the country, we were told at our \nhearing the other day, over 60,000 people have been laid off from our \npublic health agencies. That makes it more difficult to get the \nantivirals out to people who may come down with H1N1 or any other kind \nof flu virus.\n  Because of all these things we did, I think I can safely say there is \nno reason for anyone anywhere in the United States to panic because of \nthe H1N1 flu virus. As I said, one of the most important things we have \ndone is to build up our vaccine manufacturing capacity.\n  Here is the problem. This really is the crux of this bill I have \nintroduced today. Say we build up the vaccine manufacturing capacity \nand we build these plants that can respond aggressively and immediately \nto a pandemic outbreak. What happens the rest of the time? What \nhappens? Do they sit there idle, not being utilized? We cannot have \nthat.\n  What we need to do is to use these plants, then, to make more of the \nseasonal flu vaccines every year. Well, if we have the plants out \nthere, and they make more of the seasonal flu viruses but not everybody \nis using them, what do we do, just throw it away? We want the plant \ncapacity to prepare for any\n\n[[Page S5020]]\n\npandemic in the future, but they need to be active and they need to \nproduce annually. If they are going to produce annually, then we have \nto find something to do with these vaccines.\n  By offering annual free vaccines to every single person in America, \nwe will keep our vaccine production capacity up and running. It will be \nready to shift at a moment's notice, when necessary, from producing \nseasonal flu vaccines to a mass production of vaccines to fight any \nfuture outbreak or pandemic.\n\n  There is another reason for this bill. If we are faced with a flu \nvirus pandemic, we are going to have to mobilize people. We are going \nto have to get the vaccines out in a hurry and get the vaccines right \ndown to the individual people all over this country--people in small \ntowns and communities, in rural areas, and in cities. Well, by having \nan annual free flu vaccination, we will give public health agencies \nacross America valuable experience in administering vaccines to masses \nof people, local agencies that will have a reason to develop trained \ncadres of people who are capable of administering vaccines.\n  We will also develop an established network of sites that might \ninclude grocery stores, shopping malls, schools, places of worship, and \nsenior centers where people can conveniently go to get vaccinated in \ncase of an outbreak. These annual activities will significantly \nincrease State and local public health readiness to fight a pandemic. \nNot all these people are going to be employed by the Government. These \nwill be volunteers, but they will be trained. They will know where to \ngo and how to administer a vaccine because they will be doing it on an \nannual basis, free of charge, to people. We will build up a network of \nsites and a cadre of people who can be relied upon in case we face a \npandemic.\n  On Tuesday, in response to the H1N1 outbreak, I chaired an emergency \nhearing on the Health Appropriations Subcommittee. We heard assessments \nof the outbreak from top medical experts, including Dr. Anthony Fauci, \nthe renowned and remarkable Director of the National Institute of \nAllergy and Infectious Diseases at NIH.\n  Years ago, when we first started this, back in 2005, Dr. Fauci warned \nus that it is not a matter of ``whether'' there will be a flu pandemic \nbut rather ``when'' it will happen. It is not a matter of whether but \nwhen.\n  When the Senate drafted its version of the American Recovery and \nReinvestment Act this year--the stimulus bill--I included an additional \n$870 million for pandemic preparedness. Most of that funding was to be \nused to complete the work of building up our vaccine production \ncapacity; in other words, to get these plants built more rapidly. \nUnfortunately, it was taken out in the final bill. Again, what we are \ntrying to do is shift from egg-based production to cell-based \nproduction, so we can get these vaccines developed more rapidly. Taking \nit out of the stimulus bill was the typical shortsighted resistance \nthat I have often encountered when I talk about this.\n  Some accused me a couple years ago of crying wolf. The wolf is here. \nOne day in the future we can encounter an even worse wolf, such as the \nflu pandemic of 1918, which was the Spanish flu. It infected one out of \nthree people worldwide and killed more than 50 million people. It would \nbe the height of folly not to do what we can to prepare for such a \npossibility. The harsh reality is that we have repeatedly experienced \nflu pandemics. I mentioned the one of 1918 and 1919.\n  There was the Asian flu pandemic of 1957 and 1958 that killed over \n1.5 million people.\n  The Hong Kong flu pandemic of 1968 and 1969 killed over 1 million \npeople. Not only did it kill over 1 million people, it caused hundreds \nof millions of illnesses and hospital stays all across the globe.\n  We cannot predict the future course or severity of the current H1N1 \noutbreak, but clearly it is one more wake-up call.\n  Again, I am reintroducing the Seasonal Influenza and Pandemic \nPreparation Act today as a stand-alone bill. I first introduced it in \n2005, as I said. It is now a stand-alone bill. We either pass it that \nway or, if not, I plan to incorporate it into the prevention and public \nhealth title of comprehensive health reform legislation that we will \nhopefully pass this year. A program offering annual free flu shots to \nevery American is exactly the kind of smart, cost-effective, \nprevention-focused public health that must be at the center of our \nreformed health care system in America. It will save lives and money. \nWhen--when not whether--a pandemic flu strikes the U.S. in the future, \nwe will be ready.\n  I encourage Senators to cosponsor the legislation. I think this is \none more wake-up call and we have to move ahead aggressively in \npreparing for these pandemics. As Dr. Fauci said, it is not a question \nof whether, it is only a question of when and how severe it will be. We \ndon't know.\n  I remind people that a few years ago when we started this, back in \n2005, we were confronting the possible pandemic of an avian flu or H5N1 \nflu, which started in Southeast Asia. Thanks to surveillance, to the \nCDC, and to a lot of people working on it, we were able to contain it. \nThat H5N1 avian flu is one of the most deadly we have confronted, with \nover a 50-percent mortality. One out of every two persons who \ncontracted it died. Now we have contained it and tamped it down. That \nH5N1 virus is still out there and, periodically, we pick it up in \nplaces such as Southeast Asia.\n  There was a thought that because of migratory birds, it may be spread \nto other places, but we don't know that.\n  But because it has reared its ugly head, because we know that virus \nis out here someplace, it behooves us to do everything we can to \nprotect the people of this country and in doing so to prepare. I hope \nit doesn't happen. I hope when there is a pandemic flu, it will be just \na mild one and will not kill people. But we don't know. The best way to \nprepare for it is to build up our vaccine-manufacturing capacity as \nrapidly as possible; secondly, make sure our public health agencies on \nthe State and local levels are ready to go, that they are trained, that \nthey are equipped; and thirdly, that we have some experience, that we \nknow how to do this.\n  One of the best ways is to give everyone a free flu shot every year--\neveryone, a voluntary free flu shot every year. To me, that will set us \nup well to prepare for and to protect the American people against any \nflu pandemic that may come our way in the future.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DURBIN (for himself, Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Casey, and Mr. \n        Feingold):\n  S. 957. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure that \nvictims of public health emergencies have meaningful and immediate \naccess to medically necessary health care services; to the Committee on \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DURBIN: Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of \nthe bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 957\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Public Health Emergency \n     Response Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Since 2000, the Secretary of Health and Human Services \n     has declared that a public health emergency existed \n     nationwide in response to the attacks of September 11th and \n     in response to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita.\n       (2) In the event of a public health emergency, compliance \n     with recommendations to seek immediate care may be critical \n     to containing the spread of an infectious disease outbreak or \n     responding to a bioterror attack.\n       (3) Nearly 16 percent of Americans lack health insurance \n     coverage.\n       (4) Fears of out-of-pocket expenses may cause individuals \n     to delay seeking medical attention during a public health \n     emergency.\n       (5) A public health emergency may disrupt health care \n     assistance programs for individuals with chronic conditions, \n     exacerbating the costs and risks to their health.\n       (6) The uninsured could place great financial strain on \n     health care providers during a public health emergency.\n       (7) The Department of Health and Human Services Pandemic \n     Influenza Plan projects that a pandemic influenza outbreak \n     could result in 45,000,000 additional outpatient visits, with \n     865,000 to 9,900,000 individuals requiring hospitalization, \n     depending upon the severity of the pandemic.\n\n[[Page S5021]]\n\n       (8) Hospitals in the United States could lose as much as \n     $3,900,000,000 in uncompensated care and cash flow losses in \n     the event of a severe pandemic.\n       (9) Under current statute, no dedicated mechanism exists to \n     reimburse providers for uncompensated care during a public \n     health emergency.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide temporary emergency health care coverage for \n     uninsured and certain otherwise qualified individuals in the \n     event of a public health emergency declared by the Secretary \n     of Health and Human Services;\n       (2) to ensure that health care providers remain fiscally \n     solvent and are not overburdened by the cost of uncompensated \n     care during a public health emergency;\n       (3) to eliminate a primary disincentive for uninsured and \n     certain otherwise qualified individuals to promptly seek \n     medical care during a public health emergency; and\n       (4) to minimize delays in the provision of emergency health \n     care coverage by clarifying eligibility requirements and the \n     scope of such coverage and identifying the funding mechanisms \n     for emergency health care services.\n\n     SEC. 3. EMERGENCY HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.\n\n       (a) In General.--Title III of the Public Health Service Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 241 et seq.) is amended by inserting after section \n     319K the following new section:\n\n     ``SEC. 319K-1.

A bill to amend the Social Security Act to guarantee \ncomprehensive health care coverage for all children born after 2009; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER, Mr. President, I rise today, with my colleagues, \nSenator Gillibrand and Senator Casey, to reintroduce an important piece \nof legislation--the MediKids Health Insurance Act of 2009. This \nlegislation will finish the job we started with CHIP reauthorization by \nproviding health care coverage for every child in the U.S. by 2015, \nregardless of family income.\n  Congressman Stark and I have introduced our MediKids legislation in \neach of the last five Congresses because we know how vital health \ninsurance is to a child. Year after year, study after study has shown \nthat uninsured children are more likely to have unmet health care \nneeds. Without adequate health care, childhood illnesses are more \nlikely to turn into chronic conditions in adulthood with debilitating \neffects. Even something as simple as an ear infection, if left \nuntreated, can cause hearing loss, which can hinder a child's speech \nand language development. Furthermore, children with unmet health care \nneeds often underperform in the classroom and miss more days of school. \nLess time in school means students can struggle to develop the skills \nnecessary to become productive members of society.\n  Despite the well-documented benefits of providing health insurance \ncoverage for children, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, there \nwere over 9 million uninsured children in America in 2007. A \nsignificant step forward in providing health insurance for our \nuninsured children was the reauthorization of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program, a bill I coauthored. Expansions in Medicaid and the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program have helped reduce the percentage \nof low-income children that are uninsured from 28\n\n[[Page S5023]]\n\npercent to 15 percent since 1997, with another significant reduction \nprobable after the 2009 CHIP reauthorization legislation is fully \nimplemented. As pleased as I was with the reauthorization of this vital \nprogram, it is estimated that millions of children will still remain \nuninsured. This is unacceptable. We must provide universal coverage for \nchildren.\n  Children are entirely reliant on others to care for them. They cannot \ngo out and purchase their own health insurance. Just as Congress \nprovides for the care of the other segment of our population that is \nheavily reliant on others, the elderly through Medicare, the time has \ncome to make certain that all children also have access to \ncomprehensive health care. Healthy, well educated children are the key \nto the future success of our country and we cannot allow them to \ncontinue to fall through the cracks. Now, more than ever, it is time to \nfinally pass the MediKids Health Insurance Act.\n  This legislation is a clear investment in our future--our children. \nEvery child would be automatically enrolled at birth into a new, \ncomprehensive, Federal safety net health insurance program beginning in \n2010 and would be eligible up to age 23. The benefits would be tailored \nto meet the needs of children and would be similar to those currently \navailable to children through the Medicaid Early and Periodic \nScreening, Diagnosis, and Treatment, EPSDT, program.\n  Families below 150 percent of poverty would pay no premiums or co-\npayments, while those between 150 and 300 percent of poverty would pay \ngraduated premiums up to 5 percent of income and a graduated refundable \ntax credit for cost-sharing. Families above 300 percent of poverty \nwould pay a small premium equivalent to one fourth of the average \nannual cost per child. There would be no cost sharing for preventive or \nwell-child visits for any child.\n  MediKids children would remain enrolled in the program throughout \nchildhood. When families move to another state, MediKids would be \navailable until parents enroll their children in a new insurance \nprogram. Between jobs or during family crises, MediKids would offer \nextra security and ensure continuous health coverage to our nation's \nchildren. During the critical period when a family climbs out of \npoverty and out of the eligibility range for means-tested assistance \nprograms, MediKids would fill in the gaps as parents move into jobs \nthat provide reliable health insurance coverage. Our program rests on \nthe premise that whenever other sources of health insurance fail, \nMediKids would stand ready to cover the health needs of our next \ngeneration. Ultimately, every child in America would grow up with \nconsistent, continuous health insurance coverage.\n  Congress cannot rest on the success we achieved by reauthorizing the \nChildren's Health Insurance Program. Although CHIP was a remarkable \nstep toward reducing the ranks of uninsured children, there is still \nmuch more work to be done. The MediKids Health Insurance Act is a \ncomprehensive approach toward eliminating the damaging lack of health \ninsurance for so many children in our country, and I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted. in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 958\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Report on long-term revenues.\n       (c) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) More than 9 million American children are uninsured.\n       (2) Children who are uninsured receive less medical care \n     and less preventive care and have a poorer level of health, \n     which result in lifetime costs to themselves and to the \n     entire American economy.\n       (3) Although CHIP and Medicaid are successfully extending a \n     health coverage safety net to a growing portion of the \n     vulnerable low-income population of uninsured children, they \n     alone cannot achieve 100 percent health insurance coverage \n     for our nation's children due to inevitable gaps during \n     outreach and enrollment, fluctuations in eligibility, \n     variations in access to private insurance at all income \n     levels, and variations in States' ability to provide required \n     matching funds.\n       (4) As all segments of society continue to become more \n     transient, with many changes in employment over the working \n     lifetime of parents, the need for a reliable safety net of \n     health insurance which follows children across State lines, \n     already a major problem for the children of migrant and \n     seasonal farmworkers, will become a major concern for all \n     families in the United States.\n       (5) The medicare program has successfully evolved over the \n     years to provide a stable, universal source of health \n     insurance for the nation's disabled and those over age 65, \n     and provides a tested model for designing a program to reach \n     out to America's children.\n       (6) The problem of insuring 100 percent of all American \n     children could be gradually solved by automatically enrolling \n     all children born after December 31, 2009, in a program \n     modeled after Medicare (and to be known as ``MediKids''), and \n     allowing those children to be transferred into other \n     equivalent or better insurance programs, including either \n     private insurance, CHIP, or Medicaid, if they are eligible to \n     do so, but maintaining the child's default enrollment in \n     MediKids for any times when the child's access to other \n     sources of insurance is lost.\n       (7) A family's freedom of choice to use other insurers to \n     cover children would not be interfered with in any way, and \n     children eligible for CHIP and Medicaid would continue to be \n     enrolled in those programs, but the underlying safety net of \n     MediKids would always be available to cover any gaps in \n     insurance due to changes in medical condition, employment, \n     income, or marital status, or other changes affecting a \n     child's access to alternate forms of insurance.\n       (8) The MediKids program can be administered without \n     impacting the finances or status of the existing Medicare \n     program.\n       (9) The MediKids benefit package can be tailored to the \n     special needs of children and updated over time.\n       (10) The financing of the program can be administered \n     without difficulty by a yearly payment of affordable premiums \n     through a family's tax filing (or adjustment of a family's \n     earned income tax credit).\n       (11) The cost of the program will gradually rise as the \n     number of children using MediKids as the insurer of last \n     resort increases, and a future Congress always can accelerate \n     or slow down the enrollment process as desired, while the \n     societal costs for emergency room usage, lost productivity \n     and work days, and poor health status for the next generation \n     of Americans will decline.\n       (12) Over time 100 percent of American children will always \n     have basic health insurance, and we can therefore expect a \n     healthier, more equitable, and more productive society.\n\n     SEC. 2. BENEFITS FOR ALL CHILDREN BORN AFTER 2009.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Social Security Act is amended by \n     adding at the end the following new title:\n\n                     ``TITLE XXII--MEDIKIDS PROGRAM\n\n     ``SEC. 2201.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``TARP Reduction Priority \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On October 7, 2008, Congress established the Troubled \n     Assets Relief Program (TARP) as part of the Emergency \n     Economic Stabilization Act (Public 110-343; 122 Stat. 3765) \n     and allocated $700,000,000,000 for the purchase of toxic \n     assets from banks with the goal of restoring liquidity to the \n     financial sector and restarting the flow of credit in our \n     markets.\n       (2) The Department of Treasury, without consultation with \n     Congress, changed the purpose of TARP and began injecting \n     capital into financial institutions through a program called \n     the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) rather than purchasing \n     toxic assets.\n       (3) Lending by financial institutions was not noticeably \n     increased with the implementation of the CPP and the \n     expenditure of $218,000,000,000 of TARP funds, despite the \n     goal of the program.\n       (4) The recipients of amounts under the CPP are now faced \n     with additional restrictions related to accepting those \n     funds.\n       (5) A number of community banks and large financial \n     institutions have expressed their desire to return their CPP \n     funds to the Department of Treasury and the Department has \n     begun the process of accepting receipt of such funds.\n       (6) The Department of the Treasury should not reuse \n     returned funds for additional lending for financial \n     assistance.\n       (7) The United States Constitution provided Congress with \n     the power of the purse hence any future spending of TARP \n     funds, or other financial assistance, should be determined by \n     Congress.\n\n     SEC. 503. TARP AUTHORIZATION REDUCTION.\n\n       Section 115(a)(3) the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act \n     of 2008 (12 U.S.C. 5211 et seq.) is amended by inserting \n     ``minus any amounts received by the Secretary for repayment \n     of the principal of financial assistance by an entity that \n     has received financial assistance under the TARP or any \n     program enacted by the Secretary under the authorities \n     granted to the Secretary under this Act,'' before \n     ``outstanding at any one time.''\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 1031.

Let's try to get this done.\n  We have a lot more work to do following this. Before we leave here--\njust to go over briefly what we have to do--we have to do the \nlegislation dealing with credit cards, which was passed in a huge \nbipartisan vote in the House yesterday, and we have to do the \nprocurement bill, which is also a bipartisan bill sponsored by Senators \nLevin and McCain. We, frankly, are not going to be able to get to the \ntobacco legislation this work period. I am disappointed we can't do \nthat, but we would not be able to.
