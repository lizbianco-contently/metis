Mr. President, following leader remarks, the Senate will \nresume consideration of the Wall Street reform bill. There will be no \nrollcall votes today or on Monday or on next Friday. The following \nMonday, we will take a look at that. That is now scheduled as a no-vote \nday. We may not be able to do that. Other things have come up, not the \nleast of which is a conversation with Secretary Gates yesterday about \nthe supplemental war funding bill.\n  We are going to do our utmost to finish the bill we are on now next \nweek. We have today and all day Monday for people to work on \namendments, and we would hope we can make some progress in that regard. \nYesterday, there were a few difficult spots, but late in the evening we \nwere able to get the Senate back on track. We had some important \nlegislation done last night.\n  I repeat what I said last night: There doesn't need to be long \nperiods of time for debating most of these issues. We have all studied \nthem. This bill has been in the public eye for a long time. Sherrod \nBrown had a controversial, important amendment. I supported that \namendment. But he spoke for 5 minutes. The opposition spoke for 5 \nminutes. Everyone understood what they were doing. It was a good vote. \nI use that as an example. We can move through this stuff much more \nrapidly.\n  We want to make sure Senators have opportunities to offer amendments. \nAs I said yesterday, there are lots of amendments. A lot of them are in \nthe same area. We need to focus on these. Senator Durbin has six \namendments. He is going to offer one of his amendments. That is an \nexample for all of us to follow.\n  Again, we ended the day on a good note. I believe that is important. \nWe have already lined up some things to do when we begin legislative \nsession on Tuesday, but on Monday, the two managers will be ready to do \nbusiness on work they are doing. A number of these things can be worked \nout. The two people managing the banking part of this bill are longtime \nlegislators. They have handled many bills on the Senate floor. They \nwill accept a lot of these amendments.\n  The derivatives part of this bill is, by some standards, a little \nmore complicated, but even there the issues are fairly clear. Senators \nLincoln and Chambliss are ready to work with Senators who have ideas as \nto how, if at all, they want to change the legislation. They are also \nready for business.\n  I hope people understand the urgency of our agenda. We have many \nthings to do and a very short period of time to do them.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3385-7", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3385]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                  Unanimous-Consent Request--H.R. 4899\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the consideration of H.R. 4899, FEMA supplemental, the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, which legislation is at the desk; \nthat the only amendment in order to the bill be a Reid amendment \nregarding settlement of lawsuits against the Federal Government and \nemergency disaster assistance; that the amendment be considered and \nagreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time, passed, and the \nmotion to reconsider be laid on the table; and that any statements \nrelated to this matter be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on the bill before us. I \nknow John McCain from Arizona has filed an amendment on Fannie and \nFreddie, or GSEs, as we call them. I wish to speak on that amendment.\n  I know I have worked with our Presiding Officer on big pieces of this \nbill. I very much appreciate the spirit with which we have worked on \nthis bill.\n  All of us know there are pieces of this legislation that are very \nappropriate. Certainly, the orderly liquidation title that the \nPresiding Officer, myself, Senator Dodd, Senator Shelby, and so many \nothers have been involved in is an important piece of this legislation. \nAll of us realize secondarily that the derivatives title, once it gets \ncorrected and is in the right form, is a very important piece of trying \nto deal with what we as a country have dealt with over these last \ncouple of years. Certainly, some elements of consumer protection are \nvery important. I hope we are able to get that back in balance.\n  I believe, as with any piece of legislation we pass here, sometimes \nwe take a crisis and use it to cause things to happen that don't \nnecessarily have to do with the crisis itself. I certainly believe that \nis the case with some of the expanse as it relates to consumer \nprotection. But the fact is, I think the orderly liquidation title is \nsomething that is a useful tool. Hopefully, we will get the derivatives \ntitle right, and we will no longer have a situation where people are \nhugely money bad and don't settle up on a daily basis and end up with \nthe kind of situation we are all so familiar with as it relates to AIG.\n  There are still three areas we have not dealt with that are very \nimportant. One of them is underwriting. I hope the Presiding Officer \nand others will be able to work together and come up with an \nappropriate underwriting title. At the base and the core of this whole \ncrisis, the fact is, what generated this worldwide crisis was the fact \nthat a bunch of bad loans were written that should have never been \nwritten. This bill does nothing whatsoever--zero--to deal with loan \nunderwriting. To me, that is a huge oversight. I am hoping that the \nSenator from Connecticut, the Senator from Virginia, and the Senator \nfrom Alabama--many of us will figure out a way to deal with it in an \nappropriate way.\n  I have an amendment. It is an approach. I am hoping, over the course \nof the next week and a half, we will figure out a way to deal with the \ncore issue of this last crisis, which is, no doubt, we wrote a bunch of \nloans--our country did--mortgages were extended to people who could not \npay them back.\n  Second, credit ratings. The fact is, the credit rating agencies were \nat the core of this. I know the bill attempts to deal with credit \nrating agencies by virtue of a pleading standard, making it so they are \nmore liable for some of the recommendations they put forth. It is my \nsense what is going to happen, by addressing it that way, is the \nsmaller firms that are just entering the market--that would like to be \nconstructive as it relates to credit ratings--basically are going to be \npushed out of the market, and the larger firms will be more \nconsolidated or have a bigger piece of the business because they will \nbe able to withstand some of the litigation that will take place, \nhopefully, if they make bad recommendations.\n  But I think there are probably some other ways of looking at this. I \nknow there are people in this body on both sides of the aisle who \nconstructively are trying to figure out a way to deal with that.\n  But the one glaring, glaring, glaring piece is Fannie and Freddie. I \nthink one of the reasons we, as a body, have not dealt with Fannie and \nFreddie is they are huge, they are a big part of the market, the \nhousing industry is very dependent upon them, and there has not been a \nconsolidation around what most works to move them away from being such \na big piece of the market and such a huge liability for our country.\n  That is why I so much like the amendment John McCain from Arizona has \nput forth. I know he has worked with Judd Gregg and others. But what is \noutstanding about his amendment is--there are two things. No. 1, the \nfact is, we actually have to be honest with the American people about \nthe cost, the liabilities we are picking up as it relates to the GSEs. \nEach year, for budgetary reasons, we will have to allocate moneys for \nthe actual liabilities that exist. I think that is a good thing. I \nthink that is a very important step. There will be some transparency \ninto what those organizations are actually costing our country. I think \nall of us realize Fannie and Freddie are a huge problem and we need to \ndeal with it.\n  The second piece of the McCain amendment I like so much is it puts in \nplace a date certain, a certain time by which we, as a body, have to \nhave dealt with them. One of the things I worry about--again, it is \npretty hard to believe we have not thoughtfully figured out a way to \ndeal with the GSEs at the time of passage right now. What I worry about \nis this bill passes and we move on to other topics and still have these \nhuge issues that our country needs to deal with that we know are out of \ncontrol, that have done incredibly terrible jobs in underwriting and \nbasically have missions that counter each other. The fact is, it has a \nsocial mission, it has a business mission. We have tried to put those \ntogether, and it has not worked. We all know we have to deal with that \nin a different way.\n  What the McCain amendment would do is ensure that we deal with it. \nSometimes, again, we move beyond a crisis, we start thinking about \nother things, and then we have these festering problems that have not \nbeen dealt with.\n  So let me say this. I am being pretty honest right here on the floor. \nI realize none of us yet have come up with a silver bullet answer on \nwhat to do exactly with the GSEs. How do we move them into the private \nmarket without totally disrupting what is happening right now, with \nthem being such a huge part of what is happening?\n  The McCain amendment would just make sure, by a date certain, we deal \nwith it, and we can do so incrementally. I know some people on the \nother side of the aisle might take the McCain amendment as a major \ncriticism. I do not. I just look at it as a way for us to move ahead.\n  So I hope my friends on the other side of the aisle will actually \nlook at the substance. I think it is thoughtful. I truly do. I think it \nis something that allows us to start accounting for it. But then, \nwithin a certain period of time, within the next couple of years, we \nwill have had to deal with Fannie and Freddie or some draconian things \nwill occur, no doubt.\n  I hope the Senator from Virginia, the Senators from Connecticut, \nMissouri,\n\n[[Page S3387]]\n\nand New Mexico, who are in this body today--I hope we can move beyond \nany partisan thinking. I will say, I think this body has done very well \nover the last week and a half. It is a complex piece of legislation. I \nthink the Senator from Connecticut has tried to deal with this in a \nvery good way on the floor.\n  As a matter of fact, we had a vote last night that I think a lot of \nus were concerned about, and instead of somebody raising an objection \nand trying to get us to a 60-vote threshold, we had a 51-vote \nthreshold. I thought that was the best of this body last night, and I \nwish to thank those in charge of escorting this bill through the \nprocess for keeping it that way. There could have been a motion to \ntable. Somebody could have asked for a 60-vote threshold.\n  I know the Senator from Missouri is going to speak next. She has been \nconcerned about the process this year, and I join her in many of those \nconcerns. But so far this process has been about the best I have seen \nin some time.\n  So as I move back to the McCain amendment, I know it is being offered \nby a Republican. I do not offer criticisms toward either side of the \naisle for what has happened with the GSEs. Let's face it, in fairness, \nboth sides of the aisle have had a hand in these things being where \nthey are. Administrations on both sides of the aisle have used these \nGSEs toward ends. There is no question. I am not trying to weigh which \nside is most responsible. But the McCain amendment allows us to move \nahead in a thoughtful way with these organizations.\n  So I will stop. I do urge my friends to please read the legislation. \nMaybe there is a second degree that is in order to make it even better. \nBut I do believe it is a way for us to responsibly move ahead and deal \nwith Fannie and Freddie. They cannot continue to exist as they are. \nEverybody in this body knows that. The American people know that. Let's \ndeal with it. Let's pass the McCain amendment. Let's pass the McCain \namendment with a tweak or two, if that is necessary. But let's show the \nAmerican people we know it is a problem and we have the ability to work \nacross party lines to be able to do so.\n  I yield the floor, and I thank all of you for listening.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Missouri.\n\n\n             Unanimous-Consent Requests--Executive Calendar\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I rise this morning in the cause of \ncommon sense in how the Senate works. We have had so many delays on \nnominations this year. Just as a quick review of where we stand, we \nhave had over 51 rollcall votes on President Obama's nominations to \nserve in government under his Presidency. Of those 51 votes, over 80 \npercent of them were confirmed by overwhelming margins. Yet they sat on \nthe calendar for more than 3 months, on average--overwhelming support, \nsitting on the calendar for 3 months, on average.\n  Just for some comparison, at the similar point in the Bush \nadministration, there were eight nominees on the calendar. Right now, \nwe have 107 nominees on the calendar. As I look at the list, I am \nconfused because, as to most of the people on the list, we do not know \nwhy they are sitting there. We do not even know who is making them sit \nthere. Enter stage left the anonymous hold--or as I like to call it: \nNobody can blame me because they don't know who I am.\n  There is a law we passed that has a rule in it--very plain language, \nvery easy to understand--that once a Senator makes a unanimous consent \nrequest to confirm a nominee, then you have to come out in the \nsunlight. After 6 session days, after those requests are made in terms \nof a unanimous consent for their confirmation, then the rule says you \nmust notify your party leader of your hold that you have on the \nnomination, and it has to be published in the Congressional Record.\n  So last week I came to the floor and made 74 unanimous consent \nrequests on nominations. Who were those 74? This is the amazing part. \nThis is very amazing. Not one of the nominations I made a unanimous \nconsent request on last week had any opposition in committee--none--not \na voice vote ``no.'' No one spoke out and said: I have a problem. They \nflew out of committee--all 74 of them. But no one knows why they are \nsitting there or who has put a hold on them.\n  I made the request, and in the intervening week we have had a lot of \nactivity in that regard. The first thing that happened is, my friend \nfrom Oklahoma followed the rule. He notified his party leader of the \nholds he had, and it was published in the Congressional Record. He has \na great habit of reading what we are doing around here. When he read \nthe rule, it was obvious to him the rule said, once the request had \nbeen made, you say who your holds are. He has never been afraid, my \nfriend from Oklahoma. He has never been afraid to take accountability. \nI have seen him with great courage enrage this entire room because he \nhad some principles he was standing on. He is a great role model in \nthat regard--his principled stands; and he owns them. That is all we \nare talking about. We are talking about owning them.\n  Nobody in America gets why this stuff has to be secret. I know he has \nan amendment he wants to offer on secret spending, and I would like, on \nthe record, to say I would like to join him in that amendment. The \nsecret spending that goes on through the hotline process, he is \nabsolutely right--publishing this stuff for 72 hours. He is absolutely \nright.\n  But this practice is absolutely wrong. Unlike his other colleagues, \nhe stepped out of the dark and into the sunshine. But no one else did.\n  So now, a week later, we still have 53 of those 74 names for which we \nhave no idea who is holding them or why. Some of them have been \nconfirmed of the 74 since then--a few. I think the Senator from \nOklahoma identified a hold on, I believe, six or seven. So now we still \nhave 53 names for which no one knows who is holding them by people who \nare avoiding the rule.\n  I had somebody come up to me the other day and say: Well, there is no \nenforcement. I said: Who would have thought you would have to make it a \nmisdemeanor for a Senator to identify their hold? They voted for the \nbill. The vote was 96 to 2, so they voted for it. They just do not want \nto live by it.\n  Today, I come back to the floor with my colleagues--and there will be \na number of us here--to once again try to trigger the rule. The \nunanimous consent requests will be made. Today, we have 69 names--the \n53 from last week that are still out in the dark somewhere--we do not \nknow who is holding them or why--and additional names that have been \nadded to the calendar since then.\n  Mr. President, 64 of the 69 nominees we will make a motion on today--\n64 of the 69 nominees--had no opposition in committee--none. As we will \nhear over the next hour or so, these are important jobs: National \nTraffic Safety Board, the inspector general for the EPA. Can you \nimagine right now not having an inspector general of the EPA with what \nis going on in the gulf?\n  The other good news--let me just briefly talk about this. I am going \nto yield to my colleague from New Mexico. We have a letter going \naround, and the letter is very simple. Everyone who signs the letter is \ntaking a pledge--a public pledge--that they will never again \nparticipate in a secret hold; and, further, they support abolishing \nsecret holds. If you want to hold somebody, you have to put your name \non it.\n  I am very proud of the fact we now have 59 signatures on that letter, \nboth Republicans--a Republican so far, 2 Independents, and all the \nDemocratic Senators, except 1. I am optimistic we will get the last \nremaining Democratic Senator, Mr. Byrd, since he cosponsored a \nresolution in 2003, along with Senator Wyden and Senator Grassley, who \nhave done yeoman's work on this issue for years. Senator Lott and \nSenator Byrd, along with Senator Grassley and Senator Wyden, sponsored \na resolution back in 2003 to try to end secret holds, and here we are 7 \nyears later with 53 nominees in the dark after the rule has been \ntriggered.\n  So I am optimistic. I certainly am hopeful we will have a lot more \nRepublicans sign on the letter. I think we may. The iceberg is moving. \nWe may actually bust up this thing. I am wildly optimistic--which is an \nunusual thing around here--about reform. It is hard to change the \ntraditions of the Senate, especially when they are bad habits. Once \nagain, my colleague from Oklahoma and I share the same view on earmarks \nand have tried from a principled\n\n[[Page S3388]]\n\nposition to not participate in those. I think that is also a bad habit. \nClearly, we have a lot more people agreeing with us on secret holds \nthan we do on earmarks.\n\n  I look forward to making these motions today. I look forward to the \nSenators reading the rule, understanding the plain language, \nacknowledging they voted for it, and putting their name on these secret \nholds. Hold a nominee. The Senator from Oklahoma is holding some \nnominees. He has the right to do that. But the people we work for have \nthe right to know why and who he is. That is all we are asking for \ntoday. We are not asking anybody to give up their holds; we are only \nasking people to identify who they are, to come into the sunshine for \nthe transparency we all want to have as we serve the great people of \nthis Nation.\n  With that, for the unanimous consent requests, I will yield to my \ncolleague from New Mexico, Senator Udall.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I know our Presiding Officer \ntoday is also going to come forward, and we hope to see him down on the \nfloor. I thank Senator McCaskill very much for her organizational \nefforts, hers and Senator Warner's, and for working on this issue. This \nis a very serious issue for the Senate in terms of how we move forward \non the rules. I kind of liken it--and I have some history here, and I \nknow everybody has their history when it comes to administrations.\n  We have this administration elected a little over a year and a half \nago, trying to put their people in place. They are trying to put people \nin place to run, for example--I am going to be talking about the \nTennessee Valley Authority and talking about the EEOC, the Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission. They are trying to put their people \nin place to run these agencies and to get the government to work. \nSometimes in the past--and my father passed recently, but he used to \nvisit with me about the way they used to do it in the old days. In the \nold days you got to put your people into place within the first couple \nof weeks of an administration. I remember my father telling me he took \nover as Secretary of the Interior in January. Within 2 weeks, he had \nall of his Presidential appointees in place. He had his team in place. \nHe could start carrying out the responsibilities that had been given \nhim by the President. My understanding is for most of the Cabinet \nmembers in President Kennedy's Cabinet, the same thing was true. Within \na couple of weeks you had your team in place and you could go out and \ntry to do the things your President had campaigned on.\n  We are seeing a striking difference between those days back in the \n1960s and what happens today. We are seeing incredible obstruction in \nterms of trying to move forward. It is done through this process, as \nSenator McCaskill has brought out, of secret holds.\n  Since the Obama administration--I saw a figure at the end of the \nfirst year--they only had 55 percent of their team in place; 55 percent \nof their team. What we are talking about is holding up the ability of \nthe President to have his team in place and do his job. I think that is \nunacceptable. I think one of the areas that is the worst when it comes \nto this is the hold process, the secret holds.\n  What is a secret hold? Everybody asks about these secret holds. This \nmeans a Senator is able to put a hold on a nomination and not come out \nin public. We all know that the very best thing is to shine light on \nthe process. I think one of our Supreme Court Justices said it the \nbest: Sunshine is the best disinfectant. With the secret holds, there \nis no sunshine. As many of us have pointed out on the floor, we want to \nbring sunshine to this process.\n  I wish to congratulate Senator Coburn for being the only Senator to \nstep forward in this week-long process of trying to bring people out \ninto the public. I understand Senator McCaskill's reading of this \nstatute and my reading of this statute is if you have not come forward \nat this point on this large number of nominees for which unanimous \nconsent has been asked, and there has been an objection, you are in \nviolation of the law. You are in violation of the law. Only Senator \nCoburn has stepped forward to say I am holding up--I believe he is \nholding up the Broadcasting Board of Governors. He is holding up six \npeople on the Broadcasting Board of Governors.\n  Today I am going to try to move--and we are doing this, I say to \nSenator Coburn, in a bipartisan way. We are not picking just Democrats. \nWe are talking about the EEOC and the Tennessee Valley Authority, and \nwe are moving forward with both Democrats and Republicans. That is why \nI am doing an en bloc request at this point so we can get both \nDemocrats and Republicans in place.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the purpose of consideration of Calendar Nos.--\nand this is important, the EEOC--616, Jacqueline A. Berrien, to be a \nmember of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; 617, Chai Rachel \nFeldblum; 619, Victoria Lipnic, to be a member of the EEOC for the \nremainder of the term expiring July 1, 2010; and 620, Victoria Lipnic \nto be a member of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; that the \nnominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table en bloc, no further motions be \nin order, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, \nand that any statements relating to the nominees be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I wish to \nmake an inquiry of the Chair as to the interpretation of the rule we \npassed, because it is my understanding that the rule doesn't require \nyou to publish, but it does say the majority and minority leader are no \nlonger obligated to honor your request for a hold if you have not.\n  I ask for the Chair's opinion on that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The law being section 512, Notice \nof Objecting to Proceeding.\n\n       In General. The Majority and Minority Leaders of the Senate \n     or their designees shall recognize a motion of intent of a \n     Senator who is a member of their caucus to object to \n     proceeding to a measure or matter only if the Senator--\n\nlet me read both of these; I will try to paraphrase:\n  Following the objection to a unanimous consent to proceeding to, and/\nor passage of a measure or matter on their behalf, submits the notice \nof intent in writing to the appropriate leader or their designee; and \nparagraph 2, not later than 6 session days after the submission under \nparagraph (1), submits for inclusion in the Congressional Record and in \nthe applicable calendar section described in subsection (b) the \nfollowing notice--and files a notice of intent.\n  Mr. COBURN. OK. I will take that reading of the law as an assumption \nthat agrees with the position I put out there.\n  I would say--if the Chair would give me some time in consideration of \nmy reserving the right to object--I served in the majority for 2 years \nprior to the Senators who are here on the floor today, and I understand \nthe frustration. I have been there. I was on the other side. It is \ndifficult. In terms of numbers, we have more of President Obama's \nnominees cleared than President Bush's nominees at the same point in \ntime.\n  I wish to raise the question. I am going to comply. First, I don't \nhave any problem explaining why I hold somebody. The BBG nominees: The \nBBG is in such a mess, I want to make sure I visit with every nominee \nbefore I give them a clearance to get on that board, because we are \nwasting three-quarters of a billion dollars there and not doing \nanything positive for our country as we spend that money.\n  There are a lot of reasons why we hold people. One of the dangers of \ncoming forward, from my experience as a Senator myself, of putting a \nhold on and then putting it out there, is this: If I want to do further \nwork or study or have a question, the assumption with a hold is that \nyou don't want them to move, and that may not be the case at all. The \nreason for a hold oftentimes is I want to look at the history, I want \nto look at the background, and I want to take the time to meet the \nindividual myself. That fulfills the true obligation of advise and \nconsent.\n  I would also say we were frustrated when we were in the majority the \nsame way, and we played the same kind of parlance, except with our own \nnominees. When somebody on our side had a\n\n[[Page S3389]]\n\nhold, we didn't ever mention that. We didn't ever complain about that. \nWe just complained when the other side did. So the perspective has to \nbe--understanding the frustration; the President deserves advice and \nconsent--but I also know there are 150 nominees right now sitting in \ncommittee who haven't been cleared in committee and we are a year and a \nhalf, a year and 4 months into this administration. It is not just \nthat.\n  I intend to object to every one of these, not because I personally \nhave an objection, and I want my colleagues to know that, but one of \nthe considerations of courtesy on the Senate floor is if somebody else \ndoes, you will honor that.\n  The final point I will make is that the majority and minority leader \nusually work these things out. I think we passed 28 in the last few \nweeks, probably because of some of the good effort of my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle to apply the pressure and heat. But I plan \nto object to every one of these because there are those on our side who \nhave a problem with the individual. But I don't disagree that you ought \nto have the courage to stand up and say who you are holding and why you \nare holding them. I don't disagree with that. But that isn't our case \nright now and that isn't the case of the law, as I understand it; it \njust removes the obligation.\n  So on that basis I will object to this first package and plan on \nobjecting to every other one in forbearance and as a courtesy to those \non my side of the aisle who have a problem with these nominees.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I am confused. This law was passed in \nthe most bipartisan way possible: 96 to 2. Are we going to pretend this \nlaw doesn't say what it says?\n  Let me make sure I put in the Record what it says:\n\n       The majority and minority leaders of the Senate or their \n     designees shall recognize a notice of intent of a Senator who \n     is a member of their caucus to object to a proceeding or a \n     measure only if the Senator--\n       (1) following the objection to a unanimous consent \n     proceeding submits the notice of intent in writing to the \n     appropriate leader or their designee; and\n       (2) not later than 6 session days after the submission \n     under paragraph (1), submits for inclusion in the \n     Congressional Record and in the applicable calendar section \n     described in subsection (b) the following notice:\n       I, Senator ____ intend to object to proceedings to ____ \n     dated ____ for the following reasons ____ .\n\n  It says the majority and minority leader can recognize a hold only if \nthe Senator first submits the notice of intent in writing after the \nunanimous consent request is made, and submits it to the Congressional \nRecord.\n  We are going to try to slice and dice the plain language of this \nabout something as obvious and commonsensical as owning your hold? I \nknow the Senator from Oklahoma doesn't agree with that. He has just \nsaid so. He is not doing this. I know he is here as a courtesy to his \nfellow Members. But with all due respect, it is 107 to 8 on the \nExecutive Calendar.\n  That is how many were on the calendar in the Bush administration at \nthe same time--eight. There are 107 on the Executive Calendar in this \nadministration. Honestly, we can do this forever. We can say when we \nwere in the majority, we didn't do this and you did it; and when we \nwere in the minority, we didn't do this and you did.\n  We have a chance to stop it. We had 96 votes to stop it. Are we now \ngoing to stand on some kind of notion that the law doesn't say what the \nlaw says? I know part of the amendment of the Senator from Oklahoma is \nthat he wants Senators to sign in writing that they have read what they \nare passing and that they understand the impact. I will be honest; I am \ngoing to cosponsor that, if he will let me, because I agree with the \npremise of it, although it is a little paternalistic to make Senators \nsign something saying they understand the impact.\n  Does anybody believe Senators don't understand the impact of this \nlanguage? Are we going to stand on some kind of formality that we don't \nhave a way to enforce it. I guess the position the Senator is taking on \nbehalf of the Republican caucus is that the law doesn't say what the \nlaw says.\n  I have had a briefing this week on the standing rule versus the rule \nversus the law. That is what drives America crazy about this place. The \nsecret hold is wrong. The Senator from Oklahoma knows it, and I \nguarantee you most of his colleagues do. You would be amazed how many \nRepublicans have come up to me this week and said, ``I don't do it, \nClaire.''\n  I ask the Senator from Oklahoma to join our letter since he doesn't \ndo it either. He has courage. He has guts. He is accountable to the \npeople who voted for him. But to stand on behalf of the Republican \ncaucus on some notion that this doesn't say what it says--that is all \nwe are sent here to do, honestly. Believe me, I know the stuff that \ngoes on here--the equal opportunities--and the Democrats are doing some \nof this in the majority. But we cleared all the secret holds this week. \nWe had a few--the Democrats had a few--and we cleared them all. I had a \ncouple Democrats come up to me complaining: ``I can't believe you made \nme give up my hold.'' They were not happy about it. We had some \nreluctant signatures on the letter.\n  Do you know what is nice about the letter? I think this is important \nfor the Senator from Oklahoma to understand. It doesn't say we are \ngiving up secret holds for this administration. A lot of my friends on \nthe other side of the aisle have a spring in their step now and think \nmy party is on the ropes and there is a chance that, come next year at \nthis time, Senator McConnell will be the majority leader or that \nCongressman Boehner will be the Speaker. Do you know what. All the \nnames on this letter did not say ``while we are in charge.'' It says \n``forever.'' We now have 58 members of this caucus--56 and 2 \nIndependents who caucus with us--and 1 Republican so far who say it is \nforever; as long as we are Senators, we are not going to do secret \nholds.\n  Frankly, my friend from Oklahoma doesn't have to worry next year \nabout secret holds from this side of the aisle. I am proud we have done \nthat. There may be a nomination a future President makes that is a \nRepublican, and if the people of Missouri are good and kind enough to \nhire me again, I may not like it. But I guarantee I will have the guts \nto say so.\n  Mr. President, I wanted to clarify the plain reading of the law and, \nobviously, what its intent was. I don't think anybody with a straight \nface can argue what the intent was. It was to stop this stuff. We can \neither ignore the intent and stand on a slicing and dicing and parsing \nof the language and reassure the American people that we completely \ndon't get it or we can have people come out of the shadows on these \nholds.\n  I appreciate the Senator from New Mexico for allowing me to respond.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, now we have seen \ndemonstrated, I think dramatically, what the process is here. We tried \nto move on a bipartisan basis for the EEOC to put Democrats and \nRepublicans in that important government agency, an agency that focuses \non discrimination. If the people are not in place, it cannot move \nforward with that very important goal. Our friend on the other side of \nthe aisle, Senator Coburn, has objected to putting Democrats and \nRepublicans in that agency so it can move forward.\n  I am going to try to move forward, also in a bipartisan way, on the \nTennessee Valley Authority. Many people may not know, but in the \nTennessee Valley, the power is provided by an agency called the \nTennessee Valley Authority. Everybody knows how important power is to \nthe economy. When we look around the world, we see communities being \nstifled because they have blackouts and brownouts and they don't have \nthe available power. The Tennessee Valley Authority has a number of \nmembers who need to be appointed to the board of directors. We are \nmoving today--both Democrats and Republicans--to try to bring home the \npoint that we need to get this board of governors in place.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the purpose of consideration of Calendar Nos. \n740, Maryland A. Brown; 741, William B. Sansom; 742, Neil G. McBride; \nand 743, Barbara Short Haskew, all to be members of the board of \ndirectors of the Tennessee Valley Authority; that the nominations be \nconfirmed en bloc, the motions\n\n[[Page S3390]]\n\nto reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table en bloc; no \nfurther motions be in order, the President be immediately notified of \nthe Senate's action, and that any statements relating to the nominees \nbe printed in the Record as if read.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, moving forward with some \nindividual nominees for President Obama to put in place people at the \nDepartment of Commerce, at the Health and Human Services Department, at \nthe Treasury Department, at the State Department, and at the Energy \nDepartment--all very important government agencies. All President Obama \nwants is to have his team in place so they can start doing their work. \nBut what we are seeing on the other side over and again is secret holds \nand delay.\n  It is important to remind everybody that at this particular point in \ntime 107 nominees of the executive branch are being held up. At this \npoint in time in the past for President Bush, only 8 nominees were \nbeing held. So 107 are being held for President Obama, and for \nPresident Bush, there were only 8. You can only think and draw the \nconclusion that this is about preventing the President from getting his \nteam in place, which is obviously a very important function.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 640, \nEric Hirschhorn, to be Under Secretary of Commerce for the Export \nAdministration; that the nomination be confirmed; that the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table; that no further \nmotions be in order, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and that any statements relating to the nominee be \nprinted in the Record, as if read.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, now proceeding with an \nimportant nomination for Health and Human Services, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the Senate proceed to executive session for the purpose of \nconsideration of Calendar No. 647, Jim Esquea, to be an Assistant \nSecretary of Health and Human Services; that the nomination be \nconfirmed; that the motions to reconsider be made and laid upon the \ntable; that no further motions be in order; that the President be \nimmediately notified of the Senate's action, and that any statements \nrelating to the nominee be printed in the Record as if read.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I will proceed with another \nimportant position in the Department of the Treasury. We all know the \nDepartment of the Treasury supervises everything that is out there in \nterms of our economy--a very important position.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nfor the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 652, Michael Mundaca, \nto be an Assistant Secretary of the Treasury; that the nomination be \nconfirmed; that the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid \nupon the table; that no further motions be in order; that the President \nbe immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that any statements \nrelating to the nominee be printed in the Record as if read.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, here is another important \nnomination at the Department of State.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nfor the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 722, Judith Ann \nStewart Stock, to be an Assistant Secretary of State; that the \nnomination be confirmed; that the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table; that no further motions be in order; that \nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that \nany statements relating to the nominee be printed in the Record as if \nread.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, I want to \nmake it known that I am carrying on a Senate courtesy on my side of the \naisle, and these are not necessarily my objections, but they are on \nbehalf of my colleagues. I object.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I say to Senator Coburn that \nwe very much understand that he is doing this for others. We want them \nto step forward. We want to get rid of these secret holds, as the \nSenator from Oklahoma has stepped forward on the broadcasting board. He \nhas said he is holding up six people to go on that board of governors. \nIt is out there in public, and it is something that all of us can \nexamine and the media can examine. We can figure out whether his \nobjections are legitimate. But that is the process. That is what is \ngoing on--secretly delaying the administration from getting its team in \nplace.\n  Let's admit what is going on here. The folks who are putting on these \nholds do not want to see the President have his team in place. If he \ndoesn't have his team in place, I think the expectation is that they \nthink he would not be able to do the job.\n  Once again, the President nominated somebody important to work with \nSecretary Chu at the Department of Energy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 726, \nPatricia A. Hoffman, to be an Assistant Secretary of Energy; that the \nnomination be confirmed; that the motions to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table; that no further motions be in order; that \nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that \nany statements relating to the nominee be printed in the Record as if \nread.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Once again, they are being held up through \nsecret holds, and Senator Coburn has said he is doing this on behalf of \nMembers on his side--not allowing all of these people to get into the \ngovernment and do the job. We are talking about important government \nagencies, such as the Department of Commerce, Health and Human \nServices, Secretary of the Treasury, Secretary of State, Secretary of \nEnergy--all objected to today.\n  Many of these nominations have been pending for a while. There are \nvery few objections in committee. This is something that is being put \nforward for the purpose of delay.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. I am going to yield to the Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Mr. COBURN. Will the Senator from Minnesota yield?\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. For a minute, sure.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I think the motives ascribed by the \nSenator from New Mexico are improper. I do not think it is so people \ncan't get into a job to cause President Obama problems. I reject that \nmotive.\n  With any administration, there is a very big difference of opinion. \nThat is why we have elections. That is why things move like this in our \ncountry. It is about whether somebody objects to somebody's either \nphilosophical bent or qualifications for a certain job.\n  I make the point again that at the same time under a Republican \nCongress, President Bush had fewer numbers approved than President \nObama does at this time.\n  I hope we would not ascribe that motive. I want President Obama to \nhave, in fact, the people he needs to have in place to effectively run \nour government. I will give the numbers again. To this date, President \nObama has 596 of\n\n[[Page S3391]]\n\nhis nominees confirmed. At the same time, President Bush had 570. In \nthe two previous administrations, President Bill Clinton had 740 and \nPresident George H.W. Bush had 700.\n  I think what my colleagues are fighting for is fine. I agree with \nthem. I am on the team as far as that is concerned. But I think we \nought to be careful with the motives we ascribe. I really do not think \nit is to try to handcuff the administration. I think it is different. \nOf course, the sign that is being put up is about who is pending. I \nunderstand that. Let's be careful on the ascribing of motives. As I \ntalk with my colleagues, I do not really find that motive. Even though \nthey may not be out front with it as I have been, that does not mean \nthey necessarily want the administration to not be effective.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nMinnesota.\n  Senators need to be reminded that Senators may not yield the floor to \none another. They must yield only for a question and through the Chair.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I thank you for the correction.\n  I appreciate my colleague's statement about his general support--I \nassume he meant for getting rid of secret holds, and he can correct me \nif I am wrong--his general support for changing this process and \ngetting things done.\n  I will say that when we are in this time of economic challenge, no \nmatter what the motives, I really do not care what is in the heads of \nmy colleagues when they put on the holds. I do not even want to go \nthere. What I care about is getting things done in the government when \nwe have so many people unemployed, when we clearly have to move ahead \nand do more about small business and exports.\n  All I know is this: If we want to talk about the difference, at this \npoint, 107 Obama nominees are on hold and being obstructed. At the same \ntime--whether it was because not enough were nominated, I do not really \ncare--at this same point, Bush nominees waiting for a vote--there were \neight.\n  My bigger answer to this is, who cares about who did it or who did \nwhat when. What matters to me is that we move ahead and get going.\n  It is no surprise to me that the Senators who have taken the floor \nthis morning and are surrounding me are Senators who want to see good \ngovernment, Senators from open States with big blue skies, such as the \nState of New Mexico, Senator Udall, who is now the Presiding Officer; \nor my State, the State of Minnesota, which has always been a leader in \nopen government in moving things ahead; or Senator Warner, who knows \nwhat it is like to manage a large State and knows you have to have your \nteam in place if you want to get things done in the State of Virginia; \nor Senator McCaskill, who has been leading this effort from the Show-Me \nState, the State of Missouri--show me who is doing these holds.\n  The bigger issue is not just making sure we can run this government \nand getting the government moving and helping people again. The bigger \nissue for me is that things should not be done in secret. If you are \ngoing to put a hold on someone, we should know who and why you are \ndoing it. I said the other day that this reminds me of an Olympic \nsport, a relay race, passing a baton from Senator to Senator so we \ncannot figure out who is holding the baton. They rotate who is putting \non the holds, and they get around the rule. If delay were an Olympic \nsport, my colleagues would be getting a gold medal because there has \nbeen so much delay with these nominees, and it has to stop.\n  I want to give a few examples of the kinds of nominees we are talking \nabout and the kinds of nominees we would like to see get confirmed. I \nwant to give some examples of who these are, and I will then go through \nand make a request to confirm them.\n  We are right now in the middle of an oilspill of cataclysmic \nproportions in the gulf. I am going there this afternoon to see it. We \nare going to have a major hearing in our environmental committee on \nTuesday. Do you know who is being held up right now? Michael Tillman, \nto be a member of the Marine Mammal Commission, is being held up; \nanother guy, Daryl Boness, to be a member of the Marine Mammal \nCommission. Normally, one might not think this is the most important \nposition in government. I say two things: One, we are dealing with \nmarine issues right now, extreme marine issues of what is going to \nhappen to our wildlife in the oceans. The second thing we are doing \nwith this--why would anyone hold up members of the Marine Mammal \nCommission?\n  One guy I actually know--Mark Rosekind, to be a member of the \nNational Transportation Safety Board. He does a good job. Like you, Mr. \nPresident, I am a member of the Commerce Committee. We know how \nimportant it is.\n  Earl Weener, to be a member of the National Transportation Safety \nBoard. As we are dealing day-in and day-out with issues of threats to \nour transportation, the potential of airplanes that have gone down in \nthe sky in the middle of Buffalo, and we have potential terrorist \nthreats to our transportation system, what are we doing? We are holding \nup the nominees.\n  We have Toyota putting out cars that basically kill people across the \ncountry because the safety measures were not taken. They just paid the \nbiggest fine in the history of this country. What are we doing? There \nare Members who are secretly holding up members of the National \nTransportation Safety Board. Why would we do that?\n  I will start with these.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nfor the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 592, Mark Rosekind, \nand Calendar No. 787, Earl Weener, both to be members of the National \nTransportation Safety Board; that the nominations be confirmed en bloc, \nthe motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table en \nbloc, no further motions be in order, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, and that any statements relating to \nthe nominees be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Again, this is a perfect example. We look at what \nhappened with the Buffalo flight going down. We look at what happened \nwith the Toyota cars. We look at what is going on across this country \nas we are focusing on terrorism and what happened in Times Square just \nrecently. This is not the time to block nominees to the National \nTransportation Safety Board. Whatever the motives, whatever the \nreasons, at this point I do not care. I think the President should be \nable to have his team in place.\n  Next, I mentioned the Marine Mammal Commission, as we are dealing \nwith an oilspill across the gulf.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 784, \nMichael F. Tillman, and Calendar No. 786, Daryl J. Boness, both to be \nmembers of the Marine Mammal Commission; that the nominations be \nconfirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table en bloc, no further motions be in order, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that any \nstatements relating to the nominees be printed in the Record.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Very good. Again, marine mammals. We are dealing with \nanimals that are almost certainly going to die because of this \noilspill, and there are people on the other side of the aisle who have \ndecided to block these nominations.\n  Next, Warren Miller, nominated to be the Director of the Office of \nCivilian Radioactive Waste Management at the Department of Energy. I \ndon't know the reasons this hold was put on, why he is held up, but I \ndo not believe any person in this country believes we should have no \nperson directing the Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nfor the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 404, the nomination of \nWarren Miller; that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, no further \nmotions be in order,\n\n[[Page S3392]]\n\nthe President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that \nany statements relating to the nominee be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Next we go to Winslow Lorenzo Sargeant, to be Chief \nCounsel for Advocacy in the Small Business Administration. Mr. \nPresident, 64 percent of the jobs in this country are created by small \nbusinesses. Wall Street has been making record profits, but small \nbusinesses in this country are still suffering. Wall Street got a cold; \nMain Street got pneumonia. This is the time for a robust Small Business \nAdministration.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nfor the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 427, the nomination of \nWinslow Lorenzo Sargeant; that the nomination be confirmed, the motion \nto reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, no further \nmotions be in order, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and that any statements relating to the nominee be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, the next one that is being held of \nthese 107 nominations is Benjamin Tucker, to be Deputy Director for \nState, Local, and Tribal Affairs in the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy. As a former prosecutor--and I know you do, Mr. President, as a \nformer attorney general--I understand the importance of having people \nin place to work on our national drug policy and to reduce the illegal \ndrugs in this country.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 556, \nBenjamin Tucker; that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, no further \nmotions be in order, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and that any statements relating to the nominee be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Next, John Laub, to be Director of the National \nInstitute of Justice.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nfor the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 581, John Laub; that \nthe nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid upon the table, no further motions be in order, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that any \nstatement relating to the nominee be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, the next of the 107 nominations being \nput on hold is P. David Lopez, Calendar No. 618, to be general counsel \nof the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nfor the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 618, P. David Lopez; \nthat the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, no further motions be in \norder, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, \nand that any statements relating to the nominee be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, the next one is Jill Long Thompson, to \nbe a member of the Farm Credit Administration. Coming from an \nagricultural State, I understand how important it is to have people in \nplace for the Farm Credit Administration, especially during this \ndifficult time. Because of agencies such as the Farm Credit \nAdministration, at least our rural areas have not gone off the cliff \nand have maintained some stability but are always challenged.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nfor the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 628, Jill Long \nThompson; that the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, no further motions be in \norder, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, \nand that any statements relating to the nominee be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, next, James P. Lynch, to be Director of \nthe Bureau of Justice Statistics. Again, as a former prosecutor, it is \nincredibly important that we have statistics on crime, that we know \nwhat is going on so we can develop the best policies and triage the \ncases so we can keep our neighborhoods safe.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to executive session \nfor the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 705, James P. Lynch; \nthat the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, no further motions be in \norder, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, \nand that any statements relating to the nominee be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. As a member of the Commerce Committee, again, I am \nvery concerned that we still do not have a Deputy Administrator for the \nFederal Aviation Administration in place. As we know, there have been \nmany recent incidents. We are trying to get the FAA reauthorization \ndone to finally modernize our airports with NextGen so we can have the \nnext generation of airport control, so we can better process our \nplanes, so we can better land these planes, so we can have more safety, \nso we can have less congestion at our airports. This is very difficult \nto do when you don't have in place all of your managers who are \nsupposed to be managing the Federal Aviation Administration. We have \nhad incidents in Minnesota of a plane that overran the airport and \nended up in Wisconsin. We have had planes that have been sitting on the \ntarmac for 6 hours with passengers without food and water.\n\n  We have had all kinds of issues with aviation, and yet--and yet--my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, while supportive at times of \nthese efforts to modernize our air traffic control system, are blocking \nthe nomination of the deputy administrator for the Federal Aviation \nAdministration.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 782, \nMichael Peter Huerta; that the nomination be confirmed, the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, no further \nmotions be in order, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and that any statements relating to the nominee be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, another job here that is unfilled--one \nof the 107 relating to maritime issues, and again we are dealing with \nan incredibly sensitive and catastrophic issue with this oilspill in \nour oceans--the Administrator of the Maritime Administration is being \nheld by my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I don't know what \nthe motives are. Maybe they do not like this person. We don't know who \nis holding this. All I know is that a President has to get his team in \nplace when he is dealing with an issue as catastrophic as this BP \noilspill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 783, \nDavid Matsuda; that the nomination be confirmed, the motions to \nreconsider be\n\n[[Page S3393]]\n\nconsidered made and laid upon the table, that no further motions be in \norder, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, \nand that any statements relating to the nominee be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Finally, Mr. President, we have Arthur Allen Elkins, \nwho has been nominated to be the inspector general of the Environmental \nProtection Agency. Again, we are dealing with an environmental crisis \ndown in the gulf coast area. Yet we can't even get this inspector \ngeneral in place.\n  I know many of my colleagues on the other side of the aisle support \nhaving inspectors general in place so we can look at what is going on \nin government, so we can figure out what is happening and get things \nright. Yet this nomination is being held.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 794, \nArthur Allen Elkins; that the nomination be confirmed, the motions to \nreconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, no further \nmotions be in order, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and that any statements relating to the nominee be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I see the Presiding Officer has a smile \non his face as he realizes I have reached the end of the nominees I am \nreporting on today. But I will tell you this: Having managed an office \nof 400 people--a government office, a local county attorney's office--I \ncan't even imagine trying to run that place without having my top \npeople in place and that kind of security.\n  It is very difficult to cut government spending, to make the kinds of \ndecisions you need to make when you don't have your top team there to \nget the work done. Worse than that, with these secret holds, it is very \nhard to even understand why these people are being held, who is holding \nthem. That is why we are working so hard to get rid of this.\n  As I said, this crop of Senators that has come here in the last 2 \nyears does not like business as usual. We just want to get the business \ndone.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, first, let me thank my colleagues for \nbeing here this morning. I am pleased to join this effort. I want to \nparticularly thank my colleague from Missouri, who has been a \nrelentless voice on opening up and bringing a little sunshine to not \nonly this issue but a lot of things that go on here that maybe make \nsome of our colleagues a little uncomfortable, but she is constantly \nbeing that voice and pushing and prodding and trying to make sure we \nimprove the process.\n  I also want to thank my colleague, the Senator from Oklahoma, who--as \nI think the Senator from Missouri said--we may not always agree with, \nbut there are very few Members in this body who are more \nstraightforward and honest about what they believe in and are more \nconsistent, which probably frustrates some of us. But he is absolutely \nconsistent in what he believes and he holds our feet to the fire. I \ncommend him for bringing forward his holds and being willing to step up \nand explain them.\n  Like the Presiding Officer, I am a new guy here. But unlike so many \nof my colleagues, I have never been a legislator. I was a business guy \nfor a number of years and I had the honor of serving as Governor. Quite \nhonestly, I had a little TV in the Governor's office and whenever the \nlegislature was in, I simply turned it off. So I don't fully \nappreciate, perhaps, all of the traditions of a legislative body. And I \ndon't, by any means, know the history as well as my colleague from \nMissouri and my colleague from Oklahoma surrounding holds. But I did a \nlittle bit of research, and it seemed to me this ``holds'' notion came \nup as a courtesy in the last century because Senators had to travel a \nlong distance to get to the body. They couldn't be here because they \nwere traveling--on horseback--and it would take days or weeks. So \nsomebody might say, as a courtesy, that we are going to set this aside \nor put a hold on somebody until the Senator can get here and explain \nhimself or herself--I guess himself, at least at that time--in a fuller \nmanner.\n  It seems to me that some of the traditions of this institution that \nwere used on occasion--whether it is holds or filibusters or what have \nyou--to keep this body functioning, are now being so overused that we \nseem to be institutionalizing dysfunction. I think the Senator from \nOklahoma has made the case that neither side has clean hands, and \nwhatever is up today may be down tomorrow.\n  One of the things I think the Senator from Missouri in her effort has \ndone is to say: We are not saying we ought to change the rules for this \nmoment in time. We want to change the rules forever. I can't explain to \nanybody in the Commonwealth of Virginia why in the 21st century we have \nsomething called a ``secret hold,'' where somebody can say: We don't \nlike this guy or gal and we don't want them to be put forward, debated, \nand voted up or down for some secret, unknown reason.\n  I know my colleague, the Senator from Oklahoma, has said that most of \nthe Members may have a legitimate reason--because they do not agree \nwith the individual's philosophy or their background, and that is a \nvery legitimate reason to raise--but I do know there has been at \nleast--and I can't ascribe motives--a recent press report about an \nissue that brought some controversy here to the floor where a Member \nheld one of the President's nominees not because the Member felt there \nwas anything wrong with the nominee's qualifications but as a leverage \nmatter, to try to encourage the administration to change a law with \nCanada on a totally unrelated matter. That, to me, seems like \ninstitutionalizing dysfunction and not--back to what I have at least \nbeen able to read about the history of holds--as a courtesy because \nfolks can't get here and make their case in person. Even with our \nslightly dysfunctional airline system at this point, we can get here \nwithin a couple of days, absent storms.\n\n  So again commending my colleague from Oklahoma for stepping up on \nthis one, where there is a problem with someone the President is \nputting forward--this President or any future President--we ought to \nacknowledge it, we ought to say what is wrong, we should have a \nspirited discussion, and then we should either vote the person up or \ndown.\n  I am anxious to listen. If there is something wrong with some of \nthese folks, let's vote them down and tell the President to put up \nsomebody else. But 16 months into this administration--as a former \nbusiness CEO and a former CEO of the Commonwealth of Virginia, I \ncouldn't imagine having my folks languish in limbo in this kind of \nskull and crossbones kind of secret hold society stuff. It seems as if \nit was something that came out of the 18th or 19th century, where \ncertain institutions of higher learning transported this idea of secret \nholds here to the floor of the Senate. It doesn't seem to make sense.\n  I am going to finish, because there are other colleagues, and the \nSenator from Oklahoma is going to have to rise a number of times \nbecause there are a lot of folks we have to go through, so I won't go \non with this issue. But I am proud to be part of this effort with the \nSenator from Missouri, and I hope the Senator from Oklahoma will \ncontinue to raise issues--particularly around public spending--where I \nhope to find lots of places of common cause to join him. I appreciate \nhis willingness to come forward. I sure as heck hope that more Members, \non both sides of the aisle, will join this effort.\n  We can be respectful of the Senate and we can be respectful of its \ntraditions, but it sure as heck seems to me that in the 21st century, \nthe notion of secret holds ought to be one of those traditions that \ngets left behind. So in that spirit, I have two sets of nominations, \nboth en bloc, since they are both Democrats and Republicans, to try to \nmake the point that, in some small way, this is not about partisanship. \nIt is about process.\n\n[[Page S3394]]\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the purpose of consideration of Calendar Nos. \n589, Anthony Coscia; 590, Albert DiClemente; and 788, Jeffrey R. \nMoreland, all to be Directors of the Amtrak Board of Directors; that \nthe nominations be confirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table en bloc, no further motions be \nin order, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, \nand that any statements related to the nominees be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to executive session for the purpose of consideration of \nCalendar Nos. 500, Julia Reiskin, and 501, Gloria Valencia-Weber, both \nto be members of the Legal Services Corporation; that the nominations \nbe confirmed en bloc, the motions to reconsider be considered made and \nlaid upon the table en bloc, no further motions be in order, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that any \nstatements relating to the nominees be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. WARNER. Once again, Mr. President, I appreciate the courtesy of \nthe Senator from Oklahoma and the leadership of the Senator from \nMissouri. We are going to continue to raise this issue, and with the \nsame kind of relentlessness the Senator from Oklahoma raises on public \nspending. I hope he continues making some progress. I look forward to \njoining him on some of his efforts, and I hope this list of now 59 \nSenators will include many Members from both sides. It seems to me to \nmake good common sense.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I listened to my colleague from \nOklahoma, and I understand it is difficult to listen to any of us put \nmotives on something when we don't know what the reason is, and \nascribing motives is unfair when you don't know. But sometimes my \nexperience as a mother pops up in my brain, and I think of my kids when \nthey were little--and especially as they became teenagers--and I \nremember one time catching one of my kids. He had sneaked out of the \nhouse at night in the dark. I caught him and I said: You know, you are \nin big trouble, buster. He said: Well, mom, I wasn't doing anything \nwrong. We just walked around the block. We weren't doing anything you \nwould get mad about. We weren't drinking, we weren't smoking, we \nweren't chasing down girls. We just walked around the block. I said: \nWell, you know, if you do it in the dark and you are not willing to \ntell me about it, then you know what I am going to assume? I am going \nto assume you are doing something sneaky and underhanded, and you just \nneed to bank on that; that if you think you have to hide something from \nme, you have to assume I am going to think you are doing something \nwrong. If you are not willing to talk about it, you are not willing to \nown it, you are not willing to tell me about it, you are in trouble. \nEnd of discussion.\n  That is why we are ascribing motives. It is only logical to assume. \nAfter voting for a bill that clearly says once the unanimous consent \nmotion is made you have to come out of the darkness, you have to \nexplain what you are doing, the fact that these people are not coming \nforward--I have to tell you, if they were my kids, I would assume \nthis--they are doing something they aren't proud of. I would assume \nthat, if they were doing the sneaky, and that is what this is. This is \nsneaky, because they are not stepping up--like the Senator from \nOklahoma has. Step up, own it, hold for as long as you like. Some of us \nmay agree with your reasons and join you in your hold.\n\n  But there are literally names on this list where no one knows why \nthey are being held. The White House does not know, the nominee does \nnot know, maybe Leader McConnell doesn't even know. It is nonsense. It \nis plain and simple nonsense.\n  My friend from Oklahoma is absolutely correct, we should not ascribe \nmotives. But it is only human nature, if people are not looking at the \nplain language of the ethics bill they proudly voted for and doing what \nthe plain language says you are supposed to do, people are going to \nstart thinking something underhanded is happening. The only way to fix \nthat is to step up.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 648, \nMichael W. Punke, of Montana, to be a Deputy United States Trade \nRepresentative, with the rank of Ambassador; that the nomination be \nconfirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table, no further motions be in order, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, and that any statements relating to \nthe nominee be printed in the appropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

That man lived in Connecticut. Any activities that he \nengaged in, in planning this dastardly plot in which, thank God, no one \nwas killed, but we have no U.S. Attorney in Connecticut.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to executive session for the purpose of consideration of \nCalendar No. 834, Clifton Timothy Massanelli, to be United States \nMarshal for the Eastern District of Arkansas; that the nomination be \nconfirmed, the motions to reconsider be considered made and laid upon \nthe table, no further motions be in order, the President be immediately \nnotified of the Senate's action, and that any statements relating to \nthe nominee be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate \nproceed to executive session for the purpose of consideration of \nCalendar No. 835, Paul Ward, to be United States Marshal for the \nDistrict of North Dakota; that the nomination be confirmed, the motions \nto reconsider be considered made and laid upon the table, no further \nmotions be in order, the President be immediately notified of the \nSenate's action, and that any statements relating to the nominee be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, there are some nominations on whom the \nrequest has not been made. My colleague from Rhode Island has a number \nof judicial appointments. He will return to the floor to make those \nunanimous consent requests later--I assume soon. There will be 64 total \nrequests that will be made today that we cannot find opposition for--64 \nwe cannot find opposition.\n  I am going to now make five requests to which there was opposition. \nThe ones I just made, by the way, the last group I just made, are new. \nThey have been added to the calendar since I made the requests last \nweek. This is going to continue. I am going to do my very best job at \nimpersonating the tenacity of my colleague from Oklahoma. I am going to \ndo my very best job of being a dog with a bone on secret holds. I am \nnot going to give up. I am going to be out here every week, as often as \nI need to be out here. I am going to get as many colleagues to help me. \nWe now have everybody on this side on board with the exception of \nSenator Byrd, and I am optimistic we will get Senator Byrd. I am \nhopeful the next time I will have some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle, who agree secret holds are wrong, to help make these \nrequests.\n  The ones I just made were new. As notice to the Senators who may be \nholding those, they were not made last week. So I urge everyone to \ncheck the list and, if they have a hold on them, to notify Leader \nMcConnell and let Leader McConnell know what their objection is and \ncomply with the law they voted on.\n  Let me make these last ones. I wanted the record to be clear, these \nare the first ones we made that anybody voiced opposition to--anybody.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session for the purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 552, \nJane Branstetter Stranch, to be United States Circuit Judge for the \nSixth Circuit; the nomination be confirmed, the motions to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid on the table, no further motions be in \norder, the President be immediately notified of the Senate's action, \nand any statements relating to the nominee be printed at the \nappropriate place in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I might note for the record that this nominee was \nvoted out of committee by a vote of 15 to 4, with three Republican \nSenators supporting her in committee and four Republican Senators \nopposing her in the committee. The final vote was 15 to 4.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to executive session for \nthe purpose of consideration of Calendar No. 588, Philip Coyle, to be \nAssociate Director of the Office of Science and Technology; that the \nnomination be confirmed, the motions to reconsidered be considered made \nand laid upon the table, that no further motions be in order, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that any \nstatements relating to the nominee be printed at the appropriate place \nin the Record.\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. On that nominee, the vote out of committee was 19 to \n6--19 to 6. Five Republican colleagues supported this nominee and five \nRepublican Senators opposed this nominee. So it was a 5-to-5 split of \nthe Republicans on the committee to that nominee.\n  I ask unanimous consent the Senate proceed to executive session for \npurpose of consideration of Calendar No. 703, Benita Y. Pearson, to be \nUnited States District Judge for the Northern District of Ohio; that \nthe nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be considered \nmade and laid on the table, no further motions be in order, the \nPresident be immediately notified of the Senate's action, and that any \nstatements relating to the nominee be printed at the appropriate place \nin the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  I might note this was a voice vote in committee and Senator Sessions \ndid raise concerns in committee. So there was not a tally vote. No one \nrequested a rollcall vote on the nominee. It was noncontroversial \nenough that no one wanted to go on record with a rollcall vote, but we \nwanted to be very transparent and did want to indicate for the record \nthat Senator Sessions did raise concerns in committee about this \nnominee.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nexecutive session and consider Calendar No. 747, Ari Ne'eman, to be a \nmember of the National Council on Disability. I ask unanimous consent \nthat the nomination be confirmed, the motion to reconsider be \nconsidered made and laid upon the table, no further motions be in \norder, and the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction, and that any statements be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. COBURN. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. I should note that this is a nominee who--once again, \nit was a voice vote. Senator Coburn did indicate some concerns with \nthis nominee at the committee level.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have an appointment with the gentleman to have a \ndiscussion.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. We have now gone through the entire list, with the \nexception of about 10 judicial nominees on whom Senator Whitehouse will \nbe making the requests. I was hopeful that this week we would know who \nis holding those folks. We still do not know.\n  If I might make a suggestion, I am not confident it will be accepted, \nbut if the leadership of the Republican caucus wants to hold these \nnominees, Senator McConnell can put his name on all of them. Then the \npeople of America will know Senator McConnell is holding them and they \nwill see him as the leader of the Republicans and they can judge \naccordingly. But if Senator McConnell does not have objections to them \nand is not willing to put his name on them, then the people who have \nthe objections should put their names on the holds. We are going to \nbreak this bad habit.\n  I do want to make a note that there were four judges I made requests \non who inadvertently got on the list. They have been confirmed. We will \nprovide for the record those four names so they can be appropriately \nnoted. So instead of doing 69 today, we are only doing 65.\n  I thank the Senate for its indulgence. I thank Senator Coburn for \nremaining on the Senate floor. As I said, Senator Whitehouse will be \nback to make a few more motions. Let's break a bad habit that the \npeople of this country do not agree with.\n\n[[Page S3397]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak for \napproximately 15 minutes as in morning business for myself.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Jane Treat\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I pay tribute to one of my staff members \ntoday. She recently left. She had a child and is being a mom and a \ncivic activist. But she was a trusted adviser and, more than that, a \ndedicated patriot.\n  Jane Treat, who has been with me since the earliest parts of 2004, is \nleaving to become a full-time mother. It is hard to lose her. But I \nunderstand the attraction as well as the commitment for a much more \nimportant job. She first came to work for me as a volunteer, fresh off \nher studies at Patrick Henry College.\n  Since that time she has played a key role on my Judiciary Committee \nthrough many intense legislative battles. She spent many long days in \nthe Dirksen Building poring through briefing materials, preparing \nbackground notes for me, and negotiating on my behalf with other \noffices.\n  She was there during the Roberts and Alito hearings. For a time she \nalso served as my interim chief counsel on the committee, since I had \nno attorneys and she was a nonattorney as well, which was a rare \noccasion. Her dedication has never wavered. The fact is, she worked the \nday she delivered her first child. She prepared negotiations that day \nfor a bill that threatened the second amendment of the Constitution and \nhow it interacted with our veterans. We prevailed that day in no small \npart because of her efforts. One would be hard pressed to find anyone \nwho cherishes the Constitution and who knows its principles as well as \nJane Treat.\n  My legislative director jokes:\n\n       Although Jane did not actually write the Constitution, she \n     is its fiercest defender.\n\n  I would have to agree.\n  For the past 2 years, and after the birth of her daughter, Jane has \nmanaged a correspondence team that works in my office, ensuring that \nevery letter that reached my desk was treated with the utmost concern \nand professionalism. She cared for each constituent as if it were \nwritten to a close relative or a neighbor. In that, she has done a \nterrific job.\n  There is one last quality of Jane that I commend to everyone in the \nroom, and that is courage. Jane has a keen sense of right and wrong and \nwill not allow an injustice to stand, whether it is policy related or \nsimply human. She fights for everybody.\n  When she disagrees--I am laughing about this because when she \ndisagreed with me, I was always sure I would hear about it later. She \nwould come to the office and knock on the door, and say: Now we need to \nhave a talk. You were wrong.\n  Of course, I would remind her that she was not elected and I was and \nthere is some interpretation to the Constitution.\n  But the quality of having the courage to confront on things that are \nstrongly held beliefs is a great quality that built our country, and \nshe distinguishes herself in it. That is in contrast to what usually \nhappens in this town where we avoid difficult issues rather than \nconfront them.\n  True to her principles, she will turn her attention toward her new \ncommunity in Broken Arrow, OK, where she will be a full-time mom. It \nwill not be long, for sure, before she is volunteering again for a \ncause close to her heart.\n  Jane, we appreciate you. We thank you for your service, and we thank \nyou for the modeling of your behavior.\n\n\n                              Secret Holds\n\n  Now, I just want to spend a few minutes because what we have just \ngone through is a challenge to a process that has been ongoing for a \nlong period of time. The President knows I am in agreement with \nsunshine. As a matter of fact, the President and I created the \nTransparency and Accountability Act so that everything we do gets \npublished in terms of what we spend and how we spend it.\n  I agree we ought to be forthright with the reasons we hold \nindividuals. But let's talk about what a hold is. A hold is saying you \ndo not agree to a unanimous-consent request to pass out an individual. \nIn other words, what is a hold? What does it really say?\n  It really says, first of all, I either may have some very significant \nconcerns with this individual or I may want to study this individual \nfor a period of time and their record before I agree to it or I may \nwant to debate it, the qualifications of the individual.\n  I agree on the transparency. But I think it is very important that we \ngo back to say--and not necessarily attune the motive. But when I read \nthe sign about those who are being held now versus in the Bush \nadministration, I am reminded that there were over 100 U.S. attorneys \nand marshals and 50 judges at the same time who were blocked in \ncommittee so they could not even get to the floor at that time.\n  So it depends on where one takes the snapshot. There are lots of \nreasons to not agree to people being confirmed. I have no problem with \nstating my reasons, and I will publish my reasons. I do not have any \nproblem even publishing them. But I am not sure that we want to \nnecessarily impugn the motives of somebody who takes advantage of that.\n\n  I agree with the Senator from Missouri. I have no problems with \nputting it out in the open. But I did ask the question, and at some \npoint in time I think it would be wise for those who think that, that \nwe get a parliamentary ruling on what the rule really means because I \nthink there is some discussion. I do not doubt that the intent of what \nwas passed was exactly what we intended: to put it out there. But I \nthink the interpretation or how it may be read is subject to some \ndebate, and it would be great to have a Parliamentarian rule on that.\n  Finally, I would say, the other side of this issue, which comes back \nto things that are dear to my heart, is the fact that 94 percent of \neverything that passes in this body passes by that very process, \nunanimous consent.\n  Unanimous consent says: We will not have debate. We will not have an \namendment. Things will pass because nobody objects to it passing.\n  There is a real disadvantage for our country in that. The \ndisadvantage is that the American people never know what we are doing. \nThey do not get a hearing. They do not get to hear the policy debates \non both sides of the issue. It is good that we work some things out, \nbut if you watch the floor, what we know is 40 percent of the floor \ntime is spent in a quorum call.\n  The real issue we are fighting is the moving, is the reason the \nmajority leader does not move them, because it takes time to move them. \nRight? That is our problem. Time is our biggest enemy in the Senate. \nBut yet that is exactly what our Founders intended. They wanted it to \nbe very difficult to change what they had put in place, and they set in \nmotion this system that says: We are going to make things thoughtfully, \nunder full consideration, with open debate.\n  We hear our colleagues all the time say this is the greatest \ndeliberative body in the world. It is, but not all of the deliberation \ngoes on on the Senate floor. I have no doubt there are abuses on both \nsides. I do not know what the motives are.\n  When I hold somebody, I hold them because I think they are either not \nqualified for the job, I think they have a past record that would \nquestion their character, or I think, in fact, they will do a terrible \njob at the position even if they are qualified. And I have the right, \nas an individual Senator, to say I am not going to support that \nnomination. So I am all for moving and giving Presidents what they \nwant, but I am not for doing it without the debate and the \nconsideration that needs to be there.\n  So I am very supportive of people standing up and saying why they are \nholding up people. Through the courtesy of the Senator from Missouri, \nshe did not list one of the judges that I am sure she was going to ask \nunanimous consent on because I was the lone Senator in the Judiciary \nCommittee to vote against him. Now, I do not know who is holding him. \nBut the fact is, I do not think he is qualified. I want him to be \ndebated. I want to have a chance to inform the American people why I \nthink he should not be a circuit court judge. And that is my right.\n  To say we are just going to move him without a debate, without \nanything but\n\n[[Page S3398]]\n\na vote, I am not going to do that on people I think are not truly \nqualified. So it is not as straightforward as we think. I think we \nought to think about how the process is working, that the leaders do \nwork on this process. They move a lot of them forward. I understand the \nfrustration, and I would be giving the same speech if it was turned \naround. As a matter of fact, I have before.\n  So I concur with my colleagues. I think sunlight is a wonderful \nthing. I think there are times where we have the problem, and I will \ngive you three specific examples.\n  I publish all of my holds. Under the Emmett Till bill, I was \nimmediately accused of being a racist. I held the bill because I wanted \nit paid for, but as soon as I put out that I was holding the bill, I \nwas accused of being a racist. So there are reasons for people to work \nbehind the scenes to be able to work on things, to solve the problem \nwith their concerns, without it becoming public, so that you get the \nultimate action but do not impugn the integrity of people because they \nmay not agree.\n  So the potential of letting go of all of this idea that we cannot \nnegotiate before we come, and that we have to expose everything--what \nhappened was the special interest groups attacked me ferociously. I \nended up becoming best friends with a very significant individual who \ndrove that. What has happened today is we still have not done it \nbecause we did not put the money in to pay for it, which is what I \nwanted. There is still no special provision. There is still no action. \nWe passed it 2 years ago.\n  Next thing was the Veterans Caregiver Act.\n  I hated veterans because I thought we ought to pay for it, and I \nthought it ought to apply to every veteran who had that kind of injury \nwho served this country. But yet there was a ferocious attack by the \ninterest groups. I am willing to take that heat. That comes with the \njob. But it is certainly not fair to put yourself in that position. I \nunderstand why other Senators will not stand up and say every time why \nthey are holding a bill when we see that kind of attack coming at us.\n  Same thing on breast cancer. My sister-in-law, a cousin, all with \nbreast cancer, two-time cancer survivor myself, but I hated breast \ncancer patients. You can see why the idea of objecting to a unanimous \nconsent and then immediately putting it out there will end up with the \nattack of the special interest groups in this country, because you are \ntrying to make something better but your motives are impugned because \nyou don't agree with the special interest that is running the bill in \nthe first place or, in the case of a nomination, the special interest \nof the administration. They think this is the individual.\n  I don't defend. I put it out. I am willing to take that. But I \nunderstand that is not always the best way to get something \naccomplished, because you end up burning a lot of energy defending \nyourself on something you are totally innocent of in the first place. \nYou want a different result for a different reason, but that never gets \ncovered.\n  This morning has been great. It is interesting that we have had this \ndebate. My hope is we will have people who will stand up and speak and \nput up why they believe what they believe, fight for the principles \nthey believe in. I think I can defend my principles to the hilt. In \nfront of 100 commonsense folks in this country, I can get 85 of them to \ndecide with me. I am not afraid to do that. I am willing to be honest \nand transparent and straightforward. But the impugning of motives \nworries me, because it has nothing to do with not wanting President \nObama to have his people. It has to do, in many instances, with people \nwho are truly unqualified or truly are divergent on what their past has \nbeen versus what they say. Those are legitimate reasons to have debate \non individuals who are going to serve a function in this government.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, I rise to speak about an issue of great \nimportance, the foreclosure crisis, and the fears and frustrations of \nAmerican families who are at risk of losing their homes. Wherever I go \nin Minnesota, people tell me horror stories about losing their homes to \nforeclosure. I am sure the same is true of the Presiding Officer when \nhe goes home to Virginia.\n  The foreclosure crisis strikes at the heart of the American dream, \nthreatening Americans' life savings, family lives, and what they have \nachieved. The President took a big step in addressing this crisis when \nhe created the HAMP program which encourages mortgage servicers to \nmodify home loans to help people avoid foreclosure. But it is often \ndifficult to implement complex programs and HAMP is no exception. When \nHAMP works, it can be great. It can literally save people's homes. But \ntoo often homeowners who try to use the HAMP program find themselves \ninvolved in a bureaucratic process that is riddled with errors. These \nare errors that have serious consequences for people's lives.\n  Take a woman named Tecora who is a homeowner from south Minneapolis. \nIncidentally, she is someone who actually would have been helped by a \nConsumer Financial Protection Bureau. Several years ago, she bought a \nhouse with an option ARM or adjustable rate mortgage, where the \nmortgage payments increased dramatically over the years. Someone should \nhave told her that the teaser rate her lender offered her might be \nmisleading. Someone should have told her she might not be able to \nafford her mortgage payments in the future. But no one did.\n  A few years ago, Tecora's payments went up, and she fell behind on \nher mortgage. She entered HAMP hoping to save her home. But 7 months \nlater, she was told by her mortgage servicer that her file was closed \nbecause she had ``declined a final modification of her mortgage.'' Here \nis the only problem: She hadn't. And her mortgage servicer had no \nrecord of a conversation or correspondence with her. They had simply \nmarked the file as closed.\n  Tecora is lucky enough to be working with a wonderful nonprofit in \nMinneapolis, Twin Cities Habitat for Humanity. They are helping her to \nfight this mistake. But they have been working on this since March, and \nthe government resources that are available are not very helpful. In \nthe meantime, Tecora is constantly worried that she may lose her home \nbecause her mortgage servicer made a mistake.\n  Or take Barbara, a homeowner from Minneapolis who fell behind on her \nmortgage payments because her husband was laid off and her son got \ncancer, racking up huge medical bills. Talk about someone who might \nlose their home through no fault of her own. Her mortgage servicer \nclaimed she was not eligible for final mortgage modification, using \nincorrect information about her financial situation. When she pointed \nout there was a problem, her servicer told her there was nothing they \ncould do because ``once you have been denied for HAMP, you can't be \neligible again.''\n  Barbara is fighting this, but someone from the government should have \nher back.\n  Yesterday I filed an amendment with Senator Snowe and seven other \ncolleagues to fix the HAMP appeals process. People at risk of losing \ntheir homes are going through enough already. They should not be stuck \nfighting over mistakes with their servicers without a guarantee that \nsomeone will be on their side. Our amendment would create an office of \nthe homeowner advocate, modeled after the very successful Office of the \nTaxpayer Advocate within the IRS. The advocate's office would be an \nindependent unit within Treasury, charged with helping homeowners, \ntheir housing lawyers, and their housing counselors to resolve problems \nwith HAMP. The office would be temporary, lasting only as long as HAMP \ndoes. But while it exists, it would have a lot of authority to help \nhomeowners and families around the country. For the first time, \nhomeowners would be able to call an office in the government and know \nthat someone with the authority to fix a problem is actually fighting \nfor them.\n  Staff of this new advocate's office would be able to make sure that \nservicers obey the rules of HAMP or risk suffering consequences. \nPerhaps more importantly, opening a case with the advocate's office \nwould delay a servicer's ability to sell a person's house, giving the \noffice time to resolve the problem before it is too late. The director \nof the advocate's office would be someone who can truly fight for the \nrights of homeowners. He or she must have a background as an advocate \nfor\n\n[[Page S3399]]\n\nhomeowners and cannot have worked for either a mortgage servicer or the \nTreasury Department in the last 4 years. The director will also be able \nto help those of us in Congress understand what is going on in HAMP. \nBecause the office can collect data about the kinds of complaints and \nappeals that come in, the director will be in a good place to know what \nkinds of changes, both administrative and legislative, need to be made \nto the program and can describe them to the Treasury Department and to \nCongress.\n  Once a year the director will issue a formal report laying out in \ndetail all the problems people have had with HAMP and how they can be \nresolved and the way such problems could be prevented or better \nresolved in the future.\n\n  I know many of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle are \nunderstandably worried about the deficit. I want to be clear about one \nthing: This amendment includes no new appropriations. The advocate's \noffice will be funded with existing money that is set aside for HAMP \nadministrative costs.\n  I am pleased to say that our amendment is supported by the Treasury \nDepartment itself. In fact, yesterday it was featured on the White \nHouse's blog as one of ``The Good Guys,'' 10 simple, straightforward \namendments that would strengthen the already good Wall Street reform \nbill. It is a good guy, this thing.\n  My amendment is also supported by a large number of groups, including \nAmericans for Financial Reform, the Center for Responsible Lending, \nNational Consumer Law Center, the Leadership Conference on Civil and \nHuman Rights, Consumers Union, Consumer Federation of America, the \nService Employees International Union, and National Council of La Raza. \nI am particularly pleased to say that the amendment is also supported \nby several of the most important housing groups in my home State of \nMinnesota.\n  The idea behind the advocate's office is simple, but the impact could \nbe huge for all the people whom we are here to represent. Please join \nme in helping to ensure that HAMP actually works for families around \nthe country. We owe it to Tecora and Barbara and to all the working \nfamilies in our States and around the country.\n  I also rise to talk briefly about another amendment I am proposing to \nreform the credit rating industry. This industry is fraught with bad \npractices and perverse incentives. These incentives have produced \ninflated ratings which resulted in dangerous junk bonds getting AAA \nratings and thus being eligible for public pension funds. In fact, the \ncourt ruled last week that a suit on this issue brought by CalPERS, the \nCalifornia public employee pension system, can now move forward. \nCalPERS represents nearly 1.5 million California public employees, \nincluding thousands of teachers and public safety officers. CalPERS has \nbrought suit against the three biggest credit rating agencies--Moody's, \nStandard and Poor's, and Fitch. CalPERS states that the big three \nprovided ``wildly inaccurate and unreasonably high'' ratings to \nproducts that ended up in their investment fund. When these structured \nfinance products, including securitized subprime mortgages, tanked, \nCalPERS pension fund lost almost $1 billion. That is a loss of $1 \nbillion for California teachers, police officers, firefighters, and \npublic servants from their health benefits and retirement plans.\n  CalPERS is not the only group to take action. Private suits have been \nfiled in New York and the attorneys general of Connecticut and Ohio \nhave brought suit against the rating agencies on behalf of the people \nof their States. Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray filed suit last \nfall on behalf of five Ohio public employee retirement and pension \nfunds. Cordray said:\n\n       The rating agencies assured our employee public pension \n     funds that many of these mortgage-backed securities had the \n     highest ratings and the lowest risk. But they sold their \n     professional objectivity and integrity to the highest bidder. \n     The rating agencies' total disregard for the life's work of \n     ordinary Ohioans caused the collapse of our housing and \n     credit markets and is at the heart of what is wrong with Wall \n     Street today. The inflated ratings cost middle class families \n     in Ohio nearly half a billion dollars in retirement funds.\n\n  But this problem is not limited to California and Ohio and New York. \nIt has affected my home State of Minnesota. It has affected the \nPresiding Officer's home State of Virginia. It has affected every State \nin this Nation.\n  By now, I hope colleagues have heard the details of my amendment to \nreform the credit rating system. It would limit the pay-to-play model \ncurrently used in the credit rating industry. The amendment calls for \nan independent board to develop an assignment system to match the \nissuers of complex financial products with a qualified rating agency to \nprovide the product's initial rating. This system would apply only to \ninitial ratings. Issuers could seek a second or third rating from \nwhichever credit rater they prefer. But the initial rating would put a \ncheck on any subsequent rater which would be disinclined to provide an \ninflated pie-in-the-sky rating to a junk product.\n  By providing for an assignment process, the conflicts of interest \ndriving the system will be eliminated, and the assignment process will \nallow smaller rating agencies that are performing well to get more \nbusiness and rating agencies performing poorly to get less. This will \nhold rating agencies accountable for their work. It will incentivize \naccuracy and increase competition.\n\n  I know many of you agree with me, and the list of cosponsors on this \namendment is growing. Most recently, I was particularly pleased to have \nSenator Wicker join our effort. Of course, I am deeply grateful for the \nleadership of Senators Schumer and Nelson and the support of Senators \nWhitehouse, Brown, Murray, Bingaman, Merkley, Lautenberg, Shaheen, and \nCasey. Restoring integrity to the credit rating system will provide \nreal protection for working Americans.\n  Working people such as Tecora and Barbara are still reeling from the \neffects of this recession. Our unemployment rate still hangs near 10 \npercent. Working Americans together have lost nearly $4 trillion in the \nvalue of their homes and about $3 trillion in the loss of their \nretirement savings during this economic crisis.\n  The Wall Street reform bill before us goes a long way to prevent this \nfrom ever happening again. But there are a few places where it can be \nimproved. I hope my amendment creating the Office of the Homeowner \nAdvocate will help struggling Americans keep their homes. My amendment \ncalling for an overhaul of the credit rating agency industry will \nprotect millions of Americans from unprecedented losses in their \nsupposedly safe retirement investments. I ask my colleagues for their \nsupport on both of these critical amendments.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to talk about \nthree amendments pending on the legislation to reform Wall Street. I \nbegin by noting the spirit of bipartisanship which is present on this \nissue, and I think it is a very important sign. There is too little \nbipartisanship in this body, and from my travels through my State and \nelsewhere, I believe the American people are fed up--really sick and \ntired--with the kind of bickering which is present in the Senate. It \ntook a lot of public pressure and an obvious, great, and serious \nproblem to bring about this bipartisanship. But it is very important \nthat it be present in our efforts to reform Wall Street, and I hope it \nwill be a sign of things to come.\n  Some time ago, I introduced a bill which would change the decision of \nthe Supreme Court of the United States which held that aiders and \nabettors were not liable under the Securities Act. I have taken that \nbill and have submitted it as an amendment with quite a number of \ncosponsors. It is amendment No. 3776, to allow suits against aiders and \nabettors of Wall Street fraud, cosponsored by Senators Reed, Kaufman, \nDurbin, Harkin, Leahy, Levin, Menendez, Whitehouse, Franken, Feingold, \nand Merkley.\n  Prior to the decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in \nCentral Bank, back in 1994, supplemented by\n\n[[Page S3400]]\n\nthe Stoneridge Investment Partners decision, the law was that aiders \nand abettors were civilly liable for damages. It is a very odd \ncircumstance that aiders and abettors remain liable under the criminal \nlaw but are not liable under civil law, and this amendment would \nreinstate the civil liability for aiders and abettors. It is narrowly \ndrawn to apply only to individuals who knowingly provide substantial \nassistance to the primary violator. But where you have a stock offering \nand you have many parties who are working with the principal offerer, \nthe offerer can only carry out the fraud with the assistance of quite a \nnumber of people.\n  This amendment will reinstate what had been the law prior to the \nSupreme Court decisions I just mentioned. I think it is worth noting \nthat Senator Shelby had introduced similar legislation back in 2002.\n  The second amendment I wish to discuss briefly is amendment No. 3794, \nsubmitted by Senators Leahy, Grassley, Kaufman, and myself, which would \ndirect the Sentencing Commission to review and amend the sentencing \nguidelines for securities and financial institutions which engage in \nfraud, and the guidelines should reflect the intent of Congress that \npenalties for those offenses should be increased.\n  Earlier this week, on Tuesday, the criminal law subcommittee held a \nhearing attended by quite a number of very experienced people in the \nsecurities field and in criminology. The predominant view was, where \nyou have a fine imposed, it is not a deterrent at all. It is \ninsufficient as punishment for the perpetrator, but it is insufficient \nfor the gravity of the offense. A fine is simply incorporated as part \nof the cost of doing business, passed on to consumers.\n  The provision for a jail sentence would be an effective deterrent. I \nbase my own view on this subject from my experience as district \nattorney of Philadelphia, where I convicted many white-collar criminals \nand corrupt political figures, such as the chairman of the Philadelphia \nHousing Authority, the deputy commissioner of licenses and inspection, \nthe stadium coordinator--to name only a few.\n  If the perpetrators of fraud know they are going to be going to jail, \nit will have quite a different impact on their own conduct. One of the \nwitnesses testified to a celebrated case where an individual was fined \n$50 million and was willing to pay that but said, simultaneously with \nthe payment of the fine, if he had been charged criminally, he would \nhave fought it tooth and nail because of the concern about going to \njail.\n  The third amendment I wish to discuss is amendment No. 3806, which \nprovides that there should be a fiduciary duty for broker-dealers to \navoid conflicts of interest in investments and make such violations a \nFederal crime.\n  In the SEC complaint against Goldman Sachs, the gravamen was--and I \nacknowledge and am explicit that these are only allegations--that the \npackage of mortgages was put together and then was broken up into \nsecurities, and an individual who was involved in putting the package \ntogether, knowing the details, immediately hedged and sold short. That \nmeans he bet against those securities. He thought they would go down.\n  It is my view that the people who put that transaction together have \na fiduciary duty to tell the investors--even institutional investors--\nas to exactly what is going on; that they should know somebody is \nsimultaneously saying their professional judgment is that the value is \ngoing to go down.\n\n\n          Don't Give Miranda Warnings to Suspected Terrorists\n\n  Mr. President, recently Attorney General Holder testified before the \nJudiciary Committee in our periodic oversight proceedings and testified \nthat it was the policy of the Department of Justice to handle the \ninterrogation of suspects in terrorism cases on a case-by-case \nbasis. It is my view, which I expressed at the time I questioned \nAttorney General Holder, that that ought not to be the policy of the \nDepartment of Justice; that the policy of the Department of Justice \nought to be not to give Miranda warnings to people who are suspected of \nterrorism.\n\n  The Miranda warnings coming out of the decision handed down by the \nSupreme Court of the United States in 1966--and I recall it well. I was \nin my first year as district attorney in Philadelphia at the time, and \nit was quite a jolt to the criminal justice system that my office \nprepared the details to have a card for the police officers by the end \nof the week, because they interrogate a great many suspects. But the \nMiranda warnings require the interrogator to advise an individual that \nhe has the right to remain silent; secondly, that anything he says can \nand will be used against him; third, that he has the right to an \nattorney, and that if he wants to stop answering questions at any time \nin the sequence, he can.\n  When a suspect in a terrorism case is being questioned, there are \nissues which are much more important than the conviction of that \nindividual. The important thing is to gain information, find out who \nmay be involved, and gather intelligence to prevent future acts of \nterrorists. I saw this in some detail during my tenure as chairman of \nthe Intelligence Committee back in the 104th Congress. The recent \napprehension of the Times Square bomber, who had the bomb positioned to \nblow up in Times Square and injure many people is illustrative, and the \ninformation he gave without Miranda warnings. He was Mirandized, as I \nunderstand it from the media reports at some point, but the information \nhe has given has been very valuable in linking possible coconspirators \nto the Taliban in Pakistan.\n  It is not widely understood, but the only consequence of not giving \nMiranda warnings is that any statements made by the suspect may not be \nintroduced in a criminal trial in a U.S. court. But in the case of the \nTimes Square bomber, as in the case of the Christmas bomber, there was \nsufficient evidence to move ahead with the convictions. But even if \nthat were not so, the value of getting intelligence information vastly \noutweighs the interests of convicting the individual in that specific \ncase. Even in that case, there is the potential alternative of being \ntried by a military commission where the Miranda rules do not apply. So \nit is my strong recommendation to the Department of Justice, as I had \ndiscussed it with Attorney General Holder, as I have communicated it to \nthe FBI Director Bob Mueller, that the policy be changed so that it is \nnot optional with an interrogator to make a decision on a case-by-case \nbasis because the interrogator may make a mistake and decide that this \nis a case where the Miranda warnings ought to be given, and that may \nstop the individual from providing information.\n  Some of the Senators at our Judiciary Committee hearing were of the \nopinion that the chances of getting information were enhanced by giving \nthe Miranda warnings, and I think that is not only counterintuitive--\nnot what you would expect--but contrary to experience; that the \nlikelihood of a person saying he won't talk if he is advised that he \nhas a constitutional right not to, and then advised that he has a right \nto counsel, and then advised he will have counsel provided if he \ndoesn't have counsel of his own, and once counsel are in the case, \ntheir obligation is to protect the interests of their client. That \ndecision more likely than not will be to remain silent so the \nindividual is not harmed with a potential criminal prosecution. I think \nthe policy of the Department of Justice ought to be to have an absolute \nrule: No Miranda warnings in cases of persons suspected of terrorism.\n  There is some suggestion of legislation on this point. I think that \nraises constitutional issues of separation of power, and what ought to \nbe done is the policy ought to be established now by the Department as \nan absolute rule not to give Miranda warnings to those suspected of \nterrorism.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I take the floor today to talk about an \namendment which I have been working on with Senator Scott Brown of \nMassachusetts. I am very fortunate to have Senator Brown's help, \ninsight, and advice because of his extensive experience not only as a \npublic servant but as a member of the Massachusetts National Guard. As \na lawyer, as a company commander, and as someone who has served in \nvarious capacities within the Guard, Scott Brown knows from firsthand \nexperience that young troops\n\n[[Page S3401]]\n\nparticularly, men and women of our Armed Forces, can be exploited by \nunscrupulous business practices, and that it is essential when we \ncreate a Consumer Financial Protection Agency that there be a \nparticular and explicit liaison for military issues.\n  Many of these young men and women are not in their home towns. In the \ncontext of today's operations, they are returning from duty in Iraq or \nAfghanistan. They have not been spending a lot of money in Afghanistan \nbecause there is not a lot to buy, and they come home and they want to \nbuy a new car or they want to do something, and they can be exploited. \nThat exploitation is particularly hard to bear when it is at the \nexpense of a young person who is risking their life in service to his \ncountry.\n  Senator Brown and I are working on a joint amendment which would \ncreate an office of military liaison within the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau. The office would educate and empower servicemembers \nand their families to make better and more informed decisions, and it \nwould work closely with existing personnel with the Department of \nDefense and the particular services so there is not only a place to go \nwith a complaint, but also proactive information to avoid some of these \nmissteps.\n  It would help monitor and respond to complaints by servicemembers and \ntheir families, and it would also coordinate efforts among Federal and \nState agencies, and that I think is absolutely critical. You have local \ninsurance regulators, you have local attorneys general, you have the \nBetter Business Bureau, you have the Department of Defense offices. We \nhave all of these things, but often, particularly for a young soldier, \nwhere to go and get comprehensive one-stop help is hard to figure out. \nMany times they will approach an office and they will be told, well, \nyou have a good case but we don't do that, and they are sent away. \nGiven the time and commitment they have to devote to their service, \nthis is another burden they have to bear, and we hope we can reduce \nthis burden.\n  Senator Brown and I are working to develop the details of this \noffice. I think it is absolutely necessary.\n  We have looked at--and I have been looking at this problem for years \nnow, and communicating with the Department of Defense, Secretary Gates, \nand others at the Department of the Treasury about how to protect \nbetter our service men and women. We think this initiative will help us \nin that regard.\n  The Department of Defense and the Government Accountability Office \nhave found that servicemembers are particularly vulnerable to expensive \nand often abusive products. I will take off my Senate hat and put on my \nold company commander hat in a paratrooper company. You have 18- and \n19-year-old men and women. They receive an enlistment bonus of \nsometimes $20,000. They don't have a home. They have bought the most \nexpensive stereo equipment they already can buy. What they are looking \nfor is something they can call their own, and usually that is a big, \nexpensive car or truck. When they walk in the door, I think some of \nthese dealers are aware of their vulnerability: lack of information, \nthe short time they are back from an overseas deployment, the time \nbefore they are moving on to a deployment. So they are vulnerable. They \nare also vulnerable in another sense, not just with respect to products \nbut there are so many families now where one of the spouses is in the \nmilitary and the other spouse is in the military, and that other spouse \nis deployed overseas. So you have a member of the U.S. military with \nchildren, with a father or mother overseas, and they are struggling. \nEven with the pay they receive at the end of the month, it is a tough \ngo. They are looking for good deals. There are too many people out \nthere who are looking for people who are vulnerable to good deals. That \nis the reality today in the military. It is a different military force \nin terms of Operation TEMPO where I served where you were rather \nstabilized in one area for 3 years at least and then moved to another. \nNow you have families where the husband returns and 3 months later the \nwife deploys. That is a huge burden on the children, but it creates a \nkind of uncertainty and turmoil where financial problems are much more \nlikely to occur. That is another factor of vulnerability, and we have \nto recognize that.\n  We also understand too that some of the more unscrupulous operators \nout there know these soldiers are getting steady paychecks, but they \nmight not last all the way through the month. So they are a good sort \nof subject for some of these ploys. They have steady pay. You can go \nafter them legally to try to attempt to do something, subject to the \nServicemembers Civil Service Relief Act and all the other laws we try \nto protect them with. This is a target population in some respects, I \nhesitate to say, but unfortunately I think it is true.\n  The Under Secretary of Defense Clifford Stanley, who has been charged \nto be the champion for quality of life for protecting service families, \nhas stated recently: ``The personal financial readiness of our troops \nand families equates to mission readiness.'' He reports that 72 percent \nof military financial counselors surveyed--these are the individuals at \nDOT, all the personnel whose job is to talk to troops about their well-\nbeing--72 percent surveyed had counseled servicemembers on auto lending \nabuses in the past 6 months. So this is not an isolated incident in one \npart of the country; this is across the country, across the Department \nof Defense, and that is a significant situation.\n  It is not just auto abuses. Payday loans, for example. As I said, \nanybody who is working around a military base knows that come the end \nof the month, that paycheck will probably be deposited into the \nchecking account, so that is a good bet to lend money to. But the \ninterest rates they are lending at, sometimes the APR is up to 800 to \n900 percent. That is staggering. But they are doing it, and they are \ndoing it to young soldiers who have their heads, some of them, looking \nforward to a deployment. Some of them have not even gotten over the \nlast deployment, and we have to be conscious of that.\n  Rent-to-own loans. This is where you go to a shop and you say I would \nlike to rent a TV for 30 days because you am deploying in 45 days. Then \nyou don't deploy so you keep it, and in some cases you end up paying \ntwo to three times the retail price of the appliance. At least \nindividual soldiers have to be informed of those practices and know \nabout it. We have to be sure they are getting that information.\n  Refund anticipation loan is a classic. You are going to get your tax \nrefund and if you let us give you a loan right now, we will take that \ntax refund. These turn out in some cases to have APRs reaching as high \nas 250 percent as you are borrowing against your prospective tax \nrefund.\n  Automobile title pawns. Short-term loans are given to soldiers--and \nagain, as a company commander, I never--well, let me see. It was more \ncommon to see a soldier in debt than to see a soldier investing in \nbonds and safe investments. It is the nature of being 18 years old, \nwith some money and the feeling that you have to spend it. But \nautomobile title pawns, short-term loans with very high interest rates \nto give the title of their car to the lender as collateral. Again, the \nwhole notion to some youngsters in the military about what is a title, \nwhat is collateral, when they are looking at $2,000 or $3,000 on the \ntable, that is only details. But when the time comes to pay the loan, \nthey don't, and they lose their $25,000, $30,000 car or truck, and then \nit is a reality.\n  I think we have to be conscious of this. All of this is compelling in \nthe abstract. It becomes even more compelling when you listen to the \nstories of individual soldiers.\n  Three years ago, Army SPC Jennifer Howard bought a car while she was \nstationed at Fort Riley, KS. As it turns out, the dealership that \narranged her financing charged her for features on the car that she \nnever got, such as a Moon roof and alloy wheels. You may say to \nyourself, how could anybody be so gullible? If you are a young soldier \nwho just got back or is getting ready to go and you look at a shiny car \nand you know you didn't order the alloy wheels and Moon roof but you \nare not going to take time checking the manifest to see what you are \ncharged with--that has been my experience. A dealer should know that, \nbut apparently, in this case, they charged her anyway.\n  She says:\n\n       The dealership knows that we're busy, we're tired. We don't \n     take the time, because\n\n[[Page S3402]]\n\n     we don't have a lot of time. It's like get in, get out, do \n     what we got to do. If we get taken advantage of later we'll \n     deal with it then.\n\n  SGT Diann Traina bought her car from a dealership that didn't \nactually own it. When it was repossessed, she was stuck with a $10,000 \nbill. She said:\n\n       Trying to concentrate on my job and the mission in Iraq and \n     then trying to figure out stuff that's going on at home, it \n     was really stressful.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       If there's some type of regulation or agency that's out \n     there to back you up, you know who to go to to complain about \n     somebody if you're experiencing a problem.\n\n  That is what we want to do--coordinate these activities through a \nmilitary liaison at a consumer financial protection agency. We want to \ndo that because it is the right thing to do and because if we cannot \nprotect the men and women who are protecting us, then we have to ask \nseriously whether we are doing our job. I know they are doing their \njob.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Mexico is recognized.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I understand that today is set aside \njust for debate on amendments and on the bill. I certainly understand \nthat, and I, accordingly, will not call up my amendment today.\n  I do want to talk about an amendment I have filed--amendment No. \n3892--so that I can put my colleagues on notice about this amendment \nand the importance of it. This amendment has a straightforward goal. It \nis to protect the existing legal structures that ensure that \nelectricity and natural gas rates consumers pay will continue to be \njust and reasonable and free from manipulation.\n  I am joined in the amendment by a strong bipartisan group of \ncosponsors, Senators who, like me, have worked hard over the years to \nstrengthen consumer protections in this area of electricity and natural \ngas, who have worked cooperatively with me and others on the Energy \nPolicy Act of 2005 to close the so-called Enron loophole.\n  I want to particularly express my appreciation to Senator Murkowski, \nwho is ranking member on the Energy Committee that I am privileged to \nchair; Senator Reid of Nevada, who is cosponsoring the amendment, and \nSenators Brownback, Cantwell, Cornyn, Wyden, and Corker. All of these \nSenators have cosponsored the amendment we filed last night. I am \ngrateful for their support and the hard work of their staffs in \ndeveloping the amendment.\n  The bill currently before the Senate has several important \nobjectives. It improves accountability in the financial system. It \nprovides much needed protections for American consumers of financial \nservices. It also expands the scope of the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission's authority with respect to regulating commodity markets. I \nsupport all of these objectives. I am very glad to see them included in \nthis bill.\n  However, I believe a small but vital addition to the bill is needed \nto ensure that America's consumers of energy products are adequately \nprotected, and that is the issue the amendment I am discussing \naddresses.\n  We need to be sure that both under existing law and under the \nexpanded authority being given to the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission in this bill, there is no compromise of the role the Federal \nEnergy Regulatory Commission is expected to perform and the role our \nState public utility commissions are expected to perform to regulate \nrates and terms with respect to electricity and natural gas markets.\n  Without this amendment, the bill before us could inadvertently \nprevent those agencies from exercising their authority and their \nresponsibility to ensure just and reasonable rates for electricity and \nnatural gas consumers. Without this amendment, the Federal Energy \nRegulatory Commission's ability to exercise antimanipulation authority \ncould be called into question. These are enforcement tools to protect \nconsumers. Congress granted them to the FERC in 2005 as a direct \nresponse to Enron's manipulation of markets in California and the West.\n  The amendment offers a solution that I believe is consistent with the \nphilosophy of consumer protection that underlies other parts of the \nbill before us. The effect is simple: The amendment preserves the \nauthority of both FERC and the States to ensure that electricity and \nnatural gas rates are just and reasonable. Direct examination of prices \nis central to each of those agency's mission. In FERC's case, this \nauthority is longstanding; it was established over 70 years ago.\n  Without this amendment, a critical check on energy prices may be \nlost. That is true for two connected reasons:\n  First, the CFTC's so-called ``exclusive jurisdiction,'' which is in \nthe Commodity Exchange Act, could be interpreted to operate to prevent \nFERC and State public utility commissions from acting where their \njurisdictions intersect the Commodity Futures Trading Commission's \njurisdiction.\n  Second, the CFTC's regulatory mission differs significantly from that \nof the FERC and from that of the State public utility commissions. The \nCFTC's mission is to protect market participants and to promote fair \nand orderly trading on those markets. It doesn't directly examine \ncommodity prices in these markets. It does not consider the \nreasonableness of rates charged to consumers.\n  While properly functioning futures markets are important, the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission cannot and does not have the \nauthority or responsibility to provide protections that are provided by \nthe Federal Energy Regulatory Commission and the State public utility \ncommissions under their respective authority.\n  As I have said, I support the bill generally. I believe it is \nessential to ensuring that consumers are protected. However, both I and \nmy cosponsors on the amendment strongly believe it is necessary to \npreserve existing consumer protections that may otherwise be lost.\n  It is a simple, straightforward, tailored amendment that does not \ncreate loopholes in jurisdiction. It does nothing to diminish the \nability of the CFTC to regulate commodity exchanges such as NYMEX or to \nrequire public disclosure of swaps or any other authority they have to \nregulate the mechanics of commodity markets, including those that trade \nenergy commodities.\n  Once again, I thank my cosponsors for working to develop this \namendment. I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. At the \nappropriate time, I will seek to call the amendment up and have it \nvoted on by the Senate.\n  Seeing no other Senator seeking recognition, I suggest the absence of \na quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                     Emergency Supplemental Funding\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I wish to speak on a couple of \nsubjects. The first is to express my regret that the supplemental \nfunding to help Rhode Island in the wake of its unprecedented, historic \nflooding was stopped on the floor today by a Republican objection. I \nwould have hoped that when a true emergency happened in somebody's home \nState, with a Presidential disaster declaration, and Senators were \nworking to remedy that, the traditional deference for emergency \nspending would be appropriate.\n  Senator Reed, as the senior Senator and a member of the \nAppropriations Committee, is the leader on this issue. He and I will \ncontinue to work to get this done for Rhode Island. It is regrettable \nthat conditions on the Senate floor are such that emergency spending--\nwhile we still have people out of their homes, flood damage, \nunprecedented in Rhode Island's history--is not something on which we \nsimply could have agreed.\n  There are floods in other States, and I assume similar rules will \napply when they come forward.\n\n\n                       Exorbitant Interest Rates\n\n  The second issue I wish to mention, since I see the distinguished \nchairman of the Banking Committee, is I continue to hope for and argue \nfor the amendment I have proposed that will do something very helpful \nfor something that bedevils constituents in every single one of our \nStates, which is exorbitant, ridiculous interest rates.\n  Every day in the mail in every one of our States people are opening \nofferings from the big credit card companies;\n\n[[Page S3403]]\n\nproposals that, particularly when certain tricks or traps are \ntriggered, kick them into 30 percent or higher interest rates.\n  It was not too long ago in all of our lifetimes that a solicitation \nsuch as that would have been a matter to bring to the attention of the \nauthorities in our States because it would have been illegal under \nState law to charge that kind of reprehensible interest rate.\n  We as a Congress never decided we were going to overrule all those \nState laws; State laws that have existed since the founding of the \nRepublic, a tradition of interest rate regulation that in our culture \ngoes back to the Code of Hammurabi, goes back to Roman law. We never \ndecided as a Congress: Oh, we are not going to allow States to protect \ntheir consumers any longer, protect their citizens any longer against \nexorbitant interest rates.\n  It happened in a strange, backhanded, almost inadvertent way. It \nbegan with a statute in 1863 that said a transaction was governed by \nlaw based on where it was located. In 1863, there was not a lot of \ninterstate banking. So there did not need to be a lot of discussion \nabout what ``located'' meant. But by 1978, interstate banking was \nfairly common. The question came to the Supreme Court, what that word \n``located'' in that Civil War statute meant.\n  In a very unheralded decision at the time, a decision that did not \nappear to be of any significant consequence, the U.S. Supreme Court \nsaid: If you have a bank located in one State and a consumer located in \nanother State, the law is going to be the State of the bank. It had to \nbe one or the other. They chose the State of the bank. The Marquette \ndecision it was called. It involved the Presiding Officer's State, \nMinnesota. The decision said it is going to be the bank.\n  It did not seem very controversial. Why not? The problem was that the \nbanking industry began to figure out that there was a loophole. They \nbegan to figure out if they could go to the States with the worst \nconsumer protection laws in the country or if they could go to a \nfriendly Governor and say: Hey, I will make you a deal; you clear out \nyour consumer protection laws, and we will come and we will locate a \nbig, high-rise business full of call center people in your State--from \nthat State, they could operate nationally.\n  Because of this funny 1978 decision from an 1863 law, bit by bit all \nof the constitutional Federalist States rights protections, where \nsovereign States have the right to protect their own citizens against \noutrageous and exorbitant interest rates, became ineffectual. We never \ndecided that as a Congress. If we had that debate, I will venture that \nit would have gone the other way. It would be preposterous for us as a \nCongress to look out across America and say: OK, we are going to pass a \nlaw that says that the worst State for consumer protection regulation \nis going to be the State that governs. Obviously, it would create a \nrace to the bottom. Obviously, it would completely disenfranchise home \nStates trying to protect their own citizens from States a country away \nthat, frankly, couldn't care less.\n  A Rhode Island consumer being victimized is not the problem of the \nState of South Dakota. It just is not. We would never have passed that \nlaw. It would have been an outrageous law to have passed. Yet because \nof this funny, quirky Supreme Court decision, that is the way the law \nin practice developed because smart bank lawyers figured out this trick \nand have taken advantage of it.\n  It is not just consumers who are getting clobbered as a result. It is \nalso unfair to local banks. A Rhode Island bank is under Rhode Island \ninterest rate laws. But an out-of-State bank, the big Wall Street banks \nwith their big credit card subsidiaries, can play by their own rules, \nby the worst rules in the country. A Rhode Island bank, a Connecticut \nbank, a Minnesota bank--they have to play by local rules. It is not \nfair to local lenders to have this discrepancy, because it is bad for \nconsumers, because consumers all across this country are paying \ninterest rates now that would have been illegal just two or three \ndecades ago, because it is anticompetitive, because it allows the \nbiggest banks to compete unfairly against local community banks, Main \nStreet banks, disadvantaged against these big Wall Street monsters \nbecause nobody in Congress ever made a decision nor would we have made \na decision that this was OK. It is time we closed this loophole.\n  I look forward to when we return to have the chance to get a vote on \nthat amendment. I very much hope it will be a bipartisan vote because \nthe principles that the Republican Party has espoused about local \ncontrol, States rights, protecting local institutions against big, out-\nof-State national entities, federalism, and our common interests across \nthis floor in consumer protection all suggest that it is the kind of \nthing that should not divide us Republican against Democrat. This is \nclosing a loophole that never should have existed, that we never would \nhave voted for if we had the chance to vote for it, and that has \nresulted in immense harm to the public of all of our States as a result \nof these exorbitant interest rates.\n  As I said, the interest rate solicitation that is landing in \nMinnesota today, that is landing in Connecticut today, and that is \nlanding in Rhode Island today would have been a matter to bring to the \nauthorities but for this loophole.\n\n\n                              Nominations\n\n  The final issue I wish to talk about--I guess every Member on the \nother side of the aisle has left town, so there is no Republican in \nWashington, DC, to come and object to the unanimous consent request I \nwould like to offer for the stalled nominees.\n  There are now over 100 names on the Executive Calendar, which is the \nlist of everybody who is pending awaiting confirmation by the Senate. \nAt a similar time in President Bush's administration, the number was \n20. Those numbers do go up and down, as our Republican friends have \nsaid. But just a few days ago, the number was over 80, and the number \nat the equivalent time in President Bush's administration was 8.\n  There is a clear, systemic attack on the Obama administration's \nability to staff its administration and, thus, govern. What is enabling \nit is the fact that you do not have to have a reason to oppose a \nnominee. Why don't you have to have a reason? You don't have to have a \nreason because you can do it secretly. Nobody even knows that it is you \nopposing the nominee. If you want to have a systemic attack on a \nPresident's ability to govern, what a good thing a secret hold on the \nPresident's nominees is.\n  It has always been around, but it has been abused to a point where we \nneed to be rid of it. We need to be rid of it. The right of a Senator \nto hold a nominee should be protected, but that Senator should have to \nstand and say that they are doing it. If they do not have a good enough \nreason to hold a nominee that they are willing to stand up and disclose \nit, then that is, frankly, not a legitimate hold. The secret holds have \nto end.\n  The situation we are in right now, because there is a Senate rule on \npoint, is that the list of nominees has been read through. Great credit \nis due Senator McCaskill who has read through the bulk of these--76 of \nthem I think she has been through in the first round. We asked for \nunanimous consent on all those nominees. We received objections. I \nreceived an objection on a nominee that I asked for from a Senator who \nhad voted for that nominee in committee. He voted for the nominee in \ncommittee but came to the floor and objected. The nominee had cleared \nthe Judiciary Committee with zero opposition, and yet on the floor, \nheld and held and held, anonymously--secretly.\n\n  Under the Senate rules, when you have asked for unanimous consent and \nyou have had that objection, you have 6 days to come clean on your \nhold. Do you know how many Republican Senators followed that rule? One \ndid. One did. Senator Coburn of Oklahoma disclosed he had been holding \nsix or seven appointees. That still leaves 100 on the Senate floor \nright now on the Executive Calendar.\n  We began early this morning calling them up to see if those holds \nwere still there because after 6 days, you are either supposed to have \ndisclosed it or relinquished it. Sure enough, we kept on getting \nobjection and objection and objection.\n  So only two things can be true: Either they are just flagrantly \nviolating the rule--what are we going to do?\n\n[[Page S3404]]\n\nThere is no enforcement mechanism built into the rule. They are just \nsaying: Make us follow the rule. You can't make us, so we are not going \nto follow it. We know it is a rule--we voted for it, and it passed with \nenormous bipartisan support. It is a rule of the Senate, but we just \nchoose not to follow it because we get too much advantage out of secret \nholds. Senate rules don't really apply to us unless you can make us \nfollow them.\n  That is a sad place for the Senate to be, if that is where we are on \nthis issue. But there are only two alternatives. The other one is that \nthey still have holds, but it is not a hold by the same Senator who had \nthe hold when the unanimous consent was asked for and, therefore, he \nhas, under the rule, relinquished his hold. But what he has done is \ngone and found another Senator and gotten that other Senator to take up \nthe hold for him. That has been called a couple of things on the Senate \nfloor. It has been called the hold switcheroo.\n  For those of us who are prosecutors, it looks a lot like money \nlaundering. It is hold laundering. The person who has the real \nprincipal and interest with the hold has gotten someone else to aid and \nabet their scheme to interrupt the process of nominations and to \nviolate the rules by taking on the hold for them and allowing them to \ndodge the rule. That is not a great way of doing business either.\n  So whether we have a direct and outright willful violation of the \nSenate rules--massive violation of the Senate rules--or a scheme to \nhold-launder--to get people to aid and abet you in your secret hold and \ndodge the rule that way--neither is a great situation. So we need to \nfix the rules so this cannot continue. But it is a sad reflection on \nthe use of the secret hold that we are in a circumstance now where the \nonly two possible sets of facts are those two. It just plain isn't \nright.\n  If you are here as a Senator, you should follow the rules of the \nSenate. If you are not prepared to do that, find something else to do. \nThere are plenty of people who would love to serve here. To find \nanother Senator to put a sham hold in to protect your hold so that you \ncan dodge this rule is, frankly, unscrupulous. That is something that, \nif you could figure out who it was and you could get them in front of a \njury and make that case, oh boy. But we don't have the enforcement \nmechanism. So we have to continue.\n  But let me tell you who I was going to be asking for. There are two \njudges for the Fourth Circuit, Albert Diaz and James Wynn. They are a \nRepublican and a Democrat. They are paired for appointment. They \ncleared the Judiciary Committee with only one opposing vote. One was \nunanimous and the other was everybody but one. They have been on the \ncalendar now for weeks, and I would like to ask unanimous consent, but \nI am informed that because there are no Senate Republicans in \nWashington I am unable to do that right now. But they have been on the \ncalendar for many weeks and there is no reason for them not to be \nconfirmed.\n  The following judicial candidates, or nominees for a judgeship, are \nalso pending: Jon E. DeGuilo to be a U.S. district judge for the \nNorthern District of Indiana; Audrey Goldstein Fleissig to be a U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Eastern District of Missouri; Lucy Haeran Koh to \nbe a U.S. district judge for the Northern District of California; Tanya \nWalton Pratt to be a U.S. district judge for the Southern District of \nIndiana; Jane E. Magnus-Stinson to be a U.S. district judge for the \nSouthern District of Indiana; Brian Anthony Jackson to be a U.S. \ndistrict judge for the Middle District of Louisiana; Elizabeth Erny \nFoote to be a U.S. district judge for the Western District of \nLouisiana; Mark A. Goldsmith to be a U.S. district judge for the \nEastern District of Michigan; Marc T. Treadwill to be a U.S. district \njudge for the Middle District of Georgia; Josephine Staton Tucker to be \na U.S. district judge for the Central District of California; Gary \nScott Feinerman to be a U.S. district judge for the Northern District \nof Illinois; and Sharon Johnson Coleman to be a U.S. district judge for \nthe Northern District of Illinois.\n  All of these candidates are waiting. They are on the calendar, all \npending, all cleared with either unanimous or very strong votes out of \nthe Judiciary Committee, and all blocked. Yet I believe all are \nsupported by Republican Senators from their home States. These are all \ndistrict judges.\n  This is a judge who sits in a local district within a State. These \nare not people who are setting national policy. These are people who \nare handling local trials, local motions practice, local Federal court \nlitigation.\n  If you have the support of your two home Senators, and if you have \ncleared the Judiciary Committee, that ought to be pretty simple. That \nought to be pretty simple. But they are being held, and they are being \nheld for a reason. They are being held because, if the Republicans can \nforce the Democrats to burn floor time, it takes floor time away from \nthe work we need to do to rebuild our economy. It takes floor time away \nfrom the work we need to do to clean up Wall Street. It takes floor \ntime away from the bills we need to pass to fund our troops overseas. \nIt takes floor time away from our ability to do the work of governing. \nIt is obstruction, pure and simple.\n  Because there are only so many hours in a day, there are only so many \ndays in a week, and only so many weeks in a month, it is a zero sum \ngame. You take time and make us spend it on these judges, and it is \ntime we can't spend on floor work on the necessary legislation we have \nto get through. That is why we see these strange votes where we have \ncloture demanded and all that procedure; and then when the vote is \nfinally taken we have 98 to 0 or where we have had 100 to 0. Why go \nthrough all that trouble when we end on a vote of 98 to 0 or 100 to 0? \nIt is because there are ulterior motives. It is to burn the floor time \nof the Senate and to give the leader less and less time to accomplish \nthe things that we need to accomplish.\n  So I can go through many other names, but I will not do that now. I \nwill await the return of a Republican Member of the Senate to \nWashington so that somebody can be on the floor of the Senate to either \nobject or not object to these nominees. I would hope at this point that \nwe will find they do not object. That would be consistent with the \nrule.\n  If they have been on the calendar this long, if they have had their \nunanimous consent objected to, if the 6 days have run and if nobody has \ncome up and actually said they have a hold on that person, then a \nunanimous consent ought to pass. Under the rule, a unanimous consent \nought to pass. If it doesn't, it is a sign that they are either flatout \nviolating the rule or that they have done this hold laundering scheme \nwith a colleague to dodge out from under the rule. I think neither is \ncredible and we need to work our way through this process. So on the \nnext possible occasion, I will be doing that.\n  I thank the Presiding Officer for his courtesy and his time. I yield \nthe floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3404-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, this Sunday, May 9, is Mothers Day in the \nUnited States.\n  Many European nations have long observed ``Mothering Sundays,'' which \nare also part of the liturgical calendar in several Christian \ndenominations. Catholics observe Laetare Sunday, the fourth Sunday in \nLent, in honor of the Virgin Mary and the ``mother'' church. Some \nhistorians believe the tradition of sending flowers on Mothers Day grew \nout of the practice of allowing children who worked in large houses \nthat day off to visit their families. The children would pick \nwildflowers to take to their mothers on their way home for the visit. \nThe ancient Greeks celebrated the Vernal Equinox with a springtime \nfestival devoted to Cybele,\n\n[[Page S3405]]\n\na mother of many Greek gods. The ancient Romans dedicated the March \nholiday Matronalia to Juno, mother of the gods, and gave gifts to \nmothers on that day.\n  In the United States, the origins of Mothers Day are rooted deep in \nthe West Virginia hills. Anna Jarvis, the daughter of Ann Maria Reeves \nJarvis, was born in Webster, WV, on May 1, 1864. Her family moved to \nGrafton during her childhood. On May 12, 1907, 2 years after her \nmother's death, Anna Jarvis held a memorial service to honor her \nmother's memory. From that small event began Anna Jarvis' eventually \nsuccessful campaign to institute ``Mothers Day'' as a recognized U.S. \nholiday.\n  Today, the International Mother's Day Shrine, located in Grafton, \ncontinues to commemorate Anna Jarvis' accomplishment. Yet there are \nmothers who will not receive cards or flowers, or enjoy a Mothers Day \nbrunch with their husbands and children. In Montcoal, WV, there are 29 \nfamilies who are grieving the loss of sons, husbands, brothers, and \nfriends. The Nation grieves with them, but that is little comfort for \nthose mothers who will wake on the second Sunday in May to quiet houses \nand silent phones. Mothers Day holds little comfort for the wives and \nmothers who must now get on with raising children and paying bills \nalone following this tragic event.\n  Mothers Day is a lonely day as well for the ``Gold Star'' mothers, \nwives and families of soldiers lost to battle in Iraq and Afghanistan. \nFirst used in World War I, service flags--a blue star on a white \nbackground, surrounded by a red border--are hung to signify that the \nfamily has a loved one overseas in harm's way. Should the awful news \narrive that their loved one had lost his or her life, a gold star \nreplaces the blue star, signaling the supreme sacrifice that has been \nmade.\n  Miners' mothers and soldiers' mothers, as well as the mothers of \nanyone facing dangerous working conditions on a daily basis, know well \nthe constant stress and tension of having a dearly loved child in \nharm's way. Every day is a long, silent, chanting prayer: ``Please, \nGod, keep my child safe and bring him home to me.''\n  Tragedy reminds us just how much mothers care, and how much their \nchildren mean to them. This Mothers Day, we once again have an \nopportunity to thank our mothers for that loving care, and to thank all \nmothers for the great generosity of spirit that marks a caring mother.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3405-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TIMES SQUARE BOMBING ATTEMPT\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, last weekend's close call is a wake-up call. \nThe attempt to bomb New York City's Times Square should remind us both \nof the vigilance we must maintain to keep Americans safe, and the \ntriviality of political fingerpointing.\n  I first want to once again thank the men and women who helped avert \ndisaster--and saved untold lives--in one of America's most iconic and \ncrowded spaces. The system in place appears to be working as designed: \nimproved aviation security measures helped authorities apprehend the \nsubject as he attempted to flee, and the suspect is now reportedly \nproviding valuable information that could help disrupt and prevent \nfuture attacks. I am confident he and anyone else who contributed to \nthis atrocious act will be held to account.\n  But I have been disappointed that some have tried to politicize this \nattempted attack on our homeland. Let's use this opportunity to pursue \njustice and make sure our law enforcement, military, and intelligence \nservices have every tool they need to do their jobs. Let's also be sure \nwe examine what worked and didn't so we can improve the system. But \nlet's not mistake it as an opportunity to score political points or \nmake baseless accusations that do nothing to ensure our citizens' \nsafety.\n  A thwarted terrorist attack in the heart of our Nation's most \npopulous city reminds us that we have enough real enemies--we need not \nbe our own.\n  Let's also put this latest incident in context: It follows a \nsuccessful series of steps the administration has taken to protect us \nhere at home.\n  We have disrupted numerous terrorism plots and prosecuted dozens of \nterrorist suspects, including the ringleader of a plan to bomb New York \nCity's subway system last year. Attorney General Holder called that \nplot ``one of the most serious terrorist threats to our nation since \nSeptember 11th, 2001.'' That attack never happened; we cannot know how \nmany lives were saved, and our country is safer because of this \nadministration's swift and smart leadership.\n  Our Nation is also prosecuting David Headley, who is accused of \nplotting with the Pakistani terrorist organization Lashkar-e-Taiba to \nlaunch the devastating terrorist attacks in Mumbai in 2008, as well as \nto carry out other plots in South Asia and Europe. Attorney General \nHolder has credited the criminal justice system for achieving both a \nguilty plea and valuable intelligence about terrorist activities from \nHeadley.\n  And earlier this year, the FBI disrupted an international network of \nextremists operating through the Internet to plot attacks, raise \nfunding for terrorism and recruit new terrorists. Two Americans--\nColleen LaRose and Jamie Paulin-Ramirez, also known as Jihad Jane and \nJihad Jamie--were arrested along with six foreign co-conspirators. The \ntwo Americans will soon be tried in Federal court.\n  That's not all. We have also enhanced intelligence sharing, \nstrengthened aviation security and boosted human-intelligence \ncollection capabilities. We have fully implemented the 9/11 \nCommission's recommendations. And we have significantly increased \nfunding for the FBI, the Defense Department, the Department of Homeland \nSecurity and the intelligence community.\n  At the same time, we're keeping Americans safer at home by taking the \nfight to terrorists abroad. In recent months we have helped kill or \ncapture the most wanted terrorist leaders across Iraq, southeast Asia, \nAfrica and the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. We have disrupted al-\nQaida's operations, finances and safe havens, and killed or captured \nmore than half of its top 20 leaders. It is widely agreed that al-Qaida \nis the weakest it has been since 9/11.\n  We have also begun to reverse the Taliban's momentum in Afghanistan, \nin part by tripling the number of U.S. troops there. And we have \nstrengthened our partnership with Pakistan, empowering it to mount \nmajor offensives against terrorists within its borders.\n  I am praising the administration's vigilance not because the \nPresident is a Democrat. I am praising it because it is, by any \nobjective measure, successful. America is as prepared as ever to defend \nagainst any threat, domestic or foreign.\n  If, as this past weekend showed us, private citizens, street vendors, \nlaw enforcement and intelligence officials can work together in \neveryone's best interest, I would expect U.S. Senators to be able to do \nthe same.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3405-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3405-S3406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   COMMENDING CONGRESSMAN DAVID OBEY\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, we recently learned that David Obey, one \nof the longest serving Members of the other body, a friend, and a \nfellow member of the Wisconsin delegation, has decided to retire. To \ncome here and try to sum up his record and accomplishments isn't easy \nto do; Congressman Obey has achieved so much for Wisconsin, and for \nthis Nation. He has been the dean of the Wisconsin delegation, the \nchairman of the House Appropriations Committee, and a national leader \non many issues affecting hardworking families.\n  Congressman Obey understood the concerns of the people of the 7th \nDistrict of Wisconsin, and he has been their champion for more than 40 \nyears. He and I are both so fortunate to represent this beautiful swath \nof Wisconsin's north woods, including the magnificent Apostle Islands. \nIn fact, Congressman Obey and I worked together to protect the \nApostles, designating almost 80 percent of the Apostles as federally \nprotected wilderness.\n  That was just one of many ways that Congressman Obey and I worked \ntogether. Recently, we were also proud to come together to honor our \nfriend, the late Gaylord Nelson, on the 40th anniversary of Earth Day. \nAnd through the years, I have had the chance to work with Congressman \nObey in areas where he has shown tremendous leadership,\n\n[[Page S3406]]\n\nincluding advocating for veterans, farmers, and seniors.\n  Wisconsin veterans have a terrific ally in Congressman Obey, who has \nstood up for better funding and facilities for our veterans time and \nagain. I have been so pleased to work with him to open new veterans' \nhealth clinics, push for more vet centers, and fight for the best \npossible care for those men and women who have sacrificed so much for \nour country.\n  Congressman Obey has also worked tirelessly on behalf of the farmers \nof our State. He has fought for country-of-origin labeling and other \nissues critical to ginseng farmers, worked for emergency appropriations \nfunding for direct payments to help shore up the safety net for dairy \nfarmers in tough times, and pushed to create, extend and improve the \nMilk Income Loss Contract, MILC, Program. Those are just a few of the \nmany things he has done for Wisconsin's farmers, and I was proud to \njoin him in those efforts.\n  He is also a determined advocate for our seniors, and was a critical \nmember of our effort to save the SeniorCare Program in both 2007 and \n2009. Congressman Obey also has a long and distinguished record on a \nhost of other issues. He is committed to strengthening public \neducation, improving our health care system, and a longtime advocate \nfor political and congressional reforms.\n  There are so many things he has accomplished, and so many reasons he \nwill be missed. I want to take this opportunity to recognize \nCongressman Obey's outstanding service in the other body. I wish him \nall the best, and I thank him for his dedicated work for the people of \nWisconsin and for every American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3406-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3406]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOVERY OF SNOWBOARDER KEVIN PEARCE\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, Kevin Pearce has been recognized as one of \nthe best athletes that Vermont has produced. Like all Vermonters, \nMarcelle and I hold him in our prayers and thoughts after a devastating \nsnowboarding accident while preparing for the 2010 Winter Olympics.\n  We have heard reports from his parents, Simon and Pia, about his \nrecovery and like all Vermonters, and so many other Americans, we are \nso thankful he is back home and progressing every day in his recovery.\n  I watched Kevin's interview with Tom Brokaw on ``The Today Show'' and \nhe discussed how well he was doing with Tom. I also wanted my fellow \nSenators to see the article about him in The New York Times and ask \nunanimous consent to have printed in the Record that article at the \ncompletion of my remarks. I can only image how much Kevin enjoys being \nhome with his parents and his brothers and how much we all appreciate \nhis tremendous courage and abilities.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                 [From the New York Times, May 3, 2010]\n\n                ``No Place Like This for Soothing Care''\n\n                            (By John Branch)\n\n       Norwich, VT.--The renovated barn next to the family house \n     was always one of Kevin Pearce's favorite places. There is a \n     skateboard ramp out back and a giant recreation room inside, \n     with three loftlike bedrooms above.\n       But Pearce, 22, did not move into the barn until he was a \n     teenager, and soon he was off to snowboarding schools and \n     then on the worldwide circuit. Home, and his room in the \n     barn, became just somewhere to get away for a day or two.\n       Now it is the ultimate destination.\n       More than four months after sustaining a traumatic brain \n     injury during a training accident, after missing the Olympics \n     and living in hospitals in Utah and Colorado, Pearce has \n     returned, indefinitely.\n       ``It's the best thing ever,'' Pearce said Monday, sitting \n     on a living room sofa while holding hands with his mother, \n     Pia. Handwritten ``welcome home'' posters, balloons and \n     streamers hung about the house. ``There's nothing I could \n     think of that's any better than coming back home.''\n       And for a moment or two, it was easy to imagine that \n     nothing extraordinary had happened to Kevin Pearce at all. He \n     laughed with his family. He talked about snowboarding. He \n     discussed the Olympics. He smiled, big as ever.\n       ``Things feel very normal to me,'' Pearce said.\n       The past few months, much of which Pearce does not \n     remember, have been anything but normal. On Dec. 31, Pearce, \n     a rising rival to Shaun White who was expected to make the \n     United States Olympic halfpipe team and compete for a medal, \n     fell and hit his head (he was wearing a helmet) while \n     practicing a trick in Park City, Utah.\n       A helicopter flew Pearce, unconscious, to the University of \n     Utah Hospital in nearby Salt Lake City. The front half of his \n     shoulder-length hair was shaved so the recesses of his brain \n     could be drained of fluid. His family was summoned \n     immediately. Painful questions about whether he would live \n     slowly gave way to uneasy ones about how his life would be.\n       This is how, for now. Pearce walks without assistance, a \n     little gingerly but sturdily enough to navigate the stairs to \n     the familiar bedroom in the barn. He looks a little different \n     now, too. His hair, after being shaved to one length, has \n     grown back to the top of his ears. He wears bold, dark-rimmed \n     Oakley Frogskin frames with prismlike lenses. The vision in \n     each eye is fine, but the eyes themselves are a bit out of \n     sync, not quite tracking together.\n       ``My eyes are a little sketchy,'' he said. ``But they're \n     better than they used to be. They used to be scary blurry.''\n       Pearce says he does not remember the accident. He does not \n     remember much from the weeks before the injury, including \n     Christmas at home. He remembers nothing after the injury \n     until the first week of February, when he was flown from Utah \n     to Craig Hospital, a brain and spinal cord rehabilitation \n     center near Denver.\n       He does remember watching White win the Olympic gold medal. \n     Scotty Lago, a good friend of Pearce's who had had far less \n     big-event success, won bronze. It was tough, Pearce admitted.\n       But there is no memory of the moment when he learned just \n     how severe his injury was.\n       ``I never felt sorry for myself,'' Pearce said. ``This is \n     kind of what I signed up for when I started snowboarding.''\n       He vows that he will snowboard again.\n       ``Obviously, I won't be doing all the things I was doing,'' \n     Pearce said. ``Hopefully, I can still do some of the \n     tricks.''\n       Pearce's promising comeback has not included a \n     recalculation of his long-range ambitions. His family is \n     consciously keeping him concentrated on the here and now.\n       ``There is little use thinking about the past, what could \n     have been, or what may be in the future,'' Simon Pearce, his \n     father, said. ``He has stayed focused on the present moment. \n     And it feels like it is working.''\n       For months, Pearce has undergone rehabilitation and \n     therapy, both mental and physical, often for six or more \n     hours a day. More recently, he went to a Denver-area gym, \n     too, riding stationary bikes and playing basketball. He left \n     only after making at least 7 of 10 free throws. That sort of \n     therapy will continue at Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center \n     in nearby Lebanon, N.H., and at a local athletic club. \n     Pearce's rehabilitation continues to focus on vision, balance \n     and memory.\n       Pearce cannot fully appreciate how far he has come, however \n     often he watches videos that his family shot of him in the \n     hospital in January. But his parents and three older \n     brothers--Andrew (28), Adam (25) and David (24)--are still \n     amazed.\n       That hit home when the traveling party--Kevin, Adam, their \n     parents and their snowboarding friend Jack Mitrani--arrived \n     at the airport in Boston. Pearce walked through the airport \n     and carried his own bag.\n       They arrived at the family home about 9 p.m. Saturday. \n     About 30 friends and family members greeted them with cheers, \n     hugs and a few tears.\n       On Sunday, after a short hike up Gile Mountain, the family \n     gathered for supper. It was a rare reunion. Simon and Pia \n     generally alternated trips out West. Andrew, a manager for \n     the glass-blowing company founded by Simon Pearce, went back \n     and forth, too. Adam left his job as a snowboarding \n     instructor in Utah and has barely left Kevin's side, even \n     moving back to the barn. (Among other things, Adam provided \n     updates on a get-well Facebook page for more than 48,000 \n     fans.) David, who has Down syndrome and has long provided \n     perspective and inspiration, mostly stayed in Vermont and \n     worked for the family business.\n       But one horrific accident, and one celebratory homecoming, \n     brought them together again.\n       ``Sitting at the table, for me, was a big thing,'' Pia \n     Pearce said. `` `Wow, here we are, back at our round table, \n     sitting together.' ''\n       On Monday afternoon, everything seemed normal. Kevin \n     Pearce, after taking a nap in his old bedroom in the barn, \n     was sitting in the grass out front with the snowboarder \n     Ellery Hollingsworth. The sun was shining. Pearce was \n     smiling.\n       Yes, it was good to be home. Awfully good.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3406-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3406-S3407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n           50TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE DOSSIN GREAT LAKES MUSEUM\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am delighted to recognize the \nDossin Great Lakes Museum as it celebrates its 50th anniversary. This \ninstitution has graced the shores of Belle Isle, MI, since 1960, when \nthe Dossin family generously helped to transform the deteriorating \nMaritime Museum into an enduring tribute to the Great Lakes. For\n\n[[Page S3407]]\n\n50 years, the Dossin Great Lakes Museum has offered visitors from \nacross the state and beyond the opportunity to explore and experience \nfirsthand much of our State's 300-year maritime narrative.\n  Michigan's rich history is inextricably linked to the Great Lakes. In \nfact, Michigan's name is derived from the Ojibwa word for ``large \nwater,'' a root that speaks to the lakes' defining influence on our \nState's evolution. The lakes are integral to Michigan's social, \ncultural, and economic character. Native American tribes established \ntrade routes through these inland seas, which European settlers, led by \nthe French, relied on to develop a thriving fur trade beginning in the \nlate 1600s. During the War of 1812, American and British soldiers \nfought to wrest control over these precious waterways. Today, the Great \nLakes are a superhighway across which giant freighters glide. Some of \nthese great ships have become the stuff of maritime legend, such as the \nfamous Edmund Fitzgerald, whose tragic tale has captured the \nimagination of Michiganians for generations.\n  The Dossin Great Lakes Museum is a lens through which visitors can \nstudy and appreciate the tremendous importance of the Great Lakes. Its \npermanent exhibits include the enormous bow anchor of the Edmund \nFitzgerald, the pilot house of the S.S. William Clay Ford, and one of \nthe largest known collections of scale model ships in the world. \nLocated on Belle Isle in the middle of the Detroit River, facing the \nCanadian shore, the Dossin Great Lakes Museum devotes many of its \nresources to explaining Detroit's prominent role in the rich \ninternational history of the Great Lakes. The museum's dedicated staff \nare committed to providing visitors with an exciting and educational \nexperience, and to ensuring that residents of Michigan and visitors to \nour State continue to learn about the rich heritage of the Lakes.\n  For 50 years, this Detroit landmark has served an important role in \nillustrating Michigan's enduring ties to the Great Lakes. It offers the \nprospect of adventure and knowledge for those who walk through its \ndoors, and its exhibits tell stories that transport visitors through \nthree centuries of maritime history. I know my colleagues join me in \ncongratulating all those affiliated with the Dossin Great Lakes Museum \non its 50th anniversary and in wishing them the best for another 50 \nyears of navigating the course of our history.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3407-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3407-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations and a withdrawal which were referred to the appropriate \ncommittees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3407-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3407]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 10:18 a.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Novotny, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bill, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 5019.

S3408-S3409]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          STATEMENTS ON INTRODUCED BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n      By Mr. INOUYE (for himself, Mr. Begich, and Ms. Murkowski):\n  S. 3331. A bill to establish a Native American Economic Advisory \nCouncil, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I rise to introduce a bill that would \nestablish a Native American Economic Advisory Council. This Council's \nprimary duties would be to consult, coordinate, and make \nrecommendations to Federal agencies for the purpose of improving the \nsubstandard economic conditions that exist in our Native communities.\n  Currently, there is no Council, and despite the federal government's \n``trust'' relationship with Native American tribes, Native Americans \nthemselves continue to rank lowest in quality of life standings. As a \nNation we need to preserve our Native Communities; they are rich with \ncultural significance and living history.\n  Native communities are considered ``emerging economies'' that have \nstalled because of the current economic situation. This bill is an \nattempt to keep these communities moving by educating, empowering, and \nencouraging our future Native American leaders to create sustainable \neconomic growth programs in their own communities.\n  In Hawaii, the cost of living ranges from 30 percent to 60 percent \nhigher than the national average. We have to start planning for \neconomic stability in the future and this bill provides an opportunity \nto do so. I look forward to working with my colleagues on reinvesting \nin our Nation's future.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3331\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Native American Economic \n     Advisory Council Act of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds--\n       (1) the United States has a special political and legal \n     relationship and responsibility to promote the welfare of the \n     Native American people of the United States;\n       (2) evaluations of indicators and criteria of social well-\n     being, education, health, unemployment, housing, income, \n     rates of poverty, justice systems, and nutrition by agencies \n     of government and others have consistently found that Native \n     American communities rank below other groups of United States \n     citizens and many are at or near the bottom in those \n     evaluations;\n       (3) Native Americans, like other people in the United \n     States, have been hit hard by the deepest recession of the \n     United States economy in over 50 years, causing a significant \n     decline in employment and economic activity across the United \n     States;\n       (4) Native American communities have been described as \n     ``emerging economies'' and consequently have been stalled in \n     the efforts of the communities to build sustainable growing \n     economies for the people of the communities and are being \n     adversely affected faster than the rest of the United States;\n       (5) economic stimulus programs to help Native American \n     communities generate jobs and stronger economic performance \n     will require United States financial and tax incentives to \n     increase both local and expanded investment that is tailored \n     to the unique needs and circumstances of Native American \n     communities;\n       (6) the impacts of the ongoing recession and the near \n     collapse of the financial and banking systems require a \n     review of assumptions about the future, the need for new \n     growth strategies, and a focus on laying the groundwork for \n     economic success in the 21st century;\n       (7) there is a continuing need for direct economic \n     stimulus, including needs for improving rural infrastructure \n     and alternative energy in rural and Native American \n     communities of the United States and providing Native \n     Americans leaders with the tools to create jobs and improve \n     economic conditions;\n       (8) in light of the role of Native American communities as \n     emerging markets within the United States, there are \n     opportunities and needs that should be addressed, including \n     consideration of United States support for the pooling of \n     resources to create an Indigenous Sovereign Wealth Fund that \n     is similar to those Funds created around the world to \n     diversify revenue streams, attract more resources, invest \n     more wisely, and create jobs;\n       (9) Native Americans should be participants when major \n     economic decisions are made that affect the property, lives, \n     and future of Native Americans; and\n       (10) Native Americans should fully participate in \n     rebuilding Native American communities and have necessary \n     tools and resources.\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purpose of this Act is to authorize and establish a \n     Native American Economic Advisory Council to consult, \n     coordinate with, and make recommendations to the Executive \n     Office of the President, Cabinet officers, and Federal \n     agencies--\n       (1) to improve the focus, effectiveness, and delivery of \n     Federal economic aid and development programs to Native \n     Americans and, as a result, improve substandard economic \n     conditions in Native American communities;\n       (2) to build and expand on the capacity of leaders in \n     Native American organizations and communities to take \n     positive and innovative steps--\n       (A) to create jobs;\n       (B) to establish stable and profitable business \n     enterprises;\n       (C) to enhance economic conditions; and\n       (D) to use Native American-owned resources for the benefit \n     of members; and\n       (3) to achieve the long-term goal of improving the quality \n     of Native American life and living conditions and access to \n     basic public services to the levels enjoyed by the average \n     citizen and community of the United States by the year 2025.\n\n     SEC. 4.

Res. 515\n\n       Whereas the week beginning May 2, 2010, is observed as \n     National Physical Education and Sport Week;\n       Whereas a decline in physical activity has contributed to \n     an unprecedented epidemic of childhood obesity in the United \n     States, which has more than tripled since 1980;\n       Whereas regular physical activity is necessary to support \n     normal and healthy growth in children and is essential to \n     their continued health and well-being;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, overweight adolescents have a 70 to 80 percent \n     chance of becoming overweight adults, increasing their risk \n     for chronic disease, disability, and death;\n       Whereas physical activity reduces the risk of heart \n     disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and certain types of \n     cancers;\n       Whereas type 2 diabetes can no longer be referred to as \n     ``late in life'' or ``adult onset'' diabetes because it \n     occurs in children as young as 10 years old;\n       Whereas the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, \n     published by the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     recommend that children engage in at least 60 minutes of \n     physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the \n     week;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, only 17 percent of high school students meet that \n     goal of 60 minutes of physical activity a day;\n       Whereas children spend many of their waking hours at school \n     and therefore need to be active during the school day to meet \n     the recommendations of the Physical Activity Guidelines for \n     Americans;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, 1 in 4 children in the United States does not \n     attend any school physical education classes and fewer than 1 \n     in 4 children in the United States engage in 20 minutes of \n     vigorous physical activity each day;\n\n[[Page S3410]]\n\n       Whereas teaching children about physical activity and \n     sports not only ensures that they are physically active \n     during the school day, but also educates them on how to be \n     physically active and the importance of being physically \n     active;\n       Whereas, according to a 2006 survey by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, 3.8 percent of elementary schools, \n     7.9 percent of middle schools, and 2.1 percent of high \n     schools provide daily physical education classes or the \n     equivalent for the entire school year, and 22 percent of \n     schools do not require students to take any physical \n     education classes at all;\n       Whereas, according to that survey, 13.7 percent of \n     elementary schools, 15.2 percent of middle schools, and 3.0 \n     percent of high schools provided physical education at least \n     3 days per week, or the equivalent thereof, for the entire \n     school year for students in all grades in the school;\n       Whereas research shows that fit and active children are \n     more likely to thrive academically;\n       Whereas increased time in physical education classes can \n     improve children's attention and concentration and result in \n     higher test scores;\n       Whereas participation in sports teams and physical activity \n     clubs, which are often organized by schools and run outside \n     the regular school day, can improve students' grade point \n     averages, attachment to schools, educational aspirations, and \n     the likelihood of graduating;\n       Whereas participation in sports and other physical \n     activities also improves self-esteem and body image in \n     children and adults;\n       Whereas children and youth who take part in physical \n     activity and sports programs develop improved motor skills, \n     healthy lifestyles, improved social skills, a sense of fair \n     play, strong teamwork skills, and self-discipline and avoid \n     risky behaviors;\n       Whereas the social and environmental factors affecting \n     children are in the control of the adults and the communities \n     in which children live, and therefore the Nation shares a \n     collective responsibility in reversing the childhood obesity \n     trend;\n       Whereas efforts to improve the fitness level of children \n     who are not physically fit may also result in improvements in \n     academic performance; and\n       Whereas the Senate strongly supports efforts to increase \n     physical activity and participation of youth in sports: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning May 2, 2010, as \n     ``National Physical Education and Sport Week'';\n       (2) recognizes the central role of physical education and \n     sports in creating healthy lifestyles for all children and \n     youth;\n       (3) encourages school districts to implement local wellness \n     policies, as described in section 204 of the Child Nutrition \n     and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 (42 U.S.C. 1751 note), \n     that include ambitious goals for physical education, physical \n     activity, and other activities addressing the childhood \n     obesity epidemic and promoting child wellness; and\n       (4) encourages schools to offer physical education classes \n     to students and to work with community partners to provide \n     opportunities and safe spaces for physical activities before \n     and after school and during the summer months for all \n     children and youth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3410-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 516--RECOGNIZING THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF AMERICORPS \n        MEMBERS TO THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN (for herself and Mr. Dodd) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S. Res. 516\n\n       Whereas, since its inception in 1994, the AmeriCorps \n     national service program has proven to be a highly effective \n     way to engage the people of the United States in meeting a \n     wide range of local and national needs and promoting the \n     ethic of service and volunteering;\n       Whereas, each year, AmeriCorps provides opportunities for \n     approximately 85,000 individuals across the United States to \n     give back in an intensive way to their communities, their \n     States, and the Nation;\n       Whereas those individuals improve the lives of the Nation's \n     most vulnerable citizens, protect the environment, contribute \n     to public safety, respond to disasters, and strengthen the \n     educational system;\n       Whereas AmeriCorps members serve thousands of nonprofit \n     organizations, schools, and faith-based and community \n     organizations each year;\n       Whereas AmeriCorps members, after their terms of service \n     end, are more likely to remain engaged in their communities \n     as volunteers, teachers, and nonprofit professionals than the \n     average individual;\n       Whereas, on April 21, 2009, President Barack Obama signed \n     the Serve America Act (Public Law 111-13; 123 Stat. 1460) \n     into law, which was passed by bipartisan majorities in both \n     the House of Representatives and the Senate and reauthorized \n     AmeriCorps and will expand AmeriCorps programs to incorporate \n     250,000 members each year;\n       Whereas national service programs have engaged millions of \n     people in the United States in results-driven service in the \n     Nation's most vulnerable communities, providing hope and help \n     to people facing economic and social needs;\n       Whereas, in 2010, as the economic downturn puts millions of \n     people in the United States at risk, national service and \n     volunteering are more important than ever; and\n       Whereas AmeriCorps Week, observed in 2010 from May 8 \n     through May 15, provides the perfect opportunity for \n     AmeriCorps members, alumni, grantees, program partners, and \n     friends to shine a spotlight on the work done by AmeriCorps \n     members and to motivate more people in the United States to \n     serve their communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the contributions of AmeriCorps members to \n     the lives of the people of the United States;\n       (2) acknowledges the significant accomplishments of \n     AmeriCorps members, alumni, and community partners; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to join in a \n     national effort to salute AmeriCorps members and alumni and \n     raise awareness about the importance of national and \n     community service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3410-2", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 517--IN SUPPORT AND RECOGNITION OF NATIONAL TRAIN \n                            DAY, MAY 8, 2010\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG (for himself, Mr. Rockefeller, Mrs. Hutchison, Mr. \nLieberman, Mr. Schumer, Mr. Durbin, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Carper, Mr. Dorgan, \nMr. Wyden, Mr. Burris, Mr. Bayh, and Mr. Udall of New Mexico) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Reg. 3138 (January 16, 2009), \n     interferes with State insurance regulation, harms the \n     insurance industry, reduces competition, restricts consumer \n     choice, creates unnecessary and excessive regulatory burdens, \n     and diverts Commission resources, all of which outweighs any \n     perceived benefits.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this subtitle is to nullify \n     rule 151A and clarify the scope of the exemption for \n     annuities and insurance contracts from Federal regulation \n     under the Securities Act of 1933.\n\n     SEC. 553. SCOPE OF EXEMPTION FROM FEDERAL SECURITIES \n                   REGULATION.\n\n       Section 3(a)(8) of the Securities Act of 1933 (15 U.S.C. \n     77c(a)(8)) is amended by inserting before the semicolon the \n     following: ``, and any insurance or endowment policy or \n     annuity contract or optional annuity contract--\n       ``(A) the value of which does not vary according to the \n     performance of a separate account; and\n       ``(B) which satisfies standard nonforfeiture laws or \n     similar requirements of the applicable State, Territory, or \n     District of Columbia at time of issue, or in the absence of \n     applicable standard nonforfeiture laws or requirements, \n     satisfies the Model Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Life \n     Insurance or Model Standard Nonforfeiture Law for Individual \n     Deferred Annuities, or any successor model law, as published \n     by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners''.\n\n     SEC. 554.

Res. 275\n\n       Whereas, since September 21, 1959, Minute Man National \n     Historical Park has preserved key sites where the first \n     battles of the American Revolutionary War occurred, and \n     educated millions of people in the United States about the \n     extraordinary events that led to the birth of the United \n     States and the ideals embodied in the courageous actions that \n     led to such events;\n       Whereas Minute Man National Historical Park encompasses \n     more than 1,000 acres in the historic communities of \n     Lexington, Lincoln, and Concord that were at the center of \n     the American Revolution;\n       Whereas the events, places, and people recognized by the \n     Minute Man National Historical Park have become enduring \n     testaments to the values of the people of the United States \n     and are among the most celebrated and cherished symbols in \n     the history of the United States;\n       Whereas the Minute Man National Historical Park includes \n     multiple sites and vistas along the route from Boston to \n     Concord, known as the ``Battle Road'', where American militia \n     and British soldiers fought several times on April 19, 1775;\n       Whereas American militia were first ordered to return \n     British fire at Concord's North Bridge, a heroic action \n     commemorated by the United States poet Ralph Waldo Emerson in \n     his poem ``The Concord Hymn'' as the ``shot heard round the \n     world'';\n       Whereas the park celebrates the legendary ``midnight ride'' \n     of Paul Revere on April 18, 1775, that warned American \n     colonists that British soldiers were marching to Concord to \n     destroy key military stores; and\n       Whereas more than 1,000,000 people from States across the \n     United States and from around the world visit Minute Man \n     National Historical Park each year to learn about the role \n     that the New England communities of Lexington, Lincoln, and \n     Concord played in the American Revolution: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, that it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) Minute Man National Historical Park serves an essential \n     role in preserving the sites and vistas in New England where \n     the American Revolution began and in educating the public \n     about these historic events;\n       (2) Minute Man National Historical Park honors and \n     commemorates the ideals of democracy, liberty, and freedom \n     that are the foundation of the United States and sources of \n     inspiration for people everywhere; and\n       (3) the creation of Minute Man National Historical Park 50 \n     years ago represents a remarkable achievement that continues \n     to benefit the people of the United States, to preserve the \n     proud legacy of the American Revolution, and to serve as an \n     enduring resource for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3430-3", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3430]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            TO AMEND THE NATIONAL LAW ENFORCEMENT MUSEUM ACT\n\n  The bill (S. 1053) to amend the National Law Enforcement Museum Act \nto extend the termination date, was considered, ordered to be engrossed \nfor a third reading, was read the third time, and passed.\n\n                                S. 1053\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I rise to engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague from Rhode Island, Mr. Whitehouse, and my colleague from West \nVirginia, Mr. Rockefeller.\n  Mr. President, I want to thank the chairman of the Commerce Committee \nfor his leadership in advancing this bill. As he, Senator Whitehouse, \nand I have discussed, there is significant concern with respect to the \nsafety and security of proposed liquefied natural gas, LNG, facilities \nthroughout the country. Given the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the \nGulf of Mexico, we know that no system for handling volatile substances \nis fool-proof.\n  Over the last several years, the people of Rhode Island have been \ngreatly concerned about proposals to develop LNG facilities on or in \nclose proximity to Rhode Island's shores, as well as proposals to \ntransit LNG traffic through our waterways. I have come to the floor on \nmany occasions to express my deep concerns about the wisdom of these \nprojects; not as a matter of reflexive opposition to LNG but as a \nmatter of the appropriateness of siting these facilities with little \nState control.\n  This includes a proposal in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts that \nwill have significant impact on the State of Rhode Island, as it calls \nfor vessels to transit through Narragansett Bay and off-load at an \noffshore berth in Mount Hope Bay just outside of Rhode Island waters. \nOver the years, members of the Rhode Island and Massachusetts \ndelegations have raised concerns about this project, but the most \nsevere impacts of the vessel traffic and related safety and security \nmeasures will be on Rhode Island, which has very little authority to \ninfluence the process. The Coast Guard has the responsibility of \nissuing so-called Letters of Recommendation to establish the \nsuitability of a waterway to accommodate this type of vessel traffic \nand operation. Its determination is critical in the siting LNG \nfacilities. Unfortunately, Rhode Island, like other states, has little \nrecourse to object to the findings or conditions laid out by the Coast \nGuard, even though the bulk of the vessel activity will take place in \nits state waters. I believe the state should have a say about the \nappropriateness of activities in its waterways and should be consulted, \nespecially about the broader impacts of LNG facilities and vessel \ntraffic on other waterway users and on communities.\n  Although the underlying House bill includes a port security title, \nthe substitute does not. While I recognize that and that the Committee \nwill be dealing with port security legislation later this year, I think \nthat it is critical that we act on this issue as soon as possible. I \nwould like to work with the Chairman in crafting that bill, but I would \nalso ask for his commitment to work to address the issues related to \nLNG facilities during conference with the House on the Coast Guard \nReauthorization bill.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I share the sentiments of the senior \nSenator from Rhode Island, Mr. Reed.\n  Rhode Islanders are strongly opposed to this project. Furthermore, \nthe process for siting the LNG facility has afforded us too few \nopportunities to address the impacts it will have on our state's \neconomy, safety, and environment.\n  The Coast Guard is charged with the narrow task of determining \nwhether LNG tankers can safely transit Rhode Island waters on their way \nto an offshore berthing station just on the other side of the state \nline in Massachusetts. However, the safe transit of these tankers is \nonly one of the many important considerations that can, and should, be \ntaken into account in determining the suitability of such a project. \nNarragansett Bay is the backbone of the Rhode Island economy, as it \nsustains our fishing, recreation, and tourism sectors. The proposed LNG \nfacility in Fall River threatens to undermine these pillars of our \neconomy.\n  I am not opposed to LNG as a fuel source. However, I have serious \nconcerns with the proposal under consideration. The LNG tankers \ntransiting Rhode Island waters must pass through heavily populated \ncommunities, under the presence of heavy security. The Coast Guard \nadmits that this will likely displace other users of the bay and \ndisrupt traffic on the bridges the tankers must travel beneath. This is \ntoo high a burden for Rhode Island to carry for a facility that is \nlocated in a neighboring state--and I am not convinced this burden is \nworth the marginal benefits of the proposed LNG facility.\n  I thank the Chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Senator \nRockefeller, for his willingness to work with us on an issue critical \nto the State of Rhode Island.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. I am aware of both Senators' concerns and I will \nwork with each of you related to LNG facilities during conference with \nthe House on the Coast Guard Reauthorization bill.\n  Mr. REED. Thank you, Mr. Chairman. I look forward to this issue being \naddressed in the final Coast Guard Reauthorization bill.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I ask unanimous consent that the Cantwell substitute \namendment, which is at the desk, be considered and agreed to; the bill, \nas amended, be read a third time and passed, the motion to reconsider \nbe laid upon the table, and that any statements be printed in the \nRecord without further intervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Res. 480\n\n       Whereas the military regime in Burma, headed by General \n     Than Shwe and the State Peace and Development Council, \n     continues to persecute Burmese democracy leader Daw Aung San \n     Suu Kyi and her supporters in the National League for \n     Democracy, and ordinary citizens of Burma, including ethnic \n     minorities, who publically and courageously speak out against \n     the regime's many injustices;\n       Whereas Daw Aung San Suu Kyi has been imprisoned in Burma \n     for 14 of the last 19 years and many members of the National \n     League for Democracy have been similarly jailed, tortured, or \n     killed;\n       Whereas the Constitution adopted in 2008 and the election \n     laws recently promulgated effectively prohibit the National \n     League for Democracy, Buddhist monks, ethnic minority \n     leaders, and Daw Aung San Suu Kyi from participating in \n     upcoming elections, and do not leave much opportunity for \n     domestic dialogue among key stakeholders; and\n       Whereas the persecution of the people of Burma has \n     continued even though the Department of State has pursued a \n     policy of engagement with the military regime designed to \n     secure the release of political prisoners,\n\n[[Page S3433]]\n\n     foster national reconciliation, and facilitate peaceful \n     transition to civilian, democratic rule: Now, therefore, be \n     it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the continued detention of Burmese democracy \n     leader Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and all prisoners of conscience \n     in Burma, and calls for their immediate and unconditional \n     release;\n       (2) calls on the military regime in Burma to engage in \n     dialogue with all political groups and individuals dedicated \n     to democratic ideals, as well as with ethnic minorities, to \n     broaden political participation in an environment free from \n     fear and intimidation;\n       (3) calls upon the Secretary of State to assess the \n     effectiveness of the policy of engagement with the military \n     regime in Burma in furthering United States interests, and to \n     maintain, and consider strengthening, sanctions against Burma \n     if the military regime continues its systematic violation of \n     human rights and fails to embrace the democratic aspirations \n     of the people of Burma;\n       (4) calls upon the Secretary of State to engage regional \n     governments and multilateral organizations, as appropriate, \n     in order to push for the establishment of an environment in \n     Burma that encourages the full and unfettered participation \n     of the people of Burma in a democratic transition to civilian \n     rule; and\n       (5) calls on the Secretary of State to support the people \n     of Burma in calling for significant constitutional and \n     election reforms by the military regime, which will broaden \n     political participation, further democracy, accountability, \n     and responsive governance, and improve human rights in Burma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3433-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               AUTHORIZING THE USE OF THE CAPITOL GROUNDS\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolutions were agreed to.\n  The preambles were agreed to.\n  The resolutions, with their preambles, read as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 515\n\n       Whereas the week beginning May 2, 2010, is observed as \n     National Physical Education and Sport Week;\n       Whereas a decline in physical activity has contributed to \n     an unprecedented epidemic of childhood obesity in the United \n     States, which has more than tripled since 1980;\n       Whereas regular physical activity is necessary to support \n     normal and healthy growth in children and is essential to \n     their continued health and well-being;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, overweight adolescents have a 70 to 80 percent \n     chance of becoming overweight adults, increasing their risk \n     for chronic disease, disability, and death;\n       Whereas physical activity reduces the risk of heart \n     disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, and certain types of \n     cancers;\n       Whereas type 2 diabetes can no longer be referred to as \n     ``late in life'' or ``adult onset'' diabetes because it \n     occurs in children as young as 10 years old;\n\n[[Page S3434]]\n\n       Whereas the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, \n     published by the Department of Health and Human Services, \n     recommend that children engage in at least 60 minutes of \n     physical activity on most, and preferably all, days of the \n     week;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, only 17 percent of high school students meet that \n     goal of 60 minutes of physical activity a day;\n       Whereas children spend many of their waking hours at school \n     and therefore need to be active during the school day to meet \n     the recommendations of the Physical Activity Guidelines for \n     Americans;\n       Whereas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, 1 in 4 children in the United States does not \n     attend any school physical education classes and fewer than 1 \n     in 4 children in the United States engage in 20 minutes of \n     vigorous physical activity each day;\n       Whereas teaching children about physical activity and \n     sports not only ensures that they are physically active \n     during the school day, but also educates them on how to be \n     physically active and the importance of being physically \n     active;\n       Whereas, according to a 2006 survey by the Department of \n     Health and Human Services, 3.8 percent of elementary schools, \n     7.9 percent of middle schools, and 2.1 percent of high \n     schools provide daily physical education classes or the \n     equivalent for the entire school year, and 22 percent of \n     schools do not require students to take any physical \n     education classes at all;\n       Whereas, according to that survey, 13.7 percent of \n     elementary schools, 15.2 percent of middle schools, and 3.0 \n     percent of high schools provided physical education at least \n     3 days per week, or the equivalent thereof, for the entire \n     school year for students in all grades in the school;\n       Whereas research shows that fit and active children are \n     more likely to thrive academically;\n       Whereas increased time in physical education classes can \n     improve children's attention and concentration and result in \n     higher test scores;\n       Whereas participation in sports teams and physical activity \n     clubs, which are often organized by schools and run outside \n     the regular school day, can improve students' grade point \n     averages, attachment to schools, educational aspirations, and \n     the likelihood of graduating;\n       Whereas participation in sports and other physical \n     activities also improves self-esteem and body image in \n     children and adults;\n       Whereas children and youth who take part in physical \n     activity and sports programs develop improved motor skills, \n     healthy lifestyles, improved social skills, a sense of fair \n     play, strong teamwork skills, and self-discipline and avoid \n     risky behaviors;\n       Whereas the social and environmental factors affecting \n     children are in the control of the adults and the communities \n     in which children live, and therefore the Nation shares a \n     collective responsibility in reversing the childhood obesity \n     trend;\n       Whereas efforts to improve the fitness level of children \n     who are not physically fit may also result in improvements in \n     academic performance; and\n       Whereas the Senate strongly supports efforts to increase \n     physical activity and participation of youth in sports: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning May 2, 2010, as \n     ``National Physical Education and Sport Week'';\n       (2) recognizes the central role of physical education and \n     sports in creating healthy lifestyles for all children and \n     youth;\n       (3) encourages school districts to implement local wellness \n     policies, as described in section 204 of the Child Nutrition \n     and WIC Reauthorization Act of 2004 (42 U.S.C. 1751 note), \n     that include ambitious goals for physical education, physical \n     activity, and other activities addressing the childhood \n     obesity epidemic and promoting child wellness; and\n       (4) encourages schools to offer physical education classes \n     to students and to work with community partners to provide \n     opportunities and safe spaces for physical activities before \n     and after school and during the summer months for all \n     children and youth.\n\n                              S. Res. 516\n\n       Whereas, since its inception in 1994, the AmeriCorps \n     national service program has proven to be a highly effective \n     way to engage the people of the United States in meeting a \n     wide range of local and national needs and promoting the \n     ethic of service and volunteering;\n       Whereas, each year, AmeriCorps provides opportunities for \n     approximately 85,000 individuals across the United States to \n     give back in an intensive way to their communities, their \n     States, and the Nation;\n       Whereas those individuals improve the lives of the Nation's \n     most vulnerable citizens, protect the environment, contribute \n     to public safety, respond to disasters, and strengthen the \n     educational system;\n       Whereas AmeriCorps members serve thousands of nonprofit \n     organizations, schools, and faith-based and community \n     organizations each year;\n       Whereas AmeriCorps members, after their terms of service \n     end, are more likely to remain engaged in their communities \n     as volunteers, teachers, and nonprofit professionals than the \n     average individual;\n       Whereas, on April 21, 2009, President Barack Obama signed \n     the Serve America Act (Public Law 111-13; 123 Stat. 1460) \n     into law, which was passed by bipartisan majorities in both \n     the House of Representatives and the Senate and reauthorized \n     AmeriCorps and will expand AmeriCorps programs to incorporate \n     250,000 members each year;\n       Whereas national service programs have engaged millions of \n     people in the United States in results-driven service in the \n     Nation's most vulnerable communities, providing hope and help \n     to people facing economic and social needs;\n       Whereas, in 2010, as the economic downturn puts millions of \n     people in the United States at risk, national service and \n     volunteering are more important than ever; and\n       Whereas AmeriCorps Week, observed in 2010 from May 8 \n     through May 15, provides the perfect opportunity for \n     AmeriCorps members, alumni, grantees, program partners, and \n     friends to shine a spotlight on the work done by AmeriCorps \n     members and to motivate more people in the United States to \n     serve their communities: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the contributions of AmeriCorps members to \n     the lives of the people of the United States;\n       (2) acknowledges the significant accomplishments of \n     AmeriCorps members, alumni, and community partners; and\n       (3) encourages the people of the United States to join in a \n     national effort to salute AmeriCorps members and alumni and \n     raise awareness about the importance of national and \n     community service.\n\n                              S. Res. 517\n\n       Whereas on May 10, 1869, the ``golden spike'' was driven \n     into the final tie at Promontory Summit, Utah, to join the \n     Central Pacific and the Union Pacific Railroads, ceremonially \n     completing the first transcontinental railroad and therefore \n     connecting both coasts of the United States;\n       Whereas in highly populated regions Amtrak trains and \n     infrastructure carry intercity passengers and commuters to \n     and from work in congested metropolitan areas, providing a \n     reliable rail option while reducing congestion on roads and \n     in the skies;\n       Whereas Amtrak ridership in Fiscal Year 2009 reached 27.1 \n     million passengers from 46 states;\n       Whereas, for many rural Americans, Amtrak represents the \n     only major intercity transportation link to the rest of the \n     country;\n       Whereas passenger rail provides a fuel-efficient \n     transportation system, thereby providing clean transportation \n     alternatives and energy security;\n       Whereas, when combined with all modes of transportation, \n     passenger railroads emit only 0.2 percent of the travel \n     industry's total greenhouse gases and one freight train can \n     move a ton of freight 480 miles on one gallon of fuel;\n       Whereas developing this pipeline of national high-speed and \n     intercity passenger rail projects will revitalize the \n     domestic manufacturing industry and create additional \n     American jobs building on the one million good-paying, \n     middle-class-creating American jobs that can never be off-\n     shored that are already supported by the rail industry;\n       Whereas ridership on Amtrak grew every year from 2000 \n     through 2008, and is currently on track for 2010 to be its \n     best ridership year ever, further demonstrating the increased \n     demand for intercity passenger rail services; and\n       Whereas our railroad system is a source of civic pride, the \n     gateway to our communities and a tool for economic growth \n     that creates transportation-oriented development and livable \n     communities: Now, therefore, be it -\n       Resolved, That the Senate supports the goals and ideals of \n     National Train Day, as designated by Amtrak.\n\n                              S. Res. 518\n\n       Whereas more than 1,500,000 elderly and disabled \n     individuals live in the nearly 16,000 nursing facilities in \n     the United States;\n       Whereas the annual celebration of National Nursing Home \n     Week invites people in communities nationwide to recognize \n     nursing home residents and staff for their contributions to \n     their communities;\n       Whereas the theme for National Nursing Home Week in 2010 is \n     ``Enriching Every Day'', honoring caregivers who are \n     ``enriching every day'' for elderly and disabled individuals, \n     adding value to their lives and helping them to overcome many \n     of the infirmities of age and disability;\n       Whereas nursing homes are intimate communities where acts \n     of caring, kindness, and respect are the norm;\n       Whereas, when the positive bond that naturally develops \n     between patients and their caregivers is established, \n     patients experience not only better physical care and \n     healing, but also enrichment of the mind, heart, and spirit \n     and an affirmation of their value; and\n       Whereas National Nursing Home Week recognizes the people \n     who provide care to the Nation's most vulnerable population: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) designates the week beginning May 9, 2010, as \n     ``National Nursing Home Week'';\n       (2) recognizes that a majority of people in the United \n     States, because of social needs, disability, trauma, or \n     illness, will require long-term care services at some point \n     in their lives;\n       (3) honors nursing home residents and the people who care \n     for them each day, including\n\n[[Page S3435]]\n\n     family members, volunteers, and dedicated long-term care \n     professionals, for their contributions to their communities \n     and the United States; and\n       (4) encourages the people of the United States to observe \n     National Nursing Home Week with appropriate ceremonies and \n     activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/05/07/senate-section/article/S3435-1", "month": "05", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3435-S3446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            SATELLITE TELEVISION EXTENSION AND LOCALISM ACT\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I am pleased that the Senate will pass the \nSatellite Television Extension and Localism Act, STELA, of 2010. This \nlegislation modernizes and extends important statutory copyright \nlicenses that allow cable and satellite companies to retransmit the \ncontent transmitted by television broadcasters. STELA also includes \nimportant Communications Act authorizations that allow for the \nretransmission of broadcast television signals by satellite and cable \nproviders.\n  Ensuring that Americans have access to broadcast television content \nis important, and it is particularly relevant for consumers in rural \nareas who might not otherwise be able to receive these signals over-\nthe-air. The legislation that the Senate is passing today will ensure \nthat nobody will be left in the dark for the foreseeable future. \nBroadcast television plays a critical role in cities and towns across \nthe country, and remains the primary way in which consumers are able to \naccess local content such as news, weather, and sports.\n  Cable and satellite providers help to expand the footprint of \nbroadcast stations by allowing them to reach viewers who are unable to \nreceive signals over-the-air. Vermont is an example of how cable and \nsatellite companies can provide service to consumers in rural areas who \nmight not otherwise receive these signals.\n  Vermonters will see improved service when this legislation is \nenacted. Today, DirecTV is permitted to use the licenses to provide \nWindham and Bennington Counties with stations from the Burlington \ntelevision market, but DISH Network is not. This legislation will \npermit DISH to provide their subscribers in southern Vermont with the \nsame service. As soon as DISH Network uses this authority, virtually \neveryone in the State will be able to access the news and information \nthat is truly important to Vermonters.\n  One other important way that STELA will preserve and improve existing \nservice for consumers is by correcting a flaw in the statutory \ncopyright license for the cable industry. An unintended result of \ncurrent law is that the cable license requires the cable industry to \npay copyright holders for signals that many of their subscribers do not \nactually receive. This is often referred to as the phantom signal \nproblem. The effect of this anomaly in the law is that Comcast is \nrequired to pay copyright royalties based on their subscriber base \nacross the northeast for the Canadian television content that is only \nprovided to subscribers in Burlington, VT.\n  The bill corrects this flaw by giving the cable industry the \nflexibility to continue to provide signals that are tailored to local \ninterests--signals that might otherwise have been pulled from cable \nline-ups. This will benefit industry and consumers. For instance, \nsubscribers in Burlington will still be able to receive programming \nsuch as ``Hockey Night in Canada,'' which has been a tradition, without \nfear that Comcast will have to remove the channel or raise prices \nbecause it is being charged royalties based on subscribers in Boston.\n  In addition, the legislation will expand consumer access to their \nStates' public television programming and low-power, community-oriented \nstations that will promote media diversity.\n  This is the third time the Senate will have passed substantially the \nsame reauthorization language. The bill is the product of many hours of \nhard work and compromise among four committees in both Houses of \nCongress. No single member or committee chairman would have written it \nin this exact way, but the final language represents a fair compromise \non important issues. For instance, I would have preferred the approach \nincluded in the Senate Judiciary Committee-approved bill for providing \nincentives to DISH Network to launch additional local markets, rather \nthan lifting a court-ordered injunction. As a matter of policy, lifting \na court-ordered injunction based on copyright infringement is something \nI generally do not support, but others insisted upon it and it is part \nof the compromise embodied in STELA.\n  Overall, this is a good bill that will preserve and improve the \nservice that consumers across the country are accustomed to receiving. \nI hope the third time the Senate passes it will be the final time and \nthat it will be considered promptly by the House and signed into law by \nthe President.\n  Mr. CONRAD: This is the Statement of Budgetary Effects of PAYGO \nLegislation for S. 3333.
