Mr. President, the global economic crisis is very \ncomplicated. It was born of both brazen, unabashed abuses and elaborate \nschemes alike. It brought complex concepts such as ``mortgage-backed \nsecurities'' and ``credit default swaps'' and ``derivatives trading'' \ninto our everyday vocabulary. Prior to this financial meltdown, rarely \ndid we hear the words ``mortgage-backed security,'' ``credit default \nswaps'' or ``derivative trading,'' but now they are in every newspaper \nwe read. They are all over the television, all over radio. But when we \npeel back all the layers of this crisis, its foundation is nothing more \nthan a simple concept: greed. When we cut through to the root causes of \nwhy so many families are hurting and why so many businesses are \nsuffering, the core elements are evident: excess, irresponsibility, and \nreckless risks.\n\n[[Page S10712]]\n\n  Wall Street ran wild, then it ran out of steam. Last year's emergency \nrequired an urgent dose of medicine, and we supplied it. Our entire \nnational economy was on the brink. Our entire world economy was on the \nbrink. Our swift action prevented a terrible situation from getting \neven worse. For the past year, we have continued to act in strong, \nsensible, and prudent ways. We taxpayers did what we needed to do to \nhelp keep the economy afloat and didn't ask much from Wall Street in \nreturn. We would have gladly accepted a simple ``thank you.''\n  So one can understand America's disgust upon realizing in recent days \nthat Wall Street has ignored the lessons of last year. Reckless Wall \nStreet traders continue to write themselves checks for billions of \ndollars--much of it our dollars. The Wall Street Journal found that \nmajor banks and securities firms are going to pay their employees $140 \nbillion this year. That is a record high, and 20 percent more than last \nyear. But the greed is evident not only in salaries; it is in bonuses \nand other benefits also. The Washington Post reported that the Nation's \nbiggest financial firms, including the firms that took nearly half the \nemergency TARP money, are actually increasing the perks they are \nhanding out to their employees this year.\n  Here is what is happening on Wall Street today: CEOs are giving their \ntraders huge incentives--usually cash bonuses--to swing for the fences \nand make deals that put their entire firms and the larger system at \nrisk. That is the height of irresponsibility. It is the height of \narrogance. Risky bets on exotic securities are precisely what sparked \nthe financial crisis and fueled the housing crisis. These events \ndevastated Nevada and many other States. But that same carelessness \ncontinues, I am sad to say, on Wall Street today. A gluttonous \nglorification of the bottom line led to the credit crisis that has led \nso many hard-working families into bankruptcy and worse. But that same \nnarrow-mindedness continues to guide financial firms today. Short \nselling and shortsightedness--rewarded with stratospheric salaries and \nbloated bonuses--contributed to a shameful culture of excess. Yet that \nsame greed continues today.\n  A bonus that dwarfs an average American worker's entire annual salary \nis excessive. Doing so in a way that threatens our economy is \ndangerous, wrong, and a slap in the face to the American people. Main \nStreet jobless rates and Wall Street bonuses should not rise at the \nsame time. Seniors who rely on Social Security should not be \nshortchanged while the traders who threaten our economic security are \nrewarded. Taxpayer money that was supposed to keep our economic pillars \nfrom collapsing should not go directly from your savings to a brash \nbroker's pocket.\n  If the executives who designed these windfalls came out of their \ncorner offices, they would see how badly Americans are suffering. They \nwould see how offensive these paydays are. They would see how \ndesperately hard-working families are struggling to hold on to their \njobs, to their homes, and to health care. And they would be ashamed.\n  We must put an end to the recklessness that got us into this mess. We \ncannot accept more of the same.\n  Last week, the Treasury Department announced that it would reasonably \nlimit the excessive paychecks of the top executives at companies in \nwhich you and I and every American now own an equity stake. I support \nthat plan. Then the Federal Reserve announced it will rein in banks \nthat reward the riskiest practices--gambles that endanger all of us. \nThey should be reined in. I support that too.\n  In the near future, we will reform our financial industry through \nlegislation commonly referred to as regulatory reform. We will make \nsure banks are compensating their employees in a prudent way. That \nmeans firms won't be able to throw cash at a trader who closes a big, \nrisky deal--one that puts the whole bank at risk and that threatens \ntaxpayers and the greater financial system as well.\n  The Treasury, the Fed, and the Congress will play their parts. \nRegulation has its role, but I have never believed government is the \nanswer to everything. That is why Wall Street has to take \nresponsibility for its own actions also.\n  This industry, more than any other, knows the importance of sending \nsignals. The stock market hinges on hints, the trading floors run on \nrumors, and these public companies live and die by the confidence they \ninstill, the impressions they inspire, and the messages they send. So \nthese firms--whether or not they owe the government for their \nsurvival--should be careful about what their actions say about them \nbecause the American people are listening closely. Greed got us into \nthis mess; it will not get us out. If we are going to continue to \nrecover and ultimately prosper, this perverse culture and destructive \nbehavior cannot continue. How many more times must we learn the same \nlesson?\n\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I \nwill have to object, I am going to offer a counter unanimous-consent \nrequest that includes a universe of eight amendments. The majority \nleader has six.\n  We would be happy to accept short time agreements. It strikes me that \nunder my consent agreement we would finish about as rapidly as we would \nunder the consent agreement the majority leader just propounded.\n  With that, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say to the senior Senator from Kentucky \nthat I think the amendments we have suggested are in keeping with what \nwe are trying to do. We deal with a first-time home buyer tax credit. \nWe deal with the loss carryback, which people talk about being very \nimportant. We talk about another bipartisan amendment offered by the \nSenator from Virginia and the Senator from Tennessee, setting up a \nprogram where there would be trustees to oversee the ownership we have \nin various TARP properties. I think we have been so reasonable.\n  I understand my friend, the Senator from Kentucky, not being able to \nagree\n\n[[Page S10713]]\n\nat this time. I hope we can get this done. I do not want to have just a \nvote on cloture. I think probably on this we could do it, but I think \nit is the wrong message that we cannot work out some amendments.\n  I see no reason that we have to do immigration on this bill; that is \nwhat E-Verify is about. I don't know how many more times we have to \npound on ACORN. We have voted on that many times already. I think we \nare being reasonable.\n  I think Senator Bunning, if he would look at the amendment we have \nsuggested, which is out of the Finance Committee--and it is my \nunderstanding it is bipartisan--which would cover net operating losses, \nthen Senator Bunning would get everything he asked for under his \namendment. It is just where the money would come from. It is all paid \nfor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10713-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3548\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, again, the two consent agreements have \na universe of six amendments on my friend's side and eight on our side. \nWe are willing to agree to short time agreements on each amendment. I \nam fairly confident in saying it would not take much more floor time, \nif any, to pursue the underlying bill, which almost everyone supports, \nin a form that would encompass the opportunity to offer eight \namendments.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 3548, which was received from the \nHouse, and that the following amendments be the only amendments in \norder:\n  Reid-Baucus substitute; Baucus side-by-side amendment for housing tax \ncredit; Isakson-Dodd, home buyer tax credit; Johanns, alternative \nsubstitute; Vitter, ACORN; Bennett-Thune, TARP sunset; Corker-Warner, \nTARP; Sessions, E-Verify; Bunning, operating losses.\n  I further ask unanimous consent that following the disposition of the \nabove-listed amendments, the bill, as amended, be read the third time, \nand the Senate proceed to a vote on passage.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. REID. Reserving the right to object, frankly, I think it is \nunfortunate that we could not just vote on extending the unemployment \nbenefits for the masses in our country who are out of work and are \ndesperate. There are thousands and thousands of people who are waiting \nfor us to get something done.\n  The issues that are brought up are issues we can deal with, but it \nshould not be at the expense of wasting all this time. We have been \ntrying to get this done--the unemployment extension--for weeks. With \neach day that goes by more people in America have less money. If we \nwant to talk about stimulating the economy, try giving a check to \nsomebody who is out of work. They spend that money.\n  I will continue to try to be fair and reasonable with the \nRepublicans, who are so bound and determined to slow us up on \neverything, including checks for people who are desperate for work. I \nhope we don't come to a point where we have to just vote on extending \nunemployment benefits. That would be unfortunate. The proposals they \nhave made are unnecessary, but I am trying to go above and beyond what \nis fair. We are willing to step way in the other direction just to move \nthings along. But to vote on immigration matters and on ACORN, which we \nhave done so many times, is only dilatory.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, as my good friend, the majority leader, \nknows, the easiest way to move it along is with a time agreement, as \nopposed to going through the normal processes in the Senate. I have a \nfeeling the majority leader wants to object to my consent.\n  Mr. REID. I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, the reason for having a consent \nagreement is to expedite the process, do it more quickly. We have two \ncompeting consent agreements: one with six amendments and one with \neight. Either one would move the process along. We will continue to \ntalk about it and, hopefully, we can get this worked out in a way that \nis mutually satisfactory.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10713-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  UNANIMOUS-CONSENT REQUEST--H.R. 3548\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, these are not competing consent agreements. \nThis is an effort to try to get something the American people should \nhave--the most unfortunate people who have been out of work for an \nextended period of time--which is unemployment compensation checks.\n  I ask unanimous consent that we pass H.R. 3548 with no amendments; \nthat is, benefits that will go to people who have been out of work for \nan extended period of time. This is an act to amend the Supplemental \nAppropriations Act of 2008 to provide for the temporary availability of \ncertain additional emergency unemployment compensation. I hope we can \nmove forward with that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, we have \njust had a discussion about two consent agreements, each of which has a \nvery limited number of amendments. There is no reason we cannot reach \nan agreement to take up the underlying bill, with a limited number of \namendments, and finish the bill expeditiously.\n  Simply cutting people off and not allowing any amendments at all is \nnot an acceptable approach. Therefore, I object.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, it is not a question of having no \namendments. We agreed to have six. I think that is unnecessary. My \nfriends in the minority are continuing to slow-walk unemployment \ncompensation, while people are desperate for these small checks that \nthey get to keep the rent paid and pay for groceries for their kids. I \nthink we should do this today, get it done now.\n  I understand there is an objection. I think it is unfortunate.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Well, Mr. President, the only thing that would slow \nthis down would not be to reach a consent agreement. We will continue \nto talk to the majority leader and, hopefully, we can reach an \nagreement for a reasonable amount of amendments.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10713-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10713]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I will let the majority leader make his \nown announcements, but there are a lot of discussions in the news media \ntoday that in a short period of time he intends to hold a press \nconference announcing that he will push ahead with the so-called public \noption in the health care legislation--one that currently includes an \nopt-out provision for States.\n  I don't know whether he intends to do that or whether he doesn't. He \nis entitled to make his own announcement, as I said. But it provides a \ngood opportunity to talk about what we mean by a public option in \nhealth care, or a government-run health care plan, putting government \nin the health care business, and how it already works, and how it might \nwork if States were allowed to opt out.\n  The reason it is easy to talk about this is--and the former Governor \nof Virginia, who is presiding, knows this as well as I do, and maybe \nbetter because he has been Governor more recently--we already have in \nexistence in the United States today a public option health insurance \nprogram which States may opt out of. It is called Medicaid.\n  Medicaid is the largest government-run program we have in health \ncare--even larger than Medicare. Medicare, for older people, has about \n40 million persons who depend on it. Medicaid,\n\n[[Page S10714]]\n\nwhich sometimes offers confusion, is a different program. It is a \nprogram for low-income Americans. It started out for women and \nchildren, but it gradually expanded, and today it has nearly 60 million \nAmericans who depend on it. The health care legislation, which is \ncoming forward in the Baucus bill out of the Finance Committee and the \nHELP Committee, on which I serve, and the bills in the House of \nRepresentatives--all those pieces of legislation would expand the \nMedicaid Program--not Medicare for seniors but the Medicaid Program--\nand send part of the bill for that expansion to the State.\n  So let's talk about that a little bit, particularly if it is true \nthat the majority leader is about to propose that we have yet another \ngovernment-run insurance program, giving the States the right to opt \nout, which sounds pretty good. Let's see how this one works that we \nalready have, especially since the health reform bill that is headed \nour way would expand Medicaid, and according to the Congressional \nBudget Office, cost States an additional $33 billion in State dollars \nand add 14 million people to Medicaid.\n  I guess the first thing to know about a government-run health \ninsurance program which States can opt out of is that they can't. I \nmean, in the real world, they can't. Not one has. Every State in \nAmerica has Medicaid. The Federal Government pays roughly 60 percent of \nit; State taxpayers pay the rest. Most of the rules are written in \nWashington. States can ask for exemptions from the rules, but it is a \nlong and burdensome process. It is not realistic to say the States can \nopt out of the Medicaid Program for low-income Americans. I suppose it \nmight not be realistic, therefore, to say the States would be able to \nopt out of a new government-run program--a government-run, public-\noption program--that may be suggested by the majority leader. We should \nwait and see what he proposes, but I think we would be wise to pay \nattention to the fact that in the current government-run program we \nhave today, no State finds it realistic to opt out.\n  Expanding Medicaid, which is what the health reform bill coming \ntoward us on the floor proposes to do, is not just an expensive item \nfor the Federal Government and for States, it is a terrible vehicle for \nhealth care reform. The current Governor of Tennessee--Governor \nBredesen--a Democrat--has said putting more low-income Americans into \nMedicaid is not health care reform. Why would he say that? Because it \nmakes it worse for those Americans as they seek to get access to care \nfrom doctors and hospitals and as they seek to get good, quality care. \nPlus, the program is riddled with so much fraud and abuse that, \naccording to the Congressional Budget Office, $1 out of every $10 is \nstolen or wasted.\n  Most Governors who have struggled with Medicaid--and I am one of \nthem--agree that its expansion is a bad idea. They unanimously have \nsaid to us in Congress that if you in Washington want to expand \nMedicaid, then you in Washington need to pay for Medicaid. That is the \ntheory of no more unfunded mandates that every Governor whom I know \nabout has agreed with for years. In fact, there was nothing that used \nto make me angrier as a Governor than for a distinguished politician in \nWashington to stand, make a speech, come up with a good idea, hold a \npress conference declaring a problem solved, and then send the bill to \nthe States. So what does the Governor and the legislature and the mayor \nand the city council have to do? They have to cut services, they have \nto raise taxes, they have to run up tuition, they have to cut out some \nclasses because somebody in Washington thought it was a good idea to do \nthis. Well, that is what we are proposing to do with Medicaid. We are \nsaying to the States: We have a great idea. We want to expand Medicaid \nby dumping another 14 million low-income Americans into this program, \nbut congratulations, we are going to send you the bill to help pay for \nit.\n  The Washington Post quoted my home State Governor, Governor Bredesen, \nto whom I just referred, this way in regard to health care reform:\n\n       I can't think of a worse time for this bill to be coming. I \n     would love to see it but nobody is going to put their State \n     into bankruptcy or their education system into the tank for \n     it.\n\n  One of the most painful letters I have ever read was from Governor \nBredesen, which he sent on October 5, when he wrote about Tennessee's \nfiscal situation--similar to the condition in most States. He said:\n\n       By 2013 we expect to return to our 2008 levels of revenue \n     and will have already cut programs dramatically--over $1 \n     billion. At that point we will have to start digging out--we \n     will not have given raises to State employees or teachers for \n     5 years. Our pension plans will need shoring up. Our rainy \n     day fund will be depleted . . . we will not have made any \n     substantial investments for years . . . There will be major \n     cuts to areas such as children's services. On top of these, \n     there are the usual obligations that need to be met--\n     Medicaid, for example, will continue to grow at rates in \n     excess of the economy and our tax revenues.\n\n  Our idea of health care reform is to expand Medicaid and send \nGovernor Bredesen a bill for $735 million over the next 5 years, which \nwe can't afford.\n  The other legislation, from the HELP Committee, would cost the States \neven more. According to an actuarial report from the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, Medicaid represented 40 percent of the \nFederal Government's cost expenditures for health care; 41 percent of \nState health care costs. It is the largest source of general revenue-\nbased spending in health services--larger than Medicare.\n  I can vividly remember, 25 years ago, 30 years ago, as Governor, \nevery time I made up a budget, I would start with roads. That comes \nfrom the gas tax. I would go to prisons. The court said to fund that. I \nwould go to K-12 grades. Our Presiding Officer, the former Governor of \nVirginia, has had this experience. That is pretty much a set thing. \nThen you get down to the end and what are you choosing between? You are \nchoosing between higher education--the University of Tennessee or the \nUniversity of Virginia--and Medicaid. What is happening? Medicaid is \ngoing up like a rocket and State spending for higher education is flat. \nOur great higher educations systems across this country are under great \nstresses because of poor State funding because we have allowed Medicaid \nto grow out of control.\n  Not only do we do that, we are now about to expand it--about to \nexpand it and send more of the bill to the States. The Governors are \nsaying: Don't do that. Their revenues are down 17, 18, 20, 35 percent \nin some States. If you are going to pass it, they say: Pay for it. That \nis a question Governors should have a chance to ask and get an answer \nto.\n  According to the Texas Medicaid office, the current proposal to \nexpand Medicaid will cost the State $20 billion over the next 10 years. \nWe are passing it, they are paying for that much of it. According to \nthe South Carolina Governor's office, $1.1 billion over 10 years. \nGovernor Schwarzenegger has said for California it could be as high as \n$8 billion a year.\n  A New York Times article, in late September, said this:\n\n       The recession is driving up enrollment in Medicaid at \n     higher than expected rates, threatening gargantuan State \n     budget gaps even as Congress and the White House seek to \n     expand the government health insurance program for the poor \n     and disabled . . .\n\n  The New York Times went on to say:\n\n       . . . enrollment in state Medicaid programs grew by an \n     average of 5.4 percent in the previous fiscal year, the \n     highest rate in 6 years. . . . In eight states, the growth \n     exceeded 10 percent.\n\n  So States have headlines such as this: ``State Looks at $1 Billion in \nCuts.'' Their Medicaid is already growing at a rate faster than they \ncan pay for, and we are sending them more bills than they can pay for.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will be happy to yield.\n  Mr. DURBIN. We had a bill considered earlier this year--a stimulus \nbill--that sent $80 billion to the States so they could deal with the \nexpenses of Medicaid during the recession and also, obviously, their \nState's declining revenue, an attempt for us to help Governors facing \nthe horrible decisions which the Senator described.\n  If I recall correctly, only three Republicans voted for President \nObama's stimulus package to help these States with $80 billion in aid. \nWould the Senator like to factor that into his conversation about \nsensitivity to what the States are facing?\n\n[[Page S10715]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I thank the distinguished assistant Democratic leader \nfor raising the point. It is a point I would be delighted to address.\n  I voted against that proposal. That proposal was a backdoor effort in \nwhat was a so-called jobs bill to spend $85 billion over 2 years for \nMedicaid. That is one reason why we have 10 percent unemployment today, \nbecause the money that was supposed to be for the stimulus was borrowed \nfrom the biggest deficits we have ever run up in history and spent on \nsomething other than jobs.\n\n  What it also did was it unrealistically lifted the level of Medicaid \nspending in Tennessee and every other State, forcing an expansion of \nthat program, which I will go on to show in a minute is nearly cruel to \nthe people who are dumped into the program because doctors and \nhospitals will not serve them.\n  So I was glad to vote against that program. I was sorry it passed \nbecause it borrowed money we don't have to spend on programs that \ndidn't create jobs, and it artificially lifted and expanded Medicaid, \nwhich is already bankrupting the States.\n  Medicaid expansion is not real health care reform. One reason is \nbecause 40 percent--according to a 2002 Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommittee survey--of the physicians restrict access for Medicaid \npatients; meaning they will not take new Medicaid patients because \nreimbursement rates are so low. Only about half of U.S. physicians \naccept new Medicaid patients compared with more than 70 percent who \naccept new Medicare--those are the seniors--patients.\n  According to a 2002 study in the Journal of American Academy of \nPediatrics, the national rate for pediatricians who accept all Medicaid \npatients was 55 percent. In Tennessee, it was lower than that. Why is \nthat? It is because reimbursement rates are so low. Today, doctors who \nsee patients who are on Medicare get paid about 80 percent of what \nprivate insurers pay. Doctors who see patients who are on Medicaid get \npaid about 61 or 62 percent of what private insurers pay. For doctors \nwho see children, it is sometimes lower than that. So doctors don't see \nthose patients. What is going to happen if we dump 14 more million low-\nincome Americans into a system such as that? Those patients--especially \nthose children--are going to have a harder time finding doctors and \nhospitals to take care of them. It would be akin to giving somebody a \nticket and a pat on the back to a bus line that only operated 50 \npercent of the time.\n  Further, the quality of care for Medicaid patients is significantly \nlower than those with private insurance and even those with no \ninsurance. According to a survey by the National Hospital Ambulatory \nMedical Care, Medicaid patients visit the emergency room at nearly \ntwice the rate of uninsured patients. A 2007 study by the Journal of \nthe American Medical Association found that patients enrolled in \nMedicaid were less likely to achieve good blood pressure control, \nreceive breast cancer screening, have timely prenatal care than similar \nparents in private plans, and they had lower survival rates.\n  I mentioned this a little earlier. According to the Government \nAccountability Office, Medicaid--the program we are seeking to expand, \nthe government-run insurance program that sounds so good, the so-called \nlargest public option plan we have to date, the plan where about half \nthe doctors will not take new patients who are on the program--had \n$32.7 billion in improper payments in 2007 alone; 10 percent of the \nprogram's total spending is wasted.\n  So as we consider a so-called public option, I hope we will look at \nthe public option we already have--called Medicaid--one which already \nhas an opt-out provision for States, one which already has 60 million \nlow-income Americans in it, one into which we plan to put 14 million \nmore Americans, so that 50 percent of the doctors will say to new \npatients: I can't see you because the reimbursement rates are so low. \nMedicaid is the public option we have right now. States could opt out \nof it, but quality is low, fraud is high, costs are up, and Governors \nof States on both sides of the aisle are saying: We are headed toward \nbankruptcy at the present rate. If you are sending us more bills, if \nyou want to expand it, pay for it. And doctors are turning away \npatients.\n  The American people deserve better than that. I am a cosponsor of a \nbipartisan bill that would actually reduce the number of patients on \nMedicaid. It is called the Wyden-Bennett bill. It adds no cost to the \ngovernment. That bill is not being seriously considered.\n  The other approach that we Republicans believe we should take is \nfocusing on reducing costs to the government, focus on reducing the \ncost of premiums; take four or five steps in the right direction and \nexpand services to uninsured patients as we go. One way to do that, of \ncourse, would be the Small Business Health Insurance bill, which has \nbroad support in both Houses, which would permit small businesses to \ncome together and pool their resources. The estimates are that at least \n1 million more Americans would be covered by employer insurance if that \nwere to happen. Some estimates say many more millions.\n  But especially on a day when the press has it rumored that the \nmajority leader may offer a new government-run insurance program with \nthe States having the opportunity to opt out, I hope Americans will \nlook carefully at the current government-run insurance program which \nStates have the option to opt out of, but none do, and note that it has \n60 million Americans--it is soon to have 74 million; half the doctors \nwon't see new patients because of reimbursement rates; and $1 out of \n$10 is wasted. It is not a solution to health care and neither is a new \npublic option.\n  I yield the floor and thank the Senator from Illinois for his \nquestion.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10715-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10715-S10717]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I think we ought to step back and take a \nlook at this health care debate. The Senator from Tennessee has raised \nsome interesting questions that we should consider and discuss.\n  The reality in America today is that the cost of health care is out \nof control. We know it as individuals because the health care premiums \nkeep going up. In fact, the health insurance industry not only \nannounced but threatened 2 weeks ago that if we pass health care \nreform, premiums are going to go up again. Businesses are now reporting \nthey anticipate the cost of health insurance premiums to cover their \nemployees to go up at least 15 percent next year.\n  This is not new. Unfortunately it has become a pattern, a pattern \nthat continues to raise the cost of health insurance across America. \nFewer businesses offer protection, fewer individuals can afford to buy \nhealth insurance, and that is the reality, where we are today.\n  We have put forward now five different proposals, and the sixth is \ncoming, to deal with health care reform. President Obama challenged \nthis Congress to work together on a bipartisan basis to solve this \nproblem, to bring costs under control. During the course of our debate \non it, we identified some other serious problems in our health care \nsystem. We know what the health insurance companies do to people across \nAmerica. They hire literally hundreds if not thousands of employees to \nsit in front of computer terminals with a sign above them that says \njust say no, so when the doctor calls and says I wish to admit Mrs. \nSmith for surgery or I wish to keep her in the hospital an extra 2 \ndays, the answer is no and the battle is on. I know this because I have \nbeen in the hospitals of my hometown of Springfield, IL, standing with \ndoctors at the nurses desk as they call the health insurance clerks in \nfaraway States and beg them to allow a person to stay in the hospital \nso she will be there the night before her surgery. They were turned \ndown and one doctor turned to me and said, ``I cannot in good \nconscience send this woman home. I am going to have her stay and we \nwill fight them later on.'' I said, ``Does this happen often?'' And he \nsaid, ``All the time.''\n  Fighting health insurance for coverage when you need it the most, as \nthey go through your application and find out that you did not put in \nsome minor medical experience that you had--you know, it is not a \nfanciful story. In fact, it is a sad story. People have been turned \ndown for coverage for health insurance when they need it the most for \nsurgery because they failed to\n\n[[Page S10716]]\n\ndisclose they had acne when they were teenagers. It sounds as though I \nam making that up, but I am not. That is a fact. When they want to turn \nyou down, any excuse will do. We know this is happening. People, \nbecause of preexisting conditions, are being denied coverage. When they \nneed their health insurance the most, after paying into it year after \nyear, here comes that diagnosis that is going to require expensive \ntreatment or a surgery or hospitalization or missing work, they find \nout the coverage is not going to be there or there is going to be a cap \non the coverage.\n  We know these stories. We live with these stories. People are calling \nus, saying the health insurance company says no, they won't pay for it. \nAnd the battle is on. So part of health care reform is to deal with \nthis health insurance reform too.\n  I have to say in all candor to my Republican colleagues, they have \nyet to come forward with any proposal for health care reform. They just \nsay no. Whenever we come up with a proposal, it is not good enough, it \ndoesn't reach the goals they want to reach. But when we ask them what \nwould you do, they have nothing. When the HELP Committee, which is the \nHealth, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee of the Senate, now \nunder the chairmanship of Senator Harkin and then under the temporary \nchairmanship of Senator Chris Dodd of Connecticut while Senator Kennedy \nwas going through his cancer therapy--when they considered this bill \nthey had literally hundreds of amendments, 500 amendments in open \nhearing as they went through this bill.\n  It is not a surprise. This is a big undertaking. Health care reform \nis the biggest domestic issue we have ever faced in this country--ever. \nIt comprises one-sixth of our economy. There were 500-plus amendments, \nday after day, hour after hour, debating back and forth. At the end of \nthe day, the bill was finished. The committee had adopted over 150 \nRepublican amendments they had offered to the bill. Senator Dodd \nbelieved it had a fair hearing--it is a bipartisan bill with input from \nboth sides--and he called the roll in the committee to see if we could \nmove the bill forward to the floor. Not one single Republican Senator \nwould vote for it. Even after adding all those amendments they would \nnot stand up and vote for the bill to move forward to the floor. Again, \nfaced with the challenge of writing a bill, it is easier to stand back \nand say here is what is wrong with what you are doing. But in good \nfaith they should step forward and be part of it.\n  Senator Max Baucus in the Senate Finance Committee had one of the \ntoughest assignments. He had to deal not only with policy but also with \npaying for it. That is what the Senate Finance Committee is all about. \nSo what Senator Baucus did, for months, was to engage three Republican \nSenators on his committee: Senator Grassley of Iowa, Senator Enzi of \nWyoming, Senator Snowe of Maine. Three Democratic Senators sat down \nwith three Republican Senators and said let's come up with a bipartisan \nbill. Let's try to reach agreement among ourselves as to how to do this \nin a bipartisan fashion. Eventually, after literally months of trying, \ntwo of the Republican Senators left, leaving only Senator Snowe of \nMaine, who ultimately supported the committee bill that came forward.\n  She is an unusual profile in courage in the Senate. She is the only \nRepublican in the House or Senate who has ever voted in committee as a \nRepublican to bring a bill forward on health care reform. It showed \nextraordinary courage on her part. But it also showed that despite the \nbest efforts in both of these committees in open session and in closed \nmeetings, we could not get Republican buy-in for health care reform. \nThey are opposed to everything.\n  Unfortunately, to be opposed to everything is not a way to solve a \nproblem. The current health care system in America is unsustainable. It \ncosts too much. The costs are going up too fast--not just for \nindividuals, families, and businesses, but for government as well. The \nhealth insurance companies are running roughshod over people who, when \nthey need it the most, cannot count on the health insurance protection \nthey thought they had purchased. It is a reality that in the bankruptcy \ncourts across America today, two out of three people filing for \nbankruptcy in America are filing because of medical bills. It has grown \nover the last few years from one out of three to two out of three. \nSadly, that percentage is going to continue to grow because you know \nwhat happens--a person goes in after an accident, a diagnosis, goes \ninto the hospital for what appeared to be a brief stay and the next \nthing you know a bill comes rolling through for $80,000 or $100,000 or \nmore. These bills pile up in an amazing fashion and you have no control \nover them. You are there at the instruction of your doctor, receiving \nthe care the doctor said you should receive. You don't stop before the \nnurse leaves the room and say how much do those pills cost? It is the \nreality that we are helpless, defenseless, when we are in that \nposition.\n\n  So people have these medical bills stack up in an attempt to find a \ncure or to save a life. At the end of the day, the health insurance \ndoesn't cover them. They file for bankruptcy. But here is the statistic \nyou should remember. In addition to 2 out of 3 people in bankruptcy \nbecause of medical bills, 74 percent of those people filing for \nbankruptcy because of medical bills have health insurance. They are not \nuninsured. They have health insurance that was not there when they \nneeded it; health insurance that cut them off when they thought they \nhad coverage; health insurance that had a limit on how much it would \npay and they were left in a position where they were about to lose \neverything. They may be able to hang onto a truck or a toolkit or maybe \neven a small home, but their savings are gone, wiped out, because of a \ndiagnosis or an accident.\n  That is the reality of where we are today and why we continue to \nengage this issue, despite the controversy that surrounds it.\n  Senator Harry Reid is the majority leader in the Senate and he has a \ntough job. He is in the process of taking the two bills prepared by the \nSenate committees, bringing them together into something that can pass \nthe Senate. It is hard. There are a lot of policy questions and a lot \nof strong feelings. Within the Senate Democratic caucus are members who \nare very conservative, moderate, and liberal. We have it all, a wide \nrange. We agree on some things but there is disagreement when it comes \nto other things. One of the questions that came up, one of the issues \nof controversy, was about the so-called public option. In shorthand, \nthe public option is an attempt to create some form of health insurance \nprotection that is a not-for-profit plan--it doesn't have to worry \nabout paying profits to shareholders; isn't going to buy a fortune's \nworth of advertising; doesn't have to hire a lot of clerks to say no \nbut tries to keep costs under control and compete with private health \ninsurance companies.\n  We should be concerned about this because, without a public option--\nand it is only an option--without a public option, these health \ninsurance companies have virtually no restrictions on what they can \ncharge us. I say that because health insurance--insurance in general \nbut health insurance companies--enjoy special treatment under American \nlaw. There are only two businesses in America that are exempt from \nantitrust law. One happens to be organized baseball; the other, the \ninsurance industry. You say: What does that mean? It means that back \n110 years ago when they took a look at the insurance industry, they \nargued that because it was subject to State regulation in every State, \nit was not interstate business. Students of the Constitution know there \nis an interstate commerce clause there that gives the Federal \nGovernment authority when we are dealing with interstate business. So \nhealth insurance companies and insurance companies in general were \njudged to be State businesses and exempt from antitrust law.\n  Then fast forward about 50 years. The Supreme Court took a look at \ninsurance companies and said this has changed. These are no longer \nsmall insurance companies regulated State by State. They are now doing \nbusiness nationwide, and so the Court decided in the 1940s that the \nexemption from antitrust law would no longer apply. A Senator from \nNevada serving at that time, Senator McCarran, offered the McCarran-\nFerguson bill, which became law and exempted insurance companies from \nantitrust laws.\n\n[[Page S10717]]\n\n  That is a long lead-in to where we are today. What it means is that \nthe insurance companies, unlike any other businesses in America, can \nliterally meet in a closed room and decide to fix their prices. They \nwill decide what premiums they will charge for insurance policies all \nacross America. They can decide to allocate the market. One insurance \ncompany X, you take Chicago; insurance company Y, you take St. Louis; \ninsurance company Z, you get New York. Any other business that tried to \ndo that would be sued by the Federal Government for restraint of trade, \nfor killing competition. But they are exempt and that is a fact.\n  So when the insurance companies, health insurance companies, tell us \nthey are going to raise premiums, mark their words; they are going to \ndo it and they have the power to do it and they can do it speaking as \none and we cannot stop them under the current law as it exists. That is \nthe reality.\n  The public option says there at least will be a choice out there for \neverybody who is in an insurance exchange, looking for a choice. There \nwill at least be a choice out there that is not a private health \ninsurance company: a not-for-profit company, not subsidized by the \nFederal Government, that is going to deal with providers across America \nto try to bring costs down.\n  The Senator from Tennessee said this public option is what Medicaid \nis but he is mistaken. Medicaid is different. Medicaid is a government \ninsurance plan. What is the difference in this situation is there would \nbe no government subsidy to this public option and the public option \nentity, the insurance company, the not-for-profit insurance company, \nwould have to negotiate arm's-length transactions, negotiate with \ndoctors and hospitals on the rates they would be paid. There is no \ngovernment mandate on the rates paid. That is not the case in Medicaid \nat all. So the analogy falls apart. When the Senator from Tennessee \nsays public option is basically Medicaid, it is not. Medicaid is a \ngovernment plan, public option is not a government plan. Medicaid has \ngovernment command and control when it comes to the amount they are \npaying. This plan has to negotiate arm's-length transactions. It is \ntotally different.\n  I might say a word about Medicaid. I asked the Senator from \nTennessee, earlier this year because of the recession, President Obama \nsaid: We think the States are in trouble. We think the governments are \nin trouble. With the recession, fewer people are working, fewer people \nare paying taxes, and the demand for government services is going up. \nSo we need to help them. We came up with $80 billion, $85 billion to \nsend back to the States in a rescue fund so they could get through this \nrecession. Unfortunately, we didn't have the support from the other \nside of the aisle. So when the Senator from Tennessee comes in and says \nthese governments are facing hard times, it is true they are, but the \ntimes would have been much harder for these governments without \nPresident Obama's stimulus package, which tried to help these States \nget through this rough period.\n  In the stimulus bill, the State of Tennessee received almost $760 \nmillion in FMAP, which is basically Medicaid payments. There are only \nthree Republican Senators who voted for it, not including the Senator \nfrom Tennessee. So when we tried to help the States deal with the \nexpenses they face, many of those who are coming to the floor today did \nnot vote for it. I think that needs to be part of the record.\n  Let me also say the costs are going up for health care in general, \nand that affects the cost of Medicaid. Medicaid is for the poorest \npeople in America. Medicaid, by and large, when it comes to those under \nthe age of 65, covers children. These are the children of poor \nfamilies. The only compensation to the doctors and hospitals when they \nshow up, if there is any, comes from Medicaid.\n  Also, it covers those who are elderly and very poor. You find some of \nthem living in nursing homes across America. They have lost everything. \nThey have nothing left. They have their Medicare and the help of \nMedicaid.\n  The argument that Medicaid is a bad system and poor system--it is \neasy to criticize that system, and it should be improved. What would we \ndo without it? What would happen to these elderly people who have \nnowhere to turn and no savings, who are living the last months and \nyears of their lives because of Medicare and Medicaid?\n  The States, of course, say the Federal Government should give them \nmore money for Medicaid. I wish we could. In my State, incidentally, it \nis about a 50-50 split in Medicaid. For every dollar in Medicaid, 50 \ncents comes from the Federal Government and 50 cents from the State \ngovernment. Other States are more generous with more money coming in.\n  The fact is, I know it is tough on governments to keep up with the \nexpenses. What is the alternative? Is the alternative to ignore any \nhealth care for poor people? They will still get sick. As sick as they \nturn out to be, they will still show up at the hospital, and in our \ncompassion we will treat them and the cure will be paid for by \neverybody else who has health insurance.\n  I might also say I believe the opt-out provision, which is being \ndiscussed as part of our approach, says we are going to create these \npublic options, these not-for-profit health insurance companies in \nStates across the Nation. But if a State decides through its Governor \nand its legislature they don't want to be part of it, they can opt out \nof the system.\n  I cannot think of a fairer approach. It will be tough for some States \nto do that because the public sentiment is pretty strong, almost 2 to 1 \nin favor of a public option. People understand they want to have a low-\ncost alternative and not be stuck with the premiums the private health \ninsurance companies decide to charge.\n  So I say in response to my colleague from Tennessee, whom I respect \nand call a friend, I don't believe characterizing the public option as \nthe same as Medicaid is a fair characterization, and I don't think opt \nout is an unfair approach. I think there is fairness to it, allowing \neach State to make the decision what it will do based on the needs of \nthe people who live in that State, and the people in the State will \nhave the final say at the next election as to whether the legislature \nand the Governor made the best choice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10717-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10717-S10718]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    EXTENDING UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, it has been 18 days since the Senate \nDemocrats tried to pass a strong unemployment insurance extension only \nto see the bill blocked by the other side of the aisle. Since that \ntime, over 125,000 Americans trying to find work have lost their \nunemployment benefits; 125,000 families across America now have the \nhardest possible question to answer: How are we going to keep food on \nthe table? How are we going to keep a roof over the heads of myself and \nmy family? Unfortunately, we have been unable to move an extension of \nunemployment benefits on the floor of the Senate.\n  This is unusual because in times gone by, this was never even \ncontroversial. Extending unemployment benefits was expected. If the \neconomy was in recession and jobs were lost, we stepped up, both \nparties, and said: We can debate a lot of things, but let's understand \nthere are a lot of Americans in very difficult circumstances who need a \nhelping hand. That is not this time. Unfortunately, at this point in \ntime, it has become a politically controversial issue about whether to \nextend unemployment benefits to people.\n  I have heard from a lot of people back in Illinois. A week ago in \nChicago, I met with a room full of unemployed people and talked with \nthem about their expenses first hand--people who have been out of work \nfor long periods of time and are desperate to find a job. These people \nwere all in training to improve their skills to get a better chance at \nemployment. They told me about losing their health insurance. They \nworry about losing their homes. They are depleting their savings. They \ndon't know which way to turn.\n  That is the reality. Any image anyone has of people on unemployment \nenjoying it and lazily waiting for the next check I think would be \ncompletely obviated by a visit with people who are unemployed.\n  I hope all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will sit down \nwith these families who are asking us for unemployment benefits.\n  A 50-year-old woman in Machesney Park wrote me recently:\n\n\n[[Page S10718]]\n\n\n       I have worked steadily since I was 16. I am now 51 and have \n     only had to collect unemployment once in those 35 years. I \n     received my last unemployment check the first week in \n     September [of this year]. I [look for] work every day. If I \n     could just find a part-time job at 25 to 35 hours a week, I \n     could get by. . . .\n       [Our families] have exhausted our retirement accounts just \n     to keep [paying the bills]. Now we fear not being able to \n     survive when retirement comes. So I do want to thank you and \n     wish to stress the urgency in getting this bill passed. Do \n     not give up on us hard-working American citizens.\n\n  A wife and mother in Fox River Grove wrote me and said:\n\n       I am a 59-year-old educated woman who lost my job in April \n     2008. I was just informed that my unemployment benefits will \n     run out in [30 days]. I have been actively looking all this \n     time but there is little out there for me.\n       I can't believe that people are going to be turned away for \n     benefits when there is nothing out there for us to do. . . .\n       After years of working, putting two kids through college \n     (MBA and [another master's degree]), we thought at last we \n     could save for our retirement. I guess now keeping our house \n     should be [a higher priority]. My 94-year-old mother has \n     moved in with us because she lost her house so we are trying \n     to [help her get along].\n       Please convince Congress to extend unemployment [benefits] \n     until we can see a light at the end of the unemployment \n     tunnel.\n\n  A young lady from Chicago wrote me:\n\n       I have been out of work since January 2009. I am currently \n     collecting unemployment benefits, but am nearing the end [of \n     eligibility for benefits].\n       I don't have crazy outstanding bills, actually, I have no \n     debt other than a $300 credit card that has fallen into \n     arrears. I'm just trying to get by living in the city of \n     Chicago. I have $12.58 in my checking account and $5.81 in my \n     savings account.\n       I don't have a mortgage. I don't eat out. I don't even have \n     cable. No kids in school. No health club membership. I also \n     don't have insurance. I know you're working on that for us \n     now, and I appreciate that. But this unemployment bill needs \n     to pass quickly because as I understand it, 20,000 Illinois \n     residents will lose their benefits in the next few months and \n     I am one of [them].\n       I spend 10 [or more] hours a day dividing my time between \n     job searching and trying to drum up business for a small \n     business I am trying to get started. . . .\n       Senator, please, please, please pass this bill. If not for \n     me whose credit has been ruined by nonpayment of a $300 bill, \n     then for the 20,000 other Illinois residents who have much \n     larger bills, mortgages and families counting on them.\n\n  How are we supposed to justify to the people we represent across \nAmerica that we cannot take up and pass this extension of unemployment \nbenefits? These unemployment benefits are paid from a fund that is \ncollected from workers and their employers during the course of their \nwork career. We put a little bit of money away each week on the chance \nthat someone facing unemployment will need that money to get by.\n\n  These people are asking for an extension of their benefits from a \nfund into which they paid. It is deeply troubling to me that we can't \nhelp these people and thousands like them.\n  The Senator from Kentucky, Mr. McConnell, the Republican leader, came \nearlier and said the reason we can't do this is because we need to \nconsider a few amendments to it.\n  Last week, the No. 2 man in the Republican leadership, Senator Jon \nKyl of Arizona, said his side, the Republican side, wanted amendments \nto the unemployment compensation bill on ``stuff that pertains to the \nsubject--how do you pay for it, for example.''\n  I will tell you that the list of amendments given to us to add to the \nunemployment bill go far beyond what the Senator from Arizona said. For \nexample, there is a group of Senators over there who want to get into a \ndebate about immigration. This is an important issue, don't get me \nwrong, and it is one we should take up and will take up, probably not \nthis year but the beginning of next year. But to hold up unemployment \nbenefits for these hard-working Americans whose citizenship has never \nbeen questioned so we can debate immigration? I don't believe that \nmeets the test Senator Kyl said we had to meet: that he would want \namendments that pertain ``to the subject--how you pay for it, for \nexample.''\n  Secondly, the Senator from Louisiana wants to offer an amendment \nabout an organization called ACORN. You remember ACORN. Those are the \nfolks who were caught on the videotapes counseling people on conduct \nthat if it is not criminal should be criminal. Those employees of ACORN \nhave been dismissed. I am sure they are being investigated, and they \nshould be. What we saw on those tapes is not only troubling but could \nbe actionable. I am not saying hold back at all with regard to ACORN.\n  In response to that, I offered an amendment calling for the GAO to do \nan investigation of all the Federal expenditures related to this \nagency. I want to find out if there is any other wrongdoing, whether we \nshould cancel work that is being done, investigate payments that are \nbeing made. I want to get to the bottom of this. The House went further \nto cut off ACORN from any business with the Federal Government. They \nvoted for that.\n  So to say this organization has been ignored is wrong. There is a lot \nthat has been said and done about ACORN. The Obama administration cut \nthem off on work on the census, and they are investigating their work \nin a lot of other areas. But to hold up this bill on unemployment \nbenefits so we can again debate ACORN, how do you explain that to \npeople in Louisiana and Illinois, folks who have lost their \nunemployment benefits? You have to say: Just hang on. We sure would \nlike to send a check to take care of your family, but first we have to \nrevisit the ACORN debate and go through all this all over again at some \nnew level.\n  That, to me, is irresponsible. It is wrong for us to deny basic \nbenefits that people need when they are out of work so that people can \ncome to the floor of the Senate and argue about issues that have \nnothing to do with these poor unemployed people and the struggles they \nare going through.\n  There are literally six unemployed people in America for every open \njob. It is no wonder they are having a hard time finding employment. It \nis starting to turn around ever so slightly, and I hope it turns around \nquickly. That is the reality.\n  In the meantime, could we not come to agreement, Democrats and \nRepublicans, that this safety net is critically important; that the \npeople affected by it couldn't care less what our party labels are, \ncouldn't care less about another debate about ACORN? All they want to \ndo is get by another day, week, or month in the hope they can find that \njob.\n  Time and again the Democratic leader has offered our Republican \nfriends an alternative coming forward: doing this bill, passing it \nquickly, and sending it out so we can extend up to 20 weeks coverage of \nunemployment benefits in some of the States hit hardest by \nunemployment. But time and again the Republicans on the other side of \nthe aisle have said no, as they have on so many other issues.\n  They don't have an alternative to paying unemployment benefits. They \nknow we have to do it. We should do it. But they want to debate other \nissues. They don't have an alternative to health care reform. They \ndon't like what we are proposing, but they don't have an alternative. \nThey basically want to stay with the current system in America, which \nis not good for us in the long run.\n  What we need is more positive efforts toward cooperation, and I hope \nwe will achieve it. For the people and families in Illinois, they have \nmy assurance that I will continue to work to extend unemployment \nbenefits so more and more Americans, not only in my State but across \nthe Nation, will have the peace of mind knowing they can get through \nthis tough recession.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I listened to the majority leader, Senator \nReid, talk about his melded bill, the combination of the Finance \nCommittee bill and the HELP Committee bill that he has now completed \nmerging behind closed doors. He said he is going to\n\n[[Page S10719]]\n\nsend it to the Congressional Budget Office to get a score or a cost \nestimate. My hope is we will all be able to see it soon. We have not \nbeen able to participate in the process since it has been a process \ntaking place between the majority leader and presumably Senators Dodd \nand Baucus, the chairmen of the two committees, without Republicans \nbeing present. So we don't know what is in it, and we don't know how \nmuch it costs. Certainly those are two critical questions the American \npeople are asking and those of us who will be required to vote on this \nlegislation at some point would like the answers to. When will we be \nable to see it? When will the American people be able to see it? How \nmuch will the bill cost?\n  Today, I wish to focus on another question: Why is it that some \npeople in this country think another government-run health care plan is \nthe answer? A government-run plan goes by a lot of different names. It \nis an attempt, in part, to obfuscate what people are trying to do. \nSometimes people like to call it the public option because it sounds \ninnocuous. Who could be against a choice, an option, if it is not \nmandatory? Others say they are not for a public option unless it has a \ntrigger. Others talk about opting in, and we heard the majority leader \ntalk about a bill he intends to introduce that provides an opt out for \nthe States. The reality remains the same. We are talking about a \nbrandnew entitlement program, a brandnew government-run health care \nprogram run out of Washington, DC, based on the fundamental and \nmisguided belief that one size fits all for a nation of 300 million \npeople.\n  Some of my colleagues believe a government plan is gaining momentum. \nI appeared yesterday on a Sunday television show with Senator Schumer, \nthe distinguished Senator from New York, who said he thought Congress \nwas right on the cusp of a public option or government-run plan. The \nmore the American people find out about what is meant by the public \noption, the less they like it.\n  Last week, we saw the Washington Post-ABC News poll that supposedly \nsaid that support for a government-run plan was growing. In fact, \nsupport has fallen by 5 points since June. These numbers can be \nmisleading. As the Presiding Officer knows, in politics and public \nopinion polling, he or she who gets to ask the questions or frame the \nquestions, he or she who gets to decide what the sample is can have a \ndramatic impact on the answers given to a poll. It is absolutely the \ncase that support for the so-called public option drops dramatically \nwhen we explain to people what it would actually do.\n  ABC News polling director Gary Langer wrote about this dynamic in \nJune. He noted that while 62 percent initially favored a so-called \npublic option, that number dropped from 62 percent to 37 percent once \nit was explained to people that it would put many private insurers out \nof business because they couldn't compete with the Federal Government \nand the so-called government plan.\n  In other words, support dropped when people realized they would not \nbe able to keep what they have now--which is one of the President's \npromises--because many insurers would simply be driven out of business. \nThus that promise President Obama has made time and time again would \nnot be possible under the public option or government plan.\n  Today in the Washington Post, Fred Hiatt explained why a government \nplan would end up breaking President Obama's promise: A government plan \nwould work like Medicare and Medicaid--those are two government plans--\nand they would, as Medicare and Medicaid do, pay providers at low \nrates.\n  As a matter of fact, last week we had a vote on a bill--actually, on \na cloture motion on a motion to proceed--a technical vote but one that \nwould have taken us to a bill to basically reverse the cuts in Medicare \nreimbursement rates to Medicare providers. But it was not paid for. It \nwould have added $300 billion to the national debt. So 13 Democrats \njoined with Republicans to defeat that. Hopefully, we will go back to \nthe drawing board and come up with a bill that will be paid for.\n  But the point is, any new government plan, as Fred Hiatt pointed out, \nwould work like Medicare and Medicaid and pay providers much less than \nthey could get under private insurers. So providers would, as they do \nnow, make up the difference by charging private plans more for the same \nservices. This is a so-called cost-shifting phenomenon. Then private \ninsurance premiums--if you have private coverage now--would increase \nfor people who have health insurance coverage now. Ultimately, some of \nthem would be forced to drop their private insurance because it would \nbe more expensive, not less, which is what I thought the object of this \nexercise was about: how to bring down costs, not how to drive them up, \nand the cycle would continue until all private insurers would go out of \nbusiness, and all Americans would find themselves on a single-payer, \ngovernment-run health care plan. So much for the option in the public \noption.\n  So the fact is, the government plan would not be just a competitor; \nit would, in fact, act as a predator by calling the shots. Even as it \ntakes the field, the government plan would undercut the private market \nand create another Washington monopoly.\n  Some people have described the so-called public option as a Trojan \nhorse. I have used that phrase myself. But the person who actually \ndevised the public option said this--his name is Jacob Hacker, and he \nis a professor at Berkeley--he put it this way last year:\n\n       Someone once said to me, ``This is a Trojan horse for \n     single payer,'' and I said, ``Well, it's not a Trojan horse, \n     right? It's just right there.''\n\n  Professor Hacker said:\n\n       I'm telling you, we're going to get there, over time, \n     slowly.\n\n  The truth is, we should not be creating another government plan when \nthe ones we have now are not working very well at all.\n  As Robert Samuelson wrote in today's Washington Post:\n\n       Why would a plan tied to Medicare control health [care] \n     spending, when Medicare hasn't?\n\n  He noted that from 1970 until 2007, Medicare spending had risen by \n9.2 percent annually. Let me say that again. From 1970 to 2007, \nMedicare spending had risen by 9.2 percent annually. He says this is \njust one reason the so-called public option is what he called a \n``mirage.''\n  We know there are current entitlement programs that have major \nunfunded liabilities. Medicare has a $38 trillion unfunded liability \nand will effectively go bankrupt in 2017. Yet this bill, at least the \nFinance Committee bill--I presume the bill coming out of Senator Reid's \noffice will do the same--takes $500 billion from Medicare to create a \nnew entitlement plan, a new government-run health care plan, when \nMedicare itself has $38 trillion in unfunded liabilities. It just does \nnot seem to make any sense.\n  Medicaid, which, of course, primarily helps pay health care costs for \nthe poor, reduces access to health care in many communities because \nreimbursement rates are so low that many providers simply cannot take \nnew patients. As ``60 Minutes'' reported just last night, fraud and \nabuse in government health care programs cost taxpayers about $90 \nbillion a year. Does this sound like a model we want to hold out--a new \ngovernment-run plan--when the ones we have now are broken and need \nfixing?\n  On the Medicare fraud and abuse, according to FBI special agent Brian \nWaterman, Medicare fraud is a bigger problem in South Florida than the \ndrug trade. He said:\n\n       There are entire groups and entire organizations of people \n     that are dedicated to nothing but committing fraud, finding a \n     better way to steal from Medicare.\n\n  One former Federal judge looked at his Medicare statement and found \nthat someone had billed the government for two artificial limbs on his \nbehalf even though he still has the ones God gave him. In other words, \nhe did not need any artificial limbs, but somebody charged them to \nMedicare on his bill without his knowledge.\n  I agree with our colleague, Senator Landrieu from Louisiana, that a \ngovernment plan would just replicate the same kinds of problems we have \nseen in Medicare and Medicaid. As she said:\n\n       Why don't we fix the two public options we have now instead \n     of creating a [new] one?\n\n  Well, supporters of a government plan say we need to have more \ncompetition and give consumers more choice. I could not agree more. But \nthis\n\n[[Page S10720]]\n\nis not--this is not--the way to do it. Competition occurs when we have \nmore private insurance companies competing in marketplaces, which would \nhappen under some proposals made by our side of the aisle--if we would \nsimply create a system where individuals could buy health insurance in \nany State across the Nation and were not just confined to buying health \ninsurance in their own State. Competition increases when we get more \ninsurance carriers to enter the market, not by creating a government \nplan that will drive them out of it.\n  We have proposed ways, as I have said, to increase the number of \nprivate insurance options in every State. We think if that is the goal, \ncertainly we ought to be able to come together in a bipartisan way to \naccomplish that goal. But I do not know why in the world we would \nsettle for a health care proposal that would ultimately drive people to \na single-payer, government-run health care plan, would raise taxes on \nthe middle class, raise premiums on those who have insurance now and \ndepress the wages of those who have that health insurance now, and \nwould cut, as I mentioned a moment ago, $500 billion from a Medicare \nProgram that is scheduled to go bankrupt in 2017. Why would we settle \nfor something that would make things worse instead of better for more \nthan 100 million Americans? Why would we vote to spend $1 trillion or \nmore on a new entitlement program without fixing the ones we have now?\n\n  Well, it is not just me saying that this so-called public option with \nthe opt-out the majority leader has now proposed--which he admits does \nnot have 60 votes, and the one Republican, Senator Snowe, who said she \nwould vote for the bill said she would not vote for a bill with a \npublic option. So I am not sure why, with one Republican supporting the \nFinance Committee bill, they have now apparently rejected Senator \nSnowe's support and opted for a strictly partisan proposal coming out \nof Senator Reid's conference room.\n  But I also checked, and another health care expert whom I respect \nshares some of my views about the dangers of the so-called public \noption.\n  Secretary Mike Leavitt, who is the former Secretary of the Department \nof Health and Human Services, said:\n\n       Advocates for a public health-care plan continue to look \n     for a way to give political cover to moderates while \n     advancing their goal of implementing a government-run health-\n     care system.\n\n  He said:\n\n       [Ultimately,] it is designed to undercut private insurance.\n\n  He said it is ``dangerous for three reasons.'' He said:\n\n       One, it would be cheaper for employers to stop offering \n     private [coverage to their employees and to] funnel their \n     employees into the government-run plan. Employers, not \n     employees, would get to make that choice.\n\n  Secondly, he said:\n\n       [A] government-run plan would use the coercive force of \n     government to dictate the prices that [are going to be] \n     charged by others--by doctors, nurses, and hospitals--in a \n     way that private entities cannot.\n\n  Third, he said this proposal is dangerous because a ``government-run \nplan would be subsidized by American taxpayers, while private plans are \nnot.'' In other words, he says, if, in fact, States will be given a \nchance to opt out of the so-called public option, they would not have a \nchance to opt out of the tax dollars their taxpayers would spend in \norder to subsidize the so-called public plan.\n  As he concludes, he says:\n\n       The state ``opt-in'' is a transparently false choice. It is \n     just another gimmick to try to find votes for an unwise \n     policy that would increase the federal government's control \n     over health care.\n\n  We can do better. We must do better. I urge my colleagues not to take \nthe bait on this so-called public option, whether it has an opt-out or \nnot, because it is just another disguised way to try to end up with a \nsingle-payer, government-run health care system out of Washington, DC.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, first of all, let me say to my friend from \nTexas, the wake-up call is out there. People are fully aware of what is \ngoing on right now--the fact that you have a government option; you \nhave a form of socialized medicine; you have something that has proven \nnot to work in areas such as Canada and Great Britain and elsewhere. It \nis kind of interesting to me that we see those countries trying to \nemulate something we are doing at the same time we are edging over in \ntheir direction. I do not think that is going to work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10720-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10720-S10721]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CAP-AND-TRADE\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I will tell you something else I do not \nthink is going to work. During the August recess, people were upset \nmostly about--because it was the most visible issue at the time--the \nprospect of socialized medicine for America. But at the same time, as a \nclose second, there was another issue that was very much of concern; \nthat is, a cap-and-trade bill.\n  Just to refresh your memory, this goes all the way back almost 10 \nyears when we had the Kyoto Treaty. That was back during the Clinton \nadministration, and we were supposed to be ratifying the Kyoto Treaty, \nwhich would have been a big, massive cap-and-trade or tax increase. In \nfact, the analysis of that was done by the Wharton Econometric Survey, \nfrom the Wharton School of Economics.\n  The question put to them was, What would it cost if we ratified the \nKyoto Treaty and lived by its emissions standards? The answer was it \nwould be somewhere between $300 billion and $330 billion a year. I \nalways go back, when I am trying to figure out what that would mean to \nindividual families, and I recall that the Clinton-Gore tax increase of \n1993 was the largest tax increase in three decades, increasing marginal \nrates, capital gains, inheritance taxes, and all other taxes. That was \na $32 billion tax increase. So that would be 10 times larger. That was \nthe Kyoto Treaty. We did not ratify it.\n  Then along came the McCain-Lieberman bill in 2003 and then again the \nMcCain-Lieberman bill of 2005, and the same thing was true. Other \nuniversities' analyses came in and tried to determine what the cost \nwould be. I remember MIT came in and did an analysis of those bills, \nand it was somewhere in excess of $300 billion a year. Then along came \nthe Warner-Lieberman bill--not the current Senator Warner but the past \nSenator Warner--and that was essentially the same.\n  What I am saying is, it does not really matter whether we are talking \nabout Waxman-Markey or what we are going to be voting on sometime in \nthe near future, I would assume, that is going to be a form of Waxman-\nMarkey. By the way, I say that because when several Senators were \ntrying to get information to analyze what it is we are going to be \nstarting to have hearings on tomorrow and then ultimately marking up, \nthey said the bill is a lot like Waxman-Markey, so just go look at the \nanalysis of Waxman-Markey. If you want to do that, at least we now know \nthere is a target out there. We have something we can talk about.\n  While I have serious problems with EPA's analysis of Waxman-Markey \nand its 38-page ``meta-analysis'' of Kerry-Boxer--that is 38 pages of a \n923-page bill--the latter is not entirely EPA's fault. It is a drive to \nram the Kerry-Boxer bill through the legislative process before people \nreally know what it is. Now we know what it is because it is \nessentially the same thing we had in the Waxman-Markey bill that went \nthrough the House of Representatives.\n  It is kind of interesting. This massive tax increase called the \nWaxman-Markey bill passed the House after very little debate because it \ncame up--in fact, they finished it at 3 o'clock in the morning the day \nthey voted on it, so people had not had a chance to read any of it. So \nit passed by 219 votes in the House of Representatives. That is barely \na majority. It is one that was--interestingly enough, the last time \nthey had a massive energy tax increase such as this, it was called the \nBtu tax of 1994. That passed the House by 219 votes, the same margin. \nObviously, that was killed later on in the Senate, as I believe this \nwill be.\n\n  I come to the floor now to talk about this because tomorrow we start \nhearings, exhaustive hearings, on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. \nThey are not going to be talking about the specifics of the bill; it \nwill just be more propaganda. The main thing we want to do is make sure \neverybody knows it\n\n[[Page S10721]]\n\nis going to be a very large tax increase. It wasn't long ago that \nRepresentative John Dingell, who is a Democrat from Michigan--he said \nit right. He said: Cap and trade is ``a tax, and a great big tax at \nthat.''\n  So we have something we know we are going to be faced with. We know \nwe are going to have hearings. The question has to be asked: If we know \nthere are not votes to pass it in the Senate, why are we having our \nhearings now? I would suggest to my colleagues we are having them \nbecause there is a big party that is going to take place in Copenhagen. \nEvery year, the United Nations throws this party. You might ask: The \nUnited Nations? Yes, that is where it all started, the IPCC. It is \ngoing to take place in Copenhagen during the middle of December. I \nthought it was interesting last night when President Obama announced he \nprobably was not going to be going to this party in Copenhagen because \nit didn't look as if they had the votes to pass something in the \nSenate.\n  So I would only say to get ready. We are going to have more of the \nsame. We went through it back during Kyoto, 10 years ago, and since \nthen with four bills on the Senate floor and we are going to be talking \nabout it more and more.\n  I just came from my office. This is kind of interesting. This is a \nhat signed by the Young Farmers and Ranchers, which is tied to the \nAmerican Farm Bureau or the Oklahoma Farm Bureau, in this case. It \nsays: ``Don't Cap Our Future.''\n  When you stop and think about what would happen to the farmers--I \nhate to even single out farmers or any other groups because it is going \nto be just as punishing to the entire manufacturing base. It was \ninteresting the other day, when we asked the question of the newly \nappointed Director of the Environmental Protection Agency, Lisa \nJackson, as to what would happen if we were to pass the bill in the \nSenate and it would become law, as did the Waxman-Markey bill, how much \nwould it reduce CO2 emissions. She said: Well, it wouldn't \nreduce them. Because if we act unilaterally in the United States, then \nthings happen where--this isn't where the problem is. In fact, we know \nwe would have a massive exodus of our manufacturing base to such \ncountries as China, Mexico, India, and others.\n  But nonetheless, here are the farmers who are concerned about this \nbecause, if you look at the cost of fertilizer, one of the major \ningredients there is natural gas, and you look at the cost of diesel \nand everything else, it is very serious.\n  Bob Stallman, the president of the American Farm Bureau, just the \nother day said:\n\n       Increased input costs will put our farmers and ranchers at \n     a competitive disadvantage with producers in other countries \n     that do not have similar greenhouse gas restrictions. Any \n     loss of international markets or resulting loss of production \n     in the United States will encourage production overseas in \n     countries where production methods may be less effective than \n     in the United States.\n\n  In other words, we can do it more efficiently in the United States, \nbut if we don't have the energy, we will not be able to do it.\n  So I think the farmers, of all the people who should be concerned and \nare concerned, the wake-up call is out there. They better be ready when \nthey come up with allocations. The allocations will not be available to \nus during the next 3 days of hearings. The allocations are something \nthat are held back in secret so they can go to different elements of \nthe society and say: Well, you are going to have an allocation where \nyou can be a winner. They tried this with the Wheat Growers of America \nearly on during the Warner-Lieberman bill, and they actually endorsed \nthe bill until they realized it was a fraud and withdrew their \nendorsement.\n  I think Senator Kit Bond said it well. They did a study in the State \nof Missouri, and the study found that the proposed cap-and-trade \nlegislation will cost the average Missouri farmer an additional $11,000 \na year in 2020 and more than $30,000 a year by 2050.\n  So let me say to Tyler and to all my friends at the Oklahoma Farm \nBureau: I have your hat, and I will wear it with dignity all the way to \nCopenhagen to make sure this thing doesn't pass.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

Madam President, as the debate over health care \ncontinues, I think it is important, once again, to remind the American \npeople that every lawmaker in Washington recognizes the need for \nreform. Health care costs are rising at an unsustainable rate, and if \nwe don't get these costs under control, we can't expect to maintain the \nquality of care or the access to care most Americans currently enjoy. \nThis is the primary problem with our system, and it is the primary \nreason our Nation is so engaged in this debate.\n  One of the proposed solutions for increasing access is the expansion \nof Medicaid. This afternoon, some of my Republican colleagues have been \ndiscussing why we, and many others from across the political spectrum, \nbelieve this is a very bad idea. The proposal that is being considered \nwould expand Medicaid to about 14 million new people by 2019, including \nnearly 250,000 in my own State of Kentucky. On its face, this seems \nlike a potentially effective way to increase the ranks of the insured. \nThe reality is, however, it would make current problems much worse.\n  First of all, Medicaid is already in serious trouble. Leaving aside \nits exploding costs, the program is increasingly unable to match \ndoctors with patients because a growing number of doctors refuse to see \nMedicaid patients. This is a serious problem already. It would be a far \nworse problem if the program is expanded to include millions more \nwithout any expansion in the number of doctors willing to see Medicaid \npatients.\n  So while the need to expand coverage is real, Medicaid is exactly the \nwrong program to choose as a foundation for achieving that goal. \nSenator Enzi, the ranking member of the Health Committee, put it best \nwhen he said:\n\n       Instead of trapping poor Americans in a substandard health \n     care plan, we should be giving everyone more options to find \n     the care they need. Senators get to choose between competing \n     private plans; so should low-income Americans.\n\n  Another reason we shouldn't be looking to Medicaid as a solution to \nour problem is the States, which run the program, are begging us--\nbegging us--not to. There is a simple reason why: The States simply \ndon't have the money. The recession is hitting the States particularly \nhard, and expanding Medicaid would make their problems far worse. That \nis because, unlike the Federal Government in Washington, every State \nexcept one is either constitutionally or statutorily required to \nbalance its budget. In other words, while lawmakers in Washington \ncontinue to ring up everything on the government credit card, States \nactually have to pay their bills at the end of the year. So if \nWashington tells them they have to expand Medicaid by $1 billion, that \nis $1 billion less they have for something else. For States, expanding \nMedicaid would almost certainly mean shrinking services or raising \ntaxes in the middle of a recession.\n  It is easy to see why the bill writers would propose Medicaid as a \nsolution. It is a lot easier for Washington to push its problems onto \nthe States, but in the context of reforming health care, this makes no \nsense at all. Expanding Medicaid would worsen the quality of care for \nthose who already have Medicaid, and new enrollees would be entering a \nsystem with even fewer doctors per capita than there already are. \nAdditionally, States could very well be bankrupted by the additional \ncost imposed by Washington, and even if they weren't, there is no doubt \nservices would be reduced.\n\n  This is why Governors of both parties are insisting Washington not \nuse Medicaid as a vehicle for expanding health care. Here is a sample \nof what we have heard. Governor Rendell, Democrat of Pennsylvania, put \nit this way:\n\n       We just don't have the wherewithal to absorb it without \n     some new revenue source.\n\n  Gov. Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico, said:\n\n       We can't afford [it] and [it's] not acceptable.\n\n  Bill Bredesen, a Democrat of Tennessee, called the plan:\n\n       The mother of all unfunded mandates.\n\n  Ted Strickland, the Democratic Governor of Ohio, summed it up like \nthis:\n\n\n[[Page S10722]]\n\n\n       The States, with our financial challenges right now, are \n     not in a position to accept additional Medicaid \n     responsibilities.\n\n  Senators who have worked in State government also recognize the \nproblem. That is why so many of them from both parties are expressing \nserious misgivings about forcing States to expand Medicaid. Take one \nexample. Senator Nelson of Nebraska, the former Governor, has \nexplicitly said he would not support the new mandate. As he put it:\n\n       I will not support saddling the states with further \n     obligations . . . you can take me out of the governor's \n     office, but you can't take the governor out of me.\n\n  Even Senators who haven't said they oppose the idea are acknowledging \nthe problem by working behind the scenes to have their States exempted \nfrom the mandate or to have it softened, a tacit admission of what the \nrest of us are saying; that expanding Medicaid is bad for States and \nbad if the goal is better health care.\n  Republicans tried to keep the idea out of the final health care bill, \nbut those attempts were rejected. It is a shame, since there are a good \nmany ways to increase access without expanding Medicaid--ways that \nwould lead to better care and which wouldn't harm States financially. \nIncreasing competition would lower costs and enable those who are \ncurrently uninsured to get good private coverage, private coverage that \nwould provide them with far greater access to the care they need than \nMedicaid would and which would help lower overall costs for everyone. \nWe should look to these ideas rather than looking to Medicaid as a \nsolution to our problems, especially since so many people from both \nparties are massing against the idea of expanding Medicaid.\n  It is not too late to seek commonsense solutions to the problem of \naccess. All of us acknowledge the problem. Now is the time to come up \nwith a solution that all of us--Republicans and Democrats alike--\nsupport.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10722-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10722-S10725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, first of all, let me associate myself with \nthe remarks of the Republican leader just now. I came to the floor \nbecause I wanted to reflect a little bit on what the majority leader \nsaid a few moments ago at a press conference. He announced that as a \nresult of the efforts of a couple weeks of discussions behind closed \ndoors--namely, in his office--he and a few other Democrats in the \nSenate have decided on what will be in the health care reform \nlegislation. That is the first matter I wished to discuss, briefly.\n  The American people were told by the President they would be a full \nparticipant in the development of the legislation. They would know what \nit says. They would all be on C-SPAN. They would get to see everybody \nhash out all the details, and they would understand what the Senate was \nabout to do. On the contrary, what has happened is, a small group of \nSenators on the Democratic side went behind closed doors in the \nDemocratic leader's office, and they have been working now for many \ndays to put together this piece of legislation. We still don't know \nexactly what it says, but the majority leader has described it very \ngenerally, and he has described one of the most contentious pieces. It \nwill have government-run insurance, he assures us. Well, government-run \ninsurance is a very controversial concept. Obviously, that is going to \nbe the subject of a lot of debate. But the American people have a right \nto understand what this is all about, what it means.\n  I think the first thing I would like to do is to say that Republicans \nare going to stand for certain principles in the consideration of this \nlegislation. The first thing is we are going to want to know what it \nsays. The American people have a right to know what it says. So as we \nfind out, little by little, as the majority leader trickles out details \nabout what is in here--or maybe one of these days we will actually get \na written copy and we can read it and understand what is in it--we will \nshare that information with the American people.\n  They have a right to know what it says. They have a right to know \nwhat it costs. Obviously, one of the things that has to happen is that \nthe Congressional Budget Office or CBO, which has this responsibility, \nneeds to examine the legislation, do all of its cost estimates and \nrevenue estimates, and tell us what they think it costs. The American \npeople have a right to know because they are very concerned about \npassing on the costs of this legislation to the next generation--to our \nkids and grandkids.\n  That brings up the third thing: How much will this increase the \ndeficit? Does anybody believe that a $1 trillion health care bill is \nnot going to increase the deficit? I don't know of anybody who doesn't \nbelieve that it is going to increase the deficit. But by how much? A \nweek ago, we had the first vote on the health care debate, and it was \non a bill to borrow $247 billion in order to ensure that physicians \nfees would not be cut. I am all for paying physicians. We need to pay \nphysicians. My personal view is we need to pay them more, not less. But \nthis legislation should have been part of the health care reform \ndebate, because it is part of the overall cost of Medicare--for \nexample, how much we reimburse physicians to take care of Medicare \npatients. No, that was going to be inconvenient because it would \nactually result in creating a larger deficit and, therefore, adding to \nour national debt. So we take that piece out and try to run it through \nas a separate bill--and by ``we'' I mean the majority leader. And he \ngot a rude surprise. All of the Republicans said, of course, no, we \nshould not do it that way, and 13 of his Democratic colleagues agreed. \nThey cared about the deficit. They said: We don't want to add to the \ndebt and, therefore, this is the wrong way to go about it. We need to \nfind a better way.\n  Another question the American people need to have answered is not \nonly how much will it cost but how much will it add to the deficit, and \nthen how much will it add to the debt that our children and \ngrandchildren will have to pay? Republicans believe that any \nlegislation should provide protection to all patients, whether they be \nseniors on Medicare, folks relying on Medicaid, or people in the \nprivate sector. Nobody should interfere with their physician or get \nbetween them and their physician. That is a very sacred relationship--\nthe doctor-patient relationship--and the government should not get in \nbetween that. But that is what government-run insurance is all about.\n  Republicans are going to insist on protection of the American people \nfrom a delay and denial of care. Why do we raise delay and denial of \ncare? Throughout the legislation considered by the committee so far, \nthere have been numerous provisions that will result in the delay and \ndenial of care and, in the long run, rationing of health care. I have \ntalked about that on the Senate floor. We will examine the legislation \nthat has now come out from behind the majority leader's closed doors \nand see what kinds of protections they have built in. If it is not much \ndifferent than the bills already considered, my guess is there won't be \nany protections. Republicans will have to again present better ideas, \nour alternatives, that include protections for patients from having \ntheir care delayed and denied to the point that it is even rationed.\n  Another thing Americans are going to want to insist on with this new \nspending is they are not going to pay for it indirectly in the form of \nhigher taxes or premiums. I think No. 5 or 6 on my list is that \nRepublicans will want to provide protections so that the increased \ncosts of the legislation are not passed on to the American consumer in \nthe form of higher taxes or in the form of higher premiums.\n  Why am I concerned about that? Because, again, the CBO, which \nexamined the legislation before the committees already, has said that \nthe costs imposed on the insurance companies and others in the form of \nhigher taxes will be passed through to their customers, to the \nbeneficiaries, in the form of higher premiums. It is inevitable that \nwhen you have these taxes imposed among competing companies, in order \nfor them to stay in business, they are going to have to pass some of \nthese taxes on, and they are going to pass some of the increased fees \non, and they are going to pass on the premium increases that will be \nrequired for them to satisfy the various government mandates.\n  Another question is, exactly what are the government mandates here? \nWhat\n\n[[Page S10723]]\n\nare people going to be required to do that they don't have to do today? \nMost people have insurance today. It works for them and they don't want \nit interfered with. Under this legislation, every single American will \nbe required under law to buy a product, an insurance product--not just \nany product, but the product defined by the Federal Government. If the \ngovernment has the authority to make you buy something and has the \nauthority to tell you what has to be in it, it also has the authority \nto tell the people who create that what they can and cannot put in \ntheir product. Sure enough, that is what they have done with the \ninsurance companies. They have said to them that you all have to offer \nthe exact value--four different kinds of policies; you have to offer at \nleast the middle two, and you may offer the other two, but you cannot \noffer any less or any more, and they all have to have the same value, \nand we will mandate what they have to cover. Since we are going to have \na ``one policy includes everybody'' product, the same insurance policy \nwill have to provide the benefits I need, the benefits you need, the \nbenefits the occupant of the chair needs, and the benefits the American \npeople watching this need. Some of us are old, some are young, some are \nmale, some are female, some have illness, and some don't. You have all \nkinds of conditions. If we can buy our own insurance, usually we can \nfind a policy tailored to fit our needs, and it doesn't cost as much \nmoney because it doesn't cover as many things. When you have to have \none policy that covers everything for everybody for any conceivable \nissue, you will have a huge policy with all kinds of things covered and \nwith the concomitant costs--namely, costs that cover all of those \nthings--meaning a premium. That is one of the reasons premiums will be \nincreased.\n  I think another thing we are going to have to find out about this \nlegislation is, does it do what the other bills do, which is cut \nMedicare? This is important, because we have made a promise to \nAmerica's seniors, and a lot of us have a lot of seniors in our States. \nI certainly do in Arizona. We have made a promise to seniors that we \nwill provide basic care in the form of Medicare. They will have to pay \na certain amount and the government will pay a certain amount, and it \nwill provide certain benefits. Well, the seniors have said: But we \nthink maybe our benefits are going to be cut. The President, Senator \nBaucus, and others have said: No, no, don't worry, your benefits will \nnot be cut. The people who tell you that are trying to scare you.\n  Let me quote a couple of things. Last week, a USA Today-Gallup poll \nshowed that Americans overwhelmingly oppose cutting Medicare to pay for \nhealth care reform. Sixty-one percent of Americans oppose it--almost 2 \nto 1 in opposition to cutting Medicare in order to pay for health care \nreform.\n  How do we know it will cut benefits and that, therefore, seniors do \nhave a right and a reason to be concerned? Let's go again to the \nnonpartisan CBO. What does it say about the legislation that has been \ndebated so far? It estimates that the cost of the most moderate bill--\nand there are five bills all told, and now we have a new one coming out \nof the leader's office we have not read yet. But of the five bills, the \nmost moderate is the so-called Baucus bill. According to the CBO, it \nwould cut Medicare by nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion--about $450 billion. What \ndo these cuts go to?\n  Here are the specifics: $162.4 billion in permanent reductions for \nmost Medicare-covered services, such as services supplied by hospitals, \nnursing homes, and hospice. Those are real benefits; $117.4 billion in \ncuts to private Medicare plans, known as Medicare Advantage. Well over \n30 percent of the people on Medicare in Arizona have this Medicare \nAdvantage-type plan. And $32.5 billion in cuts to home health care. \nThis is something a lot of people count on, and that is a significant \ncut. There will be $22.3 billion in savings from a new Medicare \ncommission that will propose automatic cuts. A lot of people laugh and \nsay these commissions always propose cuts and Congress never ends up \nadopting them. That may well happen here. I know that one of two things \nwill happen: Either we are not going to reduce expenses and we won't \nhave enough money to pay for the new entitlement programs created by \nthe legislation, because Congress won't follow the recommendations and \nadopt them, or it will and there will be real cuts in Medicare \nbenefits. One of those things is true, and neither is a good result.\n\n  Here is what CBO said about Medicare benefits. Remember, $117.4 \nbillion is being cut from Medicare Advantage. CBO spoke to that. It \nconfirms in writing, and also to the members of the Finance Committee \nwhen Dr. Elmendorf appeared before us, that the value of the extra \nbenefits offered by Medicare Advantage will drop from $135 per month to \n$42 per month by 2019. It gradually goes down from $135 to $42 per \nmonth. What are these benefits? They include dental care, vision care, \npreventive screenings, chronic care management--a whole host of things \nthat are important for America's seniors.\n  What is the annual value of the reduction in benefits per enrollee? \nIt is only $1,116. We are not cutting benefits for seniors? Only to the \ntune of $1,116. We are cutting benefits, and seniors have a right to be \nconcerned.\n  Those who argue that Republicans should not be pointing this out to \nseniors--those who want to muzzle or gag us from telling seniors this \nwill happen I suggest should consult CBO and realize that what they are \nasking seniors to do is beyond what they should be required to do, \nwhich is to take these kinds of cuts for a new entitlement.\n  Let me share some comments from some of my constituents who have \nactually written to me about the kinds of cuts they will suffer under \nthis legislation. I have gotten a lot of letters. I asked my staff to \ncompile a few so that I could share with my colleagues where they are \nconcerned about losing drug coverage, preventive care, and a decline in \nthe overall quality of their care. This is what they talk about. They \nrealize you cannot cut nearly $\\1/2\\ trillion dollars and not cut care. \nThat is what it is all about.\n  One patient wrote that the Medicare Advantage plan helps him afford \nthe seven medications he takes every day. He said:\n\n       I have been on Medicare now for four years and . . . my \n     Medicare Advantage plan is the best deal around for seniors. \n     The benefits for my prescriptions are a lifesaver. I could \n     not afford my prescriptions without my Medicare Advantage \n     plan. Having numerous medical problems and taking over 7 \n     prescriptions per day--that can add up.\n\n  Another senior wrote this, again, talking about the savings and \npreventive care that would be lost under the plans for Medicare \nAdvantage:\n\n       Please do not cut Medicare Advantage. It provides me with \n     so many savings on doctor visits and prescriptions, including \n     preventive care and the Silver Sneakers fitness program.\n\n  Let me digress for a moment. We hear a lot of talk about trying to \nget people healthier, to take care of their own bodies, as it were, and \nto provide incentives for people to eat better, have a better diet, to \nlose weight, not to smoke, and to go to the gym and work out a little \nbit. When we have a program that incents seniors to do these kinds of \nthings, we should be happy to support that program and cut it only \nafter great consideration, if at all. I suggest that we don't cut it. \nThis constituent talks about that kind of preventive care. He says:\n\n       I will be 77 in a few weeks. I have not had any major \n     surgery or hospitalization (thank God) and go to the fitness \n     center three or four times weekly--something I could not do \n     if Medicare Advantage is cut. I urge you not to cut this very \n     important aid to senior citizens.\n\n  Another Medicare Advantage patient wrote to explain how the extra \nbenefits she gets help her. She said:\n\n       I have never written to anybody in Congress because I \n     didn't feel it necessary. Now I do because of the threat to \n     cut my Medicare Advantage Plan.\n       When I turned 65 three years ago, I opted for a Medicare \n     Advantage plan. I have been well taken care of and truly like \n     my Health Net Ruby 3 plan and want to continue on it. For a \n     small amount of $38 extra a month, I not only get dental \n     coverage, but also vision and benefits for a fitness program. \n     These extra benefits have been a great savings for me, and I \n     do not want to have them taken away. Please do not vote for a \n     cut to my Medicare Advantage plan. I want to keep my \n     benefits.\n\n  One more letter. This one, I thought, was especially touching. It is \nfrom a gentleman whose wife has pulmonary fibrosis and relies on \nMedicare Advantage for her treatments. They worry that the quality of \nher treatments will\n\n[[Page S10724]]\n\ndecline if Medicare Advantage is cut, as proposed by this legislation.\n  Here is what he said:\n\n       If we lose Medicare Advantage, we are in trouble. United \n     Healthcare Secure Horizons has provided us with great doctors \n     that understand the disease. . . . It would be disastrous if \n     she got a lung infection and had to go on a bureaucratic \n     waiting list rather than being able to call our primary \n     doctor as we do now. Please do not let them cut this great \n     program.\n\n  The reason I quoted that letter is because another one of the things \nthat is touted as a way to bend the cost curve and provide better care \nin the process is to coordinate the care from the primary physician \nright on through to any specialists and, Heaven forbid, if an \nindividual has to go into a hospital, have surgery, or even have \nposthospital care in some kind of a facility. One can see how that kind \nof continued or coordinated care could be a real advantage to people \nand also end up saving money in the long term for the individual, for \nthe insurance company that may take care of them, or the U.S. \nGovernment if we are paying for it as we do under Medicare Advantage, \nfor example.\n  So here is a woman who talks about the fact that this kind of plan \nhas been made available to her and why would we want to take it away. \nIt has always been puzzling to me that because Medicare Advantage is \nactually administered by insurance companies, there seems to be \nsomething evil about it that a lot of our friends on the other side of \nthe aisle would like to get rid of. They talk about having a government \nchoice or a government option in their health care bill, but when it \ncomes to options or choices for Medicare patients, they are not for \nthat. They just want government only. They don't want the Medicare \nAdvantage plan because it is actually administered by insurance \ncompanies.\n  What these companies do is provide a health maintenance organization-\ntype of coverage where we have the continuum of care from the primary \nphysician all the way through to whatever care may be required. This \nindividual is talking about his wife being benefited by that kind of \ncare. Why would we want to do away with that simply to save money so we \ncan create a new entitlement? At the very time Americans are asking for \nbetter care, to ensure their care is not taken away from them, that is \nprecisely what is being proposed by the other side.\n  Maybe I will be very surprised. Maybe we will finally have a chance \nto read the Reid bill or however the distinguished majority leader \nwishes to characterize it, and we will find they decided not to cut \nMedicare after all. If there are no Medicare cuts in the legislation, \nthen I will be the first to come to the floor and say: Thank you. Thank \nyou for not cutting seniors' Medicare. But if, in fact, as with the \nother bills that have been considered, this legislation ends up cutting \nMedicare anywhere from $450 billion to $500 billion, then I think the \nconcerns that have been expressed to me by my constituents need to be \ntaken into account, and Republicans will insist on protection for our \nconstituents. People should not have to go through the difficulties \nthat are projected by these real people if this legislation ends up \ncutting their benefits.\n  We just talked about a few of the things. We have additional things \nwe are going to talk about later on this week, about the tax increases \nand how the tax increases are going to be passed on to all Americans, \neven though they may, first of all, be levied against a device \nmanufacturer.\n  For example, if you have heart surgery and there is a stint that is \nused in your treatment, that is a very sophisticated device. There is \ngoing to be a tax on that device. You are going to get taxed on that \ndevice. It may be placed on the device itself. It will be in your bill. \nWhen you look at your hospital bill, I guarantee you they are going to \nbe passing it on to you.\n  There are other taxes. By the way, if you don't buy the insurance \nthey require you to have, you are going to get a tax on that, too, \nadministered by the friendly IRS, which raises a whole host of other \nproblems. To have the Internal Revenue Service endorse a provision of \nthis law is going to require a lot more folks down at the IRS to have \nthe authority to look into your records and talk to your doctor and \nfigure out whether you have bought insurance. If so, is it the right \nkind of insurance? Is it the kind of insurance the government says you \nhave to have? If so, they will be happy to slap a tax on you, and you \nwill have to pay for it. That is another tax you will be required to \npay. There are others. As I said, we will talk about that later this \nweek.\n  Then there are the premium increases. There was a real dispute about \nthis issue. Folks said: We are not going to increase premiums after \nall. The whole exercise is to reduce the cost of health care, to cut \npremiums.\n  We said: That is a wonderful goal. We said: Let's see if you can come \nup with a goal that actually reduces health care premiums for people.\n  After all this time, it turns out they cannot do it. The \nCongressional Budget Office--again, the nonpartisan group of \naccountants we in the Congress have hired to analyze the cost of all \nthese things and the effect of them--concluded that under this \nlegislation that has been considered in the committees, the cost of the \nlegislation, the cost of insurance is going to go up for the average \nfamily, not go down, compared to what it is costing them today.\n  There have been numerous studies on this issue. One of the studies \nbroke it down by States and by region. They said the overall national \nincrease, by the way, would be about $3,300 per year increase cost in \npremium. Think about that. We are sporting a bill, the idea of which is \nto make health care less costly, but our insurance premiums are going \nto go up $3,300 and our taxes are going to go up. Do you know the \nreason? You cannot spend $1 trillion and add a whole lot more people to \nthe rolls and not have it cost more money, and it will cost more money. \nShould it?\n  I think we can achieve these objectives, as I have said many times \nfrom this podium, with targeted solutions to the specific problems that \nexist without increasing taxes or premiums. We have demonstrated how we \ncan do that. The study I spoke of, though, said in certain States, such \nas the State of Arizona from which I come, the cost is going to be far \ngreater than $3,300. In fact, it is going to be, I believe it was some \n$7,400 per family per year increase. That is astounding. That is as \nmuch money as some people pay for their insurance to begin with.\n  This study demonstrated that the increases could be as much as 95 \npercent. I guess that makes sense. If it costs $8,000 for a policy \ntoday, and it is going to be increased by $7,400, that is almost a 100-\npercent increase. It is incredible we would think about doing that on \nthe American people. Yet that is the result of this absolutely \nnonpartisan study that was done by an entity that looked into all the \ndifferent factors. They didn't cherry-pick the information. I know \nthere was another group that was criticized because the insurance \nindustry had hired them. That is not the study of which I speak. I am \ntalking about the Oliver Wyman study.\n  There are so many things about this legislation we are going to need \nto know and that the American people are going to need to know. We are \ngoing to have to have plenty of opportunity to both read the bill and \nknow how much it costs. Then we need to know how much it puts us in \ndebt.\n  If the answer is it is not going to put us in any more debt or create \na big deficit, we will just keep raising taxes until we have enough \nmoney to take care of it, that is not the answer either. It is not the \nway to get out of a recession, it is not the way to help hard-working \nfamilies, and it is not the way to treat people we are trying to help \nby reducing their health care costs.\n  I hope as the next several days unfold, we will be able to read this \nproduct, this bill that was written in the majority leader's office. \nMaybe we will be surprised that it does not raise taxes, that it does \nnot raise premiums, that it does not reduce care or ration care, that \nit does not cut Medicare. But I am not going to hold my breath. My \nguess is it will do all of those things, and when the American people \nconfirm that is the result of this so-called health care reform, I am \nnot going to blame them for saying: Absolutely not. We want no part of \nreform if that is what you are talking about.\n  I am reminded of a line. I haven't tracked down where it is, so I \nwill not attribute it. I thought it came from Charles Dickens' ``A Tale \nof Two Cities.''\n\n  There was a character, Madame Defarge, who may have said this.\n\n[[Page S10725]]\n\nAgain, the question of the French Revolution was on their minds. This \nperson said: ``Reform? Sir, don't talk of reform. Things are bad enough \nalready.''\n  That is apropos to this health care debate. We have costs going up \nright now. We don't need them to go up any more.\n  As another wag put it: You think health care is expensive now, wait \nuntil it is free. We all know there is no such thing as a free lunch. \nThe money has to come from somewhere. As it turns out, in these bills, \nit is going to come from seniors, people who have private insurance and \nsubsidize those on government insurance, and it is going to come from \nall taxpayers, including those who make less than $200,000 a year, who \nthe President said would not be taxed. A large percentage of the money, \nI think 87 percent in one case, will come from people making less than \n$100,000 per year. Some of the tax provisions specifically impact \nprimarily people who make less than $50,000 a year. Health care reform \nshould be about making it better for the American people, not making it \nworse.\n  It is going to be very interesting when we finally have an \nopportunity to review the legislation that was created behind closed \ndoors to see whether it is going to pass these tests. We want to read \nit. We want to know how much it costs. We want to know that it is not \ngoing to add to the deficit or the debt. We are going to want to know \nthat it will not result in the delay and denial of our care. In effect, \nwe are going to want to know that the protections that are important \nfor our constituents are in place.\n  I think there are some better ways to do this. Again, we will talk \nabout those another day. We have already talked about them.\n  In the event you are saying, what kind of ideas are the Republicans \ntalking about, I will mention one and stand down here.\n  We have been talking a lot about health care premiums and health care \ncosts because doctors have to practice defensive medicine because if \nthey are not careful, if they do not order a lot of tests, send their \npatients to a lot of different specialists, they are liable to get sued \nfor malpractice. With this jackpot justice system we have, it costs a \nlot of money. The defensive medicine some have said can amount to $100 \nbillion or well over $100 billion a year. There are two studies that \nput it over $200 billion a year. Another study said just the cost of \nmalpractice insurance premiums for doctors represents 10 cents on every \nhealth care dollar spent.\n  If we could reform medical malpractice laws, we could not only make \nthe delivery of health care less expensive, we could make it less \ndifficult for physicians to do what they consider to be the right thing \nwithout fear of getting sued, and we could dramatically reduce the cost \nof health care premiums. This is a way to solve three problems that \nneed to be solved, not cost a dime and, in fact, generate a huge amount \nof savings.\n  Why wouldn't we want to do this? As former Governor Dean of Vermont, \nformer chairman of the Democratic National Committee, said on August 17 \nof this year at a townhall meeting in Virginia: The reason we haven't \ntackled medical liability reform is that we don't want to take on the \ntrial lawyers.\n  I understand that. He is right. The Democratic majority did not want \nto take on the trial lawyers. But that is exactly what is wrong with \nWashington today.\n  We know what the problems are, we know what a lot of the fixes are, \nbut we wouldn't want to take on the special interests such as the trial \nlawyers because that would not be good for us politically.\n  Republicans are saying: Yes, we do. It is time to take on those \nspecial interests. It is time to focus solutions on specific problems \nrather than trying to reform the entire health care system, including \nwith a big government-run insurance company, in order to solve a \nproblem that can be solved in a less intrusive way, less government \nintervention, less government expenditure, more private freedom, more \nmoney left in our pockets, and a greater assurance at the end of the \nday that we are going to continue to receive high-quality health care \nand not have it denied to us because of someone sitting in Washington, \nDC.\n  I urge my colleagues, as the days go forward, not only to review this \nlegislation for themselves but to share those results with our \nconstituents. They are the people for whom we work. They are the people \nwe represent. They need to know what is in it. They need to know how \nmuch it will cost. They need to know it will not add to the deficit. \nThey need to know it will not affect their health care. They need to \nknow they will be protected and their benefits will not be cut, and \nthey will be protected. It is up to us to provide that protection for \nthem.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10725-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10725-S10727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              HATE CRIMES\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have sought recognition, briefly, to \ntalk about the legislation on hate crimes, which was passed last \nThursday as part of the Defense authorization bill, and to note the \nvery different attitude which is present today than was present in \n1997, when Senator Kennedy first took the lead in introducing hate \ncrimes legislation, which I cosponsored with him at that time as well \nas Senators John Chaffee, James Jeffords and Alfonse D'Amato, the only \nRepublicans who appeared on the bill at that time.\n  There was some substantial opposition, very little appreciation of \nthe effort to expand hate crimes to include sexual orientation and also \ndisability. Even the Washington Post had an editorial on November 17 \nraising questions about the wisdom of the legislation which we had \nintroduced.\n  One of the concerns raised by the Post was that:\n\n       A victim of a biased-motivated stabbing is no more dead \n     than someone stabbed during a mugging.\n\n  It seems to me, that missed the point. But even the Washington Post, \nat that time, challenged the rationale for expanding hate crimes. The \nPost also raised a comment about the disturbing aspect of the \nlegislation is the lower threshold for Federal involvement, in any \ncase.\n  Having had some experience as a district attorney, and knowing the \npractices of district attorneys having jurisdiction over a county--for \nexample, my job was both the city and county of Philadelphia--that DAs \ndo not have, in some areas, a very broad perspective.\n  Where the climate for a district attorney, an elected position, is \nnot conducive to pursuing someone who has undertaken something which \nhas a racial bias, a racial motivation or a motivation for a difference \nin sexual orientation, the cases are not brought.\n  That is precisely the kind of an area which warrants hate crimes \nlegislation on the Federal level. But it has been a long battle, and \nthe issue went through quite a few conferences. Thanks to the \nleadership of our distinguished majority leader, Senator Harry Reid, we \nhave persisted. Senator Reid has kept this issue front and center in \nthe Senate, and Senator Leahy, as chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nand I in the past, in 2005-2006 in the 109th Congress, were pushing \nahead on hate crimes legislation.\n  Senator Levin, as chairman of the Armed Services Committee, is to be \ncommended for fighting it through and finally getting it through the \nconference. So it is quite a landmark move that the Congress has \nfinally acted on it as we did last Thursday. There is a recognition \nthat the Post was off base when it said:\n\n       A victim of bias-motivated stabbing is no more dead than \n     someone stabbed during a mugging.\n\n  That suggests a misunderstanding of hate crimes, as Senator Kennedy \nand I wrote in an op-ed that:\n\n       Random street crimes don't provoke riots; hate crimes can \n     and sometimes do.\n\n  A hate crime is broader than simply an attack against a victim, \nagainst the African American who was dragged through the streets in a \nsmall town in Texas which gave rise to the impetus for hate crimes \nlegislation or the brutal attack on Matthew Shepherd in\n\n[[Page S10726]]\n\nWyoming. So this legislation is highly significant.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the text of the Washington Post \neditorial of November 17, 1997, and the reply op-ed piece by Senator \nKennedy and myself, dated December 1, 1997, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                       The ``Hate Crime'' Problem\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Nov. 17, 1997]\n\n       Bill Clinton, at a White House conference last week, \n     declared his support for a proposal by Sens. Edward Kennedy \n     and Arlen Specter to broaden federal jurisdiction over that \n     category of violence dubbed ``hate crime.'' Federal law \n     already permits judges to lengthen the sentences of \n     defendants convicted of such crimes, defined as those in \n     which a victim is targeted because of a particular identity. \n     The Hate Crimes Prevention Act would go a step further than \n     merely toughening sentences; it would significantly widen the \n     Justice Department's latitude to prosecute local violent \n     crimes that were motivated by bigotry. The bill is a can of \n     worms.\n       The proposal is crafted as an amendment to a civil rights \n     statute that makes it a crime to interfere violently with \n     anyone's exercise of certain federally protected activities \n     because of that person's race, religion or ethnicity. This \n     law sometimes has enabled the federal government to prosecute \n     violent civil rights abuses when state authorities were \n     unable or unwilling to do so. The new proposal would add a \n     section explicitly including sexual preference, gender and \n     disability status within the law and allowing the government \n     to prosecute bias-motivated attacks even when the victims are \n     not engaged in a federally protected activity. It would open \n     the door, proponents concede, for certain rapes and domestic \n     violence cases to be prosecuted federally as hate crimes.\n       Folding sexual preference into the protection of the \n     existing statute is clearly a good idea. The civil rights of \n     gays and lesbians, after all, are sometimes targeted \n     violently, and the federal government's anachronistic lack of \n     authority to punish perpetrators of these assaults should be \n     corrected. The disturbing aspect of the legislation is the \n     lower threshold for federal involvement in any case. The \n     government has an abiding interest in preventing attacks on \n     the civil rights of its citizens. On the other hand, rape, \n     murder and assault--no matter what prejudice motivates the \n     perpetrator--are presumptively local matters in which the \n     federal government should intervene only when it has a \n     pressing interest. The fact that hatred lurks behind a \n     violent incident is not, in our view, an adequate federal \n     interest. The other conditions for federal involvement \n     outlined in the proposal could prove too malleable to the \n     Justice Department's desire to involve itself in a given \n     case. We don't suggest that the proposal would lead to \n     widespread federal involvement in routine criminal matters, \n     but it is too permissive--and for the wrong reason.\n       The president's White House Conference on Hate Crimes, as \n     it turned out, was less a discussion of these offenses than a \n     kind of pep rally against the dreaded emotion itself.\n       That's fine as a bully-pulpit exercise, but the federal \n     focus on what are called hate crimes must not wander too far \n     from criminality. While the government has a simple \n     obligation to protect us from crime, its relationship with \n     hatred is necessarily more complicated. Government officials \n     can denounce hatred and pass anti-discrimination laws, but \n     when push comes to shove, most expressions of ugly \n     intolerance are protected by the First Amendment. Proponents \n     of the new measure argue that a swastika painted on a \n     synagogue has a deeper impact on a community than does a \n     routine act of vandalism, and that's true as far as it goes. \n     But the victim of a bias-motivated stabbing is no more dead \n     than someone stabbed during a mugging. Ultimately, we \n     prosecute crimes, not feelings. Guiding how people feel about \n     one another is only marginally a law enforcement concern.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Dec. 1, 1997]\n\n             When Combating Hate Should Be a Federal Fight\n\n                (By Edward M. Kennedy and Arlen Specter)\n\n       The Post's Nov. 17 editorial criticizing the measure we \n     have introduced on hate crimes reflects a misunderstanding of \n     our proposal to close the gaps in federal law and a failure \n     to recognize the profound impact of hate crimes.\n       Hate crimes are uniquely destructive and divisive because \n     they injure not only the mediate victim, but the community \n     and sometimes the nation. The Post's contention that a victim \n     of a bias-motivated stabbing is no more dead than someone \n     stabbed during a mugging suggests a distressing \n     misunderstanding of hate crimes. Random street crimes don't \n     provoke riots; hate crimes can and sometimes do.\n       The federal government has a role in dealing with these \n     offenses. Although states and local governments have the \n     principal responsibility for prosecuting hate crimes, there \n     are exceptional circumstances in which it is appropriate for \n     the federal government to prosecute such cases.\n       Hate crimes often are committed by individuals with ties to \n     groups that operate across state lines. The Confederate \n     Hammerskins are a skinhead group that began terrorizing \n     minorities and Jews in Tennessee, Texas and Oklahoma a decade \n     ago.\n       Federal law enforcement authorities are well situated to \n     investigate and prosecute criminal activities by such groups, \n     and the federal government has taken the lead in successfully \n     prosecuting these skinheads.\n       Hate crimes disproportionately involve multiple offenders \n     and multiple incidents and in such cases, overriding \n     procedural considerations--including gaps in state laws--may \n     justify federal prosecution.\n       In Lubbock, Tex., three white supremacists attempted to \n     start a local race war in 1994 by shooting three African \n     American victims, one fatally, in three separate incidents in \n     20 minutes. Under Texas law, each defendant would have been \n     entitled to a separate trial in a state court, and each \n     defendant also might have been entitled to a separate trial \n     for each shooting. The result could have been at least three, \n     and perhaps as many as nine trials, in the state courts, and \n     the defendants, if convicted, would have been eligible for \n     parole in 20 years. They faced a mandatory life sentence in \n     federal court.\n       Federal and local prosecutors, working together, decided to \n     deal with these crimes under federal laws. The defendants \n     were tried together in federal court, convicted and are \n     serving mandatory life sentences. The victims and their \n     families were not forced to relive their nightmare in \n     multiple trials.\n       Federal involvement in the prosecutions of hate crimes \n     dates back to the Reconstruction Era following the Civil War. \n     These laws were updated a generation ago in 1968, but they \n     are no longer adequate to meet the current challenge. As a \n     result, the federal government is waging the battle against \n     hate crimes with one hand tied behind its back.\n       Current federal law covers crimes motivated by racial, \n     religious or ethnic prejudice. Our proposal adds violence \n     motivated by prejudice against the sexual orientation, gender \n     or disability of the victim. Our proposal also makes it \n     easier for federal authorities to prosecute racial violence, \n     in the same way that the Church Arson Prevention Act of 1996 \n     helped federal prosecutors deal with the rash of racially \n     motivated church arsons.\n       The suggestion in the editorial that our bill tramples \n     First Amendment rights is ludicrous. Our proposal applies \n     only to violent acts, not hostile words or threats. Nobody \n     can seriously suggest that the neo-Nazis who murdered Fred \n     Mangione in a Houston nightclub last year because they \n     ``wanted to get a fag'' were engaged in a constitutionally \n     protected freedom of speech.\n       In addition, hate-crimes prosecution under our bill must be \n     approved by the attorney general or another high-ranking \n     Justice Department official, not just by local federal \n     prosecutors. This ensures federal restraint and that states \n     will continue to take the lead in prosecuting hate crimes.\n       From 1990 through 1996, there were 37 federal hate crimes \n     prosecutions nationwide under the law we are amending--fewer \n     than six a year out of more than 10,000 hate crimes \n     nationwide. Our bill should result in a modest increase in \n     the number of federal prosecutions of hate crimes.\n       When Congress passed the Hate Crimes Statistics Act in \n     1990, we recognized the need to document the scope of hate \n     crimes. We now know enough about the problem, and it is time \n     to take the next step.\n       As the Lubbock prosecution shows, combating hate crimes is \n     not exclusively a state or local challenge or a federal \n     challenge. It is a challenge best addressed by federal, state \n     and local authorities working together. Our proposal gives \n     all prosecutors another tool in their anti-crime arsenal. The \n     issue is tolerance, and the only losers under our proposal \n     will be the bigots who seek to divide the country through \n     violence.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. An additional comment or two. We have seen times change \nwith respect to don't ask, don't tell. When this was put into \noperation, it seemed to me at the time--and I have said repeatedly in \nthe intervening decade-plus that don't ask, don't tell has been in \neffect--that it has outlived its usefulness, its utility. I do not know \nthat it ever had utility, but, if so, it certainly ought to be changed \nnow.\n  There are men and women, regardless of sexual orientation, who serve \nwith bravery and distinction in the military. Don't ask, don't tell \nought to be repealed. There are limits as to what the President may be \nable to do through an executive order. So where congressional action is \nwarranted, let it be enacted.\n  On a somewhat similar tone, times have changed with the Defense of \nMarriage Act since it was enacted back in 1996. Now we have seen the \nStates of Connecticut, Iowa, and Massachusetts have legalized same-sex \nmarriage. It is an issue where attitudes have changed very \nconsiderably. I think, just as we were finally able to get hate crimes \nlegislation through, just as it is time to move ahead and move beyond \ndon't ask don't tell, it is time to repeal the Defense of Marriage Act.\n  In the absence of any other Senator right now seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S10727]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, yesterday I got a call from my friend \nand my colleague from Pennsylvania, Senator Specter. He said: Have you \nread the New York Times yet?\n  I said: Well, no, as a matter of fact I have not.\n  He said: Well, there was a front page story in the New York Times on \nSunday about what was happening with small businesses, in terms of \ntheir insurance rates going up unduly, huge increases.\n  I said: Well, no, I have not read about it. I will get the paper and \nread it.\n  It struck a chord with me because somehow, over the last several \nweeks, I have gotten an influx of inquiries to me personally and also \ninto my office from small businesses in Iowa, some elsewhere but mostly \nfrom my State, wondering what was happening to the huge increases in \ntheir premiums this year.\n  They have always been used to increases in premiums, but these seemed \nunduly large. Plus, a lot of copays and deductibles were going up. So I \nwent out and got the newspaper and read the story in the New York Times \nthat Senator Specter pointed out to me. It was alarming.\n  As I said, I thought about all the inquires that had come into any \noffice. I said: Something is going on out there. Something is going on \nout there. So we have this health care bill now, reform, that will be \ngoing down to CBO, I guess today, for scoring.\n  I wish to commend Senator Reid for his leadership. I was actually in \nPittsburgh today giving a lecture on disability policy at the \nUniversity of Pittsburgh law school, with former Attorney General Dick \nThornburgh, who had endowed the law school with an endowment. They have \na very strong legal scholarship program dealing with disability law at \nthe University of Pittsburgh law school.\n  So I rushed back from there so I could be on the floor with Senator \nSpecter to talk about this a little bit because there is something very \nfunny going on.\n  When I was in the airport, I saw Senator Reid had said he was sending \nthe bill down to CBO for scoring. I commend Senator Reid for his \nleadership and for putting in a strong public option. I am told it is \nbasically the public option the Senator from North Carolina worked so \nhard on in the committee to develop. I guess he married that up with \nthe provisions from the Finance Committee bill that would allow States \nto opt out by 2014. I commend Senator Reid for putting that strong \npublic option in the bill. The vast majority of the American people \nwant that. They see it as necessary for trying to keep some control on \ncost and leaving more choice and more competition for policyholders.\n  As a matter of fact, this would be a great help to small businesses, \nbecause small businesses could go on the exchange, and they would have \nthat public option also available to them. I have said many times: The \ntwo biggest winners I can see in the health reform bill are small \nbusinesses and the self-employed. Small businesses are at the end of \nthe line. They have been whipsawed all over the place. They have no \nbargaining power. The same with the self-employed. This bill will turn \nthe tables by providing the exchanges and providing more help for small \nbusinesses. They will be much better able to negotiate and to pick and \nchoose among different policies rather than what they have now.\n  Now in many cases they get one or two, and that is about it in a lot \nof States, one or two different insurance companies. In the New York \nTimes article, some suggest the insurance companies are raising their \nrates to generate as much revenue as possible before health reform \nobliges them to change the way they do business.\n  Isn't that interesting. They are anticipating health reform passing \nso they want to jack up their premiums as much as possible before that \nhappens. Others assert the industry is responding to Wall Street's \ndemands for ever higher profits in the health insurance industry, that \nWall Street is putting pressure on them to increase profit margins.\n  Again, I always have to ask: Why are we doing health reform? Are we \ndoing health reform to help the health insurance industry or are we \ndoing health reform to help the American people? That had to be our \nfirst response, that we are here to help the American people, not to \nhelp the health insurance industry.\n  I have had many small businesses tell me how tough it has been. I \nhave a small newspaper in Iowa with 12 employees. The owner Art Cullen \nrecently turned 50. Their insurance premiums for his small business \njumped by 58 percent in 1 year and more than 100 percent in 2 years. \nThey have a $5,000 deductible.\n  I asked Art: Why don't you get another company? He said: I can't. I \nonly have one in this area that will offer insurance. So that is why we \nneed the exchanges, why we need health reform, so that Art Cullen and \nhis small business can join with other small businesses on these \nexchanges to get a better deal.\n  Mike Landeaur owns a muffler shop. He has 10 employees. He offers \ninsurance to them, but his premiums have jumped 66 percent in the last \n3 years. His deductibles have gone from $4,000 to $16,000. Mike is \nexpensive. He was born with a congenital heart disease, so he dropped \nhimself from his company's policy. He is the owner, taking himself out \nof the pool. But he can't get any kind of individual insurance because \nof his preexisting condition. Now he is worried he will have to sell \nthe small business, all because of excessive health insurance costs.\n  This is unconscionable. As we speak, the majority leader is sending \nhis bill down to CBO. And make no mistake, the bill we are bringing to \nthe floor will offer real solutions for small businesses. It will \nenable them to purchase insurance through an exchange so they can \nchoose among multiple plans at lower costs than are now available in \nthe small group market. Small businesses and the self-employed can go \non the exchanges and, if they want, they also are eligible for the \npublic option.\n  It will sharply reduce administrative overhead that drives up the \ncost of insurance through such practices and medical underwriting and \npreexisting condition exclusion clauses. We provide a new small \nbusiness tax credit to make insurance more affordable for the most \nvulnerable small businesses. We make new investments in wellness and \ndisease prevention for all businesses, including small businesses.\n  In addition, we will put a stop to the outrageous and unacceptable \ninsurance industry practices that harm the ability of small employers \nto cover their workers. We will require that insurance companies \ndocument how much of each premium dollar is going for medical expenses. \nWe will require that insurance companies document how much of each \npremium dollar goes for medical expenses, and we are going to require \nrebates for excessive overhead charges. We will end the broken status \nquo where insurance executives make tens of millions of dollars in \nsalaries and bonuses while their small business customers go out of \nbusiness because they can't afford health insurance. We will end the \nexceptional and unwarranted antitrust exemptions the industry has \nenjoyed without public benefit for far too long. We will end the \nability of insurers to jack up premiums by as much as 160 percent, \nwhich is what they did for one small business, because they thought the \ngroup was ``getting too old.'' Therefore, they jacked up their premiums \nby 160 percent.\n  I thank Senator Specter for having a keen eye and for giving me a \nheads up on this yesterday. There is something happening out there \nright now all over this country. Small businesses are being inundated \nwith higher costs and huge increases in their insurance premiums. To \nAmerica's small business community, we have a simple message: Help is \non the way. We will get this health reform bill done, and we are going \nto help small businesses and the self-employed.\n  I hope they can hang on long enough so we can get this bill through, \nhopefully before the end of the year, so that\n\n[[Page S10728]]\n\nnext year when their policies are up for renewal, we won't see these \nkinds of huge increases and gouging of small businesses.\n  We need reform. We always think about it in terms of individuals and \nhow this affects individuals. But we also think about how it affects \nthe majority of workers who work for small businesses who don't have \nthe kind of large group power that maybe big businesses and bigger \nindustries have. That is why this health reform bill is so important \nfor everyone, but none more so than the small businesses and the self-\nemployed.\n  I am hopeful, along with Senator Specter, that we can bring some more \nof this to light. I encourage anyone who has any evidence, stories, \nanything we can document of what the increases are to small businesses, \nplease get them in to us. I have heard about enough of these to know it \nis not just a few here and there. It must be more widespread. We need \nthose. Hopefully, we can shed more light on this as we move forward to \nbring the bill to the floor.\n  I thank my colleague for his leadership and for bringing this out. I \nlook forward to working with him to try to help small businesses in \nPennsylvania, Iowa, and everywhere else.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Before commenting further on the article in the New York \nTimes, some of the things the distinguished chairman of the HELP \nCommittee has said, it would be my hope that we would proceed, as \nSenator Harkin related. I got hold of him yesterday morning after \nnoting the Sunday Times, and then we proceeded to talk about a hearing \nwhich I hope we can do promptly. One of the witnesses whom I would like \nto see called, subject to the approval of the chairman, is Walter Rowen \nof the Susquehanna Glass Company in Columbia, PA who sought to renew \nhis company's coverage for 2,000 employees and found out that the \npremiums had gone up by 160 percent. I talked to Mr. Rowen this \nafternoon and got more of the details of his situation.\n  As Senator Harkin has commented, this is typical of a great many. \nRight in the middle of where we are now on this debate on the public \noption, I believe the case for the public option, a robust public \noption, would be strengthened materially to document what the New York \nTimes has said. Right now it is a newspaper article. It is a little \ndifferent when there is a Senate hearing on the subject and you bring \nin people such as Walter Rowen who have demand for a 160-percent \nincrease, and you question the insurance companies on what they are \ndoing. If the New York Times is accurate, that small businesses will be \nasked to pay about a 15-percent increase for the next year--and this is \nsubstantially higher, and in a moment or two I will go through some of \nthe specific quotations--and that they are responding to Wall Street \nbecause Wall Street is demanding more profits from their investors--\nthat is specified in the article, and I will take it up in detail--and \nthe comment is that the insurance companies are more frightened about \nWall Street than they are about Congress. I suppose that was surprising \nto me that in the context of the times, the way Congress is moving \nahead on comprehensive health care reform, insurance reform, that they \nat this point should be more concerned about Wall Street than Congress. \nI think Wall Street ought to be more concerned about Congress than \ninsurance companies. I think Congress is finally going to act on quite \na number of the abuses in so many lives. But if we are seeing here \naction by Wall Street pressuring the insurance companies to raise their \nprofits before Congress acts, then we ought to find out. If there is \nany justification for insurance companies to raise their premiums, \nlet's have them tell us. Let's bring in the insurance companies.\n  There are a lot of these famous pictures of a half a dozen corporate \nexecutives standing in front of a congressional hearing room, raising \ntheir right hands and swearing to tell the truth. And then we have some \nquestions for them. I have questions for them. Why the increase? Is \nthere an increase because health care costs have gone up?\n  One of the experts quoted in the New York Times article says 23 \npercent. Mr. Rowen faces 160 percent. Is there any justification except \nprofiteering and acting ahead of congressional action?\n  I hope Senator Harkin will have the hearing promptly. It will bolster \nthe case for the public option. It will bolster the case to have \nalternatives to the private sector. What is often misunderstood is that \nthe public option does not eliminate the private sector. The public \noption is what it says. It is an option, another course, another thing \none can choose. It is precisely this kind of response to Wall Street--\nand I will not prejudge it until we hear the witnesses and have them \nsworn in and take their testimony--if it is true, that reemphasizes the \nneed to have some competition, to have competition which will not \nknuckle to Wall Street. A public option will not knuckle to Wall \nStreet. We have talked informally. It is not easy to get a hearing \norganized fast, but Senator Harkin and I, as is well known, passed the \ngavel on the chairmanship of the Subcommittee on Labor, Health and \nHuman Services, and Education. We can proceed. I submit that now is the \ntime to do so.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I thank the Senator again for bringing \nthis to light and urging us. I think we do need information. We do need \nto bring them in and check on what is happening with small business. We \nneed to bring in some small businesses, some representatives of small \nbusinesses. I think we need to bring in some of those insurance people, \nfind out what is going on here. How come premiums are going up so much \nthis year? I think we were in a recession, were we not?\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I have seen Senator Harkin cross-\nexamine, and it is a sight to see.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am not in the former prosecutor's \nleague in that regard, I can say that. But we are working on that. As \nthe Senator knows, sometimes it is tough to get these hearings put \ntogether. But hopefully we will have something we can pull together by \nnext week.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the chairman for that \nstatement. Next week would be about right because it would come right \nas we are considering this legislation. I think it would shed a lot of \nlight on the legislation and be a big boost for the public option.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. HARKIN. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I refer to some of the specifics in the \nNew York Times article. Again, I cite this as a newspaper article. It \nis hearsay in an article, but we will have the hearings to find out the \nfacts. But this is what some of the details in the article say: that \nsmall businesses ``are seeing premiums go up an average of about 15 \npercent for the coming year--double the rate of last year's increase''; \nbig employers ``have more negotiating clout.'' ``[S]ome experts say \nthey think the insurance industry'' is ``under pressure from Wall \nStreet'' to raise its ``premiums to get ahead of any legislative \nchanges that might reduce their profits.''\n  Well, if that is so, we ought to find out about it. And if they have \na justification for the price increases, let them tell us what it is. \nLet them produce their books and records if they have a justifiable \nbasis for their increase.\n  The New York Times article goes on to point out that ``Edward Kaplan, \na consultant with the Segal Company, said his clients were seeing \nrenewals for coverage at prices 15 to 23 percent higher this year,'' \nwhere ``they typically faced increases'' in the past ``of 7 to 12 \npercent.''\n\n       Joshua Miley, a consultant with HighRoads, which analyzes \n     benefit information for employers, said the ``undercurrent of \n     health reform is driving part of the renewal increases.''\n\n  The article goes on to point out:\n\n       There is no question that insurers are under pressure from \n     Wall Street . . . they have heard from angry investors \n     disappointed by the companies' earnings.\n\n  The article further states:\n\n       While the industry is particularly vulnerable now in \n     Washington, she said--\n\n  ``She,'' meaning Sheryl Skolnick, an analyst for Pali Capital, \nreferring to the insurance companies--\n\n     ``it seems like they're more afraid of Wall Street.''\n\n\n[[Page S10729]]\n\n\n  The article goes on to point out that:\n\n       In August, when Walter Rowen, who owns Susquehanna Glass \n     [Company] in Columbia, Pa., sought to renew his company's \n     coverage for two dozen employees, he said his insurer \n     demanded a 160 percent rate increase.\n\n  I called Mr. Rowen today and found out that he has had a family \nbusiness since 1910, and they have had health insurance for about 20 \nyears, and they cover 50 percent of the premiums for their employees. \nAs prices have risen, they have sought deductibles to lower the rate, \nand then they paid the deductibles for their employees. It is cheaper \nto have deductibles, have the company pay them, than to pay the \nincrease in costs. That is another factor which we ought to analyze. \nThat ought not to be so.\n  His policy expired in October--this month--and he corroborated the \nNew York Times story that he was told there would be 160 percent more. \nHe has found other insurance, but he is paying $22,000 annually. He \nhires invariably in the 28 to 32 category for small business, and \nbetween 20 and 24 of them are covered. Now he has been forced to go to \nthe point where the employees are going to have to pay the deductible. \nIf they do not have an illness, then there is no problem. If they do, \nthen the deductible is obviously very, very expensive.\n  I join my colleague, the senior Senator from Iowa, in congratulating \nthe--now he is the junior Senator from Iowa, pardon me, but close--he \nhas been here since the election of 1984, a long time. I join Senator \nHarkin in congratulating the majority leader for moving ahead with a \npublic option in the legislation which he has melded together. I again \nthank Senator Harkin for his initiative and willingness to move ahead \nand have a hearing.\n  Madam President, I have an excellent floor statement which I will not \ntake the time to read, prepared by my expert in the field, John Myers, \nwhich I ask unanimous consent that the full text of the statement be \nprinted in the Congressional Record, and I ask that the full \nexplanation which I am giving now be included. Sometimes the written \nstatement just follows the oral extemporaneous statement and people \nreading the Congressional Record wonder why the Senator has repeated \nhimself. Well, let it be understood what I have said is an \nextemporaneous statement, and this is the text prepared by my able \nstaff assistant, and would ask that these comments be the preface to be \nincluded in the Record in full.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, yesterday the New York Times ran a front \npage article describing the difficulties faced by small businesses in \nthe face of rising health costs [Small Business Faces Sharp Rise in \nCosts of Health Care; October 25, 2009]. Small business is the backbone \nof our economy and in today's economy we must ensure that small \nbusiness has every opportunity to succeed.\n  The article highlights the plight of Walter Rowen, a constituent of \nmine. Mr. Rowen is the owner of Susquehanna Glass in Columbia, \nPennsylvania. In August, when he sought to renew his company's coverage \nfor his two dozen employees, his insurer demanded a 160 percent rate \nincrease. He was told his work force was ``getting too old and very \nexpensive''. He also found that any other health plan was likely to \ncharge 30 to 50 percent more than he paid last year. Left with few \noptions, Walter chose a less generous plan from a different carrier for \n44 percent more.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Rowen's story is not unique. Steep rises in \ninsurance premiums are affecting small businesses across the nation. \nSmall businesses are seeing renewal prices 15-23 percent higher \ncompared to last year, according to Edward Kaplan, a benefits \nconsultant with the Segal Company. As increases from 2008 to 2009 were \nconsiderably lower at 7-12 percent, it is hard to believe that a \ndoubling of the rate of renewal costs in 1 year could be linked to \nmedical costs alone. In the article Joshua Miley, a consultant who \nanalyzes benefit information for employers, states that the \nundercurrent of health reform is driving part of the renewal increases. \nThe idea that health insurance companies would increase rates to \nbeneficiaries based on pending health care reform is disturbing. \nMichael A. Turpin, a former senior executive for United Health, and now \na top official at USI holdings, an insurance brokerage firm, echoes Mr. \nWiley's hypothesis: insurance companies are ``under so much pressure to \npost earnings, they're going to make hay while the sun is shining.''\n  Clearly the primary concern of health insurers is not whether their \ncustomers receive the best possible health care for their money; it is \nhow much money can be generated for the insurers' investors. This \nobjectionable action illustrates why there is a need for a public \noption as part of health care reform. Currently, there is a lack of \ncompetition in the health insurance market. Instead of individuals or \nbusinesses having the freedom to shop for coverage that works for them, \nthey have to take what insurance companies offer. This translates to \nhigher prices, preexisting condition exclusions and denials when \ninsurance is most needed. A public option can help by introducing \ncompetition across the country. This plan could constrain costs and \nmake the insurers think twice about passing down double-digit rate \nincreases to customers.\n  The American people deserve a choice in health insurance to keep the \nprivate insurers honest. Without competition from a public plan, health \ninsurance costs have skyrocketed. As health reform moves forward, I \nencourage Majority Leader Reid to include a public option to bring \naffordability and competition back to the market.\n  A recent survey conducted by Intuit Inc. revealed that 44 percent of \nsmall business owners intended to hire new employees in the next year, \nan encouraging indicator in our economic recovery. This survey also \nnoted that nearly 90 percent of those small business owners surveyed \nsaid that health insurance benefits are integral to attracting good \nworkers. However, 58 percent of those small employers do not offer \nhealth insurance, with nearly 50 percent stating that they can't afford \nit. This is a sobering statistic and one we should do everything in our \npower to address.\n  I commend the efforts of Chairmen Harkin and Baucus to combat this \nissue. Proposed health reform legislation will include a tax credit for \nsmall businesses that provide health insurance to their employees. The \nHELP Committee bill provides a tax credit for small businesses of up to \n$2,000 for a family or $1,000 for an individual. The legislation will \nallow small businesses to join health insurance exchanges so that they \ncan group together and gain the same market power as larger companies \ncurrently enjoy. Currently, perhaps most importantly, small businesses \npay up to 18 percent more than large employers. These exchanges will \nhelp relieve the problem of small risk pools, which due to their size \ncan see their costs grow significantly if one employee suffers an \nillness such as cancer. By increasing the size of these risk pools, \ncosts will become more predictable and more affordable for small \nbusinesses. Proposed legislation will also tighten insurance ratings to \nprevent costs from being disproportionately placed on older workers. \nThis is of particular importance for small businesses that might employ \nolder individuals, an important part of our Nation's workforce.\n  There is an undeniable need to address the health care problems we \nsuffer from today. The inequities of the current system must be fixed, \nespecially for the 70 million people that are employed by or operate a \nsmall business. The decisions of health insurers to drastically \nincrease health insurance prices before health reform is enacted \ndemonstrates the need to promptly move forward with legislation that \nincludes a public option.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Madam President, I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10729-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10729-S10730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO ROZITA VILLANUEVA LEE\n\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I rise today to honor Rozita Villanueva \nLee for her many years of advocacy on behalf of the Nevada Asian \nAmerican/Pacific Islander community. Asians and Pacific Islanders refer \nto her as the mother of their communities in southern Nevada. Lee \nstarted as a former special assistant to former Governors George \nArioshi of Hawaii and Robert Miller of Nevada. She then began \nadvocating for Nevada's Asian and Pacific Islanders. Her Hawaii \nPolynesian connection led to her being the producer of\n\n[[Page S10730]]\n\n``Drums of the Island,'' the longest running Polynesian show on the Las \nVegas strip.\n  As cofounder of the Asian Pacific's Forum in 1993 in response to the \ngrowing Asian Pacific Islander population and their need for a voice \nand representation, she championed many causes to address the \nchallenges faced by her community including social justice advocacy and \npolitical representation. She was often the first person called \nregarding issues of the APIA community in Las Vegas. Lee helped \nfacilitate the reorganization of a dormant Pacific Asian Chamber to \nwhat is now the Las Vegas Asian Chamber of Commerce serving as its \nfounding chairperson. She also served as chairperson for the Philippine \nAmerican Youth Organization, PAYO, helping the younger generation of \nFilipino ancestry establish a voice and an avenue to learn more about \ntheir culture and heritage. She fulfilled all these roles while serving \nas the conduit for many organizations including the Hawaiian Civic \nClub, Japanese American Citizens League, Organization of Chinese \nAmericans and National Federation of Filipino American Association. In \naddition, she empowered cultural organization and their leaders within \nthe Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Indian, Pakistani and other APIA ethnic \ncommunities.\n  Rozita has been politically active also. She was the president of the \nWomen's Democratic Club of Clark County and was leading her fellow \nDemocrats to help bring about change. As a result, President Obama \nturned Nevada blue by winning Clark County with 380,765 votes. Mrs. Lee \nchampioned the Asian American Studies Bill in the Nevada State \nLegislature which was instituted by the Clark County Commission and \nbecame law. She has been actively serving as the chairperson for the \nAsian Pacific American Labor Alliance--APALA--in southern Nevada and \nhas been the prime mover of political activism with the APIA for more \nthan a decade. She initiated the first outreach to establish an APIA \nvoting block through education and voter registration and was the \nliaison between the Philippine Ambassador and the Senate on behalf of \nthe Filipino World War II Veterans. It is clear that Rozita is a \ndedicated community activist.\n  Rozita Villanueva Lee was named on the most influential women in Las \nVegas by the Women of Diversity, and one of 100 most influential \nFilipina women in the U.S. by Filipina Women's Network. The OCA Asian \nPacific American organization awarded Rozita the Lifetime Achievement \nAward in 2007. I congratulate Rozita Lee on her success as a \nbusinesswoman, a Democratic activist, and as an advocate for Asian and \nPacific Islanders.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10730-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10730-S10731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CONSUMER CREDIT\n\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Madam President, I rise today to discuss an \nissue of importance to all American consumers who rely on credit cards, \nespecially during our economic downturn. More specifically, I would \nlike to address two pieces of critically important legislation that \nwould help consumers.\n  First, last week I introduced legislation to move up the effective \ndate of credit card reforms outlined in the Credit CARD Act, which was \nsigned into law by President Obama in May. The act gave credit card \nissuers nine months from the date of enactment to phase out their most \negregious practices, including arbitrarily raising interest rates, \nraising interest rates on existing balances, and charging interest on \ndebt paid on time--the latter a particularly underhanded tactic known \nas double-cycle billing.\n  Rather than phasing out these practices before the new requirements \ntake effect, credit card issuers have increased them, squeezing as much \nas they can out of American consumers prior to the date the reforms are \nscheduled to go into effect. A Pew Charitable Trusts study to be \nreleased later this week will reveal that through the first 6 months of \nthis year, the 12 largest credit card issuers raised interest rates an \naverage of 20 percent, with many cardholders seeing rate increases in \nexcess of 20 percent. This is happening despite the fact that these \ncredit card companies, many of which received taxpayer bailout funds, \nare reaping the benefit--some might say government subsidy--of Federal \ninterest rates at or near zero percent.\n  The bill I introduced last week, the Expedited CARD Reform for \nConsumers Act of 2009, will move the effective date of enactment for \nall reforms required under the Credit CARD Act to December 1, 2009. The \nmajority of reforms are currently due to go into effect on February 22, \n2010, with a few other reforms due to go into effect on August 22, \n2010.\n  We all know how important short-term credit is to families and small \nbusinesses, especially during hard economic times. And we have all \nheard stories of people who have been victimized by the kind of unfair \npractices that the Credit CARD Act will end. But the truth is I have \nheard more stories from my constituents about these unfair and \ndeceptive practices since the President signed the Credit CARD Act into \nlaw, than I did in the months leading up to the bill's passage. And \nthat's saying something.\n  Through no fault of their own, many Coloradans have been victimized \nby their credit card issuer. For example, a constituent named Jean from \nCommerce City wrote to me:\n\n       Recently, CitiBank raised my [credit card] APR to 29.99 \n     percent. I called and found out that they did not raise my \n     rate because I'm late, or have a bad FICO score, but because \n     they sent me a letter with the option to opt OUT of a higher \n     interest rate. I've had this card for over 15 years and never \n     been late. I don't understand how taxpayers gave banks \n     taxpayer money, banks report record profits, and banks still \n     feel they can [take unfair advantage of] the common Joe. \n     Basically our credit card companies took away our available \n     credit and then raised our credit card rates even though we \n     made payments on time. Please help the citizens of this \n     country instead of helping the few executives at these banks. \n     We really need your help, and in the long run this will help \n     our country.\n\n  Likewise, northern Colorado small business owner Ginny Teel, whose \ncompany 10 til 2 helps pair businesses with professionals looking for \npart-time work, recently took to the airwaves to tell a similar story. \nIn a Denver television news story, Ginny reported how her credit card \ncompany is doubling her interest rate, from 11 percent to 22 percent, \nfor no reason. Like many small businesses, Ginny relied on her credit \ncard to get her business up and running. In the letter to inform her of \nthe rate increase, Wells Fargo states: ``These changes are not a \nreflection of how you managed your account with us or your credit \nscore.'' In other words, her credit card issuer is saying it is \ndoubling her interest rate because it still can.\n  I have heard from hundreds of Coloradans with similar stories since \nthe Credit CARD Act was passed.\n  For many American families and small businesses, credit cards are \nmore than a convenience, they are a necessity. Short-term credit is \nsometimes the only way that families can pay for necessities or that \nsmall businesses can function. And a well-functioning credit card \nindustry that treats its customers with fairness is absolutely \nessential to rebuilding our economy.\n  I first introduced legislation to end unfair and abusive credit card \npractices in 2005 as a Member of the House of Representatives, and I \nwas honored to be a part of finally passing real reform earlier this \nyear. But I am equally disappointed that credit card issuers would now \nbleed American consumers for as much as they can prior to the reforms \ntaking effect.\n  My legislation is supported by consumer advocate organizations, \nincluding the member organizations of Americans for Fairness in \nLending, as well as the National Small Business Association, whose \nmembers, like Ginny Teel, increasingly rely on credit cards for their \nsmall business needs.\n  During debate on the Credit CARD Act earlier this year, credit card \ncompanies told Congress they needed more time to implement the bill's \nreforms, and Congress accommodated them. Rather than phase out these \npractices, however, credit card companies have used this extra time to \ndeclare open season on their customers. If credit card companies can \nincrease abuse on a moment's notice, then surely they can end consumer \nabuse in short order.\n  Credit card issuers have shown they cannot be trusted to act in the \ninterest of the American consumer. It is time to force credit card \ncompanies to finally deal honestly with American taxpayers and comply \nwith the reforms passed earlier this year.\n  I thank Senators Schumer, Harkin, Levin, Bingaman, Tester, and\n\n[[Page S10731]]\n\nMerkley for cosponsoring the Expedited CARD Reform for Consumers Act. \nIn addition, along with Senate Banking Committee Chairman Dodd, today I \ncosponsored a bill that would immediately freeze interest rates on \nexisting credit card balances. This is an important bill that will \nallow consumers to pay off their credit card debt at the interest rate \nthey consented to when they took on that debt. It is a matter of \nfairness. I look forward to working with Chairman Dodd and colleagues \nfrom both parties to pass these important bills as quickly as possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10731-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             FIREARM DEATHS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, according to the latest data from the \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC, 3,184 children and \nteens died from a firearm in the United States in 2006, a 6 percent \nincrease from 2005. This breaks down to the life of an American child \nbeing taken every 2 hours and 45 minutes by someone wielding a gun. \nMore than five times as many, or nearly 17,500 children and teens \nsuffered a nonfatal gun injury that year, a 7 percent increase from the \nprevious year.\n  The 2009 Children's Defense Fund's report ``Protect Children, Not \nGuns'' illustrates the problem even more pointedly. The report, which \nprovides key findings on children's gun deaths, states that more \npreschoolers were killed by firearms in 2006 than were law enforcement \nofficers in the line of duty.\n  This type of violence is preventable. It only requires action. The \nChildren's Defense Fund's report makes a number of recommendations \nabout how to protect children from gun violence. Among other things, \nthey recommend schools provide nonviolent conflict resolution courses \nfor all students and communities create positive activities for \nchildren and teenagers to reduce the influence of gangs and drugs. They \nalso recommend passage of such common sense gun safety legislation as \nclosing the gun show loophole, strengthening the Brady background check \nsystem and reauthorizing the assault weapons ban.\n  We cannot afford to sit and watch as so many young lives are \nirrevocably destroyed by gun violence. Passage of commonsense \nlegislation would help end these types of tragedies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10731-2", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING SPECIALIST JACOB WILLIAM SEXTON\n\n  Mr. BAYH. Madam President, I rise today to honor the life of Army SPC \nJacob William Sexton. A member of Company A, 2nd Battalion 151st \nInfantry of the Indiana National Guard, Jacob was only 21 years old \nwhen his life came to a tragic end on October 12, 2009, while on leave \nfrom active deployment in Afghanistan.\n  Today, I join Jacob's family and friends in mourning his untimely \ndeath. Jacob will be remembered as a loving brother, son and friend to \nmany. He is survived by his parents, Jeffery and Barbara; his three \nbrothers, Joshua, Jeremiah and Jared; his paternal grandparents; \nmaternal grandmother; and a community of friends and family members. \nLike two of his brothers, Jacob followed in the footsteps of his \nfather, an Army veteran. His brother described Jacob as his father's \nbest friend.\n  A native of Farmland, IN, Jacob enlisted in the National Guard after \ngraduating from Monroe Central High School in 2006. He served his first \ntour in Iraq with the Winchester guard unit as a humvee driver. Upon \nreturning home, he continued to serve his country by training other \nmilitary humvee drivers and keeping charge of weapons and ammunition at \nCamp Atterbury. More recently, he was deployed near Kabul, Afghanistan, \nwhere he was described by his superiors as a model soldier with good \nmorale and an excellent sense of humor.\n  While we struggle to express our sorrow over the loss of Jacob, we \ncan take pride in the example he set as a soldier, a son, a grandson, \nand a brother. Today and always, he will be remembered by family, \nfriends, and fellow Hoosiers as a true American hero, and we cherish \nthe legacy of his service and his life.\n  It is my sad duty to enter the name of Jacob William Sexton in the \nrecord of the Senate for his service to this country and for his \nprofound commitment to freedom, democracy and peace.\n  I pray that the Sexton family can find comfort in the words of the \nprophet Isaiah who said, ``He will swallow up death in victory; and the \nLord God will wipe away tears from off all faces.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10731-3", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n         RECOGNIZING THE I HAVE WINGS BREAST CANCER FOUNDATION\n\n Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, today I would like to recognize \nthe I Have Wings breast cancer foundation in Erlanger, KY. October is \nNational Breast Cancer Awareness Month and I Have Wings has dedicated \nits efforts to the ongoing battle against breast cancer.\n  According to the American Cancer Society, this year over 190,000 new \ncases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in our Nation and an \nestimated 40,000 Americans will lose their fight with breast cancer. At \nthe same time, today there are millions of women in our country who \nhave been treated for breast cancer.\n  Throughout my tenure as a U.S. Senator, I have supported legislation \nto increase awareness, prevention, and funding for breast cancer. Too \noften we hear about a case of breast cancer that is caught at a late \nstage, leaving the patient and families with little hope. These stories \nremind us why we must continue to support and expand National Breast \nCancer Awareness Month efforts.\n  The I Have Wings foundation is a leader in the fight against breast \ncancer. It strives to educate individuals, provides encouragement for \nthose in need, and generously supports research efforts in Kentucky. \nAnd while efforts by I Have Wings and other breast cancer foundations \noften go unnoticed in the ongoing battle against this deadly disease, \nwe must remember that they play an important role as an activist and \neducator in our communities.\n  Again, I commend the efforts of the I Have Wings foundation as our \nNation continues to spread breast cancer awareness.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10731-4", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING DANIEL MELNICK\n\n Mr. DODD. Madam President, I wish to speak in honor of a good \nfriend and a friend to American cinema, Daniel Melnick, who passed away \nrecently at the age of 77.\n  Those who know Hollywood will remember Daniel as a successful \nproducer of film and television, and as a studio executive who believed \nin audacity and creativity--a filmmaker's studio executive, if you \nwill.\n  He was a prodigy, becoming the youngest producer at CBS Television at \nthe age of 19, where he worked on such series as the legendary ``Get \nSmart,'' and producing his first feature film at MGM, the thrilling \n``Straw Dogs,'' before he turned 40. Over the next decade, he played a \nrole in the development of films ranging from ``Network'' to ``Kramer \nvs. Kramer'' to ``The China Syndrome,'' while serving as head of \nproduction at both MGM and Columbia.\n  As a film producer, Daniels's credits include ``All That Jazz,'' \n``Altered States,'' ``Footloose,'' ``Roxanne,'' and ``L.A. Story.'' \nFittingly, his work as a producer was bold and vibrant--just the sort \nof films he encouraged as a studio executive.\n  In all, Daniel's films were nominated for more than 80 Academy \nAwards, and won more than two dozen Oscars.\n  I will remember Daniel as a warm, funny, breathtakingly creative \nfriend whose beautiful house in Utah was the site of many wonderful \nget-togethers. We are poorer for the loss, but richer for all he gave \nto our country and the arts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10731-5", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10731-S10732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             TIRBUTE TO LIEUTENANT COLONEL MICHEL G. JONES\n\n Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, today, I recognize the service \nLTC Michel ``Shel'' G. Jones, on the occasion of his retirement from \nactive duty in the U.S. Army. Lieutenant Colonel Jones is an \nexceptional officer who has served our great Nation for more than 28 \nyears, including 22 years on active duty and 6 years in the Iowa Army \nNational Guard.\n  I have personally come to know and respect Lieutenant Colonel Jones \nover the 2\\1/2\\ years he served as an Army congressional liaison for \nthe Army's weapons and tracked combat vehicles programs, to include the \nArmy's Future\n\n[[Page S10732]]\n\nCombat System. His expertise and commitment were instrumental in \neducating Members and staff in the Senate and House on Army combat \nsystems, modernization programs and initiatives. His tireless efforts \nworking with Members and staff of the Senate and House Armed Services \nCommittees were instrumental in the successful authorization and \nappropriation of the Abrams tank, Bradley fighting vehicle, small arms \nand crew-served weapons, Stryker, elements of the Future Combat System \nand the Paladin Integrated Management programs.\n  Lieutenant Colonel Jones' congressional liaison assignment was only \nthe capstone to what is an outstanding career of service to the Army \nand our Nation. He served as an armor officer in numerous command and \nstaff positions. His operational assignments began in the Mojave Desert \nat Fort Irwin, CA, serving as a platoon leader at the National Training \nCenter where he trained thousands of soldiers in desert warfare. He \nserved as commander for Alpha Company, 4th Battalion 37th Armor, Heavy, \nfollowed by command of Headquarters and Headquarters Company, 2nd of \nthe 70th Armor Battalion with the 1st Armored Division at Fort Riley, \nKS. After transitioning in to the acquisition career field, Lieutenant \nColonel Jones was assigned to Fort Knox, KY, as a combat development \nofficer and as a project manager for the Army's Future Combat System, \nFCS, in Detroit, MI.\n  The strength of our soldiers comes from their families. Lieutenant \nColonel Jones' strength came from his wife Dynette, and his two sons \nColton and Conner. This Nation is grateful for their commitment and \npersonal sacrifices made throughout Shel's military service. We also \nthank his mother Joyce, who recently passed, and his father William \n``Gerry'' Jones for raising such a fine son and patriot. Shel is from a \nmilitary family. His father is a retired soldier and his brother, Dr. \nKeith Jones, serves as a major in the National Guard. This Nation \nremains indebted to your service.\n  On behalf of the Senate and the United States of America, I commend \nLieutenant Colonel Jones for his tireless efforts in the support of our \nArmy, our military, and our Nation. As Shel and his family prepare to \nstart a new life in the great State of Oklahoma, I congratulate him on \ncompleting an extremely successful military career and wish all of them \nthe best in all their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10732-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10732]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO KAREN M.

Karen, a remarkable public servant under both \nthe legacy Immigration and Naturalization Service and U.S. Citizenship \nand Immigration Services, and devoted resident of Buffalo, NY, retired \non May 29, 2009.\n  Karen began her career as an immigration inspector at Niagara Falls, \nNY, in 1972 and quickly became knowledgeable in all areas of \nimmigration. Her work has touched the lives of thousands--giving hope \nto countless immigrants and new citizens in pursuit of their dreams, as \nwell as uniting adoptive parents with children in need of a loving \nhome, while striving to protect children and underprivileged birth \nparents from exploitation.\n  Karen became a leading expert in intercountry adoption and child \ncitizenship. In this role, she was invaluable in establishing the Child \nCitizenship Program in Buffalo, NY, drafting orphan regulations, and \nleading USCIS to take the steps necessary to implement the Hague \nConvention on Protection of Children and Cooperation in Respect of \nIntercountry Adoption.\n  Her outstanding and distinguished service has been recognized through \nnumerous awards, including an Angel in Adoption Award from the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption Institute in 2003, the Department \nof Homeland Security Secretary's Meritorious Service Award in 2006 and \nthe USCIS Director's Award in 2008 for her direction and participation \nin the Hague Implementation Working Group.\n  It is impossible to count the number of individuals who have \npersonally benefited from Karen's professionalism, insights and \ndedication and she will be sincerely missed by her colleagues \nworldwide.\n  We congratulate Karen M.

Madam President, today I wish to pay tribute to the \nAmerican men and women who served their country valiantly during World \nWar II, and to a nonprofit organization known as HonorFlight which \nflies surviving veterans, at no expense to themselves, to Washington, \nDC, to visit the World War II Memorial. I wish to have printed in the \nRecord a letter from Scott C. Stump, a veteran of the U.S. Marine \nCorps, describing the efforts of HonorFlight which will enable two \nHoosier veterans, Harvey H. Hammerlund and Joseph B. Smrt, to visit the \nWorld War II Memorial this fall.\n  The letter follows:\n\n       Dear Senator Lugar: During World War II, 16 million \n     American men and women selflessly, and unflinchingly served \n     our country and defended our way of life for future \n     generations. Now, more than 64 years since the end of that \n     Great War, only three million of our World War II Veterans \n     walk among us. Even more alarming, we are losing these \n     veterans at the rate of 1,000 per day, which is causing their \n     ranks to dwindle at an alarming rate. Now more than ever, we \n     need to take pause and recognize these veterans and their \n     contributions to making our great country what she is today. \n     Part of that recognition, the National World War II Monument \n     in Washington, DC, was completed and opened to World War II \n     Veterans and the public on 29 April 2004.\n       Since its opening, the monument has been like a shining \n     star, beckoning to our World Wax II Veterans. In fact, many \n     of those veterans have had a dream of visiting this monument \n     erected to the remembrance of ``The Greatest Generation.'' \n     Unfortunately, due to health, monetary, and other \n     constraints, many World War II Veterans have been unable to \n     visit ``their'' Memorial.\n       In 2005 that all began to change when a non-profit \n     organization known as ``HonorFlight'' was born. Several \n     dedicated individuals had a vision to fly any and all of our \n     World War II Veterans to Washington, to see ``their'' \n     Memorial, at absolutely no cost to the veterans. This \n     wonderful, all volunteer force, began flying in 2005 and flew \n     a total of 137 Veterans to see the Memorial that first year. \n     Now, a brief four years later, there will be a total of over \n     42,000 veterans who have been able to fulfill their dreams \n     and wishes of being able to visit Washington, DC and, most \n     importantly, the World War II Memorial.\n       I would like to publicly thank HonorFlight and their \n     network of dedicated volunteers for all of their efforts in \n     making dreams come true. I am truly humbled to be a small \n     part of such a great organization.\n       On this date, I would also like to recognize two very \n     special World War II Veterans who are about to embark on a \n     very special journey to Washington, DC. These two Hoosiers, \n     both from the fertile farmlands of Starke County, answered \n     their call to serve their country long ago, and in so doing \n     served with honor, dignity, and courage.\n       Harvey H. Hammerlund was born on 21 December 1924 in rural \n     Knox, Indiana. Harvey was a farm boy who enlisted in The \n     United States Navy on 4 January 1944. Harvey served on The \n     U.S.S. Urben 631 as an electrician. Harvey spent the \n     remainder of the war traversing the hostile enemy-laden South \n     Pacific. Mr. Hammerlund was discharged on 23 March 1946 at \n     the rank of 3rd Class Petty Officer. Harvey returned home and \n     was a farmer for the remainder of his working years. Harvey \n     was and is a leader in Starke County serving on various \n     boards and committees, as well as being active with V.F.W. \n     Post 748 in Knox. Harvey resides on his farm outside of Knox \n     with Dee, his wife of 59 years.\n       Joseph B. Smrt was born on 14 February 1916 in North \n     Judson, Indiana. Joe enlisted in The United States Army on 11 \n     December 1942. Joe served in Patton's Third Army in the 94th \n     Division Company B 19th Engineers. Joe proudly served all \n     over Central Europe, including the epic ``Battle of the \n     Bulge'' in Belgium. Mr. Smrt was discharged on 27 December \n     1945 but continued serving in The U.S. Army Reserves for the \n     next 33 years, retiring as a Sergeant First Class. Joe worked \n     and continues to work as a Surveyor as his profession and \n     continues to be a pillar of the Starke County Community. Joe \n     still lives in Knox with Ursula, his wife of 58 years.\n       Thank you, Senator Lugar, for recognizing a great \n     organization and two outstanding individuals. These two men \n     have truly played a part in shaping the America that we know \n     and love today.\n           Sincerely,\n     Scott C.

A bill to establish a moratorium on credit card interest \nrate increases, and for other purposes; read the first time.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise today to offer legislation that would \nfreeze interest rates on existing credit card balances until the full \nprotections of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and \nDisclosure Act go into effect in February.\n  It is clear that credit card companies see gouging consumers as a \nviable means of padding their profits. When they realized that we were \nserious about ending these abusive practices, they unfortunately \ndecided to make one last grab for the pocketbooks of American consumers \nbefore the law goes into effect.\n  Even before the Credit CARD Act passed, I heard from Connecticut \nresidents who had seen their interest rates double or even triple with \nlittle warning and no explanation. As the law's implementation \napproaches, credit card companies have continued to jack up their \ncustomers' interest rates to get ahead of provisions in the Credit CARD \nAct that will permanently prohibit them from arbitrarily raising rates \non existing balances.\n  To those of us who have worked to rein in credit card abuses, this \ngreedy behavior is disturbing, although not surprising. But to the \nfamilies in my home state of Connecticut and around the country who are \nstruggling to make ends meet these days it is something worse.\n  Debt can crush families, driving them into bankruptcy and shattering \nthe financial foundation they have worked so hard to build. It is \nimpossible to get ahead when you're falling further and further behind \neach month. The anytime, any-reason rate hikes that credit card \ncompanies have used to enrich themselves have destroyed too many \nAmerican families.\n  That is why we took action to stop unjustified rate hikes, and why it \nis an outrage that credit card companies are trying to jam consumers \none last time before our law stops them.\n  I am not about to let this stand. In April, Senator Schumer and I \nwrote to the Federal Reserve, the Office of Thrift Supervision, and the \nNational Credit Union Administration, calling on them to use their \nexisting authority to implement an emergency freeze on interest rates.\n  The regulators, unfortunately, did not act. Therefore, on behalf of \nour constituents, we must. This legislation will immediately freeze \ninterest rates to ensure that Americans are protected until the full \nCredit CARD Act goes into effect.\n  When it does, a provision I included in the legislation will hold \ncredit card companies accountable for their recent behavior. Every 6 \nmonths, card companies will be required to review each account that \nthey hit with a rate hike since January 1, 2009, and reduce the rate if \nthe customer has become less of a credit risk or the circumstances that \nwarranted the increase are no longer present.\n  I have directed Federal regulators to notify all credit card \ncompanies that they will be required to comply with this provision and \nto draft regulations that provide clear, strict rules to govern the \nreviews. Customers that did not deserve to have their rates raised in \nthe first place should not have to be stuck with the higher rate after \nthe Credit CARD Act takes effect.\n  Consumers have a responsibility to spend within their means and to \npay what they owe. But credit card companies have a responsibility to \ndeal with their customers honorably. And they most certainly do not \nhave the right to rip off American families, especially when this \nCongress has already gone on the record opposing those actions.\n  Struggling middle class families won a huge victory when we passed \nthe Credit CARD Act. Let us help them win another by ensuring that the \ncredit card companies' reign of greed does not continue for even the \nshort time before the law is implemented. I urge my colleagues to join \nme in this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1927\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Res. 321\n\n       Whereas in the early morning hours of November 16, 1989, 6 \n     Jesuit priests and faculty members of the Universidad Centro-\n     americana Jose Simeon Canas (``UCA'') located in San \n     Salvador, El Salvador--Fathers Ignacio Ellacuria, Ignacio \n     Martin-Baro, Segundo Montes, Amando Lopez, Juan Ramon Moreno, \n     and Joaquin Lopez y Lopez--and housekeeper Julia Elba Ramos \n     and her daughter, Celina Mariset Ramos, were executed by \n     members of the Salvadoran Army;\n       Whereas Father Ignacio Ellacuria, aged 59, was since 1979 \n     rector of the UCA and was an internationally-respected \n     intellectual and advocate for human rights and for a \n     negotiated solution to the Salvadoran civil conflict;\n\n[[Page S10738]]\n\n       Whereas Father Ignacio Martin-Baro, aged 44, was the vice \n     rector of the UCA, a leading analyst of national and regional \n     affairs, the founder and director of the respected polling \n     organization, the Public Opinion Institute, former dean of \n     students, dean of the psychology department, an \n     internationally-renowned pioneer in the field of social \n     psychology, and pastor of the rural community of Jayaque;\n       Whereas Father Segundo Montes, aged 56, was dean of the \n     department of social sciences, a sociology professor at the \n     UCA, and the founder and director of the Human Rights \n     Institute at the UCA, who did extensive work on Salvadoran \n     refugees in the United States during the period of the \n     Salvadoran conflict, including providing documentation and \n     advice to Members of Congress on refugee issues;\n       Whereas Father Amando Lopez, aged 53, was a philosophy and \n     theology professor at the UCA, was the former director of the \n     Jesuit seminary in San Salvador, and served as pastor of the \n     Tierra Virgen community in Soyapango, a poor neighborhood in \n     the periphery of San Salvador;\n       Whereas Father Juan Ramon Moreno, aged 56, was a professor \n     of theology at the UCA, a former novice-master for the \n     Jesuits, and a tireless pastoral worker and spiritual guide;\n       Whereas Father Joaquin Lopez y Lopez, aged 71, was one of \n     the creators of the UCA and the founder, organizer, and \n     director of Fe y Alegria (Faith and Joy), an organization to \n     address the lack of education in El Salvador, which opened 30 \n     educational centers in marginalized communities throughout El \n     Salvador where 48,000 people received vocational training and \n     education;\n       Whereas Julia Elba Ramos, aged 42, was the cook and \n     housekeeper for the Jesuit seminarians at the UCA and the \n     wife of Obdulio Lozano, the UCA gardener and groundskeeper;\n       Whereas Celina Mariset Ramos, aged 16, had finished her \n     first year of high school at the Jose Damian Villacorta \n     Institute in Santa Tecla, El Salvador and was staying with \n     her mother the night of November 15, 1989;\n       Whereas the 6 Jesuit priests dedicated their lives to \n     advancing education in El Salvador, protecting and promoting \n     human rights and the end of conflict, and identifying and \n     addressing the economic and social problems that affected the \n     majority of the Salvadoran population;\n       Whereas the 6 Jesuit priests, as faculty and administrators \n     at the UCA, educated many students throughout the 1970s and \n     1980s, students who subsequently became Salvadoran \n     government, political, and civil society leaders, and thus \n     helped facilitate communication, dialogue, and negotiations, \n     even during the turbulent years of the armed conflict;\n       Whereas these 6 priests and 2 women joined the more than \n     75,000 noncombatants who perished during the Salvadoran civil \n     war;\n       Whereas on December 6, 1989, Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives Thomas Foley appointed the Speaker's Task \n     Force on El Salvador consisting of 19 Members of the House of \n     Representatives and chaired by Representative John Joseph \n     Moakley of Boston, Massachusetts, to monitor the Salvadoran \n     government's investigation into the murders of the Jesuit \n     priests and 2 women and to look into related issues involving \n     respect for human rights and judicial reform in El Salvador;\n       Whereas the Speaker's Task Force on El Salvador found that \n     members of the high command of the Salvadoran military were \n     responsible for ordering the murder of the Jesuits and 2 \n     women and for obstructing the subsequent investigation into \n     the crimes;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on the Truth for El \n     Salvador (the ``Truth Commission'') was established under \n     terms of the January 1992 Peace Accords that ended El \n     Salvador's 12 years of war and was charged to investigate and \n     report to the Salvadoran people on human rights crimes \n     committed by all sides during the course of the war;\n       Whereas on March 15, 1993, the Truth Commission confirmed \n     the findings of the Speaker's Task Force on El Salvador;\n       Whereas on September 28, 1991, a Salvadoran jury found 2 \n     Salvadoran military officers guilty of the murders, including \n     Salvadoran Army Colonel Guillermo Alfredo Benavides Moreno, \n     the first time in Salvadoran history in which high-ranking \n     military officers were convicted in a Salvadoran court of law \n     of human rights crimes;\n       Whereas the UCA remains dedicated to advancing and \n     expanding educational opportunity and providing the highest \n     quality of academic excellence in its studies and courses and \n     maintains a commitment to human rights and social justice;\n       Whereas the 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the \n     United States, which represent many of the highest quality \n     academic communities in the Nation, have maintained a sense \n     of solidarity with the UCA and the people of El Salvador and \n     have annually observed the November 16th anniversary of the \n     martyred Jesuits and women;\n       Whereas in the United States, in El Salvador, and around \n     the world, university programs, academic and scholarly \n     institutes, libraries, research centers, pastoral programs, \n     spiritual centers, and programs dedicated to educational \n     achievement, social justice, human rights, and alleviating \n     poverty have been dedicated in the names of the Jesuit \n     martyrs;\n       Whereas the international and Salvadoran outcry in response \n     to the deaths of the 6 Jesuits and 2 women and the subsequent \n     investigations into this crime served as a catalyst for \n     negotiations and contributed to the signing of the 1992 Peace \n     Accords, which have allowed the people and the Government of \n     El Salvador to achieve significant progress in creating and \n     strengthening democratic political, economic, and social \n     institutions; and\n       Whereas November 16, 2009, marks the 20th anniversary of \n     the deaths of the 8 spiritual, courageous, and generous \n     priests, educators, and laywomen: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the lives and work of Father Ignacio \n     Ellacuria, Father Ignacio Martin-Baro, Father Segundo Montes, \n     Father Amando Lopez, Father Juan Ramon Moreno, Father Joaquin \n     Lopez y Lopez, Julia Elba Ramos, and Celina Mariset Ramos;\n       (2) extends sympathy to the families, friends, colleagues, \n     and religious communities of the 6 Jesuit priests and 2 \n     laywomen;\n       (3) recognizes the continuing academic, spiritual, and \n     social contributions of the Universidad Centroamericana Jose \n     Simeon Canas (``UCA'') in San Salvador, El Salvador;\n       (4) commends the 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the \n     United States for their solidarity with the UCA and annual \n     remembrances of the Jesuit martyrs;\n       (5) continues to find inspiration in the lives and work of \n     the Jesuit martyrs;\n       (6) remembers the seminal reports by Representative John \n     Joseph Moakley and the Speaker's Task Force on El Salvador in \n     investigating the murders of the 6 priests and 2 laywomen;\n       (7) acknowledges the role played by the Speaker's Task \n     Force on El Salvador, Representative John Joseph Moakley, the \n     Jesuit leadership of the UCA, and the Salvadoran judicial \n     investigation and convictions in advancing negotiations to \n     end the war, such that the deaths of the Jesuit martyrs and \n     laywomen contributed directly to achieving the peace to which \n     they had dedicated their lives;\n       (8) calls upon the people of the United States, academic \n     institutions, and religious congregations to participate in \n     local, national, and international events commemorating the \n     20th anniversary of the martyrdom of the 6 Jesuit priests and \n     2 laywomen;\n       (9) recognizes that, while significant progress has been \n     made during the post-war period, social and economic \n     hardships persist among many sectors of Salvadoran society; \n     and\n       (10) calls upon the President, the Secretary of State, the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development, and other Federal departments and agencies to \n     support and collaborate with the Government of El Salvador \n     and other public, private, nongovernmental, and religious \n     organizations in efforts to reduce poverty and hunger and to \n     promote educational opportunity, human rights, the rule of \n     law, and social equity for the people of El Salvador.\n\n

RELIGIOUS \n                           MINORITIES IN IRAQ\n\n  Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Mr. Brownback, and Mr. Durbin) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign \nRelations:\n\n                              S. Res. 322\n\n       Whereas threats against the smallest religious minorities \n     in Iraq jeopardize the future of Iraq as a diverse, \n     pluralistic, and free society;\n       Whereas according to the United States Commission on \n     International Religious Freedom, there are grave threats to \n     religious freedom in Iraq, particularly for the smallest, \n     most vulnerable religious minorities in Iraq, including \n     Chaldeans, Syriacs, Assyrians, and other Christians, Sabean \n     Mandeans, and Yazidis;\n       Whereas the February 2009 Country Report on Human Rights \n     issued by the Department of State identifies on-going \n     ``misappropriation of official authority by sectarian, \n     criminal, and extremist groups'' as among the significant and \n     continuing human rights problems in Iraq;\n       Whereas in recent years, there have been alarming numbers \n     of religiously-motivated killings, abductions, beatings, \n     rapes, threats, intimidation, forced conversions, marriages, \n     and displacement from homes and businesses, and attacks on \n     religious leaders, pilgrims, and holy sites, in Iraq, with \n     the smallest religious minorities in Iraq having been among \n     the most vulnerable, although Iraqis from many religious \n     communities, Muslim and non-Muslim alike, have suffered in \n     this violence;\n       Whereas the United States Commission on International \n     Religious Freedom continues to recommend that the President \n     designate Iraq as a ``country of particular concern'', or \n     CPC, under the International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, \n     because of the ongoing, severe abuses of religious freedom in \n     Iraq;\n       Whereas the Assyrian International News Agency reports that \n     59 churches have been bombed in Iraq between June 2004 and \n     July 2009;\n       Whereas persecution and violence in Iraq have extended to \n     church leaders as well, such as the March 2008 kidnap for \n     ransom and\n\n[[Page S10739]]\n\n     killing of 65-year old Chaldean Catholic Archbishop Paulos \n     Faraj Rahho;\n       Whereas members of small religious minority communities in \n     Iraq do not have militia or tribal structures to defend them, \n     do not receive adequate official protection, and are legally, \n     politically, and economically marginalized;\n       Whereas control of ethnically and religiously mixed areas, \n     including the Nineveh and Kirkuk governorates, is disputed \n     between the Kurdistan regional government and the Government \n     of Iraq, and Chaldeans, Syriacs, Assyrians, and other \n     Christians, Sabean Mandeans, Yazidis, Shabak, and Turkomen \n     are caught in the middle of this struggle for control and \n     have been targeted for abuses and discrimination as a result;\n       Whereas governments in the region report that approximately \n     2,400,000 refugees and asylum seekers have fled Iraq since \n     2003;\n       Whereas many religious minorities in Iraq, who made up \n     about 3 percent of the population of Iraq in 2003, have fled \n     to other areas in Iraq or to other countries, where they \n     reflect a disproportionately high percentage of registered \n     Iraqi refugees;\n       Whereas the flight of such refugees has substantially \n     diminished their numbers in Iraq, and few show signs of \n     returning to Iraq;\n       Whereas approximately 1,400,000 Christians were estimated \n     to have lived in Iraq as of 2003, including Chaldean \n     Catholics, Assyrian Orthodox, Assyrian Church of the East, \n     Syriac Catholics, Syriac Orthodox, Armenians (Catholic and \n     Orthodox), Protestants, and Evangelicals;\n       Whereas it is widely reported that only 500,000 to 700,000 \n     indigenous Christians remain in Iraq as of 2009;\n       Whereas the Sabean Mandean community in Iraq reports that \n     almost 90 percent of the members of that community either \n     fled Iraq or have been killed, leaving only about 3,500 to \n     5,000 Mandeans in Iraq as of 2009;\n       Whereas the Yazidi community in Iraq reportedly now numbers \n     about 500,000, a decrease from about 700,000 in 2005;\n       Whereas the Baha'i faith, estimated to have only 2,000 \n     adherents in Iraq, remains prohibited in Iraq under a 1970 \n     law;\n       Whereas the ancient and once-large Jewish community in Iraq \n     now numbers fewer than 10, and they essentially live in \n     hiding;\n       Whereas in 2008, the United Nations High Commissioner for \n     Refugees (UNHCR) reported that approximately 221,000 Iraqis \n     returned to their areas of origin in Iraq, the vast majority \n     of whom settled into neighborhoods or governorates controlled \n     by members of their own religious community;\n       Whereas many of these returnees reported returning because \n     of difficult economic conditions in their countries of \n     asylum, principally Syria, Jordan, Egypt, and Lebanon; and\n       Whereas Chaldeans, Syriacs, Assyrians, and other \n     Christians, Sabean Mandeans, and Yazidis are not believed to \n     be among these returnees: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate that--\n       (1) the United States remains deeply concerned about the \n     plight of vulnerable religious and ethnic minorities of Iraq \n     and is particularly concerned for the Chaldeans, Syriacs, \n     Assyrians, and other Christians, Sabean Mandeans, Yazidis, \n     Baha'is, Jews, and Muslim ethnic minorities, the Shabak and \n     Turkomen, and other religious and ethnic minorities of Iraq;\n       (2) the United States Government and the United Nations \n     Assistance Mission for Iraq should urge the Government of \n     Iraq to enhance security at places of worship in Iraq, \n     particularly where religious minorities are known to be at \n     risk;\n       (3) the United States Government should continue to work \n     with the Government of Iraq to--\n       (A) urgently train and deploy into the Iraqi police and \n     security forces members of vulnerable minority communities in \n     Iraq, including in Nineveh and other areas in which religious \n     minorities are located, who are as representative as possible \n     of those communities; and\n       (B) ensure that members of such communities--\n       (i) suffer no discrimination in recruitment, employment, or \n     advancement in the Iraqi police and security forces; and\n       (ii) while employed in the Iraqi police and security \n     forces, be assigned to their locations of origin, rather than \n     being transferred to other areas;\n       (4) the Government of Iraq should, with the assistance of \n     the United States Government--\n       (A) ensure that the upcoming national elections in Iraq are \n     safe, fair, and free of intimidation and violence so that all \n     Iraqis, including religious minorities, can participate in \n     the elections; and\n       (B) permit and facilitate election monitoring by experts \n     from local and international nongovernmental organizations, \n     the international community, and the United Nations, \n     particularly in minority areas;\n       (5) the Government of Iraq and the Kurdistan regional \n     government should work towards a peaceful and timely \n     resolution of disputes over territories;\n       (6) the United States Government and the United Nations \n     Assistance Mission for Iraq should urge the Government of \n     Iraq to work with minority communities and their \n     representatives to develop measures to implement Article 125 \n     of the Iraq Constitution, which guarantees ``the \n     administrative, political, cultural, and educational rights \n     of the various nationalities, such as Turkomen, Chaldeans, \n     Assyrians, and all the other constituents'' in Nineveh and \n     other areas where these groups are present;\n       (7) the Government of Iraq should take affirmative measures \n     to reverse the legal, political, and economic marginalization \n     of religious minorities in Iraq;\n       (8) the United States Government should direct assistance \n     to projects that develop the ability of ethnic and religious \n     minorities in Iraq to organize themselves civically and \n     politically to effectively convey their concerns to \n     government;\n       (9) the United States Government should continue to fund \n     capacity-building programs for the Iraqi Ministry of Human \n     Rights, the independent national Human Rights Commission, and \n     a new independent minorities committee whose membership is \n     selected by minority communities of Iraq;\n       (10) the Government of Iraq should direct the Iraqi \n     Ministry of Human Rights to investigate and issue a public \n     report on abuses against and the marginalization of minority \n     communities in Iraq and make recommendations to address such \n     abuses;\n       (11) the Government of Iraq should, with the assistance of \n     the United States Government and international organizations, \n     help ensure that displaced Iraqis considering return to Iraq \n     have the proper information needed to make informed decisions \n     regarding such return; and\n       (12) the United States Government and international \n     organizations should continue to work with the Government of \n     Iraq to develop the legal framework necessary to address \n     property disputes resulting when displaced Iraqis attempt to \n     return to their homes in Iraq.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today I submit, with Senators Brownback and \nDurbin, a resolution expressing the concerns of the Senate over the \nplight of religious minorities in Iraq and calling on our government, \nthe government of Iraq and the United Nations Mission in Iraq to take a \nseries of steps designed to alleviate the dangers that members of these \nminority groups are confronting. Regardless of our position on the \nwisdom of the Iraq war, we can all acknowledge a tragic consequence of \nthat war: the widespread persecution of religious minorities.\n  The statistics are chilling: of approximately 1.4 million Christians \nof various denominations living in Iraq in 2003, only 500,000 to \n700,000 remain. Another minority group, the Sabean Mandeans, has seen \nits population decline by more than 90 percent. Iraq's Jewish \ncommunity, once one of the largest in the Arab world, has almost ceased \nto exist.\n  What has happened to these hundreds of thousands? Many have fled \nIraq; my own hometown of Detroit, long home to a large community of \nChristian immigrants from Iraq, knows firsthand the challenges for \nfamilies abandoning their generations-long home for a strange new \ncountry.\n  Others have not had that opportunity. The United States Commission on \nInternational Religious Freedom reports that members of religious \nminorities ``have experienced targeted intimidation and violence, \nincluding killings, beatings, abductions, and rapes, forced \nconversions, forced marriages, forced displacement from their homes and \nbusinesses, and violent attacks on their houses of worship and \nreligious leaders.'' Leaders and members of these minority groups have \nbeen kidnapped, assassinated or forcibly removed from their homes. The \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees reported that in 2008, \nthere were an estimated 2.8 million internally displaced persons living \nin Iraq. Of that 2.8 million, nearly two out of three reported fleeing \ntheir home because of a direct threat to their lives, and, of that \nnumber, almost nine out of ten said they were targeted because of their \nethnic or religious identity.\n  While violence has declined in Iraq overall, religious minorities \ncontinue to be the targets of violence and intimidation. Members of \nmany minority groups who have fled other parts of the country have \nsettled in the north, only to find themselves living in some of the \nmost unstable and violent regions of Iraq.\n  Our resolution addresses this tragedy in several ways. It states the \nsense of the Senate that the fate of Iraqi religious minorities is a \nmatter of grave concern. It calls on the U.S. government and the U.N. \nto urge Iraq's government to increase security at places of worship, \nparticularly where members of religious minorities are known to face \nrisks. It calls for the integration of regional and religious \nminorities into the Iraqi security forces, and for those minority \nmembers to be stationed within their own communities.\n\n[[Page S10740]]\n\nIt calls on the Iraqi government to ensure that minority citizens can \nparticipate in upcoming elections, and to enforce its constitution, \nwhich guarantees ``the administrative, political, cultural, and \neducational rights'' of minorities. And it urges a series of steps to \nensure that development aid and other forms of support flow to minority \ncommunities.\n  I encourage the administration and the United Nations to address \nthese steps without delay. I hope our fellow senators will join with \nSenator Brownback, Senator Durbin and me to voice the sense of the \nSenate on this important matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/10/26/senate-section/article/S10740-1", "month": "10", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   AMENDMENTS SUBMITTED AND PROPOSED\n\n       SA 2700.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds as follows:\n       (1) There has been concern expressed by some across our \n     Nation, including on the Nation's airwaves, regarding whether \n     Congress has the constitutional authority to legislate \n     national health care reform.\n       (2) Certain citizens, commentators, and public officials \n     have questioned whether the Tenth Amendment to the \n     Constitution of the United States precludes the Federal \n     Government from providing related health care benefits to its \n     people.\n       (3) Numerous State legislative bodies have passed \n     resolutions raising questions regarding the scope of the \n     Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States and \n     the constitutionality of certain Federal programs.\n       (4) The Federal Government has a long and successful \n     history of providing health care benefits to its citizens \n     through Federal programs.\n       (5) Among other Federal initiatives, in 1930, Congress \n     established the Veterans Administration, an entity that \n     provided Federal benefits, including Federal health care \n     benefits, to veterans of the Armed Forces, and the Veterans \n     Administration was later merged into the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs.\n       (6) In 1954, Congress established the Indian Health Service \n     to provide medical and public health services to members of \n     federally-recognized Indian tribes and Alaska Natives.\n       (7) In 1956 and 1966, respectively, Congress passed the \n     Dependents' Medical Care Act (70 Stat. 250) and the Military \n     Medical Benefits Amendments of 1966 (Public Law 89-614; 80 \n     Stat. 862) in order to expand coverage to military personnel \n     and dependents, and these programs were later merged into the \n     TRICARE program, which provides health benefits for military \n     personnel, military retirees, and their dependents.\n       (8) In 1965, the United States established the Medicare \n     program to provide Federal health care benefits to United \n     States citizens over the age of 65.\n       (9) In 1965, the United States established the Medicaid \n     program to provide Federal health care benefits to \n     individuals at, near, or below the Federal poverty line.\n       (10) In 1997, the United States established the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program to provide health \n     insurance to certain children in families above the Federal \n     poverty line.\n       (11) In 2009, the United States expanded the State \n     Children's Health Insurance Program to cover an additional \n     4,000,000 children.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that the following Federal benefit programs are in direct \n     violation of the Tenth Amendment to the Constitution of the \n     United States and should be terminated as soon as \n     practicable: the Veterans Health Administration benefit \n     programs, the Indian Health Service, TRICARE, Medicare, \n     Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2701. Ms. LANDRIEU submitted an amendment intended to be proposed \nby him to the bill H.R. 3548, to amend the Supplemental Appropriations \nAct, 2008 to provide for the temporary availability of certain \nadditional emergency unemployment compensation, and for other purposes; \nwhich was ordered to lie on the table; as follows:\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. 2-YEAR EXTENSION OF LOW-INCOME HOUSING CREDIT RULES \n                   FOR CERTAIN DISASTER AREAS.\n\n       Section 1400N(c)(5) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 is \n     amended by striking ``January 1, 2011'' and inserting \n     ``January 1, 2013''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 2702.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements related to this matter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 321) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 321\n\n       Whereas in the early morning hours of November 16, 1989, 6 \n     Jesuit priests and faculty members of the Universidad \n     Centroamericana Jose Simeon Canas (``UCA'') located in San \n     Salvador, El Salvador--Fathers Ignacio Ellacuria, Ignacio \n     Martin-Baro, Segundo Montes, Amando Lopez, Juan Ramon Moreno, \n     and Joaquin Lopez y Lopez--and housekeeper Julia Elba Ramos \n     and her daughter, Celina Mariset Ramos, were executed by \n     members of the Salvadoran Army;\n       Whereas Father Ignacio Ellacuria, aged 59, was since 1979 \n     rector of the UCA and was an internationally-respected \n     intellectual and advocate for human rights and for a \n     negotiated solution to the Salvadoran civil conflict;\n       Whereas Father Ignacio Martin-Baro, aged 44, was the vice \n     rector of the UCA, a leading analyst of national and regional \n     affairs, the founder and director of the respected polling \n     organization, the Public Opinion Institute, former dean of \n     students, dean of the psychology department, an \n     internationally-renowned pioneer in the field of social \n     psychology, and pastor of the rural community of Jayaque;\n       Whereas Father Segundo Montes, aged 56, was dean of the \n     department of social sciences, a sociology professor at the \n     UCA, and the founder and director of the Human Rights \n     Institute at the UCA, who did extensive work on Salvadoran \n     refugees in the United States during the period of the \n     Salvadoran conflict, including providing documentation and \n     advice to Members of Congress on refugee issues;\n       Whereas Father Amando Lopez, aged 53, was a philosophy and \n     theology professor at the UCA, was the former director of the \n     Jesuit seminary in San Salvador, and served as pastor of the \n     Tierra Virgen community in Soyapango, a poor neighborhood in \n     the periphery of San Salvador;\n       Whereas Father Juan Ramon Moreno, aged 56, was a professor \n     of theology at the UCA, a former novice-master for the \n     Jesuits, and a tireless pastoral worker and spiritual guide;\n       Whereas Father Joaquin Lopez y Lopez, aged 71, was one of \n     the creators of the UCA and the founder, organizer, and \n     director of Fe y Alegria (Faith and Joy), an organization to \n     address the lack of education in El Salvador, which opened 30 \n     educational centers in marginalized communities throughout El \n     Salvador where 48,000 people received vocational training and \n     education;\n       Whereas Julia Elba Ramos, aged 42, was the cook and \n     housekeeper for the Jesuit seminarians at the UCA and the \n     wife of Obdulio Lozano, the UCA gardener and groundskeeper;\n       Whereas Celina Mariset Ramos, aged 16, had finished her \n     first year of high school at the Jose Damian Villacorta \n     Institute in Santa Tecla, El Salvador and was staying with \n     her mother the night of November 15, 1989;\n       Whereas the 6 Jesuit priests dedicated their lives to \n     advancing education in El Salvador, protecting and promoting \n     human rights and the end of conflict, and identifying and \n     addressing the economic and social problems that affected the \n     majority of the Salvadoran population;\n       Whereas the 6 Jesuit priests, as faculty and administrators \n     at the UCA, educated many students throughout the 1970s and \n     1980s, students who subsequently became Salvadoran \n     government, political, and civil society leaders, and thus \n     helped facilitate communication, dialogue, and negotiations, \n     even during the turbulent years of the armed conflict;\n       Whereas these 6 priests and 2 women joined the more than \n     75,000 noncombatants who perished during the Salvadoran civil \n     war;\n       Whereas on December 6, 1989, Speaker of the House of \n     Representatives Thomas Foley appointed the Speaker's Task \n     Force on El Salvador consisting of 19 Members of the House of \n     Representatives and chaired by Representative John Joseph \n     Moakley of Boston, Massachusetts, to monitor the Salvadoran \n     government's investigation into the murders of the Jesuit \n     priests and 2 women and to look into related issues involving \n     respect for human rights and judicial reform in El Salvador;\n       Whereas the Speaker's Task Force on El Salvador found that \n     members of the high command of the Salvadoran military were \n     responsible for ordering the murder of the Jesuits and 2 \n     women and for obstructing the subsequent investigation into \n     the crimes;\n       Whereas the United Nations Commission on the Truth for El \n     Salvador (the ``Truth Commission'') was established under \n     terms of the January 1992 Peace Accords that ended El \n     Salvador's 12 years of war and was charged to investigate and \n     report to the Salvadoran people on human rights crimes \n     committed by all sides during the course of the war;\n       Whereas on March 15, 1993, the Truth Commission confirmed \n     the findings of the Speaker's Task Force on El Salvador;\n       Whereas on September 28, 1991, a Salvadoran jury found 2 \n     Salvadoran military officers guilty of the murders, including \n     Salvadoran Army Colonel Guillermo Alfredo Benavides Moreno, \n     the first time in Salvadoran history in which high-ranking \n     military officers were convicted in a Salvadoran court of law \n     of human rights crimes;\n       Whereas the UCA remains dedicated to advancing and \n     expanding educational opportunity and providing the highest \n     quality of academic excellence in its studies and courses and \n     maintains a commitment to human rights and social justice;\n       Whereas the 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the \n     United States, which represent many of the highest quality \n     academic communities in the Nation, have maintained a sense \n     of solidarity with the UCA and the people of El Salvador and \n     have annually observed the November 16th anniversary of the \n     martyred Jesuits and women;\n       Whereas in the United States, in El Salvador, and around \n     the world, university programs, academic and scholarly \n     institutes, libraries, research centers, pastoral programs, \n     spiritual centers, and programs dedicated to educational \n     achievement, social justice, human rights, and alleviating \n     poverty have been dedicated in the names of the Jesuit \n     martyrs;\n       Whereas the international and Salvadoran outcry in response \n     to the deaths of the 6 Jesuits and 2 women and the subsequent \n     investigations into this crime served as a catalyst for \n     negotiations and contributed to the signing of the 1992 Peace \n     Accords, which have allowed the people and the Government of \n     El Salvador to achieve significant progress in creating and \n     strengthening democratic political, economic, and social \n     institutions; and\n       Whereas November 16, 2009, marks the 20th anniversary of \n     the deaths of the 8 spiritual, courageous, and generous \n     priests, educators, and laywomen: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) commemorates the lives and work of Father Ignacio \n     Ellacuria, Father Ignacio Martin-Baro, Father Segundo Montes, \n     Father Amando Lopez, Father Juan Ramon Moreno, Father Joaquin \n     Lopez y Lopez, Julia Elba Ramos, and Celina Mariset Ramos;\n       (2) extends sympathy to the families, friends, colleagues, \n     and religious communities of the 6 Jesuit priests and 2 \n     laywomen;\n       (3) recognizes the continuing academic, spiritual, and \n     social contributions of the Universidad Centroamericana Jose \n     Simeon Canas (``UCA'') in San Salvador, El Salvador;\n       (4) commends the 28 Jesuit colleges and universities in the \n     United States for their solidarity with the UCA and annual \n     remembrances of the Jesuit martyrs;\n       (5) continues to find inspiration in the lives and work of \n     the Jesuit martyrs;\n       (6) remembers the seminal reports by Representative John \n     Joseph Moakley and the Speaker's Task Force on El Salvador in \n     investigating the murders of the 6 priests and 2 laywomen;\n       (7) acknowledges the role played by the Speaker's Task \n     Force on El Salvador, Representative John Joseph Moakley, the \n     Jesuit leadership of the UCA, and the Salvadoran judicial \n     investigation and convictions in advancing negotiations to \n     end the war, such that the deaths of the Jesuit martyrs and \n     laywomen contributed directly to achieving the peace to which \n     they had dedicated their lives;\n       (8) calls upon the people of the United States, academic \n     institutions, and religious congregations to participate in \n     local, national, and international events commemorating the \n     20th anniversary of the martyrdom of the 6 Jesuit priests and \n     2 laywomen;\n       (9) recognizes that, while significant progress has been \n     made during the post-war period, social and economic \n     hardships persist among many sectors of Salvadoran society; \n     and\n       (10) calls upon the President, the Secretary of State, the \n     Administrator of the United States Agency for International \n     Development, and other Federal departments and agencies to \n     support and collaborate with the Government of El Salvador \n     and other public,\n\n[[Page S10742]]\n\n     private, nongovernmental, and religious
