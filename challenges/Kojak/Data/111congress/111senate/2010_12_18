Mr. President, essential to America's greatness, I \ntruly believe, is our respect for the rule of law. The American people \nunderstand this. For years, they have asked Congress and the President \nto secure the borders and to enforce our immigration laws, but for \nyears Congress has refused to do that. Indeed, as part of this \nlegislative session, there has been no serious movement to do anything \nthat would improve the grievous situation of illegality at our borders. \nSo what we have is contrary to that today, when we will be dealing with \nthe DREAM Act. Leaders in Washington have not only tolerated \nlawlessness but, in fact, our policies have encouraged it. Americans \nliving near the border are the ones who often pay the steepest price. \nIllegal drugs, guns, people pour into States such as Arizona and Texas \nevery day. Phoenix has turned into the kidnapping capital of the world. \nRanchers in the southern part of the State are forced to accept chaos \nas a part of their daily lives. Smugglers, traffickers stream across \ntheir properties, homes are broken into, livestock killed, families \nplaced in danger. Our government has failed in its duty to protect \nthese citizens in the peaceful possession of their property.\n  Consider the fate of Robert Krentz, the son of one of Arizona's \noldest ranching families working land that had been in the family 100 \nyears. His home had been robbed, their livestock slaughtered. On the \nnight of March 27, he went to mend a fence and check his water line. He \nreached his brother on the radio to say he was helping someone he \nbelieved to be illegally entering the country--helping them--and that \nwas the last time anyone heard from Mr. Krentz. He was found several \nhours later, shot dead.\n  The death of Robert Krentz is sadly just one of the many tragedies \nthat could have been avoided if the Federal Government had done its \njob. Instead, when Arizona tried to support the Federal immigration \nauthorities, they were sued by Attorney General Holder, and the \nDepartment of Justice said stay out.\n  They were sued for trying to protect themselves because the Federal \nGovernment would not. Yet here we are in the final days of a lameduck--\nsome say dead duck--Congress considering a bill that would create a \nmajor problem to the effective enforcement of immigration laws. People \nare not happy with us, Mr. President.\n  I had a little recognition and recalled in the shower this morning a \nlittle event with Oliver Cromwell with the long Parliament in England. \nHe said:\n\n       It is high time for me to put an end to your sitting in \n     this place. You have grown intolerably odious to the whole \n     nation. In the name of God, go.\n\n  I don't think we are odious around here, but I think the American \npeople are not happy with us. I think it is time for us to quit trying \nto move political bills in a way that is not appropriate, not through \nthe regular process.\n  The American people are pleading with Congress to enforce our laws. \nBut this bill is a law that, at its fundamental core, is a reward for \nillegal activity. It is the third time we have tried to schedule a vote \non it, and during this lameduck session it is the fifth version of this \nlegislation that has been introduced in the past 2 months. Not one of \nthese bills has gone through committee. Not one of them is subject to \namendment.\n  The House passed a bill after 1 hour of debate, having announced it \nbeing brought up 1 day before. In fact, the version we are now \nconsidering is the same one that was rammed through the House.\n  The majority leader has filled the tree. So, once again, the \nlegislation cannot be amended.\n  For 2 years, Democratic leaders have ignored the public. They have \nrammed\n\n[[Page S10649]]\n\nthrough a lot of unpopular legislation, and sometimes--and too often--\nthe process has been skirted, and it has not been healthy for the \nRepublic, which is one reason people have not been happy with it.\n  So we are at it again, in these last hours, attempting to force \nthrough legislation that is not acceptable to the people.\n  Proponents of the DREAM Act are sincere, and they insist this is a \nlimited bill for young children of illegal immigrants who graduate from \nhigh school, get a college degree, and join the military. But the facts \nof the legislation are different. The DREAM Act would grant legislation \nto millions of illegal aliens, regardless of whether they go to or \nfinish college or high school or serve in the military. It is certainly \nnot limited to children. It would apply to people here illegally who \nare as old as 30. Because the bill has no cap or sunset, they will \nremain eligible at any future time.\n  Mr. President, I know my good friend, Senator Durbin, who is such an \nable advocate, challenged me last night, or my staff, saying we were \nincorrect in saying that the Secretary of HHS would have the ability to \nwaive some of the requirements in the bill. Just for my staff's sake, I \nwant to read this part of the bill. He said it wasn't in there. My \nstaff explained to his staff why they thought it was in there. The \nwaiver section states:\n\n       The Secretary of Homeland Security may waive the ground of \n     deportability under paragraph 1 of section 237(a) for \n     humanitarian purposes or family unity.\n\n  Maybe we can disagree how that might all be played out, but I think \nthat is clearly a waiver provision in the bill.\n  The amnesty provision--and this is an amnesty bill, because it \nprovides every possible benefit, including citizenship, to those who \nare in the country illegally, and I think that is a fair definition of \namnesty. The amnesty provisions are so broad that they are open to \nthose who have had multiple criminal convictions of up to two \nmisdemeanors--just not three--and many criminal cases that are felonies \nare pled down to misdemeanors, including certain sex offenses, drunk \ndriving, and drug offenses.\n  But the bill goes further, offering a safe harbor to those with \npending applications, even if they pose some risk to the country. In \nother words, if you have filed and sought protection under the act, \nthis can stay any action against you in any deportation proceedings.\n  I think it is particularly dangerous because the safe harbor would \napply to those even from terror-prone regions in the Middle East. In \nfact, the DREAM Act altogether ignores the lessons of \n9/11, going so for as to open up eligibility to those who previously \ndefrauded immigration authorities, provided false documentation, as did \nmany of the 9/11 hijackers on their visa applications.\n  Some have suggested this should not be a debate about policy but \ninstead about compassion. But good policy, faithfully followed, is \ncompassion. I ask my friends who support the legislation, what is \ncompassionate about ignoring the public wishes and forcing people to \nlive with a lawless border and a lawless immigration system that must \nbe reformed and Congress refuses to reform? I ask them, is it \ncompassionate to put illegal aliens in front of the line, ahead of \nthose who have patiently waited and played by the rules? Is it \ncompassionate to act in a way that undermines the integrity and \nconsistency of our legal system--a system that is so important to our \nprosperity and liberty?\n  The message from the public has never been in doubt. Before we \nconsider regular status for anyone living here illegally, we first must \nsecure the border. My friend, Ben Nelson from Nebraska, has spoken on \nthis for a half dozen years. When he speaks, he has a sign behind him \nthat says ``border security first.'' That is what Senator McCain has \nsaid. He has been a champion of immigration reform. He says he has come \nto understand with clarity that we must have security first.\n  That is what the American people have told us, I am convinced. If we \ndo not do those actions first, if we pass this amnesty, we will signal \nto the world that we are not serious about the enforcement of our laws \nor our borders. It will say that you can make plans to bring in your \nbrother, sister, cousin, nephew, and friends into this country \nillegally as a teenager, and there will be no principled reason in the \nfuture for the next Congress then sitting to not pass another DREAM \nAct. It will only be a matter of time before that next group that is \nhere illegally will make the same heartfelt pleas we hear today.\n  It is time to end the lawlessness, not surrender to it. It is time to \nend the lawlessness that is occurring. This is a decisive vote. I urge \nmy colleagues to oppose this reckless bill and commit ourselves, as a \nnation, to creating an immigration system that is just and lawful and \nthat befits a nation as great as ours.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the time remaining that I \nhave not used that has been allocated to the Republicans be divided as \nfollows, and not necessarily in this order: Senator McCain, 10 minutes; \nSenator Chambliss, 5; Senator Inhofe, 10; Senator Kyl, 5.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, we have it within our power to fix the \nbroken immigration system. Last year, approximately 600,000 people were \narrested entering our country illegally. That is lower than it has \nbeen, but a determined leadership from the President, from the \nCongress, can, within a matter of 1 or 2 years, end this problem, and \nthen we can begin to wrestle with the difficult question of those who \nhave been in our country for some time.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

If you love this country enough to risk your life for it, you \nshould not have to hide who you are. You ought to be able to serve.\n  The history of our wonderful Nation is spotted with wrongs, but this \ninstitution is at its best when it corrects those. That is the \nopportunity we will have today.\n  Don't ask, don't tell has resulted in the discharge of over 14,000 \npatriotic and talented service members who were otherwise qualified to \nserve their country.\n  A 2005 Government Accountability Office report says nearly 10 percent \nof those discharged under don't ask, don't tell have been linguists \ntrained in critical languages such as Arabic, Farsi, and Chinese.\n  As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee, let me tell you\n\n[[Page S10650]]\n\nthat turning away Arabic, Farsi, and Chinese speakers is bad for \nnational security. It makes it harder for us to win the war on terror. \nDon't just take my word for it. The fact is, the military now \nunderstands how important it is to make this change.\n  Today, the Senate has the opportunity to be on the right side of \nhistory. Don't ask, don't tell is a wrong that should never have been \nperpetrated. Let's move to end it today. Again, let me say thank you to \nall of you. I look forward to being with all of you next year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Oregon for his \npowerful statement and powerful presence. We look forward to 110 \npercent of that power being back with us in the days ahead.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. LEVIN. The Armed Services Committee held two excellent hearings \nto consider the final report of the working group that reviewed the \nissues associated with the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. That report \nconcluded that allowing gay and lesbian troops to serve in the U.S. \nArmed Forces, without being forced to conceal their sexual orientation, \nwould present a low risk to the military's effectiveness, even during a \ntime of war, and that 70 percent of the surveyed members believe the \nimpact on their units would be positive, mixed, or of no consequence.\n  As one servicemember told the working group:\n\n       All I care about is can you carry a gun, can you walk the \n     post.\n\n  In combat, the troops have told us that what matters is doing the \njob.\n  We also learned during the course of our hearings that while \npredictions of problems after repeal were higher in combat units than \namong troops, this commission found that the difference disappeared \namong those who had actual experience serving on the front lines with \ngay colleagues; that is, experience is a powerful antidote to negative \nstereotypes about gay service members.\n  We learned that when our close allies, Great Britain and Canada, were \npreparing to allow open service by gay and lesbian troops, there were \nconcerns about problems there. Those concerns totally disappeared after \nthey changed their policy to allow service, but those concerns--that \nlevel of concern in our allies' armies was higher than the current \nlevel of concern in our troops. Both those countries and other allies, \nsuch as Israel, made the transition with far less disruption than \nexpected, and their militaries serve alongside ours in Afghanistan with \nno sign that open service diminishes their or our effectiveness.\n  Secretary Gates has assured everybody he is not going to certify that \nthe military is ready for repeal until he is satisfied with the advice \nof the service chiefs that we have mitigated, if not eliminated, to the \nextent possible, risks to combat readiness, to unit cohesion and \neffectiveness. We learned that Secretary Gates, Admiral Mullen, and \nother senior military leaders are concerned that unless we pass this \nlaw; that is, without this legislation, they are going to be forced to \nimplement a change in policy not when they can certify that they are \nready, as provided for in this legislation, but when a court orders a \nchange. The only method of repeal that places the timing of repeal and \nthe control of implementation in the hands of our military leaders is \nthe enactment of this bill.\n  There are a lot of reasons the repeal of don't ask, don't tell can \nand will, hopefully, happen, but we know it can happen without harming \nour military's effectiveness. Those are the reasons we can do this \nsafely, but there are other reasons why we must end this discriminatory \npolicy. In Admiral Mullen's memorable words, it is a policy which \n``forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order to \ndefend their fellow citizens.'' We should end this policy because it is \nthe right thing to do.\n  Some have argued that this is social engineering or that this is \npartisan, even though this change is supported by the overwhelming \nmajority of the American people. They are grossly mistaken.\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. One minute.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am not here for partisan reasons; I am \nhere because men and women wearing the uniform of the United States who \nare gay and lesbian have died for this country because gay and lesbian \nmen and women wear the uniform of this country and have their lives on \nthe line right now in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places for this \ncountry. One of those is a captain by the name of Jonathan Hopkins. He \nfinished fourth in his class at West Point, commanded two companies--\none in combat--and earned three Bronze Stars, including one for valor \nin combat. Yet that decorated combat leader had to leave the Army \nbecause of don't ask, don't tell. I am here because of SSgt Eric Alva, \nthe first ground unit casualty of the war in Iraq. The first casualty \nin the war in Iraq was a gay soldier. The mine took off his right leg, \nand that mine that took off his right leg didn't give a darn whether he \nwas gay or straight. We shouldn't either.\n  We cannot let these patriots down. Their suffering should end. It \nwill end with the passage of this bill. I urge its passage today. It is \nthe right thing to do.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, it is my understanding that I have 10 \nminutes, and I would like to ask the Chair to let me know when I have 1 \nminute remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair will so notify.\n  Mr. INHOFE. First of all, Mr. President, we have a couple of votes \ntoday on things we should have been addressing for a long period of \ntime in order to get to the bottom of them, and one is the DREAM Act.\n  I think the Senator from Alabama did a thorough job of talking about \nthe problems. I would only say this about the DREAM Act. I have been \nprivileged over the past 20 years to probably give more speeches at \nnaturalization ceremonies than anybody else I know. You look at these \npeople who did it the legal way--they came in and learned the language, \nand I have to say, Mr. President, they probably know more about the \nhistory of this country than many of us in this Chamber. They do it the \nright way. They study, and they are proud. When I see something like \nthis, which I believe is done purely for political reasons, I just \ncan't imagine slapping these people in the face--the people who did it \nin the legal way--and saying it is all right to open the door.\n  So enough on that. I think that was covered by the Senator from \nAlabama.\n  I do wish to speak about don't ask, don't tell. I thought back in \n1993, during the Clinton administration, that this probably wouldn't \nwork. I was shocked when I found out how well it has worked for this \nlong period of time; that is, the don't ask, don't tell policy. We have \na saying in Oklahoma: If it ain't broke, don't fix it. This isn't \nbroke. It is working very well.\n  This is something else I never believed would work, but I was a \nproduct of the draft--I was drafted into the U.S. Army. Yet today we \nhave an all-volunteer force. Our recruitment and retention today in all \nservices is over 100 percent. I look at this, and I wonder what effect \nthis is going to have on that. I think we have some pretty good \nindications on what that effect would be.\n  First of all, the study that was supposed to take place was supposed \nto have the input of the members of the services. The ones I have \ntalked to felt that it was already over. In fact, it was. We go out and \nask them for their input as to the repeal of don't ask, don't tell, how \nit would affect our military and their operations, and then we turn \naround and go ahead and pass it. We did that on May 27. So I think they \ndidn't respond, as they normally would to a survey, because the \ndecision was already made.\n  When I look at this and I see things written into this--well, first \nof all, like 23 percent, even on this survey, said they would leave or \nthink about leaving sooner than they had planned. That is 23 percent. \nTwenty-seven percent of the military members surveyed said they would \nnot be willing to recommend military service to a family member or \nclose friend. Our studies\n\n[[Page S10651]]\n\nhave shown us that 50 percent of those who join the service do so at \nthe recommendation of someone who is already in the service.\n  So when you look at this report, everyone in the working group--and \nthe working group is made up of a large number of people--says they \ndidn't tabulate the results, but when pressed, they said their sense on \nthe don't ask, don't tell policy is that the majority of views \nexpressed were against repeal of the current policy.\n  I think, if you really want to know, there are four very courageous \nchiefs of the services who have been willing to stand up and be \ncounted.\n  General Casey is the Chief of Staff of the Army. After a long \nstatement at a hearing we had on the 3rd of this month, he said:\n\n       As such, I believe that implementation of the repeal of \n     don't ask, don't tell in the near term will, one, add another \n     level of stress to an already stretched force; two, be more \n     difficult in combat arms units; and, three, be more difficult \n     for the Army than the report suggests.\n\n  At the same December 3 hearing--so this is current stuff--General \nSchwartz of the Air Force said:\n\n       Nonetheless, my best military judgment does not agree with \n     the study assessment that the short-term risk to the military \n     effectiveness is low. . . . I remain concerned with the \n     outlook for low short-term risk of repeal to military \n     effectiveness in Afghanistan.\n\n  He goes on to talk about the implementation.\n\n       I therefore recommend deferring certification and full \n     implementation until 2012, while initiating training and \n     education efforts soon after you take any decision to repeal.\n\n  So there is General Schwartz of the U.S. Air Force agreeing with \nGeneral Casey that this should not be implemented.\n  Then in that same hearing, General Amos said:\n\n       While the study concludes that . . . repeal can be \n     implemented now, provided it is done in [a] manner that \n     minimizes the burden on leaders in deployed areas, the survey \n     data as it relates to the Marine Corps' combat arms forces \n     does not support that assertion.\n\n  He goes on to talk about the element of risk, which is a term we use \nin the military when you change something, and whether that risk will \nbe low, medium, or high. The risk in this case ranges from medium to \nhigh in the estimates of these individuals who really know what they \nare talking about.\n  I also have a quote from General Amos of just 2 days ago. This was \nactually on December 14, as opposed to the 3rd. He said:\n\n       When your life hangs on the line, you don't want anything \n     distracting . . . Mistakes and inattention or distractions \n     cost Marines' lives. So the Marines came back and said, \n     ``Look, anything that's going to break or potentially break \n     that focus and cause any kind of distraction may have an \n     effect on cohesion.'' I don't want to permit that opportunity \n     to happen. . . . If you go up to Bethesda Hospital . . . \n     Marines are up there with no legs, none. We've got Marines at \n     Walter Reed with no limbs.\n\n  This is the statement of General Amos. Let me repeat. He said:\n\n       When your life hangs on the line, you don't want anything \n     distracting . . . Mistakes and inattention or distractions \n     cost Marines' lives.\n\n  So we are talking about marines' lives in this case, and that is the \nsignificance.\n  I could go on. We have been talking about this now for a long period \nof time as to some of the very serious problems.\n  I have a letter I read some time ago from 41 retired chaplains who \nsent a letter to President Obama and Secretary Gates stating that \nnormalizing homosexual behavior in the Armed Forces will pose a \nsignificant threat to chaplains' and servicemembers' religious liberty. \nThe letter warned that reversing the policy will negatively impact \nreligious freedom and could even affect military readiness and troop \nlevels because the military would be marginalizing deeply held \nreligious beliefs.\n  I know we are very short on time--votes are going to be coming up--\nbut I have to respond to something the distinguished chairman of the \nArmed Services Committee said. He was saying we will not implement this \nuntil we find out and make a determination, and he was speaking of \nhimself, Admiral Mullen, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, the \nSecretary of Defense, and the President; that they are not going to \nimplement this until they have studied this and determined it is not \ngoing to have the risks and all that.\n  But wait a minute, let's look at what they have already said. They \nhave already made up their minds. President Obama said this year: I \nwill work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that \ndenies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because \nof who they are. Secretary Gates said: I fully support the President's \ndecision. The question before us is not whether the military prepares \nto make this change but how we best prepare for it. And Secretary Gates \nalso said he strongly preferred congressional action as opposed to \ncourt action. Admiral Mullen had already made up his mind. These are \nhis words: Mr. Chairman, speaking for myself, it is the right thing to \ndo. That is why, when people stand up and say they are not going to do \nthis until such time as these three people certify that it is the right \nthing to do, they have already done it. That is what is behind this. I \ndon't want anyone out there to think this is an open process.\n  The last thing I would say is that I will be spending New Year's Eve \nin Afghanistan with the troops, and I know what they are going to say. \nThey are going to say the same thing they said before: We were under \nthe impression last January that we were going to have input in this. \nWe haven't had input.\n  So I think if you want to pursue this, we should have the time to go \nahead and do it the right way, not try to do it at the last minute, \nbefore--well, one day before my 51st wedding anniversary.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent there be 5 minutes \nadditional time on each side, an additional 5 minutes be allowed for \nSenator Graham on this side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair and my colleagues and the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I start by noting it has been a \npleasure to work with Senator Lieberman, Senator Collins, Chairman \nLevin, Senator Gillibrand, and others in the effort to repeal this \noutmoded law.\n  I have spoken many times about the repeal of don't ask, don't tell \nand how it improves our national security, but I would like to make a \nfew additional short points today before we take this important vote at \n10:30.\n  First, repealing this law is not about scoring political points or \ncatering to a special interest group. Rather, it is about doing the \nright thing for our national security, especially during a time of two \nwars. Instead of turning away qualified interpreters, mechanics, \ninfantrymen, and others, we need every able-bodied man and woman who is \nwilling to fight for their country.\n  An exhaustive study by the Pentagon recently revealed what numerous \nreports have shown, that don't ask, don't tell can be repealed without \nharmful effects. In fact, what it shows is our national security will \nbe enhanced by this repeal. That is one of the reasons our Defense \nSecretary, Robert Gates, and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, \nAdmiral Mullen, have strongly urged us to repeal the law this year, \nbefore we adjourn this week.\n  Second, the United States lags--sadly lags--behind the world's other \ntop militaries which allow open service by gays and lesbians. Our \ntroops fight next to servicemembers from many of these countries every \nsingle day. There is no evidence showing that our military operations \nin Afghanistan or Iraq are negatively affected by allowing gay \nservicemembers to serve openly alongside U.S. servicemembers.\n  Third, the vast majority of Americans support repealing this harmful \nlaw. As the Pentagon study showed, our servicemembers are complete \nprofessionals. They will comply with the repeal, and they will not \nallow open service to negatively affect the jobs they do.\n  Finally, if the Senate does not act to give the Department of Defense \nand the President the authority to end this policy, then we are leaving \nthe issue in\n\n[[Page S10652]]\n\nthe hands of the courts. Secretary Gates has said it makes far more \nsense to bring certainty to don't ask, don't tell through legislation \nrather than through lawsuits.\n  Let me end with the words of a Marine captain who wrote a courageous \nopinion piece this week that was in the Washington Post. He said:\n\n       It is time for ``don't ask, don't tell'' to join our other \n     mistakes in the dog-eared chapters of history textbooks. We \n     all bleed red, we all love our country, we are all Marines. \n     In the end, that is all that matters.\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I think Senator McCain asked I be \nrecognized for 5 minutes. If that is correct, I would like to proceed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, it is a week before Christmas. I don't \nknow where we will be next week. All I can say is, the Senate is taking \nup some very important matters--the don't ask, don't tell repeal. The \nMarine Corps Commandant said he believes changing this policy this way \nwould cause distraction among the Marine Corps to the point that he is \nworried about increased casualties. Let's hope he is wrong. But you \nhave to ask yourself, is he crazy to say that and is he the kind of man \nwho would make such a chilling statement without having thought about \nit?\n  My advice to my colleagues is that the Marine Corps Commandant is a \nserious man who is telling this body and this Nation that repeal, as \nbeing envisioned today, could compromise focus on the battlefield, and \nwe are in two wars.\n  The review from the military is positive in one area, negative in the \nother. The Army, the Air Force, particularly the Marine Corps have \ncautioned us not to do this now this way. Other people have said now is \nthe time. I can only tell you that those in close combat units have the \nmost concern about repealing this policy.\n  Some will say this is a civil rights issue of our time, the day has \ncome, we need to move forward as a nation. The Marine Corps does not \nhave that view. They have a different view, that this is about \neffectiveness on the battlefield at a time of war, not about civil \nrights.\n  It is up to the Members of the body to determine who is right and who \nis wrong; to be cautious or to boldly go forward. But to those Senators \nwho will take the floor today and announce this as a major advancement \nof civil rights in America, please let it be said that you are doing it \nin a fashion that those who have a different view cannot offer one \namendment. We are doing this in a way that the Senate, those of us who \nwant to maybe speak for the Marine Corps and have some amendments and \nideas that may make this less distracting, have zero ability to offer \nan amendment on a policy change that the Commandants of the Marine \nCorps, the Air Force, and the Army say is problematic.\n  To those who are pushing this process, it is not appreciated. It is \nnot appreciated by your fellow Senators, and I don't think it is going \nto be appreciated by the men and women who are going to have to live \nunder this kind of change.\n  Does that matter? Apparently not. That says a lot about the Senate. \nThat says a lot about modern politics.\n  To the DREAM Act, I have been involved in comprehensive immigration \nreform for many years. Senator Durbin and I have talked about how to \nmake the DREAM Act part of comprehensive immigration reform. To those \nwho have come to my office, you are always welcome to come, but you are \nwasting your time. We are not going to pass the DREAM Act or any other \nlegalization program until we secure our borders. It will never be done \nstand-alone. It has to be part of comprehensive immigration reform.\n  There is a war raging in Mexico that is compromising our national \nsecurity. I would argue that the best thing for the Senate to do, the \nHouse to do, the administration to do, is work together to secure our \nborders before we do anything else.\n  To those who are bringing up this bill today, I know why you are \ndoing it. You are not doing it to advance the issue. You are doing it \nto advance your situation politically. It is not appreciated. You are \nmaking it harder. You care more about politics in the last 2 weeks than \nyou care about governing the country. This will not help America do the \nthings America does. It is not appreciated.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, if I may, I would say that of the time \nwe have, this side will yield 5 minutes to the Senator from Virginia, \nand I thank him for coming over to speak.\n  Mr. WEBB. Mr. President, I rise in support of the notion that we need \nto make adjustments to this policy, this don't ask, don't tell policy. \nI say that after many years of thought and consideration and also in \nlight of the analysis that has been provided by the Department of \nDefense to the Armed Services Committee, on which I sit.\n  I would say to my friend from South Carolina, I take the points he \nhas made about the concerns in small-unit cohesion and that has gone \ninto the formula I have used myself in order to come to this \nconclusion.\n  We need, first of all, to understand what this is and what it is not. \nThe question is not whether there should be gays and lesbians in the \nmilitary. They are already there. According to General Hamm, who \nconducted this extensive study, approximately the same percentage of \nthe military is gay and lesbian as in our general population. The \nquestion is not about whether anyone should be able to engage in \ninappropriate conduct as a result of this policy, because we will not \nallow that and we will be very vigorous in our oversight of the \nDepartment of Defense to make sure that does not occur.\n  The question is whether this policy, as it was enacted, works today \nin a way that, on the one hand, can protect small-unit cohesion or to \nsort that out and, on the other, allow people to live honest lives.\n  Here is what we have. We have a Secretary of Defense, who served in \nthe Air Force and who implemented a policy of nondiscrimination when he \nheaded the CIA, coming forward strongly and saying he believes the \nalteration of this policy will work. I would remind my colleagues, he \nbegan as Secretary of Defense in the Bush administration.\n  We have a Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, who has an extensive career \nin surface warfare, starting with small destroyers up to commanding \nfleets, saying he believes the policy should change and that it can \nwork.\n  We have a Vice Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, a marine, saying he \nbelieves this policy should change and it can work.\n  Most interestingly, we have General Hamm, who conducted this study, a \nformer enlisted Army soldier, an infantry officer whose religious \nbeliefs cause him great concerns about the notion of homosexuality, at \nthe same time saying this policy should change and it can be changed.\n  That is what we are seeing. The question, and I think Senator Graham \nlaid it out very well, is whether a change in this policy will create \ndifficulties in small-unit cohesion. That depends, as I mentioned \nduring these hearings, on how this policy is implemented. I wrote a \nletter yesterday to Secretary Gates, wanting to reaffirm my \nunderstanding that this repeal would contemplate a sequenced \nimplementation for the provisions for different units in the military \nas reasonably determined by the service chiefs, the combatant \ncommanders, in coordination with the Secretary of Defense and Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs.\n  I ask unanimous consent it be printed in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. WEBB. He responded to me this morning. I ask his full letter be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. WEBB. He said:\n\n       This legislation would indeed permit a certification \n     approach as you suggest. . . . The specific concerns you \n     raise will be foremost in my mind as we develop an \n     implementation plan.\n\n  Without this, I would say, I would not be voting to repeal this. I \nhave spent my entire life in and around the military, including 5 years \nin the Pentagon. With this understanding and with the notion that we \nneed to be putting a policy into place that allows an\n\n[[Page S10653]]\n\nopen way of living among people who have different points of view, I am \ngoing to support this legislation.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 17, 2010.\n     Hon. Robert Gates,\n     Secretary of Defense, The Pentagon, Washington, DC.\n       My purpose in writing is to reconfirm my understanding that \n     the certification requirements contained in the Don't Ask, \n     Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010 contemplate a sequenced \n     implementation of its provisions for different units in the \n     military, as reasonably determined by the service chiefs and \n     unified combatant commanders in coordination with the \n     Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \n     Staff.\n       This was my understanding of the response I received from \n     General Cartwright when I raised the issue during his \n     testimony December 3, 2010. Specifically, I asked if the \n     process could be considered service-by-service, combat arm-\n     by-combat arm, or unit-by-unit. He agreed that this was a \n     correct interpretation.\n       Knowing of your many current commitments, I would very much \n     appreciate a short, written confirmation or clarification on \n     this matter as soon as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Jim Webb,\n     U.S. Senator.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n\n                                         Secretary of Defense,\n\n\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 17, 2010.\n     Hon. Jim Webb,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Webb: Thank you for your letter of December \n     17, 2010, regarding the certification requirements contained \n     in the Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010.\n       In response to your question, it is my understanding that \n     this legislation would indeed permit a certification approach \n     as you suggest. We have not determined the specific \n     methodology that would be used should this legislation pass, \n     but I can assure you that the specific concerns that you \n     raise will be foremost in my mind as we an implementation \n     plan. Further, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and \n     I remain committed to working closely with the Service Chiefs \n     and the Combatant Commanders in developing this process.\n       As Admiral Mullen and I have stated previously, neither he \n     nor I would sign a certification until we were satisfied, \n     after having consulted with each of the Service Chiefs and \n     Combatant Commanders, that risks to combat readiness, unit \n     cohesion, and effectiveness had, in fact, been mitigated, if \n     not eliminated, to the extent possible for all Services, \n     commands, and units.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Robert M. Gates.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Mr. President, I believe under the previous order I \nhave 5 minutes of Senator McCain's time. I would like to take a minute \nto speak on this issue of repeal of don't ask, don't tell. I wish to \nstart by talking about the process.\n  Here we are, once again, at the end of the year, 1 week before \nChristmas, dealing with a very sensitive, a very emotional issue that \nis of critical importance to our men and women in the military, as well \nas every other American, but most significantly those men and women who \nare willing to put their lives in harm's way to protect America and \nprotect Americans--and they do such a good job of that. What we have \nseen is the House took up a bill, passed a bill, it comes to the \nSenate, direct to the floor, no opportunity for amendments, limited \nopportunity for debate--which we will have today--and then we are going \nto vote.\n  I see the assistant majority leader is here. I wish to say that as we \nmove into next year, get ready--get ready--because this game can be \nplayed by both sides. There will be a number of bills that are passed \nin the House next year that the majority is not going to want to vote \non. But they better believe those bills are going to be coming to the \nfloor of the Senate in the same way this bill is coming, and we are \ngoing to insist on that.\n  Second, let me just say we are in the middle of two military \nconflicts, where men and women are getting shot at, injured, killed, \ndoing heroic acts, and providing for freedom in a part of the world \nthat is of critical importance to all Americans and, at the same time, \nmaking sure, as they fight that battle in Iraq and Afghanistan, those \nindividuals who would seek to do harm to America and Americans are not \nallowed to do so.\n  We have a policy in place called don't ask, don't tell that has been \nin place for 18 years now and it has worked. Admiral Mullen, in his \ntestimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, said that as a \ncommander he had to terminate individuals who decided to let it be \nknown they were a member of the gay or lesbian community, and he did.\n  I said in an additional question to him when he responded to that: \nDid you have a morale issue when you had to terminate those people? He \nsaid: No; morale remained high.\n  Morale today, in every branch of our service, is probably as high as \nit has ever been in the last several decades. Recruiting and retention \nare at all-time highs. But what does this survey that was sent out on \nthis issue to military personnel and military families show? First of \nall, it does not address the issue of: Do you support repeal of don't \nask, don't tell? They did not ask the question. The survey assumes the \nrepeal and talks about implementation. What is interesting about the \nsurvey is that the individuals who conducted it, in addition to sending \nout pieces of paper, also had personal interviews, they had online, \nback-and-forth chats with individual members of the military, and a \nmajority of the individuals who wear the uniform of the United States \nwho had personal interaction with the individuals who did the survey \nwere opposed to the repeal of don't ask, don't tell.\n  The survey does show that nearly 60 percent of the respondents from \nthe Marine Corps and the Army combat arms said they believe repeal \nwould cause a negative impact on their unit's effectiveness. Among \nmarine combat arms, the percentage was 67 percent. And we think this is \na good idea? We think it is a good idea when 67 percent of those \nmarines who are in foxholes and are dodging bullets around corners in \nAfghanistan as we speak today, who say that this is going to have an \nimpact on them, we think it is a good idea to repeal this policy?\n  And, by the way, this has nothing to do with the valiant service that \ngays and lesbians have provided to the United States of America. That \nis a given. We all agree with that. But what the Marine Corps and what \nthe Army, as well as what the Air Force Chief said is this is not the \ntime to repeal this. In the middle of a military conflict is not the \ntime to repeal a policy that is working, that has the potential for \naffecting morale, it has the potential for affecting unit cohesiveness, \nand it also, most significantly in my mind, according to both General \nCasey and General Amos, does have the potential for increasing the risk \nof harm and death to our men and women who are serving in combat today.\n  If for no other reason, we ought not to repeal this today. Should it \nbe done at some point in time? Maybe so. But in the middle of a \nmilitary conflict is not the time to do it. So as we think about this, \nand we think about the men and women who are serving, and the fact \nthat, as Senator Inhofe alluded to earlier--I will not repeat all of \nthose numbers--but the fact is that if the percentages in response to \nthe survey turn out to be true, then we are going to have about 30 \npercent of marine combat forces who are going to get out early and not \nreenlist, and we are going to have to replace them. We have got about \n25 percent of those combat troops in the Army who are not going to \nreenlist and who would like to get out early.\n  If that happens, we are going to have 250,000 soldiers and marines \nthat need to be replaced in short order. When I asked Secretary Gates \nabout it, he said: Well, that is not going to happen. Well, if it does \nhappen, we are going to have serious consequences.\n  I do hope common sense will prevail here and that we will not get \ncloture, and we can move on to something that is extremely important to \nthe men and women of America at this time in our calendar year.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I thank the Chair. I would yield myself \nup to 8 minutes of the time on our side.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I want to thank Chairman Levin, Senator \nUdall of Colorado, and Senator Webb for their informed and informative \nremarks in support of the motion to concur with the House in regard to\n\n[[Page S10654]]\n\nrepealing the policy that has come to be known as don't ask, don't \ntell.\n  I think that in considering this matter today we have an opportunity \nnot just to right a wrong, not just to honor the service of a group of \nAmerican patriots who happen to be gay and lesbian, not just to make \nour military more effective, but to advance the values that the \nFounders of our country articulated in our original American documents.\n  I want to talk very briefly about that, because it is important to \nset what we are doing here in the context of history. From the \nbeginning, America has been a different Nation. We did not define \nourselves based on our borders. Our Founders defined America based on \nour values, and none stated more powerfully than those words in the \nopening paragraph of the Declaration of Independence that: There are \nself-evident truths. This is a political statement, a constitutional \nstatement, but also a religious statement.\n  There are self-evident truths, and one of them is that all of us are \ncreated equal and endowed by our Creator with those unalienable rights \nto life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. In the second \nparagraph, our Founders say, in the Declaration, that they are forming \nthis new government, America, in order to secure those rights to life \nand liberty. The sad fact is, at the moment they adopted the \nDeclaration of Independence, these rights were not enjoyed for a lot of \nAmericans, including, of course, the slaves, most of all, but women had \nno legal rights to speak of.\n  One way I think I like to look at American history is as a journey to \nrealize, generation after generation, in a more perfect way, to make \nours a more perfect Union, the rights given in the Declaration of \nIndependence, the rights promised in the Declaration of Independence \nand, of course, with a lot of pain and turmoil we have done that with \nregard to race in our country, certainly true with regard to women.\n  We have created an ethic. It is the promise of America, but in some \nsense it is what we also call the American dream, that in this country \nyou are judged not by who you are but how you perform. In this country, \nno matter where you were born or how you were born, the fact is you are \nable to go--if you play by the rules and you work hard, you should be \nable to go as far as your talents will take you, not any characteristic \nthat one might associate with you, any adjective that one might put \nbefore the noun ``American'' whether it is White American, Black \nAmerican, Christian, Jewish American, gay or straight American, Latino, \nor European American, that you should be entitled to go as far as your \ntalents and your commitment to our country will take you.\n  In our generation, it seems to me that the movement to realize the \npromise of the Declaration has been one of the places that has been \nmost at the forefront and realized most significantly is in regard to \ngay and lesbian Americans, to promise that, in our time, we will \nguarantee, as a matter of law, that no one will be denied equal \nopportunity based on their sexual orientation. They will be judged by \nthe way they live and the way they perform their jobs. That is why the \nexisting don't ask, don't tell policy is, in my opinion, inconsistent \nwith basic American values.\n  It is not only bad for the military, it is inconsistent with our \nvalues. I want to say it is particularly bad for the military, because \nin our society, the American military is, in my opinion, the one \ninstitution that still commands the respect and trust of the American \npeople, because it lives by American values. It fights for American \nvalues. It is committed to a larger cause and not divided by any \ndivision, including party.\n  So to force this policy as the don't ask, don't tell does on our \nmilitary is to force them to be less than they want to be, and less \nthan they can be. Admiral Mullen, the No. 1 uniformed military officer \nin our country today, said very powerfully:\n\n       We--\n\n  The military--\n\n     are an institution that values integrity, and then asks other \n     people to join us, work with us, fight with us, die with us, \n     and lie about who they are the whole time they are in the \n     military.\n\n  That, Admiral Mullin says, is what does not make any sense to me. I \nagree. The fact is this is not just a theory we are talking about. The \nfact is that under the don't ask, don't tell policy, more than 14,000 \nmembers of our military have been discharged since 1993, not because \nthey performed their military responsibilities inadequately, not \nbecause they violated the very demanding code of personal conduct in \nthe military, but simply because of their sexual orientation.\n\n  I think if you view this as an issue, that can be controversial in \nthe realm of rhetoric or theory. But if you face those 14,000--and I \nhave talked to a lot of them--yesterday, an Air Force major, commanding \nmore than 200 members of the Air Force--all sorts of commendations, \ntossed out simply because someone did not like him, found out he was \ngay, and he was pushed out.\n  A student at one of the academies, at the top of his class, same \nthing. Because of his sexual orientation, tossed out. You know we \nspend, by one estimate, more than half a billion dollars training those \n14,000 members of the American military that we discharged solely \nbecause of their sexual orientation. What a waste. These people simply \nwant to serve their country.\n  I know you, Mr. President, have probably had the same experience I \nhave. When you talk to any of the 14,000, why are they lobbying, \npleading with us to repeal don't ask, don't tell? They want to go back \nand serve our country. They want to put their lives on the line for our \nsecurity and our freedoms. Does it make any sense to say no to them \nsimply because of a private part of their person?\n  In the survey that was done as part of the Pentagon report, there are \nsome remarkable numbers. One of them is that of the gay and lesbian \nmembers of our military surveyed, only 15 percent said they would come \nout, that they would reveal their sexual orientation. One of them was \nquoted as saying, and I paraphrase: That is private. That is not part \nof my responsibility in the military. None of us do that in the \nmilitary.\n  And, incidentally, when, as I hope and pray don't ask, don't tell is \nrepealed, gay and lesbian members of the military, just as straight \nmembers, will be held to the highest demands and standards of the \nmilitary code of conduct. If they are involved in any inappropriate \nbehavior, they will be disciplined.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 2 additional minutes of \nthe time we have.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. The other significant number in the survey I thought \nwas this: Well over two-thirds of the members of our military surveyed, \n120-some-odd thousand surveyed, said that they thought the military was \nready for this change.\n  I know there has been talk about the marines. There is a fascinating \nnumber about the marines. A significant number of the marines are \nworried about this change in policy. But among those marines who have \nserved in marine units with gay and lesbian marines, 84 percent say no \nproblem. Why? Because we do not care, when we are out in combat, what \nsomebody's race or gender or ethnicity or religion or sexual \norientation is; all we care is whether they have got our back and they \nare a good member of the unit.\n  My friends have said that this simply--if, and I hope when this \nmeasure passes, and don't ask, don't tell is repealed, it authorizes \nthe repeal, but it does not finish it. It starts a deliberative process \nin which, without time limit, the Secretary of Defense, the President, \nthe Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, have to decide that it is \ntime for the repeal to occur. It is a very reasonable process. And it \nsaves the military, as Secretary Gates has said over and over again, \nfrom facing an order from a court that forces the military to do this \nimmediately.\n  Bottom line, and I will speak personally here, I was privileged about \n10 years ago--incidentally, thinking of the DREAM Act, I am a \ngrandchild of four immigrants to America. Could they have ever dreamed \nthat I would end up a Senator--2,000 have had the opportunity--to be \nthe first Jewish American to run on a national ticket?\n  I will never forget. Someone called me up that day and said how \nthrilled they were, a member of another minority group, and said: You \nknow, Joe,\n\n[[Page S10655]]\n\nhere is what is significant. When a barrier falls for one group of \nAmericans, the doors of opportunity open wider for all Americans.\n  I think we have that opportunity today to make our great country even \ngreater, and our best-in-the-world military even better.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 23 minutes remaining for \nthe majority, just under 16 minutes to the Republicans.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I yield to the Senator from California, Mrs. Feinstein, \nfor 7 minutes.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, let me thank Senator Lieberman for his \nauthorship of and advocacy for repeal of don't ask, don't tell. I wish \nto use my time to speak about pieces of legislation.\n  Don't ask, don't tell has been with us now for 17 years. I just \npulled a speech I made on the floor 17 years ago. The DREAM Act has \nbeen with us for 10 years. So neither of these are surprise bills. Both \nof these affect large numbers of people in major ways. For many, they \nare their life. For those who love the military, who see no life \noutside of the military, don't ask, don't tell is their life. The same \nfor students, the DREAM Act becomes their life.\n  Let me begin with don't ask, don't tell. Seventeen years ago, Senator \nBoxer introduced an amendment. I spoke to that amendment. We lost by a \nvote of 33 to 63. Only one-third of the Senate voted to repeal don't \nask, don't tell in what was a benign amendment, essentially a consent \nresolution, but it lost. It lost despite the testimony of legions of \nmilitary.\n  The time has gone by, 17 long years. Many of us believe the policy is \nunconstitutional. We believe it does more harm than good. And 17 years \nlater, I am only more certain that is the case. The criteria for \nserving in the U.S. Armed Forces should be courage, competence, and a \nwillingness to serve. No one should be turned away because of who they \nare--not because of their race, their sex, or their sexual orientation. \nSince 1993, however, don't ask, don't tell has required gay and lesbian \nAmericans to make a choice. You can serve the country you love, but \nonly if you lie about who you are.\n  This has forced honorable American soldiers to conceal their true \nselves from their family, their friends, their fellow servicemembers, \nand their military superiors. It has deprived the U.S. military of \ntalent and badly needed special skills.\n  Let me discuss one person. SGT Lacye Presley served two tours of duty \nin Iraq as an Army medic. The Army awarded her a Bronze Star for her \nheroic action in keeping several critically wounded civilians alive \nafter a car bomb exploded in their midst. Another Army sergeant who \nworked with her around the same time said this about Sergeant Presley:\n\n       I would serve with Sergeant Presley any day, no doubt about \n     it. She's one of the best medics that I've ever seen in my 18 \n     years of service.\n\n  Sergeant Presley was discharged after someone reported her sexual \norientation to a senior commander. This is one for Sergeant Presley.\n  Let me discuss some other affected military personnel. Former PO2 \nStephen Benjamin was an Arabic linguist for the Navy. He started his \nservice in 2003, graduated in the top ten percent of his class from the \nDefense Language Institute, and spent 2 years translating for the Navy. \nIn 2007, he was prepared to deploy to Iraq but was turned away and \ndischarged because it was discovered that he was gay.\n  Army SGT Darren Manzella served two tours of duty providing medical \nservices in Iraq. He earned three promotions over 6 years and was \nawarded the Combat Medical Bridge for leading over 100 patrols to treat \nthe wounded and evacuate casualties. But after he confided in a \nsupervisor about his sexuality, he was threatened with discharge, his \nsexuality was made public, and he was later discharged under don't ask, \ndon't tell.\n  PVT Randy Miller of Stockton, CA, was a member of an elite Army \nparatroop division with a long family history of military service. He \nspent 2 years training in preparation for deployment and then served a \ntour of duty in Iraq beginning in the winter of 2005. But when he \nreturned to the United States to be treated for a knee injury, someone \nreported that he was gay and he was discharged from the Army.\n  Finally, there is LTC Victor Fehrenbach, a 19-year veteran of the Air \nForce. He has flown 88 combat missions in Iraq, Afghanistan, Kosovo, \nand the former Yugoslavia. He received nine Air Medals and five \nCommendation Medals. When our country was attacked on September 11, \n2001, he was hand-selected to fly patrols over Washington, DC, as part \nof the initial alert crew.\n  But Colonel Fehrenbach has been recommended for honorable discharge \nbecause his sexual orientation was made public in 2008.\n  These are only five stories. There are at least 13,500 more. All of \nthese men and women volunteered to defend the country they love, only \nto be discharged because of who they happen to love.\n  Now I wish to speak about the DREAM Act. I thank those who have \nsupported this, brought it forward--Senator Hatch, Senator Durbin, as \nwell as Senator Lieberman and Senator Collins on repealing don't ask, \ndon't tell. I have supported the DREAM Act since it was first \nintroduced. Each year the support has grown.\n  Each year approximately 65,000 undocumented young people graduate \nfrom America's high schools. Most of these did not make a choice to \ncome to the United States. Many were brought here by their parents, \nsome at 6 months old, 6 years, 12 years--whatever it is. Many of these \nyoung people grew up in the United States. They have little or no \nmemory or resources in the country from which they came. They are hard-\nworking young people, dedicated to their education or serving in the \nNation's military. They have stayed out of trouble. Some are \nvaledictorians--I happen to know one--and honor roll students. Some are \ncommunity leaders and have an unwavering commitment to serving the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. President, I would like to tell you about a few college students \nin California, who would benefit from the DREAM Act.\n  Ana was born in Mexico. She was brought to the United States when she \nwas 7 years old. She says one of her earliest memories is her mother \nwaking her up early in the morning to go to school in the United \nStates. She quickly learned English and excelled in school. She didn't \nfind out that she was undocumented until she was 13 years old and \noverheard someone talking about ``illegal aliens.'' When she asked her \nfather what it meant, he told her that she should never ask about that \nword again. Like most kids, she didn't know what it meant to be \nundocumented.\n  Then, when she was ready to apply for college, her guidance counselor \nasked for her social security number. This is when the meaning of \n``undocumented'' hit home. She graduated from high school with honors \nand is currently a sophomore at DeAnza College in California. She is \nactive in her student government and is studying political science.\n  Ivan was brought to the United States when he was just 10 months old. \nHis family settled in San Bernardino, CA, where Ivan excelled in \nschool. He found out about his undocumented status in the 7th grade \nwhen he could not accept an award he earned at a science fair because \nhe didn't have a Social Security number.\n  Ivan is a Presidential scholar who graduated within the top 1 percent \nof high school graduates in San Bernardino County. He is currently a \nsenior at California State University and is a pre-med biology major. \nHe hopes to become a doctor in the Army someday and says that it would \nbe an honor to provide care to the brave men and women risking their \nlives for this country.\n  Blanca came to the United States in 1989, when she was 6 years old. \nHer family left Mexico after a devastating earthquake. Blanca's family \nsettled in the San Francisco area, where she attended elementary school \nand graduated from high school. Although Blanca knew that she was \nundocumented, her family never spoke about it.\n\n[[Page S10656]]\n\n  Despite being undocumented, Blanca was determined to get the best \neducation she could. She attended Contra Costa Community College and \nthe University of California Davis. She graduated from college in 2008 \nand hopes to become a lawyer someday so that she can work to prevent \nsex trafficking.\n  Justino was brought to the United States 10 years ago by his mother, \nalong with his two siblings, to escape his abusive father. He attended \nschool and graduated within the top 5 percent of his class. He attends \nMount San Antonio College and is a student leader, actively engaged in \ncommunity service in the Latino community.\n  Justino says that he has a strong love for his community and has been \ndoing everything he can to improve it just like his role models, Martin \nLuther King, Jr., and Gandhi.\n  Because of their undocumented status, these young people are \nineligible to serve in the military. They face tremendous obstacles to \nattending college. For many, English is actually their first language, \nand they are just like every other American student. Now reaching \nadulthood, these young people are left with a dead end. They can't use \ntheir educations to contribute to their communities. They can't serve \nthe country they call home by volunteering for military service. In \nother words, they are dumbed down by their status. They are relegated \nto the shadows by their status. And along comes the DREAM Act. That \nprovides an opportunity for these young people to prove themselves. It \nprovides the incentive to prove themselves.\n  It would permit students to become permanent residents if they came \nhere as children, are long-term U.S. residents, have good moral \ncharacter, attend college, or enlist in the military for 2 years. So \nalready they have to prove themselves. The legislation requires \nstudents to wait 10 years before becoming lawful permanent residents \nand undergo background and security checks and pay any back taxes. This \nis a multistep process. It is not a free pass.\n  Additionally, according to CBO, the DREAM Act would actually increase \nFederal revenues by $2.3 billion over the 10 years and increase net \ndirect spending by $912 million between 2011 and 2012.\n  In addition, the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee \non Taxation indicate that enacting the bill would reduce deficits by \nabout $2.2 billion over 10 years.\n  DREAM is a winner. Repealing Don't ask, don't tell is what we should \ndo. I hope there are ``aye'' votes sufficient to pass both of these \ntoday.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Could I be advised after I have spoken for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. President, the DREAM Act is an attempt to cure a symptom of a \nproblem. The symptom is that some children have been brought here \nillegally and they are suffering the consequences of being illegal \naliens under American law. The problem is illegal immigration, which \ncauses all manner of other bad results or problems. There are huge \ncosts to society and any number of personal tragedies as a result of \nillegal immigration, the DREAM Act problems being only one subset.\n  Just a few days ago, another Border Patrol agent was killed in the \nState of Arizona, illustrating again another kind of personal tragedy \nfrom illegal immigration. Unfortunately, treating symptoms of the \nproblem might make us feel better because we are doing something for a \nparticular group of folks, but it can allow the underlying problem to \nmetastisize. Unfortunately, that is what is happening at our border.\n  In some respects, the problems are getting worse, not better. Our \ncitizens have a right to be safe and secure. Right now that situation, \nat least in my home State, does not pertain. So the first point I make \nis that we have to secure the border and stop illegal immigration. When \nwe do, there will not be more problems for people associated with \neducation that would be solved by the DREAM Act or other problems \nassociated with illegal immigration. We will have excluded or we will \nhave limited the nature of the problem to simply those who are here now \nand then, obviously, we can deal with that problem. That is the first \npoint.\n  Second, this bill is brought to us with no hearings or markup in a \ncommittee. It is the sixth version of a DREAM Act. I worked with \nSenator Durbin on another version of the DREAM Act in connection with \nthe comprehensive immigration law. There are problems with this bill. \nThose problems need to be dealt with. But the bill comes before us \nunder a condition in which there can be no amendments. There needs to \nbe amendments.\n  In the remaining 3 minutes or so I have, let me simply identify 10 \nparticular problems we need to deal with and can only be dealt with by \ngetting together and working it out by having amendments, which we \ncan't do in the short time we have.\n  The bill would immediately put an estimated 1 to 2 million illegal \nimmigrants on a path to citizenship, a number which will only grow \nbecause there is neither a cap nor sunset in the legislation. These \npeople would then have access to a variety of other Federal programs, \nFederal welfare programs, student loans, Federal work study programs, \nand the like.\n  Third, the entire time such individuals are in conditional status, \nthey are not required to attend college or join the military. That is a \ncommon misperception. Only when such individuals seek to get lawful \npermanent resident status do they then have to proceed to complete the \nrequirements for education or military.\n  Fourth, the education and military requirements can be waived \naltogether, including for criminal activity--in other words, people who \nhave a serious criminal background.\n  Five, chain migration, which is something we dealt with in the \nlegislation in 2009, would result from this legislation because once \nthe citizenship is obtained, the individuals would have the right to \nlegally petition for a green card for their family members. That means \nthe numbers could easily triple from the 2 million plus estimated right \nnow.\n  Sixth, the bill has no age limit for aliens in removal status. This \nis supposed to be for children, but there is no age limit for people \nwho are in removal proceedings and simply file an application for \nstatus under the DREAM Act to stay their removal. That has to be fixed.\n  Seven, the bill forbids the Secretary of Homeland Security from \nremoving any alien who has a pending application for conditional \nnonimmigrant status regardless of age or criminal status. In other \nwords, it provides a safe haven for illegal immigrants, some of whom we \nwould not want to allow to stay in the United States and should be \nsubject to removal.\n  Eighth, the DREAM Act as written provides that applicants who are \ncurrently ineligible under current law for status of a green card could \nnevertheless be eligible under this act. The reason is because some of \nthe grounds of waiver that exist in this act do not exist under current \nlaw, but they could be waived for DREAM Act aliens--things such as \ndocument fraud, alien absconders, and marriage fraud.\n  Nine, the act does not actually require that an illegal alien finish \nany type of degree other than a high school GPD. To receive green card \nstatus, the bill requires only that the alien complete 2 years at an \ninstitution of higher education. There is not a requirement that they \never receive a degree of any kind. The requirement is that they needn't \nreceive a degree of any kind. This is important.\n  For those who want to go into the military, there is the requirement \nfor 2 years of service in the uniformed services. When you enlist in \nthe service today, you are enlisting for a commitment of 4 years.\n  Finally, removal, if it can be demonstrated as resulting in a \nhardship either to the applicant or to a spouse, the requirements for \neducation can be waived altogether. So a sympathetic Secretary of \nHomeland Security could obviously create a situation in which there is \nessentially just a waiver for people to come into the United States.\n  For these reasons, I urge colleagues to vote against cloture on the \nDREAM Act.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I yield to three of my colleagues at this \npoint before, I believe, Senator McCain\n\n[[Page S10657]]\n\nspeaks. I yield Senator Bennet 2 minutes, Senator Gillibrand for 2 \nminutes, and Senator Schumer for 2 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I rise today in strong support of the \nDREAM Act. I have a lot of sympathy for the arguments the Senator from \nArizona has made about what is going on in Arizona, what is going on in \nthe Rocky Mountain West, where I come from, which reminds me of the \nneed we have in this country and in this Congress to finally face up to \nthe facts and pass comprehensive immigration reform. But that is not \nwhat we are talking about today.\n  What we are talking about today is the DREAM Act, a narrow bill that \ndeals with about 65,000 people a year who are here through no fault of \ntheir own and have no other country of their own but want to make a \ncontribution to our country--as scholars, as taxpayers, as part of our \nmilitary--the people who have worked hard, who have played by the rules \nand they want to do nothing other than make a contribution to the \nUnited States of America, much as my grandparents and my mother wanted \nto make when they came here as immigrants.\n  So I think on this Christmas Eve it would be more than appropriate \nfor the Senate to join the House and do the right thing and pass the \nDREAM Act.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise in support of the two very \nimportant votes we are having today on the DREAM Act and the repeal of \ndon't ask, don't tell.\n  The DREAM Act is a moral imperative. These are young people who have \ncome to this country through no fault of their own, who want nothing \nbut to achieve the American dream--either through education or through \nmilitary service--but they want to be part of this community and be \nable to give back to this community.\n  In a country that was founded on immigrants, where the richness of \nour heritage and culture and the breath of our economy is due to our \nimmigrants, we want to make sure every one of these young people can \nbecome American citizens.\n  With regard to don't ask, don't tell, I cannot think of a policy that \ngreater undermines the integrity of our entire Armed Services and who \nwe are as a Nation. This is a policy that is corrosive. We are saying \nto men and women who want nothing but to serve this country, to give \ntheir lives for this country: No, you cannot because of who you love. I \ncannot think of something more egregious, more undermining of our \ncommand structure and of our goodwill, and the entire fabric of the \nmilitary lives of the men and women who serve.\n  Mr. President, I urge my colleagues to look at this as an urgent \npriority for national security. When we are talking about worrying \nabout having two wars and terrorism at every front, we need to know all \nof our best and brightest--how many are not serving today because of \nthis policy; how many will return to the military when this policy is \nremoved. All I know is, since this policy has been in place, we have \nlost 13,000 personnel, more than 10 percent of our foreign language \nspeakers, and more than 800 in mission-critical areas who cannot be \neasily replaced.\n  If you care about national security, if you care about our military \nreadiness, then you will repeal this corrosive policy.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New York.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, today we vote on two very important \nissues in the great, long, and often difficult march that America has \nmade toward equality.\n  That is one of the greatnesses of this country, that we inexorably \nmove to equality. Sometimes it is painful. Sometimes it is difficult. \nSometimes we take two steps forward and one step back. But as the great \nscholar de Tocqueville wrote, when he visited America in the 1830s: The \nthing that separates America from all the other countries of the world \nis equality always prevails.\n  We are dealing with equality on two scores today, in two areas. One \nis in the military. One of the great things about our military, No. 1, \nis they defend us and risk their lives for our freedom. But the second \nis, it has always been an integrating, positive force in America. Any \npolicy that says you cannot serve even though you want to be an \nAmerican, you are an American, is wrong; bad for our military service \nand bad for the country.\n  Second, we speak of the DREAM Act. Inevitably, from the time the \nfirst settlers came to New York, the English began to displace the \nDutch, and the Dutch were upset. But what does America do? We reach out \nto newcomers and say: Become Americans and contribute to the American \ndream and work hard.\n  There are always people who have reasons to say no. They always fail. \nThey may not fail this morning, but they will fail because the drive \nfor equality is a great American drive. It is part of the American \ndream, and on both these issues we will prevail.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, over the last 3 years, I have spent a lot \nof time traveling around the State of Arizona and meeting with my \nconstituents. Many of these trips took me to the southern part of my \nState where I sat down with ranchers, farmers, small business owners, \nlocal officials, and law enforcement officers in the border region and \ndiscussed the issues that were important to them and their neighbors. \nEverywhere I went people told me of their fear and concern over the \nlack of security along Arizona's border with Mexico.\n  Due to the drug war in Mexico, the situation along the southern \nborder has proven to be a very serious and real threat to the people \nliving in the region. The violence that continues to plague our \nsouthern neighbor by well-armed, well-financed, and very determined \ndrug cartels poses a threat to our national security. Despite the \nincreased efforts of President Calderon to stamp out these bloodthirsty \nand vicious drug cartels, violence has increased dramatically, claiming \nover 31,000 lives in Mexico since 2006. The murderers carrying out \nthese crimes are as violent and dangerous as any in the world.\n  Two weeks ago, the Mexican military arrested a 14-year-old U.S. \ncitizen who has been working as a hit man for the Cartel of the South \nPacific. This child assassin came to the attention of the public after \nYouTube videos surfaced of him decapitating kidnapping victims. When \nquestioned by Mexican authorities, he is quoted as saying, ``When we \ndon't find the rivals, we kill innocent people, maybe a construction \nworker or a taxi driver.'' Truly disturbing behavior.\n  This week there was another tragic murder on the U.S. side of the \nborder that took the life of Border Patrol Agent Brian Terry. Our \nthoughts and prayers go out to his family and his fellow Border Patrol \nagents. Agent Terry was killed outside of Rio Rico, AZ, during a \nshootout with a Mexican ``rip-crew'' that was attempting to rip off a \nrival drug gang. These incidents are becoming all too common and are a \nbyproduct of the lack of resources and personnel along our border.\n  Incidents like these are why the residents of southern Arizona tell \nme that they feel that they live in a lawless, forgotten region of the \ncountry where they live in constant fear in their own homes. They are \nbegging for our help. It is time--in fact, the time is long overdue--\nfor the Federal Government to fulfill its responsibility to secure our \ninternational borders and ensure the safety and well-being of the \nfamilies and citizens living within those borders.\n\n  All of that being said, I still believe that the overwhelming \nmajority of men and women trying to enter our country illegally are \nlooking for nothing more than the opportunity to improve their lives \nand the lives of their families. Fixing our immigration system, with \nreforms like the DREAM Act and the implementation of a workable and \nlabor-market-driven guest worker program would benefit our Nation's \neconomy and our society. Such reform would also provide immigrants \ndesperate to come to the United States to look for work a safe \nalternative to illegal human smugglers or ``coyotes'' that have cost so \nmany people their lives and dignity. According to the U.S. Border \nPatrol, 253 people died attempting to cross the Arizona border between \nSeptember 2009 and October 2010.\n  With respect to the DREAM Act, I have great sympathy for the students\n\n[[Page S10658]]\n\nwho would benefit from passage of this legislation. I have met \npersonally with many of the students advocating for the bill, and many \nof their stories are heart-wrenching. Through no fault of their own, \nthey are now caught in legal limbo that leaves them unable to obtain \nemployment in the United States and unequipped to return to the country \nof their birth, often a place foreign and completely unknown to them. I \ntruly sympathize with the plight of these men and women.\n  But I also feel for the men and women of Arizona who live along an \nunsecure border and have been promised for decades that the Federal \nGovernment will do its job and stop the illegal migration and drug \ntrafficking that run through their towns, neighborhoods, and backyards.\n  I pity the farmers in my State who are unable to harvest their crops \nbecause they cannot navigate the burdens of the H-2A agriculture guest \nworker program. Most of all, however, I sympathize with the families \nwho live in constant fear in their homes and neighborhoods, especially \nthose who have been victimized by criminal elements crossing the border \nillegally. Consequently, I cannot in good faith put the priorities of \nthese students, as tragic as their situation is, ahead of my \nconstituents and the American people are who are demanding that the \nFederal Government fulfill its constitutional duty to secure our \nborders. Once we fulfill this commitment, we can then address the other \nissues surrounding and plaguing our broken immigration system.\n  On a practical note, I also believe that any casual, impartial \nobserver will recognize that our inability to secure the border has \nmade immigration reform politically unattainable as the American public \ninsists we stop the flow of illegal entries before considering any \nchanges to our immigration policies. In 1986, we passed what was truly \nan amnesty and we failed to secure our borders either before or after \nthat bill's passage. Consequently, we now have an estimated 12 to 20 \nmillion people living in our country illegally, and the American people \nhave said ``enough is enough.'' They are telling us to ``secure our \nborders first.''\n\n  We have already made steps in the right direction. In fact, we have \nshown our ability to work in a bipartisan fashion to secure the border \nduring this Congress. Most recently, in August, the Senate unanimously \npassed legislation to deploy $600 million in personnel and new assets \nto the southwest border. We must continue this important work together.\n  While it is true that there are more assets and resources at the \nborder now than ever before, we need a complete and comprehensive plan \nthat incorporates the ideas of the State and local law enforcement, \nelected officials, and the border Governors. In the coming months, I \nwill begin a deliberative and comprehensive process of discovering what \nis truly needed to secure our borders and give the Governors of our \nSouthern States the peace of mind and assurance they need to certify \nthat their borders are secure.\n  These elected officials are on the front line and know best what \nassets, personnel, and technology are needed. Once the border State \nGovernors certify their State border has been secured and the Federal \nGovernment can demonstrate such to the American people--only then \nshould we and can we begin working on comprehensive immigration reform.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues in a bipartisan matter \nto address all of these issues that are important to the American \npeople and the people of Arizona.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, while partisan rancor seems to have seized \nthe Senate on so many issues this year, on at least one count, I am \nencouraged and hopeful. There may yet be sufficient bipartisan \nagreement to repeal the discriminatory don't ask, don't tell policy \nbefore this Congress ends. I commend those Senators who have pledged to \nsupport the repeal, and I renew my own commitment to this worthy \neffort. It is well past time to put an end to this discriminatory and \nharmful policy.\n  Today, in the U.S. Senate, the stage is being set for one of the \nmajor civil rights victories of our lifetimes. Years from now, I hope \nthat historians will have good cause to remember this day as a day when \nthe two parties overcame superficial differences to advance the pursuit \nof equal rights for all Americans. After much effort, and just as much \nstudy and discussion, the Senate finally will proceed to an up-or-down \nvote on repealing this counterproductive policy.\n  For those who still harbor concerns that enacting this repeal would \nsomehow harm readiness, one simple fact is the clearest answer: Gay and \nlesbian Americans already serve honorably in the U.S. Armed Forces and \nhave always done so. There is no doubt that they have served in the \nmilitary since the earliest days of the Republic. The only reason they \ncould do so then, and now--even under today's discriminatory policy--is \nbecause they display the same conduct and professionalism that we \nexpect from all of our men and women in uniform. They are no different \nthan anyone else, and they should be treated no differently.\n  Ending this policy will also bring to an end years of forced, \ndiscriminatory and corrosive secrecy. Giving these troops the right to \nserve openly, allowing them to be honest about who they are, will not \ncause disciplined service members to suddenly become distracted on the \nbattlefield. It is pandering to suggest that they would be.\n  This is not only my view. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, Admiral \nMullen, has said time and again that this is the right thing to do and \nthat it will not harm our military readiness.\n  Every member of our armed services should be judged solely on his or \nher contribution to the mission. Repealing don't ask, don't tell will \nensure that we stay true to the principles upon which our great Nation \nwas founded. We ask our troops to protect freedom around the globe. It \nis time to protect their basic freedoms and equal rights here at home.\n  Throughout our history, the Senate has shown its ability to reflect \nand illuminate the Nation's deepest ideals and the Nation's conscience. \nIt is my hope that the Senate will rise to this occasion by breaking \nthrough the partisan din to proceed to a debate and vote on repealing \nthis discriminatory and counterproductive policy.\n  Mr. COONS. Mr. President, I rise to voice my strong support for this \nlegislation which I am proud to co-sponsor and which effectively \nrepeals don't ask, don't tell.\n  Today, we are at a historic crossroads. Our choice is to continue a \npolicy that conflicts with our founding principles of freedom and \nliberty for all, or to open the doors of the military to all Americans \ncourageous enough to serve.\n  Don't ask, don't tell is discrimination, plain and simple. Any \nAmerican prepared to die for their country should be afforded the \nrespect and admiration they deserve. Brave men and women in uniform are \nwilling to fight for our freedom every day, and it is our \nresponsibility as Senators as Americans first to fight for theirs.\n  President Truman had the vision and leadership to racially integrate \nthe military at a time when he faced even stronger opposition from \npolitical and military leaders than we face today. We should act today \nin that tradition.\n  I have met with many courageous members of the military some of whom \nalso happened to be gay or lesbian and listened to congressional \ntestimony on this issue. I share the view of our military leaders that \nthe most pressing question is not whether to repeal don't ask, don't \ntell, but rather, how to implement a repeal. This is why I am pleased \nthe bill before us today leaves this issue in the hands of military \nleaders, who are granted the time needed to certify adequate \npreparation for a repeal reflecting the best interests of our troops.\n  Under the legislation, a repeal of don't ask, don't tell would be \nenacted 60 days after the President, Secretary of Defense, and Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs certify they have done three things. First, that \nthey have considered the Pentagon working group report on the impact of \na repeal. Second, that the Department of Defense has readied the \nnecessary regulations for implementation. Third, that the manner of \nimplementation is consistent with the standards of military readiness, \neffectiveness, unit cohesion, and recruiting and retention.\n  This legislation does not stipulate a timeline for this process, but \nprovides\n\n[[Page S10659]]\n\na congressional mandate that the policy must be changed once measures \nare in place to mitigate any negative impact of a repeal. This includes \ntraining, education, and additional steps to ensure a smooth transition \nto implementing a repeal.\n  The issue of implementation was one concern shared by all the service \nchiefs who testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on \nDecember 3, and I am pleased it is adequately addressed in this bill. \nAnother concern shared by all service chiefs was the view that they \nwould prefer that Congress legislate a repeal rather than leave it to \nthe courts. They shared a concern that a court order would compel \nmilitary leaders to implement a repeal without the time and flexibility \nrequired.\n  As the recent Department of Defense report demonstrated, 70 percent \nof our troops believe a repeal of don't ask, don't tell will have \nlittle impact on military readiness or unit cohesion. Sixty-nine \npercent believe they have served with someone who is gay or lesbian, \nand of that group, 92 percent responded that serving with someone who \nis gay or lesbian had little impact on their unit.\n  These report findings demonstrate a basic truth that we can deny no \nlonger. Gay Americans have chosen to proudly serve their country, and \nthe current don't ask, don't tell policy forces them to lie about who \nthey are or face discharge. In fact, we have discharged nearly 14,000 \nbrave servicemembers since the law was implemented in 1993, simply \nbecause their sexual orientation was disclosed. Those discharged \ninclude high-decorated combat veterans, national security experts, and \nbadly needed military linguists when our nation is engaged overseas in \ntwo wars. These are losses we can ill afford.\n  Sexual orientation is not a choice but discrimination is. Homosexuals \nin the military today face the double burden of risking their lives for \ntheir country while being force to lie about who they are or face \ndischarge. Today, I am pleased to join my colleagues in ending this \nburden once and for all and repealing don't ask, don't tell.\n  I wish to voice my strong and unequivocal support for this bill which \neffectively ends the seventeen year policy of treating homosexuals as \ninherently unqualified for military service. It is time we join the \nmajority of our allies in allowing those already serving in our \nmilitary to do so free from discrimination, with integrity and honor.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, over the past few months, we have heard a \nvariety of justifications for why now is not the time to repeal don't \nask, don't tell.\n  Opponents of repeal have said that we should wait for our military \nleaders to call for change. Well, in the past year, the Secretary of \nDefense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff--the two highest-\nranking military leaders in America--have told us now is the time for \nCongress to act.\n  We have been told that we should wait for the results of the Pentagon \nstudy on the effects of ending don't ask, don't tell and \nrecommendations for implementing its repeal. We now have the results of \nthat study. It concludes that the risks associated with overturning \ndon't ask, don't tell are low, with thorough preparation. The repeal \nbill before us provides for just such preparation.\n  A survey included in the Pentagon study shows that a substantial \nmajority of servicemembers--about 70 percent--predict little to no \nnegative effects from allowing gay men and lesbians to openly in our \nmilitary.\n  Rather than listen to our top military leaders and rank and file \nservicemembers, opponents of repeal now want to move the goal posts. \nAfter months of exhaustive study and debate, they now say they want a \nsurvey that asks different questions and to hear from different \nleaders.\n  They say the 103-question survey, 95 forums, and 140 focus groups \nincluded in the Pentagon study were not sufficient to gauge the affects \nof repeal.\n  Enough with the stalling and blocking.\n  The days of don't ask, don't tell are numbered. This discriminatory \npolicy, which is harmful to our Nation's principles and or national \ndefense, will end. The only question is whether Congress will act and \ngive military leaders the time they seek to make an orderly transition, \nor continue to delay and risk that the federal courts will demand a \nmore abrupt change.\n  Congress or the courts. That is the choice.\n  Secretary Gates warned us as much at the release of the Pentagon \nstudy. He said:\n\n       Now that we have completed this review, I strongly urge the \n     Senate to pass this legislation and send it to the president \n     for signature before the end of this year. I believe this is \n     a matter of some urgency because, as we have seen in the past \n     year, the federal courts are increasingly becoming involved \n     in this issue.\n\n  He continued:\n\n       Just a few weeks ago, one lower court ruling forced the \n     department into an abrupt series of changes that were no \n     doubt confusing and distracting to men and women in the \n     ranks. It is only a matter of time before the federal courts \n     are drawn once more into the fray, with the very real \n     possibility that this change would be imposed immediately by \n     judicial fiat--by far the most disruptive and damaging \n     scenario I can imagine, and one of the most hazardous to \n     military morale, readiness and battlefield performance.\n\n  Just this week, another legal challenge was filed in federal court by \nthree former servicemembers discharged under don't ask, don't tell.\n  Their stories illustrate once again the arbitrary and unjust the \nnature of the current policy, and the harm it causes.\n  The plaintiffs are Air Force veterans Michael Almy and Anthony \nLoverde, and Navy veteran Jason Knight. Let me tell you about these \nbrave men.\n  MAJ Michael Almy is the son of a West Point graduate and served 13 \nyears in the Air Force.\n  Major Almy deployed to the Middle East several times in the late \n1990s, helping to enforce the no-fly zones in Iraq. He deployed again \nin 2002 and 2004 to support the invasion of Iraq and its aftermath.\n  Near the end of his 2004 deployment, Major Almy was named the Field \nGrade Officer of the Year. It was also during this deployment that a \nmember of his unit found e-mails Major Almy sent to another man and the \ndischarge process started.\n  Major Almy's superiors and subordinates provided glowing character \nreferences during the discharge.\n  This is what one subordinate said--Major Almy:\n\n     one of the most respected leaders in the squadron thanks to \n     his no nonsense approach to mission accomplishment.\n\n  He added:\n\n       I can say without any reservation that Major Almy was the \n     best supervisor I have ever had . . . It would be an absolute \n     travesty to lose such an outstanding officer and superior \n     leader.\n\n  Even while his discharge was pending, Major Almy's wing commander \nrecommended his promotion to lieutenant colonel--ahead of his peers.\n  None of this was enough to save Major Almy's career. Despite his \nexemplary record, he was discharged for being gay.\n  The second plaintiff, SSG Anthony Loverde, is also a highly decorated \nveteran of Operation Iraqi Freedom. He had the difficult and job of a \nC-130 loadmaster.\n  During his deployment in 2007, Loverde found that he could no longer \npretend to be someone he was not. Upon returning home, he sent his \nsupervisor an email saying he would like to continue to serve, but he \ncould not do so if it also meant continuing to conceal his sexual \norientation. That letter started his discharge.\n  One month after his discharge, Sergeant Loverde received the Air \nMedal for ``superior ability in the presence of perilous conditions.''\n  But that is not the end of Sergeant Loverde's story.\n  Shortly after his discharge, he went to work for a defense contractor \nand headed back to Iraq, this time as an openly gay man. As a defense \ncontractor, he shared quarters with servicemembers--without incident.\n  In a letter last year to the Washington Post, Sergeant Loverde wrote:\n\n       At the same time I was being discharged, my younger \n     brother, who served a 15-month tour in Iraq during 2004-05 \n     with the Army infantry, was stop-lossed to be sent back for \n     another tour of duty. He had a new wife and a young son; he \n     had fulfilled his initial commitment and wanted to leave the \n     Army to continue his career as a civilian. But our country's \n     needs were too great--he was told he had to keep fighting.\n\n  Why, in such a time, would we discharge decorated servicemembers who \nwant to serve our Nation?\n\n[[Page S10660]]\n\n  The third member in this latest court challenge is PO2 Jason Knight.\n  Petty Officer Knight enlisted in the Navy in April 2001 and served 5 \nyears. He spent the first 3 of those years as a member of the elite \nNavy Ceremonial Guard at Arlington National Cemetery. He participated \nin more than 1,500 military funerals.\n  In 2004, Petty Officer Knight realized he was gay. He ended his \nmarriage and informed his commander.\n  He was discharged in April 2005, but because of an error in the \npaperwork, he remained eligible for recall.\n  Sure enough, Petty Officer Knight was recalled in 2006, and deployed \nto Kuwait. During that deployment, he served as an openly gay man and \nreceived high praise from those with whom he served.\n  In 2007, responding to a statement by GEN Peter Pace, then-Chairman \nof the Joint Chiefs of Staff, that he viewed homosexuality as immoral, \nJason Knight wrote a letter to the editor of Stars and Stripes.\n  In his letter, Petty Officer Knight wrote:\n\n       I spent four years in the Navy, buried fallen \n     servicemembers as part of the Ceremonial Guard, served as a \n     Hebrew Linguist in Navy Intelligence, and received awards for \n     exemplary service. However, because I was gay, the Navy \n     discharged me and recouped my $13,000 sign-on bonus. Nine \n     months later, the Navy recalled me to active duty. Did I \n     accept despite everything that happened? Of course I did, and \n     I would do it again. Because I love the Navy and I love my \n     country. And despite [General] Pace's opinion, my shipmates \n     support me.\n\n  For writing those words, Jason Knight was discharged for a second \ntime under don't ask, don't tell.\n  The men and women discharged under don't ask, don't tell are not \nasking to be treated as a special class. Just the opposite--they are \nasking to be treated like everyone else.\n  Some defenders of the status quo claim that things are working fine \nunder don't ask, don't tell. How in the world can anyone say that after \nhearing these stories?\n  At a time when our Nation is fighting two wars, honorable men and \nwomen with proven records of outstanding service are being forced out \nof our military, they are having their careers destroyed, solely \nbecause they are gay. It is time for Congress to act and give our \nmilitary leaders the time they need to bring this flawed policy to a \nresponsible end.\n  We know that some branches and some members of our armed services are \nmore skeptical than others of the ability of America's military to \nadapt to a repeal of don't ask, don't tell.\n  Lack of complete agreement is no reason to delay.\n  We have been here before. In 1948, when President Harry Truman signed \nExecutive Order 9981 calling for an end to segregation in the armed \nforces, he also created a military advisory committee and charged them \nwith examining military rules, procedures, and practices that \ninterfered with equitable treatment of military personnel. It was \ncalled the President's Committee on Equality of Treatment and \nOpportunities in Armed Forces, but it became better known as the Fahy \nCommittee, after its chairman.\n  In March of 1949, the three Service Secretaries testified before the \nFahy Committee. The Secretaries of the Air Force and Navy testified in \nsupport of President Truman's executive order. But Secretary of the \nArmy Kenneth Royall argued in favor of maintaining the status quo, \nsaying that the Army was ``not an instrument of social evolution.''\n  As it turned out, Secretary Royall was wrong. The U.S. military--and \nthe Army in particular--helped lead the way in creating the vibrant, \nintegrated society we know today.\n  America has the best trained, most professional military in the \nhistory of the world. I am confident that our military can and will \nmeet the challenges of ending discrimination based on sexual \norientation, just as they helped lead the way in ending legalized \nracial discrimination in the past.\n  Former Senator Edward Brooke served in this body for 12 years in the \n1960s and 1970s. He was the first African-American elected to the U.S. \nSenate since Reconstruction.\n  He remembers well the injustice of serving in a segregated Army. He \nrecently wrote an impassioned plea for ending don't ask, don't tell. It \nappeared in the Boston Globe. I quoted from it when I spoke on this \ntopic a few days ago. I want to do so again, because what he says bears \nrepeating.\n  Senator Brooke wrote that don't ask, don't tell ``shows disrespect \nboth for the individuals it targets and for the values our military was \ncreated to defend.''\n  He wrote:\n\n       Regardless of its target, prejudice is always the same. It \n     finds novel expressions and capitalizes on new fears. But \n     prejudice is never new and never right. One thing binds all \n     prejudices together: irrational fear. Decades ago, black \n     servicemembers were the objects of this fear. Many thought \n     that integrating black and white soldiers would harm the \n     military and society. Today, we see that segregation itself \n     was the threat to our values.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       We know that laws that elevate one class of people over \n     another run counter to America's ideals. Yet due to ``don't \n     ask, don't tell,'' the very people who sacrifice the most to \n     defend our values are subject to such a law. We owe them far \n     more.\n\n  One month before President Truman's Executive Order, a Gallup poll \nshowed that only one in four American adults supported ending racial \nsegregation in our military.\n  Today, 75 percent of Americans say that gay men and lesbians should \nbe allowed to serve openly.\n  A majority of our servicemembers and our top military leaders say it \nis time to end the discrimination against gay men and lesbians.\n  The time for change has come. The only question is whether we will \nact responsibly and give our military leaders the time they are seeking \nto make this transition. Or will we continue to delay and let the \ncourts set the timetable?\n  America is ready to end don't ask, don't tell. Now it is our turn to \ntake the next step forward and end a policy that offends our national \nprinciples and harms our national security.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on both sides?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona has 10 \nminutes. The Senator from Illinois has 10 minutes 30 seconds.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Well, Mr. President, I would ask, is it true the \nparliamentary situation as it exists right now is that we will be \nvoting on cloture on both what is known as don't ask, don't tell and \nthe DREAM Act?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct. There will \nbe cloture votes on both of those House messages.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Meanwhile, on the Executive Calendar, we have the START \ntreaty?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is correct.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And there are no amendments that are in order on either \nthe DREAM Act or don't ask, don't tell, no amendments are in order?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. My understanding is there is no \nplace for an amendment on either measure at this time.\n  Mr. McCAIN. So here we are, about 6 weeks after an election that \nrepudiated the agenda of the other side, and we are jamming, or trying \nto jam, major issues through the Senate of the United States because \nthey know they cannot get it done beginning next January 5. They cannot \ndo it next January 5. The American people have spoken, and they are \nacting in direct repudiation of the message of the American people. \nThat is why they are jamming this through.\n  My friends, there is a lot of talk about compromise. There is a lot \nof talk about working together. You think what this ``bizarro'' world \nthat the majority leader has been carrying us in, of cloture votes on \nthis, votes on various issues that are on the political agenda of the \nother side--to somehow think that beginning next January 5 we will all \nlove one another and kumbaya? I do not think so. I do not think so.\n  Unfortunately, the majority is using the lameduck session to push an \nagenda, when the fact is lameduck sessions are supposed to be to finish \nup the work of Congress so the new Congress can act on the issues of \nthe day.\n  The American people have spoken in what the President of the United \nStates described as a ``shellacking.'' Everything we are doing is \ncompletely ignoring that message. Maybe it will require another \nelection.\n\n[[Page S10661]]\n\n  So, for example, I filed two amendments I believe are relevant to \nthis bill, important to this major change. Those will not be in order.\n  I have always and consistently stated that I would listen to and \nfully consider the advice of our military and our military leadership. \nOn December 3, the Committee on Armed Services heard from the Chiefs of \nour four military services--the Chiefs of our four military services.\n  General Amos said:\n\n       Based on what I know about the very tough fight in \n     Afghanistan, the almost singular focus of our combat forces \n     as they train up and deploy into theater, the necessary \n     tightly woven culture of those combat forces that we are \n     asking so much of at this time, and, finally, the direct \n     feedback from the survey, my recommendation is that we should \n     not implement repeal at this time.\n\n  Then he talks about:\n\n       Mistakes and inattention or distractions cost Marines' \n     lives.\n\n  Cost marines' lives.\n\n       [M]arines came back--\n\n  After serving in combat--\n\n     and they said, ``Look, anything that's going to break or \n     potentially break that focus and cause any kind of \n     distraction may have an effect on cohesion.'' I don't want to \n     permit that opportunity to happen. And I'll tell you why. If \n     you go up to Bethesda . . . Marines are up there with no \n     legs, none. We've got Marines at Walter Reed with no limbs.\n\n  General Casey said:\n\n       I believe that the implementation of the repeal of Don't \n     Ask, Don't Tell in the near term will, one, add another level \n     of stress to an already stretched force; two, be more \n     difficult in our combat arms units; and, three, be more \n     difficult for the Army than the report suggests.\n\n  General Schwartz basically said the same thing.\n  I have heard from thousands--thousands--of Active-Duty and retired \nmilitary personnel. I have heard from them, and they are saying: \nSenator McCain, it isn't broke, and don't fix it.\n  So all of this talk about how it is a civil rights issue and \nequality, the fact is, the military has the highest recruiting and \nhighest retention than at any other time in its history. So I \nunderstand the other side's argument as to their social, political \nagenda. But to somehow allege that it has harmed our military is not \njustified by the facts.\n  I hope everybody recognizes this debate is not about the broader \nsocial issues that are being discussed in our society, but what is in \nthe best interest of our national security and our military during the \ntime of war.\n  Now, I am aware this vote will probably pass today in a lameduck \nsession, and there will be high-fives all over the liberal bastions of \nAmerica. We will see the talk shows tomorrow--a bunch of people talking \nabout how great it is. Most of them never have served in the military \nor maybe even not even known someone in the military.\n  And, you know, we will repeal it; all over America there will be gold \nstars put up in windows in the rural towns and communities all over \nAmerica that do not partake in the elite schools that bar military \nrecruiters from campus, that do not partake in the salons of Georgetown \nand the other liberal bastions around the country. But there will be \nadditional sacrifice. I hear that from master sergeants. I hear that \nfrom junior officers. I hear that from leaders.\n  So I am confident that with this repeal our military--the best in the \nworld--will salute and do the best they can to carry out the orders of \nthe Commander in Chief. That is the nature--that is the nature--of our \nmilitary, and I could not be more proud of them in the performance that \nthey have given us in Iraq and Afghanistan, and before that other \nconflicts. They will do what is asked of them.\n  But do not think it will not be at great cost. I will never forget \nbeing, just a few weeks ago, at Kandahar. An Army sergeant major, with \nfive tours in Iraq and Afghanistan, in a forward operating base, said: \nSenator McCain, we live together. We sleep together. We eat together. \nUnit cohesion is what makes us succeed.\n  So I hope when we pass this legislation we will understand we are \ndoing great damage, and we could possibly and probably--as the \nCommandant of the Marine Corps said; and I have been told by literally \nthousands of members of the military--harm the battle effectiveness \nwhich is so vital to the survival of our young men and women in the \nmilitary.\n  Mr. President, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, how much time is remaining on this side?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There remains 10\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe Senator from Illinois.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today in support of the DREAM Act \nand in support of the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. I will focus my \nremarks on the DREAM Act, but I want to make it clear to my colleagues, \nyou will not get many chances in the Senate in the course of your \ncareer to face clear votes on the issue of justice. This morning, you \nwill have two--not one but two.\n  The question is whether the Senate will go on record as a Nation \nprepared to stop discrimination based on sexual orientation. It is a \nmonumental question, a question of great moment, and a question we \nshould face squarely.\n  There will be a vote, as well, on whether the Senate will stand by \nthousands of children in America who live in the shadows and dream of \ngreatness. They are children who have been raised in this country. They \nstand in the classrooms and pledge allegiance to our flag. They sing \nour Star Spangled Banner, our national anthem. They believe in their \nheart of hearts this is home. This is the only country they have ever \nknown. All they are asking for is a chance to serve this Nation. That \nis what the DREAM Act is all about.\n  Last night, Senator Bob Menendez, who has been my great ally on this, \nand I stayed late to speak on the Senate floor. I left and went \nupstairs, and there were many of these young people who were here in \nsupport of the DREAM Act, who came by my office and we spent a few \nminutes together. Some of them have ridden on buses for 28 hours from \nAustin, TX, to be here, to sit in this gallery, and to pray that 100 \nSenators will consider the issue of justice and stand up for them.\n  Some have come to the floor today and criticized this as a political \nstunt. I wish to tell my friends, I hope you understand my sincerity on \nthis issue. I have been working on this issue for 10 years. These \npeople have been waiting for more than 10 years. To say we are pushing \nand rushing a vote--for them, it can't come too soon because their \nlives hang in the balance.\n  I would just say this is not a procedural vote. It is not a political \nstunt. We are voting on a bill that has already passed the U.S. House \nof Representatives. If it passes on the floor of the Senate, it will \nbecome the law of the land with the President's signature.\n  I thank those who have brought us to this moment: the President, who \nwas a cosponsor of the DREAM Act when he served in the Senate; \nSecretary of Interior Ken Salazar, who is on the floor today, as a \nformer Member of the Senate. What a great ally you have been, Ken, \nthroughout this entire debate; Secretary of Education Arne Duncan; \nSecretary of Homeland Security, Janet Napolitano; and especially my \nfriend, Senator Richard Lugar of Indiana. What an extraordinarily \ncourageous man he has been to join me in cosponsoring this measure, \nwhich is controversial in some places.\n  What will this bill do? Let me make clear some of the things that \nhave been said on the floor which are not accurate. First, when this \nbill is signed into law, the only people eligible to take advantage are \nthose who have been in the United States for 5 years. Anybody who comes \nafter 2005 cannot be eligible, and those who are eligible have 1 year \nto apply and to pay the $500 fee and then they have 5 years under the \nbill to do one of two things: to serve in our U.S. military and risk \ntheir lives for America or to finish at least 2 years of college.\n  What are the odds they are going to do those things? I will tell my \ncolleagues. Today, about half the Hispanic youth in America don't \nfinish high school. Only 1 out of 20 enters college in this status. So \nthe odds are against them. But that isn't the end of it. There is a \nlong list of things they must do in order to qualify for the DREAM Act, \nincluding background checks on their moral character and criminal \nrecords. If they have been convicted of a felony, they are ineligible; \nif they have been convicted of more than two misdemeanors, ineligible.\n\n[[Page S10662]]\n\n  There have been things said on the floor by the Senator from Alabama \nand others that the Secretary of Homeland Security can waive this \nrequirement. That is not true. It is not true.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a statement by \nthe Department of Homeland Security which makes it eminently clear she \nhas no power, no directive to have any power under the DREAM Act to \nwaive any of these requirements which bar those with criminal records, \nwho violate the law or have a history of terrorism or threat to \nnational security.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               Department of Homeland Security DREAM Act\n\n       MISLEADING CLAIM: The DREAM Act is not limited to children.\n       FACT: The DREAM Act limits applications to persons who were \n     children when they arrived in the United States (under 16) \n     and are under age 30 on the date of enactment.\n       MISLEADING CLAIM: The DREAM Act will be funded on the backs \n     of hardworking, law-abiding Americans.\n       FACT: The DREAM Act is fully paid for by applicants without \n     cost to the Federal Government. It allows for collection of \n     fees to recover ``the full costs of providing adjudication \n     and processing services,'' and requires a total of $2,525 in \n     surcharges paid by applicants during the process designed to \n     ensure that the DREAM Act does not increase direct federal \n     spending. Not only will the DREAM Act cost the government \n     nothing, but it will actually reduce the deficit over the \n     next ten years. Moreover, as conditional nonimmigrants, these \n     individuals are barred from a broad range of federal public \n     benefits as well as federal tax credits to purchase health \n     insurance in the exchange created by the health care reform \n     bill.\n       MISLEADING CLAIM: The DREAM Act provides safe harbor for \n     any alien, including criminals, from being removed or \n     deported if they simply submit an application.\n       FACT: Only individuals who can show that they are prima \n     facie eligible for cancellation of removal and conditional \n     nonimmigrant status are prohibited from being removed. A \n     prima facie showing of eligibility is not a modest or low \n     standard of legal proof and cannot be satisfied by the \n     alien's signature. In immigration law it is a much more \n     stringent determination.\n       Prima facie eligibility determinations are required under \n     the existing provisions governing Temporary Protected Status. \n     USCIS must make a determination that an applicant is prima \n     facie eligible for TPS under section 244(a)(4) of the INA and \n     implementing regulations at 8 C.F.R. 244.5. USCIS checks the \n     applicant's nationality and verifies identity through \n     biometrics checks. The agency also runs fingerprint checks \n     through the FBI and conducts certain background checks in \n     relevant systems to determine whether there is available \n     derogatory criminal or security information that would call \n     into question the applicant's eligibility for TPS, and thus \n     may require further review. If this initial identity check of \n     the applicant and the background and security checks raise no \n     immediate concerns about TPS eligibility, the applicant will \n     be considered ``prima facie'' eligible for TPS and provided \n     certain ``temporary treatment benefits,'' such as an \n     employment and travel authorization.\n       DREAM Act applicants would be required to undergo a similar \n     process to establish prima facie eligibility.\n       MISLEADING CLAIM: Certain inadmissible aliens, including \n     those from high-risk regions, will be eligible for amnesty \n     under the DREAM act.\n       FACT: The DREAM Act is not an amnesty. No one will \n     automatically receive a green card. Rather, the DREAM Act \n     requires a decade-long process for a narrowly tailored group \n     of young persons who were brought to the U.S. years ago as \n     children to resolve their immigration status, thereby \n     allowing America to derive the full benefits of their \n     talents. The editorial board of the Wall Street Journal \n     opined on November 27: ``[W]hat is to be gained by holding \n     otherwise law-abiding young people, who had no say in coming \n     to this country, responsible for the illegal actions of \n     others?''\n       MISLEADING CLAIM: Certain criminal aliens--including drunk \n     drivers--will be eligible for amnesty under the DREAM act.\n       FACT: Any criminal who applies for the DREAM Act will only \n     hasten their deportation. Anyone who has committed a \n     deportable crime and applies for the DREAM Act will have \n     their application denied and will be placed in removal \n     proceedings. In addition, the DREAM Act creates a new \n     criminal offense punishable by imprisonment of 5 years for \n     anyone who commits fraud on a DREAM Act application. \n     Moreover, all applicants must establish that they are persons \n     of good moral character, which is a much higher standard than \n     that required of other immigrants becoming permanent \n     residents.\n       MISLEADING CLAIM: Conservative estimates suggest that at \n     least 1.3 million illegal aliens will be eligible for the \n     DREAM act amnesty. In reality, we have no ide how many \n     illegal aliens will apply.\n       FACT: The non-partisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) \n     estimates, under the DREAM Act, that 700,000 persons would be \n     able to gain conditional non-immigrant status at the end of \n     the 10-year conditional residency period.\n       The CBO and the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) estimates \n     that the bill will reduce deficits by approximately $2.2 \n     billion over the next ten years. But that figure alone \n     underestimates the enormous benefits to taxpayers because the \n     CBO and JCT do not take into account the increased income \n     that DREAM Act participants will earn due to their legal \n     status and educational attainment. It is estimated that the \n     average DREAM Act participant will make $1 million over his \n     or her lifetime simply by obtaining legal status, which will \n     bring hundreds of thousands of additional dollars per \n     individual for federal, state, and local treasuries.\n       America must increase the proportion of persons who \n     graduate from high school and college in order to remain \n     competitive in the global economy. The students who benefit \n     from the DREAM Act will have opportunities to attend college \n     and graduate school not otherwise available to them.\n       MISLEADING CLAIM: The DREAM Act does not require that an \n     illegal alien finish any type of degree (vocational, two-\n     year, or bachelor's degree) as a condition of amnesty.\n       FACT: In order to be eligible for the DREAM Act, a person \n     must already have completed a GED or have earned a high \n     school diploma. In order to satisfy the requirements of the \n     DREAM Act, an applicant must acquire a degree from an \n     institution of higher education in the United States or \n     complete at least two years in good standing, or serve in the \n     Armed Forces for at least 2 years without receiving a \n     dishonorable or other than honorable discharge.\n       MISLEADING CLAIM: Despite their current illegal status, \n     DREAM Act aliens will be given all the rights that legal \n     immigrants receive--including the legal right to sponsor \n     their parents and extended family members for immigration.\n       FACT: DREAM Act individuals will not be able to sponsor \n     family members for permanent residency for more than a \n     decade. For the first 10 years of their conditional status, \n     DREAM participants would have absolutely no ability to \n     sponsor any family members, not even spouses or minor \n     children. Only after they have earned permanent residency--at \n     the end of that 10-year period--would they be able to sponsor \n     their immediate family members, spouses and children. The \n     spouses and children would have to go to the end of the \n     family preference line, like everyone else, a line that can \n     take many years. Only when an eligible DREAM Act individual \n     earns citizenship--after at least 13 years in conditional and \n     permanent resident status--would they be able to begin the \n     process of sponsoring their parents or siblings. But even \n     then, spouses, children, parents, and siblings who entered \n     the U.S. illegally would have to leave the country for at \n     least 10 years before they could reenter legally. DREAM Act \n     participants would NEVER be able to sponsor extended family \n     members, such as grandparents and cousins.\n       MISLEADING CLAIM: The DREAM Act allows the Secretary to \n     waive all grounds of inadmissibility for illegal aliens, \n     including criminals and terrorists.\n       FACT: The DREAM Act expressly limits the Secretary's \n     authority to waive grounds of inadmissibility and \n     deportability. Under this bill, the Secretary may only waive \n     health related grounds; public charge; status-related \n     immigration violations; or violation of previous immigration \n     status. The Secretary cannot waive other grounds of \n     inadmissibility or deportability, including criminal and \n     national security related grounds.\n       Under the structure of the INA, an alien, when being \n     removed from the country, is either subject to grounds of \n     inadmissibility (found at INA section 212) if they have never \n     been legally admitted to the country, or subject to grounds \n     of deportability (found at INA section 237) if the alien was \n     previously lawfully admitted to the country. At the time of \n     adjustment of status or seeking an immigration benefit (such \n     as status under the DREAM Act), an alien is deemed to be an \n     applicant for admission and subject to the grounds of \n     inadmissibility at INA section 212 and would be subject to \n     the waiver authority for section 212 grounds. The Secretary \n     would not have authority to apply a waiver of a ground of \n     deportability (under section 237) when applying for admission \n     (when subject to section 212 grounds).\n       If an individual was previously admitted to the country \n     (i.e.-- a visa overstay), when placed in removal proceedings, \n     the individual would be subject to grounds of deportability \n     at INA section 237 and waiver authority at that time would \n     have to be pursuant to INA section 237. A waiver of INA \n     section 237(a)(1) would not waive other section 237 grounds, \n     which include separate criminal and security grounds. INA \n     section 237(a)(1) does not waive these other grounds of \n     deportability. In other words, the individual would still be \n     subject to the concurrent criminal, security, or other \n     applicable grounds of deportability.\n       MISLEADING CLAIM: The DREAM Act allows applicants to \n     immediately become permanent residents.\n       FACT: The DREAM Act does not allow individuals to become \n     permanent residents immediately. In fact, they must wait many \n     years before receiving green cards. Under section 8 of the \n     DREAM Act, only persons who have been granted conditional \n     nonimmigrant status for at least nine years are\n\n[[Page S10663]]\n\n     eligible to apply become permanent residents. Section 8(c) \n     allows persons to apply for adjustment to permanent residence \n     one year before the 10 year period of conditional \n     nonimmigrant status expires so U.S. Citizenship and \n     Immigration Service has plenty of opportunity to carefully \n     review applications to determine that only those who meet the \n     stringent requirements of the Act are approved.\n       MISLEADING CLAIM: The DREAM Act allows individuals to \n     remain in nonimmigrant status indefinitely.\n       FACT: Conditional nonimmigrant status is not indefinite. It \n     can only be granted for two 5 year periods according to \n     section 7(a) and 7(d) of the bill. At the end of the second 5 \n     year period, individuals can apply for adjustment to \n     permanent residence status. There are no extensions of \n     conditional nonimmigrant status for individuals who do not \n     apply to become permanent residents at the end of the second \n     5 year extension. Let's be clear: Individuals who do not \n     apply for adjustment by the end of the second 5 year period \n     will no longer have legal status in the U.S.\n       Immigration law generally requires an individual to file an \n     application to obtain legal status. The DREAM Act requires \n     three such filings: the first is for the initial 5 year grant \n     of conditional nonimmigrant status; the second is for another \n     5 year extension of conditional nonimmigrant status, and the \n     last is for adjustment of status to permanent residence, \n     starting no earlier than 9 years after the initial grant of \n     conditional nonimmigrant status.\n       MISLEADING CLAIM: The DREAM Act does not require that an \n     illegal alien complete military service as a condition for \n     amnesty, and there is already a legal process in place for \n     illegal aliens to obtain U.S. citizenship through military \n     service.\n       FACT: The DREAM Act has been strongly embraced by the \n     military as an important element in furthering our nation's \n     readiness. The DREAM Act is part of the Department of \n     Defense's 2010-2012 Strategic Plan to assist the military in \n     its recruiting efforts. The DREAM Act streamlines and \n     simplifies the process by which aliens who wish to serve in \n     the Armed Forces may gain permanent status in the United \n     States.\n       MISLEADING CLAIM: Current illegal aliens will get Federal \n     student loans, Federal work study programs, and other forms \n     of Federal financial aid.\n       FACT: DREAM applicants are expressly prohibited from \n     obtaining Pell grants, Federal supplemental educational \n     opportunity grants and other federal grants. DREAM Act \n     beneficiaries would, like all students, be required to pay \n     back any loans they have incurred.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Let me also say I join my colleague from Alabama in \nsadness over the loss of a life of a border guard. It is a terrible \nthing. These men and women are serving our country, and it is a \ntragedy. But can we blame these young people sitting in the galleries \nand across America for that, to question the border security? I am for \nborder security.\n  In July, Senator Schumer came to the floor with Senator McCain and \nadded $600 million more to border security without any objection from \neither side of the aisle. Oh, I suppose if we were playing this game of \nnegotiating, we could have stood and said: No; no more money for border \nsecurity until we get the DREAM Act. We didn't do it because we are as \ndedicated to border security as anyone, and we want to make sure people \nhave the opportunity to vote for border security and to also vote for \nthe DREAM Act.\n  Let me ask, at this point, how much time is remaining.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Five minutes. Thank you.\n  I wish to say a few things about the people who are involved in this. \nThey are faceless and nameless until we bring them to the floor. This \nis Benita Veliz. Benita Veliz has an amazing story which I wish to \nshare with my colleagues. Benita was brought to the United States by \nher parents in 1993, when she was 8 years old. She graduated \nvaledictorian of her class, received a full scholarship to St. Mary's \nUniversity in Texas, majoring in biology and sociology. Her honors \nthesis was on the DREAM Act. She sent me a copy of it.\n  What she has asked for, basically, she says in these words: I was \ncalled to a Cinco de Mayo community celebration and asked to sing the \nnational anthems of the United States and Mexico. I couldn't do it. I \nonly knew the words for the American national anthem. I am an American. \nI want to live my dream. Benita Veliz.\n  Meet this young man, another who would benefit from the DREAM Act. \nHis name is Minchul Suk. This is an amazing story as well. Brought to \nthe United States from South Korea at the age of 9, graduated from high \nschool with a 4.2 GPA, graduated from UCLA with a degree in \nmicrobiology, immunology, and molecular genetics. With the help of the \ncommunity, they raised enough money for him to finish dental school. He \nhas taken his boards, but he cannot become a dentist in America because \nhe is undocumented. Do we need more dentists in America? Yes, we do, \nand we need a man of his quality to serve our Nation.\n  I want you to meet this young man too. His name is David Cho. David \nis a man you might have seen on television. It is kind of an amazing \nstory. David was brought to the United States at the age of 9, \ngraduated with a 3.9 GPA in high school. He is now a senior at UCLA and \nthe leader of the marching band. He wants to serve in the U.S. Air \nForce. I say to my friends who stand on the floor and protest their \ntrue belief that the military means so much to us as Americans, why \nwould you deny these young people a chance to serve in the military? \nThat is all I am asking.\n  The last story I wish to tell is about a young man from New York: \nCesar Vargas. He has an amazing story. He was brought to this country \nat a very young age and when 9/11 occurred, he was so mad at those who \nattacked America he went down to the Marine Corps and said: I want to \nsign up, and they said: You can't; you are undocumented. So he \ncontinued on and is attending the New York University Law School now. \nHe speaks five languages. He has had offers from the biggest law firms, \nfor a lot of money. He turned them down. His dream, under the DREAM \nAct, is to enlist in the Marine Corps and serve in the Judge Advocate \nGeneral Corps.\n  These are the faces of the DREAM Act, and the people who stand before \nus and try to characterize this as something else don't acknowledge the \nobvious. These are young men and women who can make America a better \nplace.\n  I understand this is a difficult vote. It is a difficult vote for \nmany. As a matter of fact, I am not asking for just a vote for the \nDREAM Act today. From some of my colleagues I am asking for much more. \nI am asking for what is, in effect, an act of political courage. Many \nof my colleagues have told me they are lying awake at night tossing and \nturning over this vote because you know how hard it is going to be \npolitically; that some people will try to use it against you. But I \nwould say, if you can summon the courage to vote for the DREAM Act \ntoday, you will join ranks with Senators before you who have come to \nthe floor of this Senate and made history with their courage; who stood \nand said the cause of justice is worth the political risk. I am \nprepared to stand, they said, and vote for civil rights for African \nAmericans, civil rights for women, civil rights for the disabled in \nAmerica. I am prepared to go back home and face whatever comes.\n  Most of them have survived quite well because of their genuineness, \ntheir conviction and their strength and the fact that their courage is \nrecognized and respected, even if someone disagrees with part of their \nvote. That is what we face today. We face the same challenge today. I \nhope my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will summon the courage \nto vote for justice. We don't get many chances. When it comes to \njustice for these young people of the DREAM Act or justice for those of \ndifferent sexual orientation to serve in the military, this is our \nmoment in history to show our courage.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/18/senate-section/article/S10663-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10663-S10665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNITION OF THE REPUBLICAN LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, we will soon be voting on two \nconsequential and contentious matters, the DREAM Act and repeal of the \nlegislation concerning the Defense Department's don't ask, don't tell \npolicy. As our ranking member on one of the two committees of \njurisdiction recently made clear, the Democratic majority in the Senate \nis again depriving the American people of the right to have their \nconcerns addressed through debate on amendments by depriving the \nminority of its right to offer amendments.\n  When Democrats were in the minority, my good friend, the majority \nleader, said: This is a ``very bad practice,''\n\n[[Page S10664]]\n\nand it ``runs against the basic nature of the Senate.'' In fact, he \nsuggested we should not shut off debate ``before any amendments had \nbeen offered.''\n  With back-to-back blockage of amendments on both the DREAM Act and \nlegislation repealing don't ask, don't tell, the current majority has \nset a dubious record by denying the minority its right to amendment a \ntotal of 43 times. Let me say that again. The current majority has set \na dubious record by denying the minority its right to offer amendments \na total of 43 times.\n  To put that in perspective, in his 4 years as the majority leader, \nSenator Frist did this 15 times. The current Senate majority in the \nsame amount of time has done it three times--three times--as often. In \nfact, the current majority has blocked the minority from offering \namendments more often than the last six majority leaders combined. The \ncurrent majority has blocked the minority from offering amendments more \noften than the last six majority leaders combined.\n  The danger of following this practice is underscored by the flawed \nprocess used on the very measures before us now. The DREAM Act the \nSenate will vote on today has never had a Senate hearing. In fact, it \nhas not had any Senate committee action in 7 years. But, of course, \nthis is a House bill, and the legislative record there is more sparse \nstill. The House, similar to the Senate, has never had a legislative \nhearing on the DREAM Act, and it has never had a markup there either. \nNow the Senate majority is preventing their colleagues from addressing \nthe concerns of the American people by shutting off the ability to \noffer any amendments on the floor.\n  So, in sum, there has never been an amendment offered to the DREAM \nAct at either the committee or floor stage in either House of Congress \nsince President Bush's first term.\n  I guess our Democratic colleagues believe this bill is so perfect it \ndoesn't need any amendments whatsoever--just a few last-minute rewrites \nduring a lameduck session. I don't think that is what the American \npeople believe.\n  In regard to the ill-conceived effort to repeal the military policy \non don't ask, don't tell, the majority leader has insisted on pressing \nforward with this effort, despite the fact that the ranking member of \nthe Armed Services Committee has established the need for additional \nhearings. The All-Volunteer Force has had many successes, but has this \nbody become so alienated from the enlisted men and women in uniform \nthat liberal interest groups have more influence over military \npersonnel policy than the senior enlisted leaders of the Army and \nMarine Corps who were denied the opportunity to testify?\n  This repeal will be rushed through, despite the fact that it is \nconcerning to those in Army combat arms units, and 58 percent of those \nin Marine Corps combat units believe repeal will be harmful to unit \nreadiness. Should we ignore the volunteers charged with the most \ndifficult missions in our military, combat with the enemy? I think not.\n  Democrats will deny the opportunity to amend the bill to require the \nservice chiefs to certify that this repeal will not harm combat \nreadiness, although they are responsible for training the force. Why \nwould anyone oppose this change or even the opportunity to vote on this \nchange?\n  This is harmful during a time of war and an irresponsible manner in \nwhich to change policies that the Commandant of the Marine Corps has \nactually stated could risk lives.\n  I am going to recommend to my colleagues to heed the advice of my \nfriend from Nevada, which he gave a few years ago, and not vote to shut \ndown the debate and amendment process for these bills, at least until \nthe minority is allowed to offer, debate, and vote on a limited number \nof amendments, and the Senate is allowed to be the Senate once again.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I will use leader time.\n  I say to the people in the Senate and the American public, to hear my \nfriend, the distinguished Republican leader, talk about our having done \nthings procedurally brings a big yawn to the American people. Everyone \nknows how we have been stymied, stopped, and stunned by the procedural \nroadblocks of this Republican minority. So we are where we are today. \nNo. 1, we are nearing the end of this congressional session. There is a \ncontinuing resolution that has been prepared by Senator Inouye and \nSenator Cochran. It has some things I don't like, but it has been done \nbecause we have to do this, and we will finish that in the immediate \nfuture.\n  I am going to speak just briefly on don't ask, don't tell. But to \nsuggest there haven't been adequate hearings on this is simply \nnonsensical. Senator Levin has held 2 days of hearings in the last 30 \ndays. There have been hearings held, reports done by the military. My \nRepublican friends have said: Well, this is something we probably \nshould do, but why don't we have a study by the military and see what \nthe Pentagon thinks. They did that. More than 70 percent of people who \nhave served in the Armed Forces believe it doesn't matter at all.\n  This is exemplified in a story that appears in the Las Vegas Sun \nnewspaper today, and I will just read two paragraphs from the story:\n\n       The Pentagon's report is done, and it concluded that \n     repealing the law would do little to affect troop readiness. \n     In fact, most of the troops interviewed for the report \n     indicated they didn't think it would be a problem. The \n     majority of them said they had served with someone who they \n     believed to be gay or lesbian and it didn't bother them or \n     affect their units' effectiveness.\n\n  Mr. President, listen to this. For example, the report quotes a \nspecial operations soldier, who said, ``We have a gay guy in the unit. \nHe's big, he's mean, and he kills lots of bad guys. No one cares that \nhe's gay.'' That says it all. As Barry Goldwater said, you don't have \nto be straight to shoot straight.\n  Mr. President, the DREAM Act. I first must say to everybody within \nthe sound of my voice that I came to Washington in 1982 to serve in the \nHouse of Representatives. One of the people who came in that large \nDemocratic class we had was Dick Durbin from Illinois. I have gotten to \nknow him extremely well. He is very good. We all know he has the \nability to express himself extremely well. I have known him for all \nthese 28 years. We have worked very closely together. He is now the \nassistant leader of the Senate. I have never known him to feel so \nstrongly about an issue as he does this DREAM Act. He worked on it for \nmore than a decade. He has shed tears while talking to me about some of \nthe people with whom he visits. We saw the emotion he felt here today. \nI so admire and appreciate him for the work he has done.\n  I am committed to passing the DREAM Act. As we work toward a \ncomprehensive approach to reform our country's broken immigration \npolicy, one thing we can do now is ensure that the next generation can \ncontribute to our economy and to our society.\n  The DREAM Act applies to a very specific group of talented, motivated \nyoung people who already call America home. This is their home. It \napplies only to those who came here at age 15 or younger and have been \nhere at least 5 years. Even then, in order to have a chance at \npermanent legal residency, they would have to graduate from high \nschool, pass strict criminal background checks, and attend college or \nserve in the military for at least 2 years.\n  I have said on this floor before--but I will repeat it--when I first \nbecame aware of the problem we had in our country, I was in Smith \nValley, NV, an agricultural community in the northeastern part of our \nState. I was a relatively new Senator. They had gotten all the students \nthere in a very small high school together. I made a presentation to \nthem. When I finished, I could tell there was a girl who wanted to talk \nto me. She was there; I could see her and feel her presence. I knew she \nwas embarrassed to talk to me, so I said, ``Do you want to talk to \nme?'' And she said, ``Yes.'' She alone said to me:\n\n       Senator, I am the smartest kid in my class. I have the best \n     grades. But I can't go to college. My parents came here \n     illegally. What am I supposed to do with my life?\n\n  At that time, I didn't know that this brilliant, young, beautiful \nwoman of Hispanic origin could not go to college, but she could not. \nThat is what this is all about. I don't know where that young woman is \nnow, whether she has completed college or whether she working in the \nonion and garlic farms up there--I just don't know. I have thought \nabout that many times.\n\n[[Page S10665]]\n\n  When we jeopardize our education, we jeopardize our economy. The \nCongressional Budget Office found that letting these men and women \ncontribute to our society will reduce the deficit by more than $1 \nbillion. A UCLA study found that the DREAM Act would add as much as \n$3.5 trillion to our economy--that is trillion with a ``t.'' That comes \nfrom the University of California at Los Angeles. This bill is not only \nthe right thing to do, it is also a very good investment.\n  The Defense Department also knows it is good for national security. \nThe Pentagon has said it will help it meet the recruitment goals of our \nAll-Volunteer Force. That is why our military made it part of its 2010 \nto 2012 strategic plan. That is in their plan, the Pentagon's plan.\n  Some Republicans are trying to demonize these young men and women, \nwho love this country and want to contribute to it and fight for it. \nThe real faces of the DREAM Act are the dreamers.\n  I was welcomed to Washington on Thursday. There was a beautiful child \nthere with a graduation hat on, a four-cornered hat. She was a dreamer. \nShe wants to be able to go to college. That is all she wants. And we \nhave others who want to be able to join the military.\n  The real faces belong to people such as Astrid Silva, who wrote to me \nfrom Nevada to tell me this--and I have visited her on many occasions:\n\n       I am 22 and have never even stolen a piece of gum from a 7-\n     11; yet, I feel as though my forehead says ``felon.''\n\n  Ricardo Cornejo wrote to me from Las Vegas to tell me that young men \nlike him ``would love to fight and give our entire lives for our \ncountry.''\n  Opponents use the word ``amnesty,'' hoping to trick people into \nthinking this bill is something it is not. They are trying to play to \npeople's worst fears.\n  One Senator said in the presence of one of these dreamers that he \ncould not vote for it because that law said one didn't need to serve. \nAll you need to do is sign up. I say to this U.S. Senator and anyone \nelse suggesting such an absurdity: Read the bill. It takes 2 years of \nservice in the military. It will be longer than 2 years because you \nhave to sign up for more than 2 years. We certainly get our money's \nworth in that regard. The DREAM Act could not be further from amnesty. \nIt is an opportunity that gives nothing for free and demands a great \ndeal of those who earn legal residency. It is not granting citizenship \nimmediately; it puts them on the pathway to citizenship. It gives \nnobody incentives to break the law but to contribute to our Nation and \nits economy.\n  When it passes--Mr. President, I hope it passes, as my friend Senator \nDurbin said today, but it is going to pass--millions of children who \ngrew up in America as Americans will be able to get the education they \nneed to contribute to our economy. Many who have volunteered to defend \nour country will no longer have to fear being deported.\n  Democrats know this is good policy. Republicans know it too. That is \nwhy Senator Orrin Hatch coauthored it 10 years ago, and that is why the \nWall Street Journal's very conservative editorial board called it a \nworthy immigration bill within the last few weeks. The only question is \nwhether we will let good policy inform our votes or let partisan \npolitics get in the way of so many futures--not just of these children \nbut our own.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/18/senate-section/article/S10665-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10665]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin).

Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to discuss \nmy vote today against ending debate on the Dream Act, a bill that would \nprovide legal status to millions of people in this country who are \nillegally present. Before I discuss the substance of the bill, I want \nto express my frustration on the process of how this bill was brought \nto the floor for a vote. This bill has been around for nearly 10 years. \nIn 2003, the Senate Judiciary Committee considered and debated the \nbill, and voted to send it to the full Senate for consideration. It \ndidn't pass at that time, and since then, not one hearing has taken \nplace on the legislation.\n  The bill we considered today was the sixth version of the Dream Act \nthat we have seen in the last 2 months. Five of the six versions were \nintroduced and immediately put on the calendar, bypassing the committee \nprocess. The Judiciary Committee, of which I am a member, didn't have \nthe opportunity to debate it or make it better. Instead, the full \nSenate was asked to consider the bill as written, without the ability \nto amend it. You see, the majority leader used his ability to block all \namendments through a process known as ``filling the tree.'' This \nprocedure means that no amendments could be in order. No improvements \ncould have been made. The democratic process was effectively blocked.\n  Now, allow me to express some concerns that I have had about this \nversion of the bill. The Dream Act would legalize an unlimited number \nof people who are here illegally, including the relatives of the alien \nthat applies. It would put millions of individuals not just young \npeople on a path to citizenship. The bill also leaves the door open to \nmore fraud and abuse of our immigration system. It leaves a lot of \ndiscretion to the Secretary of Homeland Security, including authority \nto waive bars of inadmissibility. This latest version of this \nlegislation provides very few assurances that criminal aliens would be \nbarred from applying. The Dream Act, according to the Congressional \nBudget Office has a $5 billion price tag, and could require hard-\nworking Americans to foot the bill for this amnesty program. The bill \nfails to require individuals to graduate from college or to complete \ntheir military service, even though proponents claim that this is the \nsole mission of the bill. Finally, one of the most alarming provisions \nof the bill allows aliens who apply, no matter how frivolous their \nclaim, to be granted safe harbor from enforcement officials by \nprohibiting the Secretary of Homeland Security from removing an alien \nwho has a pending application.\n  I agree that we should take a hard look at protecting the youth who \nare forced to come here illegally, unaware of the consequences. \nHowever, we also need to be conscious of those people standing in line, \nall around the world, who follow the law and wait their turn to come \nhere legally. This bill just wouldn't be fair to those people.\n  Congress and this administration must come to terms with the \nimmigration problems we have. We need true reform of our immigration \nlaws, starting with border security and enforcement of the laws already \non the books. We need to consider changes to our legal immigration \nsystem, including expanding or improving visa programs, to make sure \npeople are incentivized to come in legally rather than illegally. These \nreforms will make the system better for future generations because a \nshort term amnesty program as proposed by the Dream Act--doesn't solve \nthe underlying problem.\n  I voted against ending debate today because I believe this bill \nrequired serious deliberation. I thought we deserved to have amendments \nconsidered. It is unfortunate that the majority attempted to push this \nbill through at the final hour, circumventing the democratic process \nthat allows for amendments and serious debate on an issue that would \ndramatically undermine our rule of law.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/18/senate-section/article/S10666-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10666-S10667]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SBIR/STTR REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 1999--RESUMED\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Reid motion to concur in the amendment of the House to the \n     amendment of the Senate to the bill.\n       Reid motion to concur in the amendment of the House to the \n     amendment of the Senate to the bill, with Reid amendment No. \n     4827 (to the House amendment to the Senate amendment), to \n     change the enactment date.\n       Reid amendment No. 4828 (to amendment No. 4827), to change \n     the enactment date.\n       Reid motion to refer the message of the House on the bill \n     to the Committee on Armed Services, with instructions, Reid \n     amendment No. 4829, to provide for a study.\n       Reid amendment No. 4830 (to (the instructions) amendment \n     No. 4829), of a perfecting nature.\n       Reid amendment No. 4831 (to amendment No. 4830), of a \n     perfecting nature.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I rise to ask my colleagues on both \nsides of the political aisle to support this cloture motion. The fact \nis that removing a form of legalized discrimination from our books, \nallowing people to serve our military regardless of sexual orientation, \nis not a liberal or conservative idea; it is not a Republican or \nDemocratic idea; it is an American idea consistent with American \nvalues. We have come to a point in our history, I hope, where neither \nrace nor religion, ethnicity nor gender nor sexual orientation should \ndeprive Americans of serving our country as the patriots that they are. \nThis measure would accomplish that result in an orderly way to be \ndetermined by the leaders of our military when they decide that the \nmilitary is ready to implement the change, repeal don't ask, don't \ntell, without negative effect on military effectiveness, unit cohesion, \nand military morale. It is time to right a wrong and put the military \nin line with the best of American values.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Today is a very sad day. The Commandant of the U.S. \nMarine Corps says: When your life hangs on the line, you don't want \nanything distracting. Mistakes and inattention and distractions cost \nmarines' lives.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nresume executive session to consider the following nomination which the \nclerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Albert Diaz, of North Carolina, \nto be United States Circuit Court Judge for the Fourth Circuit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided. The Chair recognizes the Senator \nfrom Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I yield my time to the Senator from North \nCarolina.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I am thrilled that after 11 months on the \nExecutive Calendar, we are finally voting to confirm Judge Albert Diaz \nto the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. I have spoken about Judge \nDiaz's qualifications a number of times here on the floor, so I will \nnot list them again. But let me say that every Senator should feel \ncomfortable voting to confirm this excellent judge to the Federal \nbench. I have no doubt that as the first Hispanic judge on the Fourth \nCircuit, he will serve our Nation with distinction. The senior Senator \nfrom North Carolina, Mr. Burr, also strongly supports Judge Diaz. I \nwish to thank him for his work on this nomination.\n  I wish also to thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee for his \ntireless work to confirm so many desperately needed judges, including \nJudge Diaz. Judge Diaz will make an outstanding addition to the Fourth \nCircuit. I would urge all of my colleagues to support his nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate will finally consider two \njudicial nominations that have been stalled for months on the Executive \nCalendar after being reported unanimously by the Judiciary Committee.\n  The first nomination is Albert Diaz of North Carolina, who was \nnominated in November 2009 to fill a judicial emergency vacancy on the \nFourth Circuit. His Republican home State senator, Senator Burr, asked \nnearly a year ago that the Judiciary Committee ``look for an expedited \nreview and referral to the full Senate so that that deficiency on the \nfourth circuit can be filled.'' We did and the Judiciary Committee \nreported his nomination after unanimous rollcall vote--19 to 0--on \nJanuary 28, nearly 11 months ago. There has been no explanation for the \nlengthy delays preventing final consideration of his nomination.\n  Judge Albert Diaz is a respected and experienced North Carolina \njurist who served in the Armed Forces.\n  He has the support of both his home State Senators, Senator Hagan and \nSenator Burr. The ABA Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated \nhim unanimously ``well qualified'', and the North Carolina Bar \nAssociation has urged us to confirm him. When he is confirmed today, \nJudge Diaz will be the first Latino to sit on the Fourth Circuit. I \ncongratulate Judge Diaz and his family on his confirmation.\n  In addition to Judge Diaz, there are six more superbly qualified \nconsensus circuit court nominees ready for consideration by the Senate, \nfour of them for judicial emergency vacancies. Five of these were \nreported unanimously, and another was reported with the support of 17 \nof the 19 Senators on the Judiciary Committee. I predict all six would \nbe confirmed with strong bipartisan support, and I hope all six can get \nup-or-down votes before the Senate adjourns.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. BURR. Mr. President, I join my colleague from North Carolina in \npraising the nomination of Judge Albert Diaz, and urge my colleagues to \napprove this nomination. The Fourth Circuit has suffered for some time \nunder partisan politics. Good nominees have fallen by the wayside, and \nthat time needs to stop.\n  Judge Diaz is immensely qualified for this position and will serve \nwell on the court. He has proven himself already by earning a \nreputation as a fair and impartial judge, and also for dedicated public \nservice in the Marines and his community.\n  After the treatment of some of the nominees for the Fourth Circuit \nand what they were subjected to, I am impressed that we still have high \ncaliber nominees such as Judge Albert Diaz who would step forward to go \nthrough the nomination process.\n  It is a proud day that Judge Diaz is getting the vote that so many \nnever did. I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this nomination and \nget this good man on the Fourth Circuit.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Leahy.) All time has expired.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Albert Diaz to be U.S. Circuit Judge for the Fourth Circuit?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/18/senate-section/article/S10667-2", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10667-S10668]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nNOMINATION OF ELLEN LIPTON HOLLANDER TO BE UNITED STATES DISTRICT JUDGE \n                      FOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND\n\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On pages S10667, December 18, 2010, the Record reads: . . . for \nthe Eastern District of Maryland.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . for the \nDistrict of Maryland.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will be 2 \nminutes of debate on the Hollander nomination.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I am pleased to rise today in support of \nthe confirmation of two judicial confirmations pending before the \nSenate from my home State of Maryland. Both James Bredar and Ellen \nHollander have been nominated by the President to be U.S. district \njudges for the District of Maryland.\n  I was pleased to work with our senior Senator, Ms. Mikulski, to \nrecommend these nominations to the President last year. I chaired their \nconfirmation hearing in May of this year before the Judiciary \nCommittee, on which I serve. These two judges were approved by a voice \nvote in the Judiciary Committee in June.\n  Judge Ellen Hollander currently serves as a judge on the Maryland \nCourt of Special Appeals, Maryland's second highest court, which hears \nmandatory appeals from our State trial courts in Maryland.\n  She has served as a judge on that court since 1994. Judge Hollander \ncomes to the Senate with an impressive amount of experience in Federal \nand State court. She served as a Federal prosecutor in Maryland for 4 \nyears, served as a State circuit court judge in Baltimore City for 5 \nyears, and has served as a State appellate court judge for 16 years. As \na State trial court judge, she heard thousands of criminal and civil \ncases--hundreds of which went to verdict or final judgment--and handled \nboth jury trials and bench trials. As an appellate judge, she has \nauthored over 1,000 opinions.\n\n[[Page S10668]]\n\n  The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal \nJudiciary evaluated Judge Hollander's nomination and rated her \nunanimously ``well qualified,'' the highest possible rating.\n  Judge Hollander, really exemplifies the spirit of public service. She \nis well known by lawyers and jurors alike in Maryland for her \nmeticulous reasoning process and well-crafted legal opinions. She \nreally is a model of a fair and impartial judge who will dispense equal \njustice under the law. I know Judge Hollander has also supported \nefforts to reduce recidivism and is a strong supporter of our drug \ntreatment courts and juvenile diversion programs.\n  Judge Jim Bredar also comes to the Senate with a wide range of \ncourtroom and litigation experience. He served as a Federal prosecutor \nin Colorado for 4 years before coming to Maryland and serving as a \nFederal public defender for 6 years. Since 1998, he has served as a \nU.S. magistrate judge for U.S. District Court for the District of \nMaryland, where he works closely with our judges of the U.S. District \nCourt for the District of Maryland. He conducts preliminary proceedings \nin felony cases, all proceedings in petty offense cases, and all \nproceedings in misdemeanor and civil matters upon the consent of the \nparties. Judge Bredar has conducted over 700 mediation and settlement \nconferences in civil cases.\n  Judge Bredar has been a member of the Maryland Bar since 1995. The \nAmerican Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nevaluated Judge Bredar's nomination and rated him unanimously ``well \nqualified,'' the highest possible rating.\n  With Judge Bredar, I see a nominee who is genuinely concerned about \nbroadening the access to justice of Americans to their courts. He \nbelieves that we can do better with both our criminal and civil justice \nsystems. I know of Judge's Bredar work as a mediator in our Federal \ncourt's alternative dispute resolution program, which has received high \npraise from Maryland lawyers and litigants alike.\n  The people of Maryland will be well served by having Judge Bredar and \nJudge Hollander on the Federal bench in Baltimore. I look forward to \nthe Senate confirming these two outstanding nominations.\n  We are extremely pleased that we are now getting a chance to vote on \nthe confirmation of Judge Hollander to the Maryland District Court. \nSenator Mikulski has taken the leadership in bringing forward the \nnominations that we strongly support, the two of us.\n  I would yield the time to the senior Senator from Maryland.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, it is with great pleasure that Senator \nCardin and I bring to the Senate Judge Ellen Hollander, an outstanding \nwoman who is currently a member of the Maryland Court of Special \nAppeals; has been deemed qualified, very qualified by the Maryland Bar, \nand every specialized bar in the State of Maryland.\n  She brings a sense of judicial temperament, great judicial \ncompetence, and a commitment to impartial justice. She will be a great \naddition to the Federal bench in Maryland and to the Federal bench of \nthe United States. She does not live in an ivory tower. Her work on \nboards and commissions in the nonprofit areas shows a keen involvement \nin civic affairs. I urge that we adopt the nomination of Judge \nHollander. I would hope that we could do it by voice.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, we will now finally have a vote on the \nnomination of Ellen L. Hollander to serve on the U.S. District Court \nfor the District of Maryland. Her nomination has been pending on the \nSenate's Executive Calendar since the Judicial Committee reported it \nunanimously on June 10, more than 6 months ago. Judge Hollander, a \nwell-respected Maryland State judge for the last 16 years, was \nunanimously rated ``well qualified'' by the ABA Standing Committee on \nthe Federal Judiciary and has the strong support of both of her home \nState Senators, Senator Mikulski and Senator Cardin.\n  After the confirmations today, 30 Federal circuit and district court \nnominations favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee remain ready \nfor final vote. These include 21 nominations reported unanimously and \nanother 3 reported with strong bipartisan support and only a small \nnumber of ``no'' votes. These 24 nominations should have been confirmed \nwithin days of being reported.\n  In addition, 17 nominations ready for action on the Senate calendar \nare to fill judicial emergency vacancies. With judicial vacancies at \nhistoric highs, we should act on these nominations. We should do as we \ndid during President Bush's first 2 years in office, when the Senate \nwith a Democratic majority had up-or-down votes on all 100 judicial \nnominations favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee. That \nincluded controversial circuit court nominations reported during the \nlameduck session in 2002. In contrast, during this first Congress of \nPresident Obama's administration, the Senate has considered just 49 of \nthe 80 nominations reported by the Judiciary Committee.\n  I congratulate Judge Hollander and her family on her confirmation \ntoday.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the nomination.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Ellen Lipton Hollander, of \nMaryland, to be United States District Judge for the District of \nMaryland.\n\n\n =========================== NOTE =========================== \n\n  \n  On pages 10668, December 18, 2010, the Record reads: . . . for \nthe Eastern District of Maryland.\n  \n  The online Record has been corrected to read: . . . for the \nDistrict of Maryland.\n\n\n ========================= END NOTE ========================= \n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is, Will the Senate advise and \nconsent to the nomination of Ellen Lipton Hollander, of Maryland, to be \nU.S. District Court Judge for the District of Maryland.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested.\n  Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, all consent agreements that I have been \ninvolved\n\n[[Page S10669]]\n\nin over the years have been imperfect, but this is the best we could \ndo. I think it is a pretty good one.\n  I ask unanimous consent that at 3 p.m. today all postcloture time be \nconsidered expired and the Reid motion to concur with amendments be \nwithdrawn; that no further amendments or motions be in order, and \nwithout further intervening action or debate the Senate proceed to vote \non the Reid motion to concur in the House amendment to the Senate \namendment on H.R. 2965; that upon disposition of the House message, the \nSenate then resume executive session and the START treaty and there be \n4 minutes of debate prior to a vote in relation to the McCain \namendment, No. 4814, with the time equally divided and controlled \nbetween Senators Kerry and McCain or their designees; that upon \ndisposition of the McCain amendment, Senator Risch be recognized to \noffer an amendment, with any debate time prior to disposition of the \nHouse message with respect to H.R. 2965 equally divided and controlled \nbetween the leaders or their designees.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nobject, 4 minutes is not adequate for my amendment. There are a couple \nof speakers, including the cosponsor, Senator Barrasso.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I say through the Chair to my friend, the \nSenator from Arizona, I agree. So tell me what time you think would be \nappropriate. It does not matter.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I join in this colloquy?\n  I do not think there needs to be any reference to time for debate. If \nI could just make a brief statement, I think the purpose for this \nunanimous consent agreement was to allow Members, by unanimous consent, \nto speak as in morning business on the don't ask, don't tell bill prior \nto a vote on that at----\n  Mr. REID. At 3 o'clock.\n  Mr. KYL. At 3 o'clock, but that we would be on the treaty, and if \npeople did not want to talk about the don't ask, don't tell, then we \nwould be on the McCain-Barrasso amendment, and that debate would \nconclude before 3 o'clock, and then the vote on the McCain-Barrasso \namendment would follow the vote on the don't ask, don't tell.\n  Mr. REID. I think that is totally appropriate. I would just add and \nsay to my friend while the Chair is considering the consent request, \none of the reasons we were able to get this agreement is we have worked \npretty hard in the last few days, and people felt we should have the \nafternoon off after we finish this information. As far as I am \nconcerned, I will be in my office. If people want more time, that is \nfine. But that was one of the conditions that some people wanted on \nyour side, and that is fine with me.\n  We will come in about midday tomorrow to resume consideration of the \nSTART treaty.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, and I will \nnot.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, so I now understand that we now have a \nrevised request, which is that between now and the hour of 3 o'clock, \nthere will be an opportunity for Senators to speak either on the \namendment or on don't ask, don't tell, and following the vote at 3 \no'clock on don't ask, don't tell, there would then be a vote on the \nMcCain amendment. Is that correct? I agree with that.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Is that agreeable to the manager?\n  Mr. KERRY. I think that makes sense.\n  Mr. REID. I would ask, Mr. President, that the request be modified to \nthe effect here as has been indicated.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered. The request is agreed to.\n  The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor today--and before I speak, I ask \nunanimous consent that Senator Boxer of California be the next \nDemocratic Senator speaking after I conclude and Senator Hutchison has \nconcluded on the Republican side.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I reserve the right to object. What is the \npending business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The pending business is the motion to concur \non H.R. 2965. That is the pending business. As I understand the request \nfrom the Senator from Washington, on the Democratic side Senator Boxer \nwill be the next Democrat recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Following the Republican speaker.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Maybe I am wrong, but I thought the time would be either \non the don't ask, don't tell or the START treaty.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. That is correct. The Senator is correct. I am merely \nasking for----\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The time will be equally divided between now \nand 3 o'clock, and the Senators may speak on either subject.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Mr. President, I come to the floor this afternoon to speak and join \nin the effort to repeal don't ask, don't tell.\n  This policy has failed in its intended goals. It has done a \ntremendous disservice to the men and women who want nothing more than \nto defend our country, and it is time for this policy to go. I want to \nbegin this afternoon by talking about a true hero from my home State of \nWashington named Margaret Witt.\n  She joined the Air Force in 1987 and served honorably for 18 years as \na flight nurse--rising to the rank of major. She was described in \nreviews and by her peers as being an exemplary officer, an effective \nleader, and a skilled and caring nurse.\n  But in 2004 her superiors discovered she was a lesbian and, acting \nunder don't ask, don't tell policy they suspended and ultimately \ndischarged her. Margaret lost the job she had given her life to, and \nour country lost a talented and committed flight nurse.\n  She did not give up. She went to court. She called witnesses. She \nmade her case. In September of this year, U.S. District Judge Ronald \nLeighton ruled that she must be reinstated. Judge Leighton said the \ngovernment gave no compelling reason for dismissing Major Witt, and \nthat the application of don't ask, don't tell was not shown to further \nthe government's interest in promoting military readiness.\n  That was the right decision, and it was amazing news for Major Witt. \nShe is now working with disabled veterans in Spokane, WA, but she says \nshe is excited to get back in the air and back to helping the troops \nwho need her.\n  Major Witt is a true hero. Her commitment to our country should be \nrecognized and honored. But she should never have been put in this \nposition. She has the skills, the experience, and the commitment to do \nher job. The fact that she is a lesbian does not change that one bit.\n  There are so many reasons to repeal don't ask, don't tell and to do \nit now. This policy destroys lives. We have all heard stories like \nMargaret's. There are thousands like it, and for every one we hear \nthere are so many more who suffer silently, whose lives and livelihoods \nare devastated--not because of something they did but because of who \nthey are: men and women who are kicked out of the military or who are \nforced to lie to everyone they work with, who go to sleep petrified \nthey will be found out about and discharged, and who wake up dreading \nanother day of mandated deceit and dishonesty.\n  It is wrong. It needs to end.\n  Don't ask, don't tell is depriving our armed services of talented men \nand women at a time when we need our best on the front lines defending \nAmerica. We are fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and we cannot \nafford to lose critical assets simply because they are gay.\n  Finally, we also know that repealing don't ask, don't tell will not \nhave an adverse impact on the military. We have heard from military \nleaders who support this repeal. The Pentagon recently came out with \ntheir report that showed that repealing this policy would not inhibit \ntheir ability to carry out the missions they are charged with.\n\n[[Page S10670]]\n\n  In fact, that report said 70 percent of servicemembers believe repeal \nwould have little to no effect on their units.\n  Repealing don't ask, don't tell is the right thing to do. It is right \nfor our country. It is right for our military. It is right for Major \nWitt and thousands like her. It is right for people like Rebekah. She \nis a young woman from Spokane in my home State. She wrote me a letter a \ncouple of months ago and told me she is a senior at Eastern Washington \nUniversity, and her dream for years has been to join the U.S. Army. She \nwrote to me and said:\n\n       I believe the military is an honorable calling. One of \n     self-sacrifice and dedication--and I would be proud to call \n     myself a soldier.\n\n  But there was a problem. Rebekah told me the very sense of honor that \ncalled her to serve her country was preventing her from acting on her \ndream because she told me she is a lesbian. She is very proud of who \nshe is. As long as the official policy of the United States Army is to \nask her to bury that pride, to tell her to keep secret a large part of \nwho she is, and to ask her to live what would essentially be a lie, she \nsimply will not be able to serve our country.\n  Rebekah told me that nothing would make her happier than to be able \nto graduate this coming spring and start her journey standing up for \nour Nation. She does not want to feel that she should be ashamed of who \nshe is, and she should not have to.\n  We need to repeal don't ask, don't tell so young women like Rebekah \nwill not stop dreaming of growing up to serve our country, and so that \nevery man and woman in our Armed Forces can serve their country openly \nand with pride. We have heard the stories of the lives this policy has \nruined. We have heard from top-ranking military officials that it \nsimply does not work. We have heard from servicemembers that they, too, \nwant it to change. Today, this afternoon, with this historic vote, this \ncountry will move a step forward in being proud of every man and woman \nwho serves their country.\n\n  For far too long, men and women with courage and commitment to serve \nour Nation have been asked to hide the truth about who they are. It is \nshameful. It is a bad policy. Today, it will end.\n  I look forward to the vote this afternoon and the courage of this \nSenate to stand up and do the right thing today.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n\n\n                            New START Treaty\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about the START \ntreaty. We have been debating the START treaty off and on throughout \nthe last few days, and there will be an amendment voted on for the \nresolution after the 3 o'clock vote on don't ask, don't tell.\n  I wish to talk about the amendment and the treaty itself. This \nhistoric treaty is seeking, of course, to limit the strategic long-\nrange nuclear weapons that are currently in U.S. and Russian inventory \nfor a total of 1,550 warheads for each country. While these limits \nrequire some reductions in the number of delivery vehicles and deployed \nwarheads both countries possess, a change in the counting of warheads \nwill allow both countries to cut hundreds of them on paper with no \nactual reductions. For example, under START I, each deployed delivery \nvehicle was counted as carrying a specified number of warheads \nregardless of how many warheads were actually equipped on the missile \nor bomber. New START abandons these rules, instead only counting the \nnumber of warheads actually equipped on deployed missiles. In addition, \nstrategic bombers each count as one warhead regardless of how many \nwarheads they are actually carrying.\n  I also have reservations because of how New START limits our ability \nto conduct extensive and robust verification activities to ensure \ncompliance with the treaty. The ability to adequately and thoroughly \nverify the enforcement of the treaty is crucial for two reasons--not \nonly to ensure that both parties are holding up their end of the \nbargain but also as it relates to possibly one party losing control of \nmissiles they are not accounting for. It is said in many quarters that \nsome of the deteriorating nuclear materials in Russia have somehow \ngotten through to rogue nations such as North Korea or Iran. So it is \nvery important to have a verification system that keeps count.\n  I am concerned about the ability to conduct onsite inspections \nbecause it has been reduced in this agreement. Under START I, the \nUnited States conducted more than 600 inspections over the course of 15 \nyears. In New START, that number has been substantially reduced to only \n180 inspections over the course of 10 years.\n  There are only two basic types of inspections in New START. Type one \ninspections focus on sites with deployed and nondeployed strategic \nsystems. Type two focuses on sites with only nondeployed strategic \nsystems. Each side is allowed to conduct 10 type one inspections and 8 \ntype two inspections annually. Under the previous START treaty, there \nwere 12 types of onsite inspections as well as continuous onsite \nmonitoring activities at a certain facility. Even though, as has been \nmentioned on this floor in the debate, there are fewer facilities, this \nis a pretty drastic reduction in the ability to actually have the \nonsite investigations. Because weapons inspectors will only have 10 \nopportunities per year to inspect just 2 to 3 percent of Russia's \nforce, we will be more reliant than in previous agreements on the full \ncooperation of Russia.\n  I really don't know how we could have reached an agreement to \nsubstantially reduce our most effective method of enforcement. In fact, \na recent State Department report issued by the Obama administration \nsaid:\n\n       Notwithstanding the overall success of START I \n     implementation, a significant number of long-standing \n     compliance issues that have been raised in the START I \n     treaty's Joint Compliance and Inspection Commission remain \n     unresolved.\n\n  Defense. I am also concerned that proposals under the New START \ntreaty may restrict U.S. missile defense capabilities, which could \nthreaten our national security. Of all of the concerns that have been \nraised, I think this is the most important. It also is part of the \namendment we are going to consider this afternoon.\n  Russia and the United States each issued unilateral statements when \nthey signed New START that clarified their position on the relationship \nbetween START and missile defenses.\n  The official Russian statement said:\n\n       The treaty can operate and be viable only if the United \n     States refrains from developing its missile defense \n     capabilities quantitatively or qualitatively.\n\n  Contrary to claims by the Obama administration that missile defense \nwill not be negatively impacted, a review of the text of the treaty \nshows otherwise. The most obvious limitation on missile defense is \nfound in article V, paragraph 3 of the treaty. It says this prevents \nconverting existing intercontinental ballistic missiles, ICBMs, and \nsubmarine-launched ballistic missiles, SLBMs, into launchers for \nmissile defense interceptors.\n  The administration says: Well, it is more expensive to actually \nconvert than to create new ones.\n  Well, we need to have flexibility. Whether we convert or whether we \ncreate new ones should not be a limitation on the United States. U.S. \nplanning and force requirements might have to change in the future to \nrespond to evolving world threats during New START's tenure. It is \nimportant that our Nation be able to adjust our military defense \nsystems if needed. We are not just talking about Russia now. We are \ntalking about adjusting our missile defense capabilities against any \nother country in the world, including rogue nations we believe have \nnuclear capabilities. We are not sure how far developed they are, but \nwe know North Korea is trying to have a ballistic missile with a \nnuclear warhead. We know Iran is too. We know Pakistan has them, and \nthough Pakistan is an ally, it is a fragile government at this point.\n  Why would we in any way link our own missile defense capabilities \nwith the evolving threats out there, regardless of the present good \nterms we have with Russia? Why would we do that? That is a unilateral \ncapability that our country must insist we keep for our sovereign \nNation.\n  The McCain amendment would take out of the preamble to this treaty:\n\n       Recognizing the existence of the interrelationship between \n     strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms, that \n     this interrelationship will become more important as \n     strategic nuclear arms are reduced, and that current \n     strategic defensive arms do not undermine the viability and \n     effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the Parties.\n\n\n[[Page S10671]]\n\n\n  We want to take that out. It is absolutely essential that we take \nthis out of the preamble.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to be added as a cosponsor of \nthe McCain amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, we need to ensure that our defenses \nare not in any way inhibited by this treaty because we must defend \nagainst countries that perhaps are not enemies of Russia, but they \nmight be ours. And to in any way restrict our defenses is not necessary \nto ensure that we have mutual offensive lowering of numbers.\n  So I am very concerned about this particular segment. If we can adopt \nthe McCain amendment, of which I am a cosponsor, it would take me a \nsignificant way toward believing this treaty would be worthy of \nratification.\n  I am seriously concerned that although it is clear that a number of \nrestrictions will be placed on the United States under this treaty, the \nsame is not necessarily true for our partner to the treaty--Russia.\n  Dr. Keith Payne, a former Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for \nForces Policy, has noted that New START's limitations are of little \nreal consequence for Russia because Russia's aged Cold War strategic \nlaunchers already have been reduced below New START ceilings. \nAdditionally, many defense analysts predict Russia will have fewer than \n1,500 nuclear warheads by 2012.\n  Russian defense expert Mikhail Barabonov bluntly makes the same \npoint. He says:\n\n       The truth is, Russia's nuclear arsenal is already at or \n     even below the new ceilings.\n\n  Already at or even below the new ceilings.\n\n       At the time of the signing of the treaty, Russia had a \n     total of just 640 strategic delivery vehicles--only 571 of \n     them deployed . . . It therefore becomes evident that Russia \n     needs no actual reductions to comply. If anything, it may \n     need to bring some of its numbers up to the new limits, not \n     down.\n\n  That brings me to the second major point that concerns me about the \ntreaty; that is, the modernization capabilities for our warheads that \nare part of our arsenal. We can do something about this outside the \ntreaty and still go forward with the ratification, but so far we have \nnot had the assurances that would allow us to know our modernization \ncould be done.\n  According to the 2010 Nuclear Posture Review, today's nuclear weapons \nhave aged well beyond their originally planned life, and the nuclear \ncomplex has fallen into neglect. It has been 18 years since our arsenal \nhas been tested.\n  I share the concerns of my colleague, Senator Kyl, who has been a \nleader on this issue. We must ensure--and we can do it in a separate, \nsigned ratification resolution--that the United States has a strong \nplan that provides for a nuclear modernization program that ensures \nthat if we did need to deploy because a rogue nation that is not part \nof any treaties or is a part of a treaty but isn't going to comply--we \nneed to ensure our deterrent is real. Our deterrent will be real if our \nwarheads are assured of still being capable of being a deterrent, being \ndeployed, being used in the very worst case circumstances.\n  As President Reagan said, trust, but verify when you are making \ntreaties with other countries, especially this treaty that is going to \nhave such consequences as one that might lower our capability to defend \nour country from a nuclear missile, a warhead on a missile that could \nbe delivered to our country by a rogue nation.\n  This has nothing to do with Russia. We don't expect them to launch a \nmissile against the United States, that is for sure. But we do know \nthat there are other nations that are enemies of the United States, \nthat are trying to get, and possibly have, nuclear warheads and the \ncapability to deliver them.\n  So we need to assure, first and foremost, two things: that our \nnuclear capabilities are viable, which means we need a modernization \nprogram that we can be assured has an arsenal that can work; No. 2, we \nneed to make sure our ability to maintain missile defense is not \nnegatively impacted by this treaty. There is no reason to connect it to \na treaty that is going to limit offenses. As long as our missiles are \ncapable of being deployed, that is leverage we must have. But we \ncertainly have no reason to lower our capability to defend our country \nunilaterally, which I cannot imagine that any administration--and \ncertainly not the Senate--would sign or ratify a treaty that might take \naway our capability to defend our country. I would hate for it to be on \nour watch that we lowered the defenses of the United States, because we \nare being rushed into ratifying a treaty without the full capability to \namend it, or that we don't make sure in every detail, as Senator Kyl \nhas said so many times, that we have preserved our capabilities to \ndefend our country against any enemy; and secondly, that we have the \ncapability to go on offense so that any country that might decide to \nsend a nuclear warhead into our territory, or into anyplace where our \ntroops are on the ground fighting for freedom, that that country or \nthat group of rogue nations would know we could respond because our \narsenal of weapons is viable.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the next two \nDemocrats on the list be Senator Leahy, followed by Senator Shaheen.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to respond to the comments of my \nfriend from Texas, who was very passionate in her remarks, by saying it \ninterested me that she raised the name of President Ronald Reagan, \nbecause a lot of major players in his administration support this \ntreaty--George Shultz, for one, and also James Baker. In addition, the \ncurrent Director of National Intelligence, who is responsible for \nverification, supports this treaty. And LTG Patrick O'Reilly, head of \nthe U.S. Missile Defense Agency, says that the New START treaty \nactually reduces constraints on the development of missile defense.\n  I think her comments were very articulate, but they are not correct, \nbecause, again, I will place into the Record the many leaders from \nformer Republican administrations who are pressing us hard to get this \ntreaty done. As a matter of fact, we haven't had boots on the ground to \nverify what the Russians are doing for a long time now. This treaty \nwill make sure we can verify. But whether it is Defense Secretary \nRobert Gates, or Patrick O'Reilly, as I said, head of the U.S. Missile \nDefense Agency, or the Director of National Intelligence--you also have \nformer Secretary of Defense James Schlesinger saying he doesn't believe \nthis inhibits missile defense. You have the former Secretary of Defense \nunder President Clinton, William Perry, being very strong on this, \nalong with Secretary of State Henry Kissinger, and so on. In the \nWashington Post, Henry Kissinger, George Shultz, James Baker, Lawrence \nEagleburger, and Colin Powell made the following statement. ``New START \npreserves our ability to deploy effective missile defenses.'' The \ntestimonies of our military commanders and civilian leaders make it \nclear that the treaty does not limit U.S. missile defense plans.\n  I think the biggest danger to our country is not acting on this. If \nwe don't act, it is a danger to the national security of this Nation. I \nam very pleased to see the incredible bipartisan support outside of \nthis Chamber and, I hope, inside this Chamber. I am very hopeful. But \nwe will find out in the coming days.\n  I want to also talk about the two very critical votes we cast here \nmoments ago, which are so important to large segments of our \ncommunities. The DREAM Act, which would give a path of legality to \nstudents who are outstanding in their communities and who want to join \nthe military, or go to college, is an important bill. Because of the \nfilibuster we needed 60 votes. We got 55 votes--a majority--but the \nRepublican filibuster stopped us from passing it.\n  Today the dreams of young, talented students who grew up in America \nwere crushed because of a filibuster. We have to make it clear to the \npeople who follow this that the Republicans stopped us from passing the \nDREAM Act, even though we had a few of them join us. I say thank you to \nthose on the other side. We got 55 votes. We had 90 percent of \nDemocrats voting for it and less than 10 percent of Republicans--90 \npercent of Republicans voted against it. Today, dreams were crushed.\n\n[[Page S10672]]\n\n  I believe in America. My mother was born in a foreign land and, by \nthe grace of God, she was naturalized, and she kissed the ground of \nthis country. I often think to myself, what if she had a foul-up in her \npapers somehow, what would have happened to me? Would I be a different \nperson? No, I would be the same human being. America would be my \ncountry.\n  The reason I am so passionate on this is these are young people who \nwould make our country stronger. As a matter of fact, our military says \nthe DREAM Act is a recruiter's dream, because we get the best and the \nbrightest to sign up for the military. In my State, where I am so proud \nof our incredible diversity, we have a group of young people who are \nready to go to college there, start their own businesses there, get \njobs there, form their families there, work in their communities. They \nalready are.\n  I have shown on the floor of the Senate many times individuals who \nwere caught in this limbo state. A lot of them are presidents of their \nstudent bodies, A students, leaders in their communities. Studies show \nthat if the DREAM Act passes, the gross domestic product of our Nation \nwill increase. There is a very good study, a recent study by USC, the \nUniversity of Southern California, that is very clear on the point.\n  It seems to me what we did today by failing to end the filibuster, \neven though we had a strong majority vote, we hurt our country. Why did \nwe hurt our country? Because our children are our future. These are \nvery bright young people, who are very motivated. They would be the \nonly ones to benefit from the DREAM Act.\n  I am here today with a message: I will never give up until we pass \nthe DREAM Act.\n  On the good side today, from my perspective, we made some history. We \ndid break a filibuster--a Republican filibuster--on the issue of ending \ndiscrimination in the military against gays and lesbians. We voted to \nend that filibuster and take up the issue of the repeal of don't ask, \ndon't tell. I do believe, in a few hours, that policy will be gone.\n  There are moments in history that come to us, and for me to be here \nat this time--and I know I speak for a lot of colleagues--and cast a \nright for civil rights, cast a vote for justice, cast a vote for \nequality, and to cast a vote against discrimination is a high honor.\n  I have to say as a point of personal privilege, I was here when that \npolicy went into effect. It was 1993 and I was a new Member of the \nSenate. I thought this was the wrong policy at that time. So I said to \nmy staff: Can't we do something and stop this? We decided the best way \nto try to stop it was to say let's not codify this policy. Let's not \nput it into law. Let's have an amendment that says it is up to the \nexecutive branch. That way, the executive branch could repeal it if it \ndidn't work, and it would be easier.\n  It is interesting because our thoughts were right on target, because \nour President does not support don't ask, don't tell, and he would, in \na heartbeat, of course, remove it as a policy through Executive order. \nBut because we had voted it into law, we had to act.\n  I decided to go back to the speech I made on that day, September 9, \n1993, and take a look at some of the things I said about don't ask, \ndon't tell. First, I said, on the question of codification--that is, \nputting don't ask, don't tell into law:\n\n       There is no historic precedent for the codification of the \n     military personnel policy that prevents a whole class of \n     Americans from serving their country in the Armed Forces.\n\n  I felt it was against precedent, and I said:\n\n       There is simply no compelling reason to believe we should \n     break with history and codify such a policy.\n\n  I mentioned that, over the past four decades, Congress had declined \nto impose restrictive personnel policies on the military. I quoted a \nformer Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, Barry Goldwater, who \nstated:\n\n       Banning loyal Americans from the Armed Forces because of \n     their sexual orientation is just plain un-American.\n\n  I said the policy is a policy of outright discrimination, which flies \nin the face of the very American values that the military has sworn to \ndefend.\n  I lauded the courage of those military personnel who were willing to \ncome forward and testify before Congress way back then. And, of course, \nfast forward to today, it is incredible that brave men and women \nserving in uniform in Iraq and in Afghanistan, who put their careers on \nthe line, can stand up and be counted and speak truth to power about \nthis issue.\n  I think this is an important point. The military has a very strict \ncode of conduct, which it must have. So everybody in the military must \nadhere to it, whether you are heterosexual, homosexual, or whatever \nyour orientation is; you have to live by the code of conduct. In 1993 \nwe had just come through this horrible scandal called Tailhook. It was \nawful. You had a series of rapes, and you had a very bad circumstance, \nwhich was brought out into the public. Action was taken. So, clearly, \nheterosexuals in the military, when they misbehave in a sexual way, are \ngoing to be punished. It is the same way for improper homosexual \nbehavior. It will not be tolerated.\n  That is the point. I said that don't ask, don't tell is a policy of \ndiscrimination based on your status instead of your behavior.\n  Here is something else I said in 1993:\n\n       It is easy to lose sight of the impact that policies have \n     on people's lives. It is easy to label people that are \n     different from us as ``those people.'' We might be able to \n     temporarily fool ourselves into thinking that those people \n     are not part of our social fabric.\n\n  I read into the Record some writing of a German philosopher, who \nwrote about World War II, in which he said:\n\n       When the Nazis came for the Jews, I didn't speak up because \n     I was not a Jew. And when the Nazis came for the gypsies, I \n     didn't speak up because I was not a gypsy. And when the Nazis \n     came for the mentally defective, I didn't speak up because I \n     was not mentally defective. When the Nazis came for me, there \n     was no one left to speak up.\n\n  So I said: Let's not do this to gay and lesbian people. Let's have a \ncode of behavior that affects us all and does not divide us. We fool \nourselves when we say that the gay and lesbian community is not part of \nour social fabric; that they are not human; that they do not have an \neffect on our lives. That isn't right. We are all God's children and \nthey are our sons and our daughters.\n  So in a couple of hours, for me, this issue comes full circle. I got \n33 votes that day in 1993 for my amendment not to codify don't ask, \ndon't tell. I got 33 votes, and I was proud of that. I remember Howard \nMetzenbaum--may he rest in peace--said at that time: The Boxer \namendment is a civil rights amendment, and I was proud. But I was so \nsad to lose badly--33 votes. Today--today--we have come a long way, and \nwe have come a long way because people have put their fear aside and \nthey came forward and they told their stories. They took the light and \nthey focused it on the truth. We have come a long way because of their \nfamilies who love them and have spoken out. We have come a long way \nbecause the military itself, in the Pentagon's recently released \nsurvey, said it doesn't matter. Seventy percent of our servicemembers \nsaid we don't care about sexual orientation.\n  So this is America at its best--when we open our arms to equality and \nfreedom and justice.\n  In closing, I would say there is more work we have to do on this \nwhole issue. There is still a lot of unfairness in our laws--partners \nnot being able to have the same rights as married couples. That is \nanother whole issue we will work on. But I am confident that as \nAmericans we will move forward. When we started out, only White men of \nproperty could vote. We have struggled. All this is a struggle. It is \nnot easy. The struggle for freedom is not easy. People have died for \nfreedom in all these communities. It is in our history. But this will \nbe a day that will go down in American history as a day we lifted a \nbarrier, and America is stronger because of it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, may I ask a question of the Senator from \nWyoming, just for planning purposes? I am going to be recognized next. \nApproximately how long does the Senator think he will take?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, 10 to 12 minutes on the START treaty.\n  Mr. LEAHY. I thank my friend, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n\n[[Page S10673]]\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the \nMcCain-Barrasso amendment to the New START treaty, and I appreciate \nhearing all the strong and passionate support for this amendment from \nmy colleagues on the issue of missile defense. We debated this \nyesterday, well into the evening, and we are going to be voting on this \na little after 3 this afternoon.\n  I think it is important that the American people are given the \nopportunity to hear the implications of the New START treaty. The New \nSTART treaty significantly impacts America's national security and our \nnuclear deterrent. I believe this treaty places limitations on the \nability of our Nation to defend itself--limitations I believe should \nnot be in the treaty.\n  The preamble to the New START treaty provides an explicit link \nbetween strategic nuclear offensive weapons and strategic nuclear \ndefensive weapons. It also implies the right of Russia to withdraw from \nthe treaty based on U.S. missile defense that is beyond ``the current \nstrategic capabilities.'' Well, by specifying current strategic \ncapabilities, the intent is clear: They are signaling that future U.S. \ncapabilities could pose a problem. Russia does not want us to improve \nor to expand missile defense capabilities for the United States. For \nme, this is absolutely unacceptable.\n  The administration claims the language in the preamble has no legally \nbinding significance. They claim it is simply a nonbinding concession \nto Russia--a nonbinding concession to Russia. Well, it is important to \nnote that the New START treaty is not the first attempt by Russia to \nlimit our national defense. Russia has wanted language limiting U.S. \nmissile defense for a long time. They are looking for grounds to claim \nthe U.S. missile defense program violates an international agreement.\n  Russian threats have had an impact on our own missile defense \ndecisions in the past. This administration abandoned previous plans to \ndeploy missile defense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic. It is \nevident the administration already receives considerable pressure from \nRussia to limit our Nation's missile defense activities. I believe the \nlanguage in the treaty will only further add to that pressure and will \nimpact U.S. decisionmaking on our own missile defense.\n  I wish to emphasize, again, that the United States must always remain \nin charge of our own missile defense capabilities, not Russia and not \nany other country. It is unacceptable for the United States to make any \nconcessions on missile defense. Defending our Nation should be a top \npriority.\n  Many of my colleagues have come to the floor over and over to \nhighlight this very point. We share a deep concern about the \nconcessions the New START treaty provides to Russia, especially the \nlimitations of our missile defense. There is no legitimate reason for \nthe inclusion of limitations to our national security in this treaty. \nThe New START treaty is just the first step in allowing greater \nconcessions on U.S. missile defense in future agreements.\n  I think it is also important to point out the continual change in the \nstory by the administration--the one they have provided this Senate \nregarding the inclusion of missile defense language in the treaty. \nOriginally, the Senate was told the New START treaty would not contain \nanything on missile defense. Then the Senate was informed there would \nbe no reference to missile defense other than in the preamble of the \ntreaty but certainly no limitations. Then we found that article V of \nthe treaty contains a limitation on the conversion of ICBM and SLBM \nlaunchers into launchers for missile defense. The Senate has a treaty \nbefore it now on nuclear strategic offensive weapons with several \nlimitations on missile defense. We are now being told not to worry \nabout these limitations on our ability to defend ourselves in the New \nSTART treaty. The administration says: Well, it is only a statement of \nfact. They say: It isn't legally binding or this administration doesn't \nplan to use it or it is only an insignificant concession to the \nRussians.\n  I do not find any of these arguments comforting. This treaty sets a \nterrible precedent. The United States should not be placing any \nconstraints on our ability to defend ourselves, no matter the type, the \nsize or the length of time.\n  Significant disagreements exist between the United States and Russia \non missile defense provisions in the New START treaty. Some argue it \ndoesn't matter what Russia says about the issue. Well, I believe it is \nvital that we examine what Russia has said about this very matter. When \ntwo countries enter into a bilateral agreement, there needs to be an \nactual agreement--an agreement of what is said and an agreement of what \nit means. Discussing the disagreements between the two parties to the \ntreaty is imperative, and it is part of the Senate's constitutional \nobligation. The two parties to this treaty--the United States and \nRussia--need to know how both parties will be acting and how they will \nboth be interpreting the New START treaty. We cannot ignore the \ndifferences.\n  Some proponents of the treaty have argued that passing the McCain-\nBarrasso amendment will complicate ratification. I reject that idea. I \nreject the idea that the Senate's advice and consent duty is to take it \nor leave it. I believe the Senate's advice and consent role is either \nto accept the treaty or improve the treaty, and that is what this \namendment does--it improves the treaty. We, as a Senate, cannot simply \nbe a rubberstamp to treaties due to fears of fixing flaws and improving \nimportant provisions.\n  The Congressional Research Service published a study on the role of \nthe Senate in the treaty process. It is titled ``Treaties and Other \nInternational Agreements: The Role of The United States Senate.'' On \npage 125, the study states:\n\n       Amendments are proposed changes in the actual text of the \n     treaty. They amount, therefore, to Senate counteroffers that \n     alter the original deal agreed to by the United States and \n     the other country.\n\n  So should the Senate agree to strike the missile defense section of \nthe preamble, we are simply asking the Russians to accept it. The ball \nis in Russia's court. The Russians can either accept or reject the \nSenate's counteroffer. If the text of the preamble is just a nonbinding \nstatement of fact, then Russia should not have any problem in \neliminating that portion of the preamble. But if Russia does have a \nproblem with eliminating a so-called nonbinding statement of fact and \nRussia is willing to jeopardize the entire treaty over it, then every \nMember of the Senate should be concerned about the provision's impact.\n  The treaty's preamble, the Russian unilateral statement on missile \ndefense, and remarks by senior Russian officials all show an attempt by \nRussia to limit or to constrain future U.S. missile defense \ncapabilities. Let's take a look at the Russian unilateral statement. It \nshows how the Russians will act under the treaty. It states:\n\n       The treaty between the Russian Federation and the United \n     States of America on the reduction and limitation of \n     strategic offensive arms signed in Prague on April 8, 2010, \n     can operate and be viable only if the United States of \n     America refrains from developing its missile defense \n     capabilities quantitatively or qualitatively.\n\n  That is the Russian unilateral statement. Russian Foreign Minister \nLavrov stated the treaty contained ``legally binding linkage between \nstrategic offensive and strategic defensive weapons.'' He went on:\n\n       The treaty and all obligations it contains are valid only \n     within the context of the levels which are now present in the \n     sphere of strategic defensive systems.\n\n  To me those statements seem very clear. The negotiators have given in \nand they have allowed limitations on our missile defense capabilities. \nI have no doubt that Russia will threaten to withdraw from the treaty, \nshould the United States expand its current nuclear capabilities.\n  There should be no problem in removing the language in the preamble \nwhen treaty proponents believe that it has no legally binding \nsignificance.\n  I have been sitting here, visiting and discussing this treaty with \nMembers on both sides. This amendment only strikes a portion of the \ntreaty that people who support the treaty have called nonbinding, \nlegally insignificant, and one Senator called it a throwaway provision. \nThen they should throw it away. This Senate can ensure that there is no \nlimit on U.S. missile defense by simply passing the McCain-Barrasso \namendment. Our missile defense is worth the effort and the time to get \nit right.\n  The McCain-Barrasso amendment significantly improves the treaty and I\n\n[[Page S10674]]\n\nurge my colleagues to vote in favor of this very important amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                         Don't Ask, Don't Tell\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I know in a couple of hours we will be \nvoting on repeal of don't ask, don't tell, now that we have been able \nto go past the filibuster of it. I wish to speak about that for a few \nminutes.\n  While partisan rancor seems to have seized the Senate on so many \noccasions this year, on at least this one count I am encouraged and I \nam hopeful. There is yet sufficient bipartisan agreement to repeal the \ndiscriminatory don't ask, don't tell policy before this Congress ends. \nI commend the Senators who have pledged to support the repeal. Of \ncourse I renew my own commitment in support of the effort. It is well \npast time to put an end to this discriminatory and harmful policy.\n  Today, in the Senate, the stage is set again for one of the major \ncivil rights victories of our lifetimes. Years from now I hope \nhistorians will have good cause to remember that today is the day when \nthe two parties overcame superficial differences to advance the pursuit \nof equal rights for all Americans. After much effort and just as much \nstudy and discussion, the Senate will finally proceed to an up-or-down \nvote on repealing this counterproductive policy.\n  For too long we have said let's vote maybe, we are not quite ready \nfor a vote, let's get the filibuster going. I think most Americans \nexpect Senators--after all there are only 100 of us--they expect us to \ncome here and either vote yes or vote no, not vote maybe. A filibuster \nis voting maybe. To Senators who keep saying I want to think about it \nmore, I want to go longer--we have had years of study. This afternoon \nit is time for every man and woman in this body to step forward and \nvote either yes or no. For those who still harbor concerns that \nenacting this repeal would somehow harm readiness, one simple fact is \nthe clearest answer. Gay and lesbian Americans already serve honorably \nin the U.S. Armed Forces and they have always done so. There is no \ndoubt that they have served in the military since the earliest days of \nthe Republic. The only reason they could do so, then and now, even \nunder today's discriminatory policy, is because they display the same \nconduct and professionalism that we expect from all our men and women \nin uniform. They are no different from anyone else. They should be \ntreated no differently. As one combat veteran said: I don't care \nwhether the soldier next to me is straight or not; I care whether he \ncan shoot straight or not.\n  In ending this policy we are bringing to an end years of forced \ndiscriminatory and corrosive secrecy. Giving these troops the right to \nserve openly, allowing them to be honest about who they are, will not \ncause disciplined servicemembers to suddenly become distracted on the \nbattlefield. It is pandering to suggest that they would be.\n  But that is not only my view. The Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, \nAdmiral Mullen, has said time and time again that this is the right \nthing to do, that it will not harm our military readiness.\n  Gay soldiers and straight soldiers have fought and died for our \ncountry throughout the history of this country. Gay soldiers and \nstraight soldiers have fought and died for our country in Iraq and \nAfghanistan. I think of one of the editorial cartoons showing parents \nat a military graveyard and they are looking at the grave of their son. \nOne says, ``They didn't ask.'' And the other said, ``They didn't \ntell.''\n  Look at this--three coffins draped in flags. The caption is, ``Which \nis the gay one?''\n  Like so many other Senators, I have walked on a quiet day through the \ngraveyard at Arlington National Cemetery. I have seen dates going back \nlong before I was born. I see people who have died in our world wars, \ndied in Korea, died in Vietnam, who die now in Iraq and Afghanistan. I \nlook at the names--some from my own State--and like everybody else who \nwalks through, I think of the sacrifice of these people and the \nsacrifice of their families, the life that would not be lived, the \nchildren who might not know a parent, the brother who might not know a \nsister or sister who might not know a brother, parents who are burying \ntheir child. Of course in the natural order, children bury their \nparents. Here, parents have buried their child.\n  Does anybody look at those graves and say: Move this one because we \njust found out that soldier who died in battle was gay? If anybody \nasked to do that there would be an uproar in this country. So I ask why \nany question about them serving? Every member of our armed services \nshould be judged solely on his or her contribution to the mission. \nRepealing don't ask, don't tell will ensure that we stay true to the \nprinciples on which our great Nation was founded.\n  We ask our troops to protect freedom around the globe. Isn't it time \nthat we protect their basic freedoms and equal rights here at home? \nThroughout our history the Senate has shown its ability to reflect and \nilluminate the Nation's deepest ideals and the Nation's conscience. It \nis my hope the Senate will rise to this occasion by breaking through \nthe partisan din and proceed to debate, as we have, and now vote on \nrepealing the discriminatory and counterproductive policy.\n  I see my good friend and neighbor from across the Connecticut river, \nSenator Shaheen, and I see my friend and colleague--I apologize, I did \nnot see him--the Senator from South Dakota. I know he is waiting. I \nwill yield to him. It is my understanding Senator Shaheen will be \nrecognized after Senator Thune.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to speak to the START treaty, more \nspecifically to the McCain-Barrasso amendment which is the amendment \nthat is currently under consideration and on which we will vote later \nthis afternoon. I want to point out at the outset that you do not have \nto watch the news very often in this country to realize we live in a \ndangerous world. There are lots of countries around the world that are \nrun by regimes that not only mistreat their own populations but would \nlove to do harm to countries that are allies of ours, as well as to the \nUnited States. That is why a debate about an issue such as missile \ndefense is so important. That is why this particular provision in the \nSTART treaty has drawn so much attention, so much concern by many of us \nwho are concerned about the linkage it establishes between offensive \nstrategic arms and defensive strategic arms.\n  The Senate made it abundantly clear at the outset of the negotiations \non the New START treaty, specifically in section 1251 of the fiscal \nyear 2010 National Defense Authorization bill, that there should be no \nlimitations on U.S. ballistic missile defense systems. The New START \ntreaty not only contains specific limitations on those systems, but \nalso reestablishes an unwise linkage between offense and defense that \nwas broken when the ABM Treaty came to an end.\n  We were told as recently as March 29, by Under Secretary Tauscher, \n``The treaty does nothing to constrain missile defense. This treaty is \nabout strategic weapons.''\n  I quote again, ``There is no limit on what the United States can do \nwith its missile defense systems.''\n\n  And then quote again, ``There are no constraints to missile \ndefense.''\n  Those were all quotes made by Secretary Tauscher on March 29. But \nthese assertions are incorrect in two ways. No. 1, not only are there \nspecific limits on some missile defense options--and I note article V, \nparagraph 3 of the treaty text itself--but, second, when viewed \ntogether with the treaty's preamble, Russia's unilateral statement and \nstatements by senior officials all provide potential for Russia to \nintimidate the United States by threatening to withdraw from the treaty \nif the United States seeks to increase its missile defense \ncapabilities.\n  The treaty's supporters are going to argue that the limit on \nconverting offensive silos for missile defense is meaningless because \nwe don't have any such plans. But the question I come back to is simply \nthis: Why is there a limitation at all on missile defense in a treaty \nthat is meant to deal with nuclear weapons? Why did we concede to the \nRussians on this important point and can we be sure we will never have \nsuch plans. After all, we have converted offensive silos to defensive \nsilos--for defensive purposes--in the past.\n\n[[Page S10675]]\n\n  My own view is that particular provision in the treaty text is a \ndirect linkage between offensive and defensive arms. Then you have the \npreamble and unilateral signing statements that I think are even more \ntelling when it comes to that connection that is drawn between--that \ninterrelationship between offense and defense.\n  Far more pernicious is the treaty's preamble and the two unilateral \nsigning statements by the Russians and by the United States. The \npreamble states, ``The current strategic defensive arms do not \nundermine the viability and effectiveness of the strategic arms of the \nParties.''\n  The statement suggests that moving beyond current systems might \nundermine the viability and effectiveness of strategic systems and \ncould provide grounds for withdrawal.\n  The administration says that either side can withdraw anyway. That is \nonly partially true. The withdrawal clause in the treaty, as it has \nbeen in previous treaties, deals with extraordinary events and the \npreamble and unilateral statements make withdrawal more likely by \nbuilding in an inevitable pretext.\n  So you have the preamble, the language in the preamble, you have the \ndirect linkage in the treaty text itself, and then I also want to \nmention the other point which I think is equally important and that is \nthe Russian unilateral signing statement makes clear Russia's legal \nopinion. Here is what it says.\n\n       The treaty between the Russian Federation and the United \n     States of America on the reduction and limitation of \n     strategic offensive arms signed in Prague on April 8, 2010, \n     can operate and be viable only if the United States of \n     American refrains from developing its missile defense \n     capabilities quantitatively or qualitatively.\n\n  It further states:\n\n       The exceptional circumstances referred to in article XIV, \n     the withdrawal clause of the treaty, include increasing the \n     capabilities of the United States of America's missile \n     defense system in such a way that threatens the potential of \n     the strategic nuclear forces of the Russian Federation.\n\n  So the Russians have built into the treaty record their threat that \nimprovement of U.S. missile defense creates the legal pretext for their \nwithdrawal from the treaty. It can only be read as an attempt to exert \npolitical pressure to forestall continued development and deployment of \nU.S. missile defenses.\n  Was our response to that a firm rebuttal? The answer is no. Unlike \nthe START I agreement where the United States said quite clearly that \nit did not agree with Russian statements linking that treaty to the \nU.S. status in the ABM treaty, we did not do that this time.\n  Instead, the State Department said, in response to the Russian \nunilateral statement:\n\n       The United States of America takes note of the statement on \n     missile defense by the Russian Federation. The United States \n     missile defense systems would be employed to defend the \n     United States against limited missile launches, and to defend \n     its deployed forces, allies and partners against regional \n     threats. The United States intends to continue improving and \n     deploying its missile defense systems in order to defend \n     itself against limited attack, and as part of our \n     collaborative approach to strengthening stability in key \n     regions.\n\n  So it would appear that the U.S. position does not contradict the \nRussian position in the slightest. What then to make of the U.S. \nmissile defense plan previously announced by Secretary Gates, which \ntalks about the deployment of SM-3 missiles in Romania by 2015, Poland \nby 2018, and then in 2020 the deployment in Europe of the new SM-3 2B \nmissile for the defense of Europe and the United States against ICBMs; \nis this still our position or is it now the position set forth in the \nsigning statement and as recently briefed to the NATO-Russia Council in \nLisbon where the SN03 2B missile was portrayed quite clearly as being \n``available'' rather than ``deployed'' in the year 2020.\n  It is clear to me the administration is already coming under \nconsiderable pressure by the Russians to limit its missile defense \nactivities in the very near future. Past experience would suggest this \nadministration may be willing to alter its plans to accommodate the \nRussians, as it did in the case of previous plans to deploy missile \ndefense systems in Poland and the Czech Republic.\n  How will it respond if the President's prized accomplishment, the \nSTART treaty, is at risk? I think it is very clear from the language in \nthe preamble, the direct linkage in the treaty itself, and what the \nsigning statements say, what the Russians' intentions are with regard \nto this particular issue, which is why it is so important this \namendment get adopted.\n  This amendment the Senators from Arizona and Wyoming have offered \nwould simply strike the language in the preamble that is causing so \nmuch concern. We have heard arguments on the floor of the Senate since \nwe started debate on the START treaty that the preamble is nonbinding; \nin other words, it does not mean anything.\n  In fact, it was said yesterday by someone on the other side that it \nis throwaway language. Yet at the same time, it has been argued by \nothers on the other side that it is a treaty killer. It cannot be both. \nIt cannot be a throwaway that is not legally binding and a treaty \nkiller at the same time.\n  Essentially, what they are saying is, it means nothing and it means \neverything. That is a direct contradiction. That is why it is so \nimportant this amendment be adopted, which would clarify once and for \nall, or separate and decouple or delink this connection that exists in \nthis treaty between offensive and defensive arms.\n  I think the amendment that is before us right now gets at the very \nheart of the matter, and we all know the Russians and Americans have \ndifferent views on missile defense. But the attempt to paper over or \neven ignore these differences in this treaty sets the stage for future \nmisunderstandings or confrontations as the United States continues its \nmissile defense activities, particularly in Europe.\n  Confusion about U.S. plans is equally dangerous. This is not an issue \non which there should be ambiguity, on which there should be confusion, \nand on which there should be this kind of a difference of opinion.\n  So I would simply say, as we come here in an hour or so to a final \nvote on the McCain-Barrasso amendment, that I think it is important for \nthe Senate in our important role when it comes to treaty ratification \nto make sure we are doing everything that is in the national security \ninterests of the United States and allows us in the best way possible \nto defend this country and our allies.\n  If we are limiting in any way our ability when it comes to the issue \nof missile defense, we are putting in jeopardy and at risk America's \nnational security interests. So this treaty should not be approved. It \nshould not be approved certainly until some of these changes are made, \nand we can start today by eliminating the linkage and the connection \nthat exists today in the preamble by striking and deleting that \nlanguage from the preamble of this treaty and making it very clear that \nthe United States intends to preserve all options available to us when \nit comes to missile defense.\n  As I said before, this is something--this linkage was broken years \nago under the Bush administration. We should not establish now the \nprecedent of allowing those issues to be linked and to give the \nRussians an opportunity and an excuse to withdraw from this treaty if \nthe United States decides to proceed with what is in its own best \nnational security interests.\n  So I would urge my colleagues on this amendment--this is an important \namendment. We will hopefully have debate on other amendments. I have a \ncouple of amendments to deal with the issue of delivery vehicles which \nI think is also a very important part of this treaty. But there \nprobably is no more important piece of this treaty than the issue of \nmissile defense when it comes to the vital national security interests \nof the United States.\n  So I hope Members will, when this vote comes up later today, vote in \nfavor of the McCain-Barrasso amendment and make it clear that there is \nto be no linkage, no nexus, between strategic offensive arms and \nstrategic defensive arms so we eliminate once and for all the ambiguity \nthat exists with regard to this issue and allow us to proceed to other \namendments on the treaty.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n[[Page S10676]]\n\n                                  DADT\n\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here today to express my strong \nsupport for the repeal of the don't ask don't tell policy. The Senate \ntook a significant step toward that repeal earlier today. I want to \ncongratulate and thank Senators Lieberman and Collins for their strong \nbipartisan leadership on this issue. I was proud to be a cosponsor of \nthis bill, and I hope we will soon send it to the President for his \nsignature.\n  It is not often that the Senate gets the opportunity with a single \nvote to right a wrong, but we have that opportunity here today. This is \na historic vote, one for which this Senate will be remembered for a \nlong time. This is our opportunity to fix an outdated, discriminatory \nand broken policy and to strengthen America's security. The United \nStates, our military, and our security will be better off because of \nthis legislation.\n  I completely agree with Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who strongly \nendorsed the repeal and urged the Senate to pass this legislation \nbefore the end of the year. Secretary Gates and America's military \nleadership understand that this discriminatory policy undermines our \nnational security and diminishes our military readiness.\n  A nation at war is a nation that needs the best, most qualified \nservice members we can find regardless of sexual orientation. At a time \nwhen nearly 150,000 American men and women are serving in combat \noverseas, and at a time when our military is stretched thin across the \nglobe, we simply cannot afford to lose some of our finest soldiers.\n  Since the policy was instituted in 1993, more than 14,000 service \nmembers have been expelled from the military, and an estimated 4,000 \nservice members per year voluntarily leave because of this \ndiscriminatory policy. One thousand of those expelled were badly needed \nspecialists with vital mission critical skills, like Arabic speakers \nand other technical experts.\n  Don't ask, don't tell also ignores the realities of today's combat \nenvironment, where American soldiers are fighting next to allied troops \nfrom around the world. In fact, at least 12 nations allowing gays and \nlesbians to serve openly have fought alongside U.S. service members in \nAfghanistan. At least 28 countries, including our closest allies, Great \nBritain, Australia, Canada, and Israel, already allow open service.\n  Not only is this policy costing us critical capabilities, it is also \nunnecessarily costing us a significant amount of money. The military \nspends as much as $43,000 to replace each individual charged under the \ndon't ask, don't tell policy. At a time of extremely tight budgets with \nlittle money to go around, it just does not make sense to spend tens of \nthousands of dollars to investigate, try, and replace American soldiers \nbased only on their sexual orientation.\n  Repeal of this policy has earned the backing of an overwhelming \nmajority of America's Iraq and Afghanistan veterans and countless \nmilitary leaders, including retired GEN Colin Powell, who says that \nattitudes and circumstances have changed since the policy was first \ninstituted 17 years ago.\n  In addition, we now have a good understanding of what our own \nmilitary men and women feel about the repeal of this policy. The \nmilitary undertook one of the largest and most comprehensive reviews in \nits history to make sure those most affected by this change had their \nviews heard and incorporated. The in-depth, 9-month review included a \ncomprehensive survey that was sent to nearly 400,000 active duty and \nreserve component service members as well as 150,000 military spouses.\n  The review's final report, released several weeks ago, found that \nrepealing this policy could be accomplished without undermining \nmilitary readiness and can be initiated immediately. The report found \nthat more than two-thirds of those questioned found that repeal would \nhave no effect on cohesion, effectiveness, unit readiness, or morale.\n  We used to tell young Americans, ``Don't ask what your country can do \nfor you.'' Yet now we tell the very people who have answered that call, \n``don't ask, don't tell.'' This is a civil rights issue. It is a moral \nissue, and it is a national security issue. Today, the Senate has an \nhistoric opportunity to fix this broken and outdated policy.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Ohio.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I rise to echo the words of the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire, Mrs. Shaheen, and her support \nof the repeal of don't ask, don't tell. It is important for our \nmilitary, it is important for our values, it is important for human \nrights, it is important for our country.\n  As we know, for nearly 17 years Federal law has dictated that gay and \nlesbian Americans serving or hoping to serve in our Nation's military \nmust be silent about their sexual orientation. If that silence were \nbroken, they would face the grim consequences of an almost certain \ndischarge.\n  The don't ask, don't tell policy, as it has become commonly known, is \ninconsistent with our American values. It has robbed the military of \nvaluable personnel who can contribute to military readiness and \nfulfillment of missions at home and abroad. That is why I opposed this \npolicy in the mid-1990s and have advocated for its repeal ever since.\n  Throughout this debate I have heard from many Ohioans, including \nmembers of our military, expressing profound opposition to the policy \nof don't ask, don't tell. Ohioans such as Cadet Katherine Miller, LTC \nVictor Fehrenback, who spoke with me at one of my Thursday morning \ncoffees in the Capitol, MAJ Mike Almy, and many other advocates and \nservicemembers have worked in their communities. They have walked the \nHalls of Congress to explain why don't ask, don't tell should be \noverturned.\n  Their experiences and that of those they represent are reminders that \nimportant battles remain in the fight for human rights and justice in \nour country. But we know for sure that history is on their side.\n\n  Today's vote will affirm what military leaders from Defense Secretary \nGates to GEN Colin Powell to Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \nMichael Mullen have been saying for some time: Repeal of don't ask, \ndon't tell will make our military stronger. With our Nation at war, it \nis especially important that our policies promote the recruitment and \nretention of the very best soldiers, regardless of their race, \nreligion, sexual orientation or gender.\n  President Obama and Secretary Gates have conducted a year-long \nreview--which many people in this Chamber in both parties, especially \nmy Republican colleagues, asked for--on the impact of fully and openly \nintegrating lesbian and gay Americans into the military. It is no \nsurprise that the report concluded that open service poses no threat to \nour military readiness or effectiveness.\n  It is estimated that the don't ask, don't tell policy has cost the \nAmerican people somewhere between $300 and $500 million to implement. \nIt has resulted in the discharge of almost 14,000 soldiers--14,000 \nsoldiers who were discharged not for performance but because of their \nsexual orientation. These 14,000 Americans include hundreds of Ohioans \nwho offered to lay down their lives for this country. They deserve \nbetter than investigations and discharge. They deserve acceptance, \naffirmation and, most importantly, the right to serve openly and \nhonestly in America's military.\n  The strength of our Nation is measured not just by the size of the \neconomy or the might of our military, it is measured by acts consistent \nwith our values, the very values our servicemembers defend and that \ndefine our Nation's greatness.\n  The repeal of don't ask, don't tell is a long overdue victory for our \nmilitary, a victory for American values, a victory for human rights \nand, most important, a victory for the American people. I ask support \nof the measure, a resounding vote out of this Senate to go along with \nthe House so the President can sign this bill and end this policy that \nhas not served the American people well for much of two decades.\n  I yield the floor, suggest the absence of a quorum, and ask unanimous \nconsent that time under the quorum be charged equally to both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KERRY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n\n[[Page S10677]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania is here and wants to speak. Then, I think the Senator \nfrom New Jersey is on his way over to speak. Because there have been a \nnumber of speeches on the START treaty against it and a number of \narguments laid out, I wish to have an opportunity to speak to them. I \nask unanimous consent that at 2:30 I be permitted to speak for about 15 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the vote that will occur \nin a little more than an hour on the don't ask, don't tell policy. I \nhave some basic thoughts about it, coming from a State where we have \ncontributed probably as many or more soldiers to almost every major \nconflict we have had over the last 100 years. We are a State that has \nover 1 million veterans. We have lost soldiers most recently in the \nconflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan. In Iraq, our killed-in-action number \nwas just below 200. At last count, it was about 197. In Afghanistan, it \nis now up to 61, 62 who have been killed in action. People in \nPennsylvania know what war is about, what sacrifice is about, because \nso many families have contributed to that service and that sacrifice.\n  When it comes to this change in policy we are advocating, I wish to \nfocus on two basic considerations. One is basic integrity and the other \nis valor. We have had a number of statements made by senior military \nleaders, part of this administration and others, who have called for \nrepeal of the policy. Secretary Gates, Secretary of Defense for the \nObama administration and for a good while under the administration of \nPresident Bush, said:\n\n       I fully support the President's decision. The question \n     before us is not whether the military prepares to make this \n     change but how we best prepare for it.\n\n  So said Secretary Gates.\n  Admiral Mullen, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said in \npertinent part:\n\n       It is my personal belief that allowing gays and lesbians to \n     serve openly would be the right thing to do. No matter how I \n     look at this issue, I cannot escape being troubled by the \n     fact that we have in place a policy which forces young men \n     and women to lie about who they are in order to defend their \n     fellow citizens. For me personally, it comes down to \n     integrity.\n\n  His statement goes on from there.\n  Former Secretary of State Powell fully supports the change. I could \ngo on from there, and I know folks have cited military leaders in the \ndebate. I keep coming back to this question. Secretary Mullen talked \nabout integrity and a policy that forces young men and women to lie.\n  Former National Security Adviser Jim Jones said, quoting in pertinent \npart, that the don't ask, don't tell policy:\n\n       . . . has to evolve with the social norms. I think times \n     have changed. The young men and women who wish to serve their \n     country should not have to lie in order to do that.\n\n  I wish to focus on that part of it. How can a policy long endure in \nthis country, especially as it relates to the military, that asks \npeople to lie? Every day they to have get up and prepare themselves for \nservice and sometimes literally for battle, a life and death battle. \nEvery day this policy says: But you have to lie about it. You have to \nkeep it a secret. You can't let anyone know. You have to lie.\n  How can a policy endure in this country that is based upon lying and \nnot telling the truth? That is at the core of our Republic, whether you \ntalk about the rule of law or no man or woman is above the law. All \nthose statements, all that philosophy is undergirded by basic \nintegrity, that we all try to live by the same rules. If we are not \ntelling the truth and we are forcing folks who are willing to serve \ntheir country to put themselves in harm's way, which doesn't even begin \nto describe the sacrifice, some of these soldiers have not only served \nbut been gravely, grievously wounded and some, of course, have been \nkilled in action in the current conflicts and many before that, it is a \nbasic question about integrity. Are we going to continue to support a \npolicy that calls upon people to lie? I don't think the American people \nsupport that.\n  Secondly, the basic and related question of valor. We have public \nofficials across the country, Members of Congress, public officials in \nour States who stand on Veterans Day and all kinds of days when we \ncommemorate and pay tribute to those who have sacrificed, those who \ngave, as Lincoln said, the last full measure of devotion to their \ncountry. There are a lot of speeches given and commendations accorded \nto people who have served the country. But a lot of that will ring \nhollow if we are saying there is one group of soldiers whom we may not \nwant to have in the military, and if we want them in, then they are \ngoing to have to lie about it. These are young men and women who are \nthe definition, the embodiment of service and valor and courage. We \ncan't just get up as a politician and give a speech about patriotism \nand then be willing to undermine our argument and undermine our \nmilitary by saying we have to perpetuate a policy that doesn't work and \nis in conflict with who we are.\n  I want to read a quotation from someone who has served in the \nCongress for the last 4 years but someone who has also served our \ncountry, someone I know, and he is a friend of mine--I put that on the \nrecord--but someone we are very proud of and the work he has done in \nboth forms of service: as a Member of Congress and serving in our \nmilitary, and that is, Congressman Patrick Murphy from Bucks County, \nPA. For some who do not know their geography, that is on the east side \nof our State. He has been here in the Congress for 4 years. He will be \nleaving this month. But he has been a champion of repealing this \npolicy, and he speaks with an integrity and a commitment which I think \nis unmatched because he is not speaking about this policy \ntheoretically, he is not speaking about this policy in a textbook \nsense, he is speaking and has fought for the change in this policy from \nthe vantage point of someone who has served and who served in \nsituations where he could have been killed, sometimes every day of the \nweek.\n  Here is a part of what he has said. There are many things he has said \nabout this, but he said:\n\n       The paratroopers from the 82nd Airborne Division in the \n     Army that I served with back in Iraq in 2003 and 2004, they \n     didn't care who you were writing letters back home to, if you \n     had a boyfriend or a girlfriend. They care whether you can \n     handle your assault rifle. Can you kick down a door? Can you \n     do your job so you all come home alive?\n\n  That is the challenge he presents to all of us, Congressman Patrick \nMurphy, former member of the 82nd Airborne Division. This policy on the \nbattlefield is not theoretical. It is consequential in at least one \nsense. If we continue the policy the way it is, we are going to be less \neffective on the battlefield. If we continue the policy the way it is, \nwe are going to have less people serving at a time when we need extra \nhelp.\n  We need soldiers on the battlefield. We need to continue to have \nyoung men and women who will volunteer to serve, knowing that once they \nvolunteer, this is not sending you to some base somewhere for a couple \nof years away from conflict--knowing that when you volunteer today--\nmaybe this was not true 10 or 15 years ago--but today when you \nvolunteer, the likelihood of you seeing combat is very high.\n  So there is a special category of valor and integrity for those who \nare willing to volunteer to serve their country, especially when they \nknow they could be sent into a firefight.\n  You do not have to take the word of one or another Senator, but I \nthink we can take the word and base our judgment upon the experience of \na Member of Congress, in this case from the House, who has also served \nin the 82nd Airborne Division. We should remember his words, what folks \nat home will care about. They care about ``whether you can handle your \nassault rifle.'' ``Can you kick down a door?'' ``Can you do your job so \nyou all come home alive?''\n  When we speak about this policy, this is not theory. This is a \ndebate, at\n\n[[Page S10678]]\n\nleast, about two very important principles: valor, and whether we are \ngoing to affirm the valor of others who serve and are willing to serve; \nand whether we are going to have a policy based upon a core \nfoundational principle of our democracy, which is integrity. That is \nthe basic question we have before us.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bayh). The Senator from New Jersey.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, it is time to stop discrimination. It is \ntime to repeal don't ask, don't tell. This is a policy that should have \nbeen repealed long ago--long ago. It should have been repealed for its \ndiscriminatory nature. It should have been repealed because the Defense \nDepartment's own report makes it clear that those who pointlessly cling \nto this discriminatory, wrongheaded, shortsighted policy, by claiming \nthe mantle of national security, have absolutely no ground--no ground--\nto stand on.\n  Don't ask, don't tell is a ridiculous notion, a bad policy, and a \nrelic of a bygone era. It is keeping brave, able, educated, technically \nskilled, multilingual, trained soldiers, men and women who want nothing \nmore than to defend their country from doing so.\n  We are preventing them from making our military even stronger, making \nit better, and contributing to what we need in a modern military force. \nIn my view, a vote to repeal this antiquated policy is a smart vote. It \nis the right vote. It is the fair vote. It is a just vote. It is a vote \nto keep our military strong, keep good people in the military, who want \nto serve.\n  Americans who now must remain anonymous, such as an anonymous marine \ncurrently serving in Afghanistan says:\n\n       So far the military has been my source of work and income \n     for the last 6 years. I don't want that all taken away from \n     me and me being discharged anything but honorably.\n\n  He says:\n\n       We face the same challenges as all other marines or \n     soldiers but with an extra burden.\n\n  Or another anonymous servicemember--a decorated Midwesterner, a \nshining example of an American marine, with a chest full of ribbons--\nlike others, he risked his life, but, like other marines denying who \nthey are, he was deeply apprehensive about seeking the medical care he \nneeded when he got home for fear of being ousted and losing everything \nhe had worked and sacrificed for, everything he had served for.\n  He suffered in silence, careful in whom he confided, saying:\n\n       You never know who you can trust.\n\n  An Arabic linguist--someone whose talents we sorely need against some \nof the enemies we have today--named Bleu Copas was discharged under \ndon't ask, don't tell, even though he was never identified as gay and \nhis accuser never revealed himself. Imagine that, in a country that \nvalues the rule of law and justice, that your accuser never has to \nreveal themselves, never be subject to cross-examination, never testing \nthe veracity, the truthfulness of what they are saying, and yet have \nthis person be discharged.\n  This is no way to run a military. We are talking about patriots. We \nare talking about men and women who want to serve, who are serving, who \nyearn to serve, who put their lives on the line.\n  When a C-17 from the 436th Airlift Wing flies into Dover, DE, when \nrows of flag-draped coffins fill a hangar and the solemn dignity of \nfallen heroes brings silence and tears to all of us as a nation, do we \nask the faith, the color, the sexual preference under those flags? I \nthink not.\n  Listen to the arguments and rationale of those military leaders who \nknow best.\n  Former Secretary of the Army Clifford Alexander said:\n\n       The policy is an absurdity and borderlines on being an \n     obscenity. What it does is cause people to ask of themselves \n     that they lie to themselves, that they pretend to be \n     something that they are not. There is no empirical evidence \n     that would indicate that it affects military cohesion.\n\n  Former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Shalikashvili, \nsaid:\n\n       Within the military, the climate has changed dramatically \n     since 1993. . . .\n       Conversations I've held with servicemembers make clear \n     that, while the military remains a traditional culture, that \n     tradition no longer requires banning open service by gays.\n\n  Three-star Retired LTG Claudia Kennedy said:\n\n       Army values are taught to soldiers from their earliest days \n     in the Army. Those values are: Loyalty, duty, mutual respect, \n     selfless service, honor, integrity and personal courage. We \n     teach our soldiers that these are the values we expect them \n     to live up to.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       I believe that as an institution, our military needs to \n     live up to the values we demand of the servicemembers. . . .\n       Military leaders need to respect all servicemembers. We \n     need to recognize that loyalty and selfless service are \n     exhibited equally, by servicemembers of every color, gender \n     and sexual orientation.\n\n  I think about her words ``selfless service.'' When you voluntarily, \nin an all-volunteer military, come forth as an American and say: I want \nto serve my country, I am willing to put my life in harm's way in \nbehalf of the defense of the Nation and my fellow Americans, does that \nsomehow get diminished--that selfless service get diminished--because \nyou are gay?\n  I think about personal courage. When you are on the battlefield, and \nyou are being shot at, and when you are protecting those who are in \nyour company, and when you are injured, and when you are bleeding, does \nthat personal courage get diminished because you are gay?\n  Certainly not. Certainly not.\n  And most convincingly, and to the point, Retired Navy VADM and U.S. \nCongressman Joe Sestak said this:\n\n       We have to correct this. It's just not right. I can \n     remember being out there in command, and someone would come \n     up to you and start to tell you--and you just want to say, \n     no, I don't want to lose you, you're too good, [too \n     valuable].\n\n  Let's take the advice of these military leaders who know that this is \na bad policy and it should be repealed. It is a policy that the \nPentagon report itself says, if repealed, presents little risk to \nmilitary readiness and cohesion, and little effect on morale.\n  In fact, 62 percent of servicemembers responded to the Pentagon's own \nsurvey that repeal of don't ask, don't tell would have a positive or no \neffect on morale.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Democrats' time is expired.\n  There is 15 minutes allocated to Senator Kerry. He is not on the \nfloor.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. As a member of that committee, I ask unanimous consent \nfor 1 minute to finish this statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me close by quoting from a letter from the Human Rights Campaign. \nI think it puts it purposely and exactly:\n\n       . . . take a moment to truly comprehend the lives ruined \n     over the last 17 years because of this discriminatory law. \n     The soldiers, sailors, airmen, translators, doctors and more, \n     whose military careers were ended, whose livelihoods were \n     threatened, whose friendships were cut off, all because the \n     forces of bigotry and fear held out for so long.\n       They can never get those years back. But I hope they know \n     that their sacrifice meant something. Their courage and \n     integrity helped a nation understand what it means to serve. \n     And that, more than anything else, helped bring about this \n     historic change.\n\n  That is the vote I hope we will have--one that creates historic \nchange and honors the courage, the integrity, and the service of these \nmen and women.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. KLOBUCHAR. Mr. President, I appreciate the Senator from Arizona \nand the Senator from Massachusetts allowing me to speak for a few \nminutes.\n  I wish to lend my strong support as a cosponsor of the repeal of \ndon't ask, don't tell. I have always believed the commitment of our top \nmilitary leaders is critical to successfully implementing the repeal of \nthis policy. Since February of this year, we have heard testimony from \nDefense Secretary Gates as well as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, ADM Mike Mullen. To\n\n[[Page S10679]]\n\nthis day, both support the repeal of the policy.\n  Admiral Mullen outlined his concern with the policy pretty \nsuccinctly. He said:\n\n       No matter how I look at the issue, I cannot escape being \n     troubled by the fact that we have in place a policy which \n     forces young men and women to lie about who they are in order \n     to defend their fellow citizens.\n\n  Our country is literally asking our servicemembers to lie.\n  Earlier this year, Secretary Gates called for a study of the repeal. \nThat study involved comprehensive polls of the U.S. military. After the \nDecember release of the report on the implementation of the repeal, we \nknow the majority of our military members--70 percent of Active-Duty \nmilitary and National Guard and Reserve--have said this change will not \nhave a negative impact on their ability to perform their duties.\n  So what we have is this: We have the support of the top brass of our \nmilitary of the United States--something that was incredibly important \nto implementing this policy change. We have checked that box. We have \nthe support of the majority of our soldiers in the field, who basically \nsaid they can live with this policy change or they can live with \nserving with a soldier who admits they are gay. The last thing we have \nis this body, this Chamber, and today is the day we checked that box. \nToday is the day we voted for the repeal.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the remaining \nRepublican time be equally divided between Senators McCain, Kyl, and \nSessions.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, before the Senator gets going, I think we \nhave an understanding. Just so the record is clear, how much Republican \ntime remains at this point?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Just under 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. So it is my understanding they will each have about 10 \nminutes. I think Senator Kyl and Senator Sessions will speak, at which \npoint I will have an opportunity to speak, and then Senator McCain, \nsince it is his amendment, would have the last 10 minutes at that \npoint.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, during one of the last votes, a Member came \nto me and said: I have not been able to follow this debate. What \nexactly is the McCain-Barrasso amendment?\n  With all of the to-and-fro--having votes on different subjects, then \ngoing back to the START treaty, then going back to a vote on don't ask, \ndon't tell, then finally a vote on the McCain-Barrasso amendment--I \nthought it would be good to recapitulate a little bit on what exactly \nthe McCain-Barrasso amendment is and why it is important.\n  What the amendment does is it removes language that relates to \nmissile defense from the preamble. This treaty was supposed to be about \noffensive strategic weapons, not about missile defense. In fact, we \nwere told by an administration spokesman that it wouldn't relate to \nmissile defense, but sure enough, there the words are. Why are they \nthere? They are there because the Russians insisted they be there. Why \ndid they insist they be there? Because for decades the Russians have \nbeen fixated on U.S. missile defense, trying to find ways to reduce the \neffect of our missile defense on Russian strategic capabilities. They \ntried it at Reykjavik with President Reagan. He said no. They tried it \nagain in the first START treaty. They tried it again in the Moscow \nTreaty of 2002. And they have tried it again here.\n  The difference between this treaty and the previous times is that the \nUnited States always pushed back and said: No, we are going to rely on \nmissile defense. It is the moral thing to do. We are not going to get \ninto quid pro quos with you where we have to reduce our missile defense \nif you reduce your strategic offensive weapons or some other agreement \nlike that.\n  In the START I treaty, when the Russians said in their signing \nstatement: We find this interrelationship, and the United States should \nnot advance its missile defense capabilities, the United States pushed \nback strongly in our statement and said no, that would not be a grounds \nfor withdrawal from the treaty and the Russians need to understand \nthat. They never did withdraw even though we did withdraw from the ABM \nTreaty so we could build missile defenses.\n  Well, once again, they have put it in the preamble this time and \nthen, in their signing statement, made very clear their intent that the \ninterrelationship between the two means that if our missile defenses \nare ever developed to a point where they consider it qualitatively or \nquantitatively better than it is currently, then they would have the \nright to withdraw from the treaty; that that would qualify as one of \nthe exceptional circumstances under article XIV, which is the \nwithdrawal clause of the treaty. Why do they want to do that? Obviously \nto put pressure on the United States not to develop our missile \ndefenses in a way they don't want. They will threaten to withdraw from \nthe treaty if we begin to do that. Some Presidents--I suspect the \nexisting President, for example--would therefore be very wary of going \nforward with missile defense plans if that means the Russians would \nwithdraw from the treaty.\n  My colleague Senator Kerry says: Well, the preamble is a meaningless \ndocument. It is a throwaway document. It doesn't mean that much. But he \nalso says: However, if we change one comma in the preamble, it will be \na treaty-killing amendment.\n  At first, I said: Well, both of those things can't be true. It can't \nbe both meaningless and of ultimate importance, that it would kill the \ntreaty if we changed it.\n  On reflection, I think Senator Kerry actually has it right, \npartially. To the United States, it is meaningless. Our negotiators \ndidn't care what the Russians put in there. It doesn't mean anything to \nus, but it means everything to the Russians, and that is why I think \nSenator Kerry is right.\n  This would be a big problem for the Russians. Why is that so? Because \neven though we were willing to walk away from that commitment we had \nalways made in the past that there wouldn't be this connection between \ndefense and offense, the Russians got it in here, and it means \neverything to them because it creates the predicate for their \nwithdrawal from the treaty, and that is what they are trying to \nestablish.\n  I will close this point by quoting from Dr. Condoleezza Rice, who \nwrote an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal in which she said we needed \nto do something about this in our ratification process. She said there \nare legitimate concerns that must be addressed in the ratification \nprocess.\n  I am quoting now:\n\n       The Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying \n     this treaty, the U.S. is not reestablishing the Cold War link \n     between offensive forces and missile defenses. New START's \n     preamble is worrying in this regard as it recognizes the \n     interrelationship between the two.\n\n  What this language from Senators Barrasso and McCain does is simply \nremove that language from the preamble, thereby removing the thorn, \nremoving the contention, the potential and I would say almost certain \nconflict that is due to arise between our two countries when the time \ncomes that we do build a missile defense that the Russians don't want.\n\n  They say: We are going to withdraw from the treaty.\n  We say: You can't do that; that is not an extraordinary circumstance.\n  They say: Yes it is. We identified it as such at the time we signed \nthe treaty, and we are going to leave the treaty.\n  And then the U.S. President has a dilemma: Do we pull back on our \nmissile defenses or allow the Russians to withdraw from the treaty and \nall that will portend?\n  That is why this is important. The amendment cures the problem by \nsimply removing that language from the preamble.\n  In the remaining time, I wish to briefly respond to four points the \nPresident made in his weekly address today relating generally to the \nsame subject.\n  One of the first points he made is he talked about the number of \nnuclear\n\n[[Page S10680]]\n\nweapons--about 25,000 on each side--and the decades that have ensued \nsince the Cold War. Those numbers have come down dramatically, and he \nsaid that progress would not have been possible without strategic arms \ncontrol treaties.\n  Yes, it would have. It was happening anyway. Both sides were willing \nto draw both of their delivery vehicles and warheads down because they \ncouldn't afford to keep them. In fact, after the end of the Cold War, \nthe United States, under President Bush, said: We are reducing ours, \nand Russia, you can do whatever you want to do.\n  We knew they couldn't afford to keep theirs any more than we could \nkeep ours, and they weren't reducing theirs.\n  The Russians came to us and said: Gee, we need a treaty.\n  We said: Why? We don't care how many you have. We are reducing ours.\n  Eventually, we said: OK. If you want a treaty, fine.\n  It was a three-page treaty, but it had no connections with missile \ndefenses or anything the Russians wanted.\n  The point is, it didn't require a treaty for us to bring those levels \ndown.\n  How about the delivery vehicles? This treaty actually fixes the \nnumber of delivery vehicles above where the Russians are right now. \nThey could actually build up to the level of about 140, as I recall, to \nget up to the level of 700.\n  The point is, both countries are reducing the levels to the point \nthat we need, not because of an arms control treaty but because it is \nin our national interests to do so.\n  Secondly, the President said that without this treaty, we will risk \nturning back the progress we have made in our relationship with Russia. \nI will just repeat what I have said before. Secretary Kissinger and \nothers who have spoken to this point have always warned: Don't \npredicate the support for a treaty on improving your relationship with \nsomeone. The treaty should relate to reducing arms or whatever the \nsubject of the treaty is. It should not be based on anything other than \nthat or you get into a morass of always trying to please the other side \nand risking that they will withdraw from the treaty.\n  Third, the President said that it is about the safety and security of \nthe United States of America. I have yet for anybody to tell me what \nthreat we are reducing by agreeing with the Russians that both of us \nare going to reduce our delivery vehicles and warheads. Actually, the \nRussians don't have to reduce theirs; they could actually build up \nunder the treaty. I don't think we see any big threat there.\n  Finally, the President said that every minute we drag our feet is a \nminute we have no inspectors on the ground at those Russian nuclear \nsites. We just talked about the fact that we have this reset \nrelationship with the Russians, and we need to continue these good \nrelationships, but we can't trust them, so we have to get our folks on \nthe ground verifying what is going on right now. As I pointed out \nbefore, the administration created this problem on its own. We could \nhave had a bridging agreement. We could have simply extended the \nverification provisions of the previous START treaty, but the Russians \ndidn't want to do that, we are told. Fine, they didn't want to do that. \nThat doesn't mean we had to agree that we will abide by their wishes \nwhen it comes to verification.\n  My colleague says: Well, you can't get them to do something, so we \nsigned the treaty the way the Russians wanted in this regard, and we \njust have to live with that. The administration might have to live with \nthat, but the Senate is not a rubberstamp, and it seems to me the \nSenate has a right to say: You let the verification procedures lapse; \nyou didn't have to do that.\n  Senator Lugar had a bill that related to the extension of the legal \nregime whereby both sides would be able to continue to have presence in \nthe other country. We knew that was a problem at the time. For some \nreason, the administration didn't pursue it--I suppose because the \nRussians said no, but that doesn't mean the U.S. Senate has to say: OK, \nthe Russians just say no, and I guess we have to go along with that.\n  The point here is that I don't think any of the arguments President \nObama has made require that we ratify this treaty this week. I would \nurge my colleagues to seriously consider what Dr. Condoleezza Rice has \nsaid, what Senator McCain and others have said here about the necessity \nof cleaning up this preamble so that we don't reestablish the link with \nmissile defense and inhibit U.S. ability to proceed with missile \ndefense plans in the future.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I would ask to be notified after 6 \nminutes.\n  I wish to thank Senator Kyl and Senator McCain for their leadership \non this issue and state that I believe the McCain amendment is perhaps \nthe most critical amendment that will be raised during this debate \nbecause the future of missile defense is critically important for \nAmerica.\n  I chaired the Subcommittee on Strategic Forces in the Armed Services \nCommittee. I have been the ranking member of the subcommittee and a \nmember of the committee for 12 years, and I know all of the history on \nthis issue. It has gone on for a great deal of time.\n  I believe missile defense is critical to our national security. We \nhave invested billions of dollars over 30-plus years developing it, and \nnow that we are actually deploying it in Alaska and California, it is \nproving to be a shield that will work.\n  We had plans for a long time to deploy a site in Central Europe. The \nBush administration negotiated with the Poles and Czechoslovakia. They \nsigned agreements that they would allow a radar base in the Czech \nRepublic and a missile base in Poland.\n  When President Obama was elected, the Russians immediately started \npushing back on our missile defense plans for reasons I have never \nfully understood. We are only talking about 10 defensive missiles \nagainst hundreds--hundreds, maybe thousands--of Russian missile and \nlaunch vehicles. It would in no way threaten their power. Some \nexperts--and I am inclined to agree--thought it related more to the \nRussian concern about us having a defense relationship with \nCzechoslovakia and Poland, but I don't know. For some reason, it has \nbeen a big deal for them.\n  They have pushed back very hard. From the Bush administration, Doug \nFeith, in a Wall Street Journal article recently said--he negotiated in \n2002--that they pushed back on it at that time. They said they would \nnot sign a treaty unless we agreed not to proceed with missile defense. \nHe said no deal. They insisted, and he said no deal. They said: We \nwon't have a treaty if you don't agree. He said: Well, we won't have a \ntreaty. We don't have a treaty with England, India, Pakistan, China, or \nFrance, who have nuclear weapons. We don't have to have a treaty with \nyou. We are bringing our numbers down anyway, and you are, too. We \nwould like to have a treaty, but we are not going to limit our missile \ndefense. The Russians signed that treaty.\n  Now we come and they start the same bluster against the Obama \nadministration, which, unfortunately, gave in. These negotiations \nstarted early in the year. The treaty negotiations started in March of \n2009. By September of 2009, President Obama unilaterally announced, to \nthe shock of our Polish and Czech allies, that we were not going \nforward with the Polish site--much to the delight of the Russians, who \nhad achieved a significant victory in a negotiating point that had gone \non for many years.\n  So to say that this treaty has nothing to do with missile defense is \nnot correct. Did the Russians say, thank you, we will be glad to work \nwith you on the treaty? No, they still wanted language in the treaty \nthat put them in a position to walk away from this treaty any time they \nwanted to if we deployed a missile defense system in Europe. They got \nit in there, in the preamble. It leaves not just an ambiguity, as I \nsaid earlier, it is a misunderstanding, or a disagreement of a central \nissue. Repeated Russian statements indicate they believe that if we \nmove forward quantitatively or qualitatively with a missile defense \nsystem, then they would have a right to get out of the treaty.\n  I can hear what would happen in the Senate if we start deploying a \nmissile defense system in Europe. A lot of our colleagues would say: If \nwe do that, the Russians will get out of the treaty. We can't do that. \nIt will make it difficult.\n\n[[Page S10681]]\n\n  In addition, the system we were going to deploy was a GBI two-stage \nmissile in central Europe, Poland. The President stopped this. It was \nready and able to be deployed by 2016. It is the same system we have in \nthe United States, except it is two-stage instead of three. The \nNational Intelligence Estimate shows that Iran can reach the United \nStates with a ICBM, and now they are developing nuclear weapons, and \nthey can do it by 2015. We were trying to get this system in by 2016. \nWhen they canceled this, it caused an uproar. The White House said: \nDon't worry, we have a new plan--one I had never heard about. We are \ngoing to do an SM-3 Block 2B. We are working on it. Well, have you \nstarted? No. Is it under development? We just conjured this up. It is a \nbigger, rounder missile than the existing SM-3, and it is quite \ndifferent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator used 6 minutes of his time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I thank the Chair. It is a different thing. It would be \nready only by 2020. So I contend that this administration, as part of \nthe negotiations over this treaty, in their too-anxious-desire to get \nthis treaty, to reset the relationship with the Russians, which we of \ncourse want to do, made a very serious error in capitulating on the \nthird site--sending shock waves among our sovereign nation allies in \nCentral Europe, which used to be a part of the Soviet empire. They have \nmade concessions that are significant.\n  As a matter of fact, they pretend it had nothing to do with the \ntreaty, but I would say there is no doubt that the abandonment of the \nPolish site was a way to gain support of the Russians as part of the \nnegotiations in this treaty. And we now have this ephemeral, chimeric \nvision of a 2020 entirely new missile system for Poland that may or may \nnot ever reach fruition.\n  Those are my concerns. The McCain amendment would say let's get this \nstraight with the Russians and make Congress know that if it requires a \nnew negotiation with the Russians, so be it. Maybe we can reach an \nunderstanding. You could never enter into a treaty or any contract in \nwhich the parties have a serious misunderstanding or actual \ndisagreement on a critical part.\n  I thank the Chair and reserve the remainder of the time on this side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, would you inform me when I have used 4 \nminutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Yes.\n  Mr. KERRY. Our colleagues are fighting against a phantom. All of this \nargument they have been going on for several days with is about \nlanguage that has no binding impact on this treaty whatsoever. Senator \nKyl acknowledged that yesterday. He also acknowledged that if you \nchange it, it requires this treaty to go back to the Russian \nGovernment, and then we don't have this treaty. We don't have any \nverification for whatever number of months that follow. I will come \nback to that.\n  A moment ago, Senator Kyl said the Russians didn't want to continue \nthe verification methods of START. He somehow insinuates that because \nthey didn't want to continue it, what we have here is something less \nthan what we ought to have for ourselves.\n  We didn't want to continue the verification and process of START as \nit existed. In fact, the Bush administration was told that. He knows \nthat. This is phantom debate, what we have going on here. The target is \nthe treaty itself, not this language, because this language doesn't \nhave any legal binding impact on the treaty. In a moment, I will share \nwhat impact it has.\n  Our friends on the other side of the aisle are supplanting their \njudgment for the judgment of Secretary Gates. We have the right to do \nthat, and you can do that. But I ask people to weigh whether Secretary \nGates, who was appointed by George Bush and held over by President \nObama, has anything except the interests of our country at heart when \nhe makes this statement in his testimony:\n\n       So, you know, the Russians can say what they want, but, as \n     Secretary Clinton said, these unilateral statements are \n     totally outside the treaty. They have no standing. They are \n     not binding. They never have been.\n\n  Do you know what the Soviets said at the U.S.-Soviet negotiations on \nnuclear space arms concerning the interrelationship between strategic \ndefensive weapons compliance with the treaty--and this is START I. They \nsaid:\n\n       In connection with the treaty between the United States of \n     America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics on \n     reduction and limitations of strategic defensive arms, the \n     Soviet side states the following: This treaty may be \n     effective and viable only under conditions of compliance with \n     the treaty between the United States and the USSR on the \n     limitation of antiballistic missile systems as signed May 26, \n     1972.\n\n  That was their signing statement, just like this signing statement. \nGuess what. The United States of America saw our national security \ninterests in getting out from under the ABM Treaty. We got out from \nunder the ABM treaty. This language, just like the language we are \ndebating today, meant nothing at all. They stayed in the treaty. They \ndidn't pull out. So we are debating something that has no impact \nwhatsoever on this treaty.\n  Let me go a little further. Secretary Gates said further:\n\n       So from the very beginning of this process, more than 40 \n     years ago, the Russians have hated missile defense.\n       It's because we can afford it and they can't. And we're \n     going to be able to build a good one, and are building a good \n     one, and they probably aren't.\n       And they don't want to devote the resources to it, so they \n     try and stop us from doing it, through political means. This \n     treaty doesn't accomplish that for them.\n\n  My God, after several days, either the Secretary of Defense--and how \nabout LTG Patrick O'Reilly, whose job it is to defend the United States \nagainst missile attack. He is the man who runs this agency day to day. \nYou know what he said:\n\n       Relative to the recently expired START Treaty, New START \n     Treaty [this treaty we are voting on] actually reduces \n     constraints on the development of the missile defense \n     program.\n\n  We have our own leader of the Missile Defense Agency telling us that \nthis is an advantage for the United States of America.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has used 4 minutes.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair. Let me get to the heart of the argument \nabout why this is so critical. The other side is trying to minimize \nthis, saying you can't say that language has no legal binding \nauthority, it is not that important, and turn around and say we can't \nchange it. That is the nub of their argument--that we have to be able \nto change it because, if we don't change it, somehow nonbinding \nlanguage is enough for us to say let's have no verification at all. It \nis a strange tradeoff.\n  Here is why it matters. Because the preamble is in the instrument \nthat is transmitted to the Senate. Even though it is not the binding \ncomponent of it, the rules by which we all play are that if you change \na comma, or one word, that change has to go back to the Government of \nRussia, and they have to decide what they want to do. Why is that \nimportant relative to this language? Because the public position that \nthey fought for in this negotiation was to achieve binding restraints \non U.S. missile defense. That is what they wanted. And as Secretary \nGates said--every general and admiral who has looked at this, including \nAdmiral Mullen and General Chilton, have all said they didn't get that. \nThey didn't win that point. We won that point. In any negotiation, when \nsomebody needs something to be able to feel good, or deal with their \nown politics, sometimes you let them have a little something that is \nmeaningless to you but may mean something to them. That is what we gave \nthem. Take it away and you open this whole treaty. Then they have to \nfigure out how they deal, in other terms, with those politics. I will \nwait until the classified session that we are going to have on Monday. \nI can't go into it here, but I will lay out why this treaty is good for \nthe United States and why we believe reopening it would be dangerous. \nThat is why this amendment is dangerous, because it will reopen this \nand will force--it doesn't constrain us in the least, and the extent to \nwhich that is true, I think, will be understood by a lot of colleagues \nin that session.\n  To make this even more clear, the President of the United States has \nwritten a letter today to Majority Leader Harry Reid and to Minority \nLeader McConnell. In the letter, which Senator Reid has shared with me, \nit says from the President:\n\n       The New START Treaty places no limitations on the \n     development or deployment of\n\n[[Page S10682]]\n\n     our missile defense programs. As the NATO Summit meeting in \n     Lisbon last month underscored, we are proceeding apace with a \n     missile defense system in Europe designed to provide full \n     coverage for NATO members on the continent, as well as \n     deployed U.S. forces, against the growing threat posed by \n     proliferation of ballistic missiles. The final phase of the \n     system will also augment our current defenses against \n     intercontinental ballistic missiles from Iran targeted \n     against the United States.\n       All NATO allies agreed in Lisbon that the growing threat of \n     missile proliferation, and our Article 5 commitment of \n     collective defense, requires that the Alliance develop a \n     territorial missile defense capability.\n\n  It goes on to talk about that capability. Then he says this, which is \ncritical with respect to this debate. This is the President's letter to \nthe leadership:\n\n       In signing the New START Treaty, the Russian Federation \n     issued a statement that expressed its view that the \n     extraordinary events referred to in Article XIV of the Treaty \n     include a ``build-up in the missile defense capabilities of \n     the United States of America such that it would give rise to \n     a threat to the strategic nuclear potential of the Russian \n     Federation.'' Article XIV(3), as you know, gives each Party \n     the right to withdraw from the Treaty if it believes its \n     supreme interests are jeopardized.\n       The United States did not and does not agree with the \n     Russian statement. We believe that the continued development \n     or deployment of U.S. missile defense systems, including \n     qualitative and quantitative improvements to such systems, do \n     not and will not threaten the strategic balance with the \n     Russian Federation, and have provided policy and technical \n     explanations to Russia on why we believe that to be the \n     case. Although the United States cannot circumscribe \n     Russia's sovereign rights under article XIV, paragraph 3, \n     we believe the continued improvement and deployment of \n     U.S. missile defense systems do not constitute a basis for \n     questioning the effectiveness and viability of the New \n     START treaty and, therefore, would not give rise to \n     circumstances justifying Russia's withdrawal from the \n     treaty.\n       Regardless of Russia's actions in this regard, as long as I \n     am President and as long as the Congress provides the \n     necessary funding, the United States will continue to develop \n     and deploy effective missile defenses to protect the United \n     States, our deployed forces, and our allies and partners. My \n     administration plans to deploy all four phases of the EPAA. \n     While advances of technology or future changes in the threat \n     could modify the details or timing of the later phases of the \n     EPAA--one reason this approach is called adaptive--I will \n     take every action available to me to support the deployment \n     of all four phases.\n       Sincerely, Barack Obama, President of the United States.\n\n  I think this letter speaks for itself. I think the facts are history. \nI think the testimony of Secretary Gates and all those others who have \ncome before us that makes it clear the United States has no constraints \non missile defense whatsoever, makes clear this amendment is not \nnecessary, and this amendment carries with it dangerous implications \nfor the ultimate ratification implication of the treaty.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. How much time do I have?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. About 13 minutes.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I will reserve at least the last 3 minutes for my \ncolleague, Senator Kyl.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Very good.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As we all know, we will vote very quickly on the \namendment to the New START treaty. I have offered this amendment along \nwith the Senator from Wyoming, and this amendment is an important and \nseminal one. It is focused on a key flaw in the treaty--the inclusion \nin the preamble of the following clause. I wish to read it in full. We \nhave read it before, and I don't understand how the letter the Senator \nfrom Massachusetts just read would not then force us to negate this \npart of the treaty, which says:\n\n       Recognizing the existence of the interrelationship between \n     strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms, that \n     this interrelationship will become more important as \n     strategic nuclear arms are reduced, and the current strategic \n     defensive arms do not undermine the viability and \n     effectiveness of the strategic offensive arms of the Parties.\n\n  This language carries a lot of historical significance and strategic \nweight because it recognizes an interrelationship between nuclear \nweapons and missile defense. Some believe this type of linkage was \nappropriate during the Cold War, when the United States and the Soviet \nUnion were existential enemies, with the means to annihilate each \nother. But it is not appropriate for today, when the United States and \nthe Russian Federation, for all our differences, are not devoted to one \nanother's destruction and when one of the greatest threats to our \nnational security comes from rogue states such as Iran and North Korea, \nwhich are developing nuclear weapons and increasingly better means to \ndeliver them. In today's world, with so many new and constantly \nevolving threats, the United States can't be limited in the \ndevelopment, deployment, and improvements of missile defense systems \nthat we deem to be in our national security interest.\n  I am concerned, as are many of my colleagues, that the Russian \nGovernment believes this clause from the preamble confers a legal \nobligation on the United States which constrains our missile defenses. \nEver since President Reagan proposed a Strategic Defense Initiative, \nthe Russians have sought to limit our strategic defensive arms. They \nhave sought to limit our missile defense programs through legal \nobligations, and failing that, with political commitments or agreements \nthat could be cited to confer future obligations. Words matter. Words \nmatter.\n  To open ourselves to this type of political threat by accepting an \noutdated interrelationship between nuclear weapons and missile defense \nis wrong. Furthermore, by saying that ``current'' missile defenses do \nnot undermine the treaty's viability and effectiveness, this clause \nfrom the treaty's preamble establishes that future missile defense \ndeployments could undermine the treaty, thereby establishing a \npolitical threat the Russian Federation could use to try to constrain \nU.S. missile defenses. In short, we have handed the Russian Government \nthe political tool they have sought for so long to bind our future \ndecisions and actions on strategic defensive arms.\n  Imagine a world, a few years from now, when--God forbid--an Iran or \nNorth Korea or some other rogue state has developed and deployed longer \nrange ballistic missiles and a deployable nuclear capability much \nearlier than we assessed. Imagine we are faced with a situation where \nunforeseen events compel us, for the sake of our national security and \nthat of our allies, to improve our current systems or to develop and \ndeploy new systems in order to counter a new and far greater threat \nthan we expected. Then consider what the Russian Federation said in a \nunilateral statement at the signing of the treaty.\n  This is the statement of the Russian Federation--something that if \nthe Senator from Massachusetts is correct, we should be able to clarify \nby asking for a statement from the Russian Federation repudiating what \nthey said at the time of the signing statement. This is what they said:\n\n       The treaty between the Russian Federation and the United \n     States of America on Measures for the Further Reduction and \n     Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms signed at Prague on \n     April 8, 2010, may be effective and viable only in conditions \n     where there is no qualitative or quantitative buildup in the \n     missile defense system capabilities of the United States of \n     America.\n\n  That is clear language. That is clear, unequivocal language, and I \nwill repeat it:\n\n       . . . where there is no qualitative or quantitative buildup \n     in the missile defense system capabilities of the United \n     States of America. Consequently, the extraordinary events \n     referred to in Article XIV of the Treaty also include a \n     buildup in the missile defense system capabilities of the \n     United States of America such that it would give rise to a \n     threat to the strategic nuclear force potential of the \n     Russian Federation.\n\n  That is a very clear statement. It is unequivocal as to what the \nRussian Federation is saying. One of the things Senator Graham and I \nand others have said is: Hey, why don't we just drop a letter to the \nRussian Ambassador or to Vlad or whomever and ask them, clarify this, \nwill you? Are you standing by your statement you made at the signing? \nIs that the Russian Federation's official policy that has not been \nrevoked?\n  This is the Russian interpretation of what our two governments have \nagreed to in the preamble. They seem to believe this clause limits U.S. \nmissile defense systems. They seem to believe the language in this \nclause about ``the effectiveness and viability of the Treaty'' means \nthat any buildup or improvement in U.S. missile defense systems would \nundermine the treaty.\n\n[[Page S10683]]\n\nThey seem to believe there is a clear and legally binding connection \nbetween what was agreed to in this clause of the preamble and article \nXIV of the treaty, which establishes the rights of the parties to \nwithdraw from the treaty and the conditions under which they may do so.\n  In short, the Russian Government seems to believe this nonbinding \npolitical agreement is the pretext for a legal obligation under the \ntreaty itself, and if the United States builds up its missile defense, \nRussia will withdraw from the treaty.\n  Let's listen to what the Russian leaders have said. I mean, this is \nnot made up. This is what they have said.\n  The Russian Foreign Minister, on March 28, 2010--this year--said \nthis:\n\n       The treaty and all obligations it contains are valid only \n     within the context of the levels which are now present in \n     the sphere of strategic defensive weapons.\n  What could be more clear? Here he says again, in April of 2010--April \nthis year.\n\n       Linkage to missile defense is clearly spelled out in the \n     accord and is legally binding.\n\n  I mean, if there is any clarification for that statement from the \npreamble, he just gave it--at least what the Russian version is.\n  Here is President Dmitry Medvedev on November 30--18 days ago.\n\n       Either we reach an agreement on missile defense and create \n     a full-fledged cooperation mechanism, or if we can't come to \n     a constructive agreement, we will see another escalation of \n     the arms race. We will have to make a decision to deploy new \n     strike systems.\n\n  Finally, here is Prime Minister Vladimir Putin on ``Larry King \nLive.'' Larry, we will miss you. I have quoted him so many times. This \nwas on ``Larry King Live'' on December 1, 2010.\n\n       If the counter missiles will be deployed in the year 2012 \n     along our borders, or [2015], they will work against our \n     nuclear potential there, our nuclear arsenal. And certainly \n     that worries us. And we are obliged to take some actions in \n     response.\n\n  This is a troubling situation. And it must be corrected by this body. \nLet me quote again from the recent op-ed by former Secretary of State \nCondoleezza Rice in the Wall Street Journal:\n\n       The Senate must make absolutely clear that in ratifying \n     this treaty, the United States is not reestablishing the Cold \n     War link between offensive forces and missile defenses. New \n     START's preamble is worrying in this regard, as it recognizes \n     the interrelationship of the two.\n\n  Now that is a statement by our former Secretary of State, who, by the \nway, wants this treaty ratified, but she also wants us to fix this. \nThis amendment fixes it--this amendment.\n  I appreciate the letter from the President of the United States. I am \nvery grateful for it. But the fact is, letters are letters and \nPresidents don't last forever. But binding treaties do, until they are \neither broken or they are revoked. To have right in the beginning, at \nthe preamble, a clear and unequivocal statement that any improvement in \nour defensive weapon missile systems will then be grounds for \nwithdrawal from the treaty is not anything we should let stand.\n  The simplest way--\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. McCAIN. I thank the Chair. Let me finish.\n  The Senator from Wyoming and I are proposing the amendment which will \nsimply strike the language from the preamble itself. I urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment, and I yield the remainder of my \ntime to the Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, how much time is remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona has 2 minutes 10 \nseconds remaining.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, is there any time remaining on the Democratic \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Twenty-five seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. Is there anyone who would like to take the 25 seconds?\n  Senator Levin will take the remaining 25 seconds?\n  Mr. LEVIN. If no one else wants it, I will be happy to take it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, let me just say that General Chilton, who \nis the commander of our U.S. Strategic Command, told the Armed Services \nCommittee on July 20:\n\n       As the combatant command also responsible for synchronizing \n     global defense plans, operations, and advocacy, I can say \n     with confidence that this treaty does not constrain current \n     or future missile defense plans.\n\n  The McCain amendment would be a treaty killer, and for that reason \nalone the Senate should defeat it.\n  On the issue of the interrelationship of offensive and defensive \narms, which is the text of the Preamble, President George W. Bush \nagreed that such an interrelationship exists. In a joint statement with \nPresident Putin of July 22, 2001, they said: ``We agree that major \nchanges in the world require concrete discussions of both offensive and \ndefensive systems . . . We will shortly begin intensive consultations \non the interrelated subjects of offensive and defensive systems.''\n  As all our senior civilian and military officials acknowledge, the \ntreaty does not limit our missile defense plans or programs. Gen. Kevin \nChilton, the Commander of U.S. Strategic Command, told the Armed \nServices Committee on July 20th that ``As the combatant command also \nresponsible for synchronizing global missile defense plans, operations, \nand advocacy, I can say with confidence that this treaty does not \nconstrain any current or future missile defense plans.''\n  On the issue of ICBM silo conversion for missile defense, which the \ntreaty prohibits, this is not a constraint on our missile defense plans \nor programs. As Lieutenant Gen. Patrick O'Reilly, the Director of our \nMissile Defense Agency said on June 16th: ``replacing ICBMs with \nGround-Based Interceptors or adapting Submarine-Launched Ballistic \nMissiles to be an interceptor would actually be a setback--a major \nsetback--to the development of our missile defenses.''\n  On the subject of the unilateral statements, these are not part of \nthe treaty and do not in any way constrain our missile defenses. We \nfaced a nearly identical situation with the original START treaty, \nwhere Russia issued a unilateral statement saying that if we withdrew \nfrom the ABM Treaty, that would constitute grounds for their withdrawal \nfrom the START treaty. Guess what. We did withdraw from the ABM Treaty, \nbut Russia did not withdraw from START. Our unilateral statement makes \nclear that we intend to develop and deploy missile defenses, regardless \nof the Russian statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Time has expired.\n  The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, to say the treaty doesn't constrain the \nUnited States misses the point of the argument we have been trying to \nmake over the course of the last day and a half.\n  What the Russians have done is establish a legal pretext for \nwithdrawal from the treaty. They have been very clever about it, and up \nto the time we had been told the President had sent us a letter, there \nwas no pushback from the United States.\n  I haven't seen this letter, so it is a little hard to comment on it. \nIt has been given to us 15 minutes before the vote is supposed to \nstart. It hasn't been shared with us. We have no idea what all it says. \nWe have Senator Kerry's quotation of certain parts of it. It is \nobviously a last-ditch effort to try to win votes or preclude an \namendment from passing. It shows the administration is scrambling and \nmaking it up as it goes along. That is not the way to deal with a \nserious subject such as this.\n  Does the letter commit to the GBI--or the ground-based missile--\nbackup for the phased adaptive approach, as was originally announced? \nWell, I don't know whether it says that. Does it repudiate the signing \nstatement of the United States Department of State issued by Secretary \nTauscher, which of course conflicts with the letter and is the official \nposition of the U.S. Government? Does it conflict with the briefing in \nLisbon, where the phased adaptive approach was discussed, and revealed \ndeployment of the first three phases but the fourth phase only being \navailable? When will the deployment occur?\n  The letter, apparently, says we will have effective defenses--\nwhatever that means. What does that mean? When would those effective \ndefenses be deployed? Iran intelligence tells us they will have an ICBM \nby 2015--an ICBM that would require something like the GBI to \nintercept. But we are told the\n\n[[Page S10684]]\n\nGBI is--well, A, we are not told whether the GBI is a contingent backup \nplan; and, B, we are not told whether it will be ready before 2017, \nwhich I find strange. Because I think we already have 24 GBIs in Alaska \nand California, and I don't know why we can't build some more to deploy \nin Europe.\n  So I don't know what to make of this letter. Obviously, it comes at \nthe last minute and hasn't been sent to us, and I don't see how we can \nbase a vote on such a letter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. I believe all time has expired. The Senator \nfrom Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I would like to just interject, with \ntremendous respect for my friend from Arizona, this letter is something \nthat actually I have been seeking too. I know a number of us have asked \nthe President to send this letter. I am glad he sent it.\n  I am going to support the McCain amendment and wish this was not in \nthe preamble. I talked to General Cartwright yesterday who, by the way, \nhas reiterated about what was said about the missile defense system. \nThe preamble in no way limits it. But I wish to say this letter is \nsomething I am glad was sent. I asked for this letter, as numbers of \npeople on our side have asked for.\n  Mr. LUGAR. If the Senator will yield, let me respond. The President \nsent a copy of the letter to Senator McConnell, our leader. Both \nleaders got the letter.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, all postcloture time \nhas expired and the motion to concur with amendment No. 4827 is \nwithdrawn.\n  The question now is on agreeing to motion to concur in the House \namendment to the Senate amendment to H.R. 2965.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The yeas and nays have been requested. Is \nthere a sufficient second? There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nManchin) is necessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Bunning), the Senator from New Hampshire (Mr. \nGregg), and the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Utah (Mr. Hatch) \nwould have voted ``nay,'' and the Senator from Kentucky (Mr. Bunning) \nwould have voted ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nproceed to executive session to resume debate on the START treaty, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Treaty with Russia on Measures for Further Reduction and \n     Limitation of Strategic Offensive Arms.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       McCain/Barrasso amendment No. 4814, to amend the preamble \n     to strike language regarding the interrelationship between \n     strategic offensive arms and strategic defensive arms.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will be 4 minutes of debate equally \ndivided on the McCain amendment.\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, currently the New START treaty \nestablishes limits on missile defense. Placing constraints on future \nU.S. defense capabilities should not be up for debate and should not be \nplaced in a treaty on strategic offensive nuclear weapons. Russia is \ntrying to force the United States to choose between missile defense and \nthe treaty. If that is the case, I choose missile defense. We cannot \ntie our hands behind our back and risk the national security of our \nNation and our allies.\n  This treaty is a bilateral agreement between Russia and the United \nStates. It is clear that there is a disagreement about the actual \nagreement made. Russia continues to claim that the treaty successfully \nlimits our ability to defend ourselves. Supporters of the treaty claim \nthe limitation on missile defense in the preamble is not binding and \nthat it is legally insignificant and a throwaway provision.\n  We are talking about the preamble. Like the preamble to the \nConstitution, ``we the people,'' this is meaningful. Some things we \nhold dear. The safe and the smart decision would be to eliminate the \ndisagreement by getting rid of that provision entirely.\n  I urge all colleagues to support the McCain-Barrasso amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The Senator from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, this amendment is unnecessary because, as \nGeneral Chilton, who is the commander of U.S Strategic Command, said:\n\n       I can say with confidence that this treaty does not \n     constrain any current or future missile defense.\n       Secretary Gates has said that what the Russians wanted to \n     achieve was a restraint. He said this treaty doesn't \n     accomplish that for them.\n\n  Even though the language is completely nonbinding, has no requirement \nin it whatsoever, this amendment requires us to go back to Russia, \nrenegotiate the treaty, open whatever advantages or disadvantages they \nmay perceive since the negotiation exists, and we would go through a \nprolonged negotiation. We have no verification whatsoever today because \nthat ceased on December 5 of last year. We need to hold this treaty \nintact and pass it.\n  I yield whatever remaining time I have to the chairman of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, every one of our military leaders has said \nto the Armed Services Committee and I believe they have reiterated to \nthe Foreign Relations Committee that there\n\n[[Page S10685]]\n\nare no constraints in this treaty on missile defense, period, end of \nquote. These are our top military leaders. They are in charge of \nmissile defense. They say there are no constraints.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there further debate? If not, the question \nis on agreeing to amendment No. 4814.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the preamble to the Treaty to acknowledge the \n interrelationship between non-strategic and strategic offensive arms)\n\n       In the preamble to the New START Treaty, insert after \n     ``strategic offensive arms of the Parties,'' the following:\n       Acknowledging there is an interrelationship between non-\n     strategic and strategic offensive arms, that as the number of \n     strategic offensive arms is reduced this relationship becomes \n     more pronounced and requires an even greater need for \n     transparency and accountability, and that the disparity \n     between the Parties' arsenals could undermine predictability \n     and stability,\n\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President and fellow Senators, what we are going to do \nis, tomorrow, at noon, we are going to start with amendment No. 4839. \nAmendment No. 4839 deals with the relationship between strategic \nweapons, which this treaty deals with, and tactical weapons, which this \ntreaty does not deal with but should. That is essentially the purpose \nof this amendment.\n  I think virtually everyone who is involved in this debate has an \nopinion on this, No. 1. But almost everyone agrees that the issue of \ntactical weapons, namely, short-range weapons, is a very serious issue \nand rises to at least the level of the discussion on strategic weapons, \nand perhaps even more so.\n  So tomorrow we are going to have a spirited discussion about those \nissues. There has actually been quite a bit of debate already on this, \nand for those of you who are like me, and you take the Congressional \nRecord home and read it in the evening, if you go back and look at the \ndebates on the various treaties that dealt with nuclear weapons \ntreaties, you will see that some very bright people, some of whom are \nstill Members of this body, have already spoken on this issue.\n  I am looking forward to having this discussion tomorrow.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I want to talk a little bit about the \nomnibus bill that was pulled down 2 nights ago because there were not \nthe votes from across the aisle to get the bill moving.\n  In that omnibus bill, there was a number of very important projects \nfor every State in the Union. But there were a lot of very important \nprojects for the State of Montana in that bill that I am afraid now \nwill be put on the back burner.\n  Nonetheless, there was also some very important language in the \nomnibus bill. In my particular case, there was language in that bill \nthat was going to help put people back to work, and that language was \ncontained in a bill we call the Forest Jobs and Recreation Act.\n  What this bill does is create 660,000 acres of new wilderness. It \ncreates 370,000 permanent acres in new recreation areas. It requires \nforest restoration and logging of 100,000 acres over 15 years.\n  It is important in Montana for several reasons. The first reason is, \nwe have been attacked by beetles, the bark beetles that have killed a \nlarge percentage of our forests, and we need to give the Forest Service \nthe tools they need to be able to treat that.\n  The second thing is that in the western part of Montana the economy \nhas been hurt pretty badly. The unemployment rate there is the highest \nin our State. This bill will create jobs. Let me give you an example.\n  Over the last year, in Montana, 1,700 jobs were lost in the wood \nproducts industry alone. This bill would help get those folks back to \nwork. How? Well, it would help the folks running the chain saws, doing \nthe cutting in the woods, the mills that create dimension lumber and \nplywood, and those kinds of things, get back up running and employing \npeople.\n  It would help provide the opportunity for biofuels with these trees, \nto be able to get a dependable supply, to be able to put the investment \nin to create biofuels, and move that industry along, to make this \ncountry more energy independent.\n  It would help save our timber infrastructure because, quite frankly, \nif you look at some of the States in the West, that timber \ninfrastructure is gone, and our ability to manage those forests leaves \nus when that timber structure goes. That is not the case in Montana, \nbut we are getting very close. It is why this bill needs to be passed. \nUnfortunately, it does not look as though it is going to happen at this \npoint in time.\n  The other part about this bill--as I said, while there were so many \nprojects in the omnibus, the CBO says this bill is deficit neutral, \nwith no cost to the taxpayers. It is a bipartisan bill. It is a bill we \nhave support for from both sides of the aisle, with Governors and \nSenators and Congressmen and local county commissioners, from both \nparties.\n  It is a bill that the Forest Service, through Secretary Vilsack, \nsupports. It is popular with over 70 percent of Montanans.\n  As I said earlier, we are in dire need of it because our forest is \ndying, with\n\n[[Page S10686]]\n\nover 1 million acres of dead and dying trees. This bill has been the \nsubject of intense public debate for the past year and a half since I \ndropped it in. We had a Senate hearing a year ago, a year ago \nyesterday, I believe it was. We have had townhall meetings, 11 in \ntotal, across Montana. We have had unprecedented transparency with this \nbill, with it being online and explaining and taking input and changing \nthe bill as it has moved forward, making it a better bill. We have \ntaken suggestions from the public, and where we have been able to \naddress those concerns, we have been able to address them straight-up \nand move forward. It really is a new way of doing business for the \nForest Service, for our forested lands, our government-owned forested \nlands in this country.\n\n  It has not been an easy go. This bill would not have happened 10 \nyears ago. It absolutely would not have happened 20 years ago because \nfor the last 30 years we have had gridlock in our forest industry. We \nhave had conservationists and environmentalists and loggers and mill \nowners and recreationists all fighting with one another, and nothing \nhas gotten done in the last 30 years.\n  Well, about 5 years ago these folks got together and they said: You \nknow, we have all been losing. Nobody has been winning. We should set \nour differences aside--and this body should listen to this--set our \ndifferences aside, find a common ground, and move forward with \nsolutions. They did exactly that. It was not easy, but they did exactly \nthat--where everybody gives a little but gets a lot. They sat down at \nthose tables and they met, and they met for years, and they came up \nwith this proposal.\n  Shortly after I was elected, they came to me and said: Would you \ncarry it?\n  I looked at it, and I said: You know what, this bill makes sense. It \nmakes sense for Montana. It makes sense for the West.\n  We were on track to get this bill passed until the omnibus was pulled \nthe other night because of a lack of support. Our No. 1 responsibility \nright now is jobs--jobs, jobs, jobs. This bill helped create jobs, \nhelped put people to work in an industry that needs help.\n  Regardless of what happens from here, it is going to be critically \nimportant that we stay focused on jobs in this body. I will tell my \ncolleagues that I think if we do that and we are successful in that, \nthis country will be a better place. It will be a better place for our \nkids and our grandkids, and it will be a better place for people right \nnow. Quite frankly, I haven't seen a lot of that working together in \nthe last 4 years. When we have a piece of legislation that really isn't \na Democratic piece of legislation or a Republican piece of legislation \nbut, rather, a good piece of legislation, it gets caught up in the \nprocess.\n  I will continue to fight for jobs for everybody in this country, \nparticularly in Montana. We will continue to work to get this bill \npassed and bills like this passed because it is good for the country \nand it gives the agencies--in this case, the Forest Service--the kinds \nof tools they need to manage our forests.\n  As I said before, I was going to ask unanimous consent for the \npassage of this bill. I have been informed that will be objected to, so \nthere is no reason to go through that formality. But I will say we hope \nto bring it up again, and hopefully next time we will be successful \nbecause it is a good bill.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. Mr. President, I wish to respond briefly to my good friend \nfrom Montana.\n  First of all, let me say that I, of course, was at the hearings the \nSenator referred to in our Energy and Natural Resources Committee. \nOrdinarily, I wouldn't involve myself at all in the internal matters in \nMontana. Natural resource issues are best decided by the people who \nlive in the particular counties and in the particular States where that \nresource is located. On this particular issue, however, one of the \nareas of land included in the landmass my good friend from Montana \ndescribed in his bill is an area that is referred to as Mount \nJefferson. Mount Jefferson and the area included admittedly are \nentirely within the State of Montana. However, the only way the \nsouthern part can be accessed is through the State of Idaho.\n  I couldn't agree more with my good friend from Montana in saying that \nwe need to keep our eye on the ball, and that is jobs, jobs, jobs.\n  The particular area in question is not a large area. I think the \ntotal amount is 4,400 acres. The amount I am talking about is about \n2,200 acres, but it is used intensively by Idaho people engaging in \nrecreation in the wintertime. Under my good friend's bill, that would \nhave been closed out, and the snowmobiling particularly would have been \nprohibited in this area, which is the south side of Mount Jefferson.\n  I sincerely appreciate my friend's willingness to talk about this and \nto work on this particular issue. As we go forward with this--and I \nhave no doubt that his commitment to his State will cause him to \ncontinue to work with us on this issue and to deal with this particular \nbill and the areas of land he is talking about in this bill as we go \ninto the next Congress. I commit to work with him, and I hope we can \nresolve this issue. As I say, the issue of winter snowmobiling only as \nfar as motorized use of this particular area is of great importance to \nthe people of the State of Idaho.\n  I thank the Senator for his courtesies thus far, and I look forward \nto working with Senator Tester in the next Congress on this issue.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. TESTER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I appreciate the remarks of the good Senator from Idaho. I understand \nthe Senator's concern as we have talked about the Mount Jefferson issue \nbefore. Overall in the bill, just for the record, we have added 370,000 \nacres of recreation area for exactly that--snowmobiles. That doesn't \nsolve the problem on Mount Jefferson of the 4,400 acres, but we will \ncontinue to work with the Senator from Idaho and move forward to try to \nget something as close to what meets the needs of everybody as we can. \nAs Vince Lombardi once said, the recipe for failure is trying to please \neverybody.\n  I thank the good Senator from Idaho.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Byron always liked to joke that he \ngraduated in the top 10 of his class of 9 students.\n  Senators on both sides of the aisle have come to respect and admire \nSenator Dorgan's distinctive voice here in the Senate, a voice that \nmixes keen intelligence with a great sense of humor, plus a gift for \nmaking his arguments with colorful, compelling stories and language. \nThroughout his more than four decades in public service, he has used \nthat voice to speak out powerfully for farm country in rural America. \nHe has fought hard for policies at the national level to give rural \nfamilies a better chance at success. He has been a strong supporter of \nthe farm bill's safety net provisions, including countercyclical \nsupport for farmers to get them through hard times, and he has been \nequally outspoken in championing strict limits on Federal farm payments \nto ensure that the lion's share goes to small family farms, not big \nagribusiness and absentee farm owners.\n\n  As a senior member of the Energy and Natural Resources Committee and \nchair of the Appropriations Committee's Energy and Water Development \nSubcommittee, Senator Dorgan has always been an outspoken champion of \nclean, renewable, homegrown energy, including wind and solar and \nbiofuels.\n\n[[Page S10687]]\n\nHe likes to boast that North Dakota is ``the Saudi Arabia of wind.'' \nWell, my folks in Iowa might dispute that claim, but we get the point. \nByron and I have both been strong advocates of building a nationwide \ndistribution grid for wind- and solar-generated energy.\n  I wish to make just one more point about Senator Dorgan. I guess I \ncan say this now since he is retiring and a political opponent won't be \nable to use it against him. Byron Dorgan is an intellectual. He has a \npassion for ideas and knowledge. He even writes books--actually, really \ngood books, the kind that show up on the New York Times bestseller \nlist. I am a great fan of his 2007 book entitled ``Take This Job and \nShip It: How Corporate Greed and Brain-Dead Politics Are Selling Out \nAmerica.'' If you want a blistering and I think dead-on account of the \ncauses of the crash of 2008, read Byron's other book entitled \n``Reckless! How Debt, Deregulation, and Dark Money Nearly Bankrupted \nAmerica.''\n  I consider Byron Dorgan a great friend, a great Senator, and a great \nadvocate for all working people in this country. He has accomplished \nmany things in his three terms here in the Senate, but I can think of \nno greater accolade than to say simply that he is a good and decent and \nhonest person with a passion for social justice and a determination to \nmake life better for ordinary Americans.\n  When the 111th Congress comes to a close, of course, my friendship \nwith Byron will continue, but I will miss his day-to-day counsel and \ngood humor. I join with the entire Senate family in wishing Byron and \nKim the best in the years ahead.\n\n\n                                Kit Bond\n\n  Mr. President, with the retirement of Senator Kit Bond at the close \nof this Congress, the Senate will lose one of its most respected \nveteran Members, and a truly distinguished individual with a \ndistinguished career in public service will come to an end. Of course, \nwe would expect big things from a young man who graduated with honors \nfrom Princeton and first in his class at the University of Virginia Law \nSchool, and Kit Bond did not disappoint.\n  At age 30, he became assistant attorney general of Missouri, serving \nunder former Senator John Danforth. At age 33, he was elected Governor \nof the State of Missouri, serving two terms. In 1986, he was elected to \nthe Senate, where he has now served for nearly a quarter of a century.\n  Over the years, Kit Bond has been a great friend and a frequent \ncollaborator, especially on the Appropriations Committee. For example, \nin 1993, when the Midwest was devastated by historic floods, Senator \nBond was the senior appropriator in the minority party from the nine \nimpacted States, and I was the senior appropriator in the majority \nparty. We took the lead in the Senate, working together very \neffectively to rally Federal assistance to victims all across the \nstricken Midwest.\n  Over the years, we have worked together to improve the locks and dams \nalong the Upper Mississippi. I can say I think we are both proud of our \nwork in the early part of this decade, forging an agreement to \nauthorize the modernization of five of the critical locks so that our \ngoods can move more efficiently up and down the river. We worked very \nhard for about 4 years to bring together a remarkable coalition of \nindustry and agriculture and the environmental community to make this \nproject possible.\n  Senator Bond and I are members of a breed of Senators affectionately \nknown around here as ``pavers.'' We both believe very strongly that it \nis a cardinal responsibility of the Federal Government to invest \ngenerously in a first-class national transportation infrastructure--the \nroads, the bridges, the locks, the dams, and so on--what we call the \narteries and the veins of commerce.\n  Senator Bond and I have also collaborated frequently to boost the \nrural economy and improve the quality of life of the people who live in \nour rural communities. In particular, we have used funding through the \nHousing and Urban Development Subcommittee of Appropriations to approve \nhousing for people of modest means, with a particular focus on rural \nareas. On this score, I would note Senator Bond was a ``compassionate \nconservative'' long before that term came into fashion. He cares deeply \nabout the well-being of the less fortunate in our society, giving them \nboth a helping hand and a hand up. In the mid-1990s, I was proud to \nwork with Senator Bond on the first bipartisan welfare reform bill, \nmodeled, I might say, on the very successful welfare-to-work program we \nhad in Iowa.\n  Over the years, Senator Bond has recruited and retained an \nexceptionally talented staff.\n  In particular, I will cite Jon Kamarck, his outstanding lead staffer \nfor many years on the Appropriations Committee, with whom I have had \nthe pleasure of working on many occasions. I know Senator Bond also \nplaces great store by his long-time staffer and current chief of staff, \nBrian Klippenstein--who, by the way, had the good sense to marry a \nDemocrat from the State of Iowa.\n  Mr. President, the Senate has been fortunate to have a Senator of Kit \nBond's high caliber and character for the last 24 years. In so many \nways, he represents the very best in this body--a passion for public \nservice, a willingness to reach across the aisle to get important \nthings done, and an insistence on the highest ethical standards. He has \nalways been determined to do the right thing for the people of Missouri \nand the entire United States.\n  For me, it has been a great honor to be his friend and colleague for \nthe last 24 years. Our friendship, of course, will continue. And I wish \nKit and Linda the very best in the years ahead.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at the \nconclusion of my remarks, Senator Harkin be recognized again, followed \nby Senator Carper, and then Senator Brown.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/18/senate-section/article/S10687-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10687-S10688]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMENDING CONGRESSMAN PATRICK J. KENNEDY\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise to make a few brief remarks in \nhonor of Congressman Patrick Joseph Kennedy of Rhode Island.\n  With Patrick's departure from the House of Representatives to seek \nnew challenges and enjoy some well-earned time out of the political \nspotlight, my home State of Rhode Island is losing a champion for \nworking families and our country is losing a public servant who did as \nmuch as anyone else to care for and lift those in the shadows of life.\n  It is a moment to thank Patrick for his many contributions to the \nlives of Rhode Islanders over his 16 years of service in the House but \nalso a moment to reflect on his unique place in the political history \nof our country.\n  After all, the 112th Congress will be the first in more than half a \ncentury in which no member of the Kennedy family is serving in either \nthe House or the Senate.\n  In Rhode Island, a State that he adopted, and that adopted him/he \nfirst entered public service at the young age of 21, winning his \ncongressional seat a few short years later in 1994, one of only four \nGOP seats Democrats won in that election.\n  Over the years, Patrick continually faced capable and well-funded \nopponents, but his constituents had come to recognize and welcome his \nhumble dedication to their lives, re-electing him seven times. He was \nmy younger, but senior, colleague on our delegation.\n  The arena of politics is combative--all the more so when your last \nname is Kennedy--but Patrick persevered, and he persevered despite his \nown health and addiction challenges.\n  And instead of running from those challenges, instead of hiding from \nthose challenges, Patrick had the courage and wisdom to realize that \nthe problem he was experiencing was a problem shared by millions of \nfamilies in America. Instead of hiding from public scrutiny, he stood \ntall--not only on his own behalf, but also on behalf of Americans who \nneeded a champion to bring their struggles to the forefront of the \nnational agenda.\n  With that, Patrick's campaign for mental health parity took fire, \nresulting in passage of the landmark Mental Health Parity Act of 2008, \nan achievement Speaker Nancy Pelosi described as ``the legislative feat \nof the century.''\n  In that fine cause, Patrick had the chance to work with a towering \nchampion of civil rights, the lion of the Senate, his father.\n\n[[Page S10688]]\n\n  Peer to peer, man to man, they hashed out the final bill in \nconference. The father, with his easy, booming laugh and affectionate \ncamaraderie; the son, with his fierce but quiet determination.\n  Thus did Patrick help lift up millions of Americans. Thus did he earn \na place alongside his father--a man he called his hero, his \ninspiration. Thus did he emerge as a champion for so many who needed \none so badly. Thus did he uphold the best traditions of the family and \nthe Nation he loved.\n  Patrick has proudly carried on his family's spirit of service and \ntheir fight for social justice. And to be sure, he has always been \nproud to be Teddy's son. ``From the countless lives he lifted,'' \nPatrick said, ``to the American promise he helped shape, My father \ntaught me that politics at its very core/was about serving others.''\n  In the service of others, Patrick too brought to the rough and tumble \nof politics/traits that made him unique, and he left behind \naccomplishments that allow him to stand on his own as one of the great \nlegislators of our time.\n  Indeed, of all the descendents of President Kennedy, and of Bobby \nKennedy, and of our own late colleague Ted Kennedy, it was Patrick who \nlast held public office, Patrick who longest held public office, \nPatrick who youngest held political office, and Patrick who most \nsuccessfully used public office to further the family's mission of \nlifting up every American.\n  Patrick's success as a Member of Congress came not easily, not from \nthe charm charisma so characteristic in his family but rather from \nsimple hard work, unshakeable integrity, and his formidable \ndetermination to win what others had sought.\n  Henry Wadsworth Longfellow wrote in ``The Ladder of St. Augustine'':\n\n       The heights by great men reached and kept,\n   Were not achieved by sudden flight,\n  But they, while their companions slept,\n  Were toiling upward in the night.\n\n  The story of Patrick Kennedy is not a story of glamorous sudden \nflight to glory. It is a tale of long and silent toil, upward, and in \nthe night, in the shadow of his own challenges.\n  The best part of this story is that Patrick's work is not yet \nfinished. Neither his father nor his uncles got to experience life \nafter public service. But, stepping away from the Congress at the age \nof 43, Patrick's road stretches ahead for many more miles.\n  I know that Patrick will continue to look for ways to give back to \nthe State that gave him a chance to serve and the Nation that gave his \nfamily a chance to thrive. And he will always enjoy the gratitude of \nRhode Islanders whom he has served so well and Americans whose burdens \nhe has helped to relieve. And I will always be proud to consider him a \nlegislative inspiration, a political ally, and a beloved friend.\n  Patrick, thank you. And I wish you all the best in this new \nbeginning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, with the close of the 111th Congress, the \nSenate will lose to retirement Senator Russ Feingold of Wisconsin--a \nproud progressive, a fearless reformer, and a genuine maverick in the \nvery best sense of that much-abused term.\n  During his three terms in this body, Senator Feingold has been a \nworthy successor to another great progressive reformer from Wisconsin, \nSenator Robert ``Fighting Bob'' LaFollette, whose desk I am proud to \noccupy, here on the Senate floor--and whose portrait is displayed \nprominently in Senator Feingold's office.\n  Like Senator LaFollette, Russ Feingold knows that it is not enough to \nbe on the side of the angels. It is not enough to have our hearts in \nthe right place. Progressivism, by its very nature, is a fight against \nentrenched corporate interests, entrenched economic privilege, and \nentrenched political power. If we are going to succeed against these \nforces, we have to know how to fight, and we have to be willing to \nfight. And, as our colleagues here in the Senate know very well, \nSenator Feingold is equally skilled at building bridges across the \naisle and tenaciously carrying the fight to those who oppose \nprogressive change.\n  Most famously, we witnessed these talents during Senator Feingold's \nrelentless campaign to pass the landmark 2002 Bipartisan Campaign \nReform Act, better known as the McCain-Feingold law. Senator Feingold \nand his legislative partner, Senator John McCain, championed this \nlegislation for nearly 2 years, overcoming stiff resistance from both \nparties, as well as from powerful interests outside the Senate. They \nfaced countless obstacles but refused to give up. They won.\n  Again, in 2007, in the wake of the Abramoff scandals, Senator \nFeingold played the key role in pushing through the Honest Leadership \nand Open Government Act, a tough ethics and lobbying reform bill, which \nincluded stringent disclosure requirements and a crack-down on abusive \npractices by lobbyists.\n  As chair of the Judiciary Committee's Constitution subcommittee, \nSenator Feingold cast the Senate's lone vote against the USA PATRIOT \nAct.\n  For nearly two decades in this body, Senator Feingold has been an \noutspoken champion of working Americans--fighting for safer workplaces, \nthe right to organize, stronger public schools, better access to higher \neducation and health care. He has always stood up for Wisconsin's \nfamily farmers and rural communities.\n  Senator Feingold has accomplished important and even historic things \nduring his tenure as U.S. Senator. But, in my book, the highest \naccolade is simply that Russ Feingold is a good and decent person, with \na passion for fairness, social justice, and honest government.\n  For me, it has been a great honor to be his friend and colleague for \nthe last 18 years. Our friendship, of course, will continue--as will \nRuss Feingold's fight for the progressive causes we both believe in.\n  Our great friend Paul Wellstone used to say that ``the future belongs \nto those with passion.'' By that definition, Russ Feingold has a \nwonderful future ahead of him. I join with the entire Senate family in \nwishing him the very best in the years ahead.\n\n\n                             Robert Bennett\n\n  Mr. President, in these closing days of the 111th Congress, the \nSenate will be saying farewell to one of our most seasoned and \naccomplished Members, respected on both sides of the aisle, Senator \nRobert Bennett of Utah.\n  Certainly, no one in this body doubts Senator Bennett's staunch \nconservative values and principles, especially on fiscal and regulatory \nissues. But, throughout his 18 years in this body, Senator Bennett has \nbeen a consensus builder, willing to reach across the aisle in order to \nget important things done for the people of Utah and of the entire \nUnited States. Clearly, this thoughtfulness has caused him to lose \nfavor with the more extreme wing of his party, for which he paid a \nprice during the primary election this year. I know I am not alone in \nmourning the loss of one of the Senate's most thoughtful conservatives.\n  For example, he partnered with Senator Ron Wyden of Oregon in \nadvocating a legislation to provide universal health insurance \ncoverage.\n  And in response to the financial crisis of 2008, as a senior member \nof the Senate banking committee, he supported the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act. Senator Bennett was widely criticized by those on \nthe right, as was I for the same vote by critics on the left. But he \ncan take great pride in it, because facts are facts: the Troubled \nAssets Relief Program prevented a total meltdown of our financial \nsystem. And almost the entire $700 billion taxpayer investment has \nbeen--or soon will be--paid back to the Treasury. In fact, just this \nweek, the Treasury booked a $12 billion profit on its previous $45 \nbillion TARP investment in Citigroup.\n  I have been proud to call Bob Bennett my friend for the last 18 \nyears, and I count myself fortunate to have served with him on the \nAppropriations Committee. He is a gentleman, a bridge-builder, a person \nof rock-solid character and integrity.\n  I join with the entire Senate family in wishing Bob and Joyce the \nvery best in the years ahead.\n\n\n                            blanche lincoln\n\n  Mr. President, in these closing days of the 111th Congress, the \nSenate will\n\n[[Page S10689]]\n\nbe saying farewell to one of our most popular Members, Senator Blanche \nLincoln of Arkansas.\n  During her 12 years in this body, at a time when the Senate has \nbecome increasingly partisan and ideologically divided, Senator Lincoln \nhas charted an alternative course. She has cultivated friendships and \ncollaborations on both sides of the aisle, and has been skilled in \nforging bipartisan agreements on a wide range of issues.\n  Last year, Senator Lincoln succeeded me as chair of the Agriculture \nCommittee. I would note that she is the first Arkansan and the first \nwoman to serve in that position.\n  She has used that position to champion causes that have been her \npassion for many years, including revitalizing rural communities, \nsupporting family farmers, promoting biofuels and other forms of \nrenewable energy, and advocating for better nutrition for our school-\naged children.\n  Senator Lincoln is leaving the Senate at the very top of her game. \nJust this week, President Obama signed into law the Claims Resolution \nAct of 2010, the culmination of Senator Lincoln's efforts to provide \njustice for African-American farmers who suffered decades of \ndiscrimination in agricultural programs.\n  Also this week, President Obama signed into law the Healthy, Hunger-\nFree Kids Act, which will become a major part of Senator Lincoln's \nlegacy as a Senator.\n  When I handed over the gavel of the Senate Agriculture Committee to \nSenator Lincoln last year, much work had been done on the child \nnutrition bill but much remained to be done. Senator Lincoln did a \nfantastic job--a masterful job--of taking over the child nutrition \nauthorization and shepherding it to a unanimous approval by the Senate. \nThanks to her leadership, low-income children will have increased \naccess to Federal nutrition programs, the nutritional quality of the \nprograms will improve, and the financial foundation of the National \nSchool Lunch Program will be greatly reinforced.\n  Senator Lincoln also exhibited extraordinary leadership earlier this \nyear in the Wall Street reform bill. Again, as the chair of the Senate \nAgriculture Committee, she was able to forge bipartisan consensus for \nstrong reform of the derivatives market. Indeed, the provision she \nchampioned will help to restore integrity to the derivatives markets, \nit will allow companies to safely use derivatives to manage their \nbusiness risk, and it will help to prevent future financial crisis. I \nwas proud to support her in those efforts.\n  For the last 12 years in this body, Senator Lincoln has been a \ntireless advocate for the people of her State of Arkansas, for American \nagriculture, for rural Americans, and for families with small kids. She \nhas been an outstanding Senator and a wonderful friend. I join with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle in wishing Blanche and Steve and \ntheir twin boys Reece and Bennett the very best in the years ahead.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I thank my colleague for his \nforbearance.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Before Senator Harkin leaves the floor, let me say I am \nso pleased that I was literally able to be here on the floor and hear \nyou talk about our colleagues. What a wonderful thing to do, and to \nsingle out Democrats and Republicans and to reflect upon their service \nto their States and to our country. I had to mention that.\n  You mentioned Blanche Lincoln. A lot of people say I respect my \ncolleague, I think highly of my colleague, but here in the Senate we \nlove Blanche. We love Blanche and her family. She is such a joy to work \nwith. Always up, even during the course of the tough year she has had. \nI remember her more than once saying what doesn't kill you makes you \nstronger. And she has come through this with a smile and such grace, it \nis just remarkable. I loved working with her on the Finance Committee, \nespecially on the health care bill that is designed to provide better \noutcomes for less money.\n\n\n                              Bob Bennett\n\n  You mentioned Bob Bennett. He and I served on the Banking Committee \nfor a number of years. In the end, he lost his seat I think because of \nhis willingness to do what we were rewarded for in Delaware, and that \nis to reach across the aisle and find ways for Republicans and \nDemocrats to do things together. We will certainly miss him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/18/senate-section/article/S10689-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10689]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             RUSS FEINGOLD\n\n  Russ Feingold may be best known for his work on campaign finance \nreform, but I admire his work very much on helping to strengthen the \nPresident's rescission powers.

Mr. President, in November 1948--that was 1 year after my \nbirth--President Harry Truman issued a highly controversial Executive \nOrder. It called for beginning the process to bring to an end the \nlongstanding policy of racial segregation in the Armed Forces of our \nNation.\n  Just a few years earlier, my father and three of my uncles had served \non active duty for much of World War II. One of them--Bob Patton--was \nkilled in a kamikaze attack on his aircraft carrier, the USS Suwannee \nin 1944. But all four of them--my dad and three uncles--were born and \nraised near the coal mining town of Beckley, WV, where my sister and I \nwere born after the war.\n  Neither my father nor my uncles ever discussed with us the \nimplication of President Truman's Executive Order. Having said that, I \nlater learned that many of the people in my native State opposed it, as \ndid many people in Danville, VA, the last capital of the Confederacy \nand the place where my sister and I would grow up.\n  The transition that followed President Truman's actions was not an \neasy one, but history would later show the steps he ordered 62 years \nago this year were the right ones for our military and for our country.\n  Twenty years after Truman's historic action, I was commissioned an \nensign in the Navy and headed for Pensacola, FL, to begin the training \nthat would enable me to become a naval flight officer. I had just \ngraduated from Ohio State University--the Ohio State University, I \nguess--which I attended on a Navy ROTC scholarship. My sister was not \nin our ROTC unit at Ohio State. In fact, there were no women in that \nunit, and to the best of my knowledge there were no women in any of our \nROTC units across the country nor in our military service academies in \nAmerica either.\n  A lot of people thought that was fine, and while there were women who \nserved then in our Armed Forces, they were denied the opportunities \nthat I and a lot of other men had that enabled us to advance in rank \nand to assume positions of ever greater responsibility. I went on to \nserve in Southeast Asia and retire as a Navy captain after 23 years of \nactive and reserve duty. No women served with us in my active-duty \nsquadron, but as the years passed that began to change. Young women \ngained admission into ROTC programs in colleges and universities across \nAmerica and into our service academies as well. They became pilots, \nthey flew airplanes, helicopters, served on ships, and someday, before \ntoo long, they will serve on some submarines as well.\n  Today, women are admirals and they are generals. While there is still \nresistance to the transition that continues to this day--and much of \nthat is understandable--most of us who have lived through it would \nagree this change has helped to make our military and our Nation \nstronger.\n  Today, we face a different kind of transition--a challenging one, \ntoo--and that is whether to end the policy of don't ask, don't tell. \nConfronted with this question and how to answer it, I have sought the \ncounsel of a number of people over the past year whose wisdom I value. \nForemost among them has been our Secretary of Defense Bob Gates. He has \ngraciously shared his thoughts on this difficult and contentious issue \nwith me and with many of my colleagues, both in private and in public \nforums.\n\n[[Page S10690]]\n\n  Today I stand in agreement with the Secretary and with ADM Mike \nMullen, the Chairman of our Joint Chiefs of Staff. The time has come to \nrepeal the law that requires young men and women to lie about who they \nare in order to serve their country.\n  Having said that, however, I also agree with them that this \ntransition--like several of the others I have talked about--must be \ndone in a way that eases the military into this change over time so \nthat it does not adversely affect or undermine our military readiness, \nour ability to recruit, and our morale.\n  The proposal we approved an hour or so ago seeks to do exactly that. \nIt will empower Secretary Gates and our other military leaders to \ncarefully implement a repeal of don't ask, don't tell in the months \nahead. Repeal is not something that is going to happen overnight. The \nSecretary and the Joint Chiefs are going to do this in a deliberate and \nresponsible way, and it will take some time. Our military leaders have \nmade it clear they want Congress to act now, though, to enable them to \nbegin to implement this repeal of don't ask, don't tell in a thoughtful \nmanner rather than to have the courts force them into it overnight.\n  I support that approach. I support the approach recommended by our \nmilitary leaders. I stand behind Secretary Gates and our Nation's other \nmilitary leaders as they prepare to lead our military and our Nation \nthrough this historic transition, rather than to allow the courts to do \nit for us in ways that we may some day live to regret.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

We need to be doing everything we can \nto protect our national security and to reduce the threat from nuclear \nweapons. But while we debate these issues in front of the public, \nbehind the scenes, away from public scrutiny, the Federal \nCommunications Commission is about to decide two distinct but very \nclosely related issues that have the potential to change dramatically \nthe way we get our entertainment, the way we communicate with one \nanother, and, most importantly, the way we use the Internet.\n  The first matter before the FCC is the proposed merger of Comcast and \nNBC/Universal. There is no question in my mind that regardless of what \nyou hear from industry, this merger will be bad for consumers on many \nlevels. It will allow Comcast to exploit NBC/Universal's content, \ncharging other cable networks more for access to NBC shows and movies. \nDo you know what that will do? It will raise your cable bills. And NBC/\nUniversal--which actually owns 37 broadcast or cable networks--will be \nfavored by Comcast to the exclusion of other independent or competing \nnetworks. This means Comcast will pay less to carry channels such as \nthe Discovery Network, the Food Channel, Bloomberg, or the Tennis \nChannel--threatening their financial viability--or these channels will \nbe relegated to the graveyard around channel 690 or 691 or 692, or \ncustomers will have to pay even more each month to buy access to these \nchannels.\n  This is bad for consumers because it is going to put many of these \nnetworks out of business. That means less choice and more Comcast/NBC \nprogramming.\n  But it doesn't end there. Comcast also happens to be the Nation's \nleading wireline broadband Internet provider, which means this single \ncompany will both own the programming and run the pipes that bring us \nthat programming. Here again, Comcast will be able to use its \noverwhelming market share--and in many markets its near monopoly in the \nInternet business--to favor its own video services, say, its OnDemand \nservice, over companies such as Netflix, that are cheaper and would \notherwise win on a level playing field.\n  These are all major problems with the deal. But it might be tough to \nunderstand in the abstract how this deal will affect you, so let me \ntake a minute or two to make this more concrete.\n  I ask the people sitting in the gallery, the Senate staff watching \nthis speech, and everyone at home in Minnesota: How many of you like \nyour cable and Internet provider?\n  When you call Comcast or Verizon or AT about a problem, how many of \nyou get good service? How many of you like the prices you pay?\n  When you decide you want to sign up for broadband, and Comcast tells \nyou that they aren't sure when they can come to install your service, \nand then finally you get an appointment and you have to take a day off \nfrom work to wait between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m. for a repairman to come, \nand then he doesn't come, is that how you feel you deserve to be \ntreated?\n  Are you getting good service when you call Verizon and spend 10 \nminutes listening to automated messages and pressing numbers that \ndirect you to more automated messages, and then finally--finally--you \nget a human being on the line but that person tells you that he or she \ncan't help you and you get put on hold again; is that how you deserve \nto be treated? Are you getting good service?\n  When you have had enough with bad service and rapidly rising bills \nand you decide you want to switch to another company, how many of you \nhave found that you don't have another choice? That there is no other \ncable provider in your area?\n  I can tell you that right now, Comcast has about 23 million cable \nsubscribers and about 16 million Internet subscribers. They are already \nthe largest provider of cable service to Americans by a very large \nmargin, and in some areas, they have a total monopoly.\n  And this is what cable and Internet customer service is like today. \nDo you think that merging the single largest cable provider, which is \nalso the largest wireline Internet provider, with one of the biggest TV \nand movie studios in the country, will make any of this better? Do you \nthink it will lead to lower prices on your cable and Internet bills? Do \nyou think it will mean more choice for what you can watch and download \nat home? Do you think it will mean better customer service?\n  I can assure you that the answer to these questions is no, no, no, \nand no.\n  We count on competition in this country to keep corporations in \ncheck, and we have designed antitrust laws to ensure that companies are \nnot getting too big or too powerful. These laws were designed to \nprotect consumers, because the one thing we know about corporations is \nthat they are created to maximize shareholder profit--not to protect \nconsumers.\n  There is nothing wrong with that. We want corporations to grow, and \ncreate jobs, and provide goods and services. There are some great \ncorporations based in Minnesota, like General Mills and 3M. In addition \nto providing you Cheerios and Post-it notes, these companies put a lot \nof Minnesotans to work.\n  But when you go shopping for cereal, you have a lot of choice. \nGeneral Mills may produce Cheerios, but they have to compete with \ncompanies such as Kellogg's, which makes Corn Flakes, and Post, which \nmakes Fruity Pebbles. And they all have to compete with the store or \nvalue brands.\n  Let's look at another example of the benefits of competition. When \nyou go out for dinner at a restaurant, you usually have a lot of \noptions. I am guessing you don't go back to the restaurant that served \nyou limp lettuce, mediocre meatloaf, and cold, lumpy mashed potatoes. \nAnd I am guessing you wouldn't go back if they told you that you would \nbe served sometime between 9 a.m. and 2 p.m.\n  Unfortunately, you don't always have that kind of choice when it \ncomes to your cable and Internet service. And this is only going to get \nworse if the FCC allows the merger between Comcast and NBC to sail \nthrough. It is competition--and regulation where there isn't \ncompetition--that keeps corporations accountable to consumers.\n  But don't take my word for it. You can already see what Comcast has \nup its sleeve. If the merger is allowed to go through, as I mentioned \nbefore, we can expect Comcast to favor its own content and leave \nconsumers with less choice.\n  Take the Tennis Channel, which filed a complaint against Comcast \nearlier\n\n[[Page S10691]]\n\nthis year. It alleged that Comcast has been favoring the Golf Channel \nand its own sports channel, Versus, by making those channels available \nas part of its basic cable package, while putting the Tennis Channel on \na so-called ``premium tier.'' In other words, if you get cable from \nComcast, you get the Golf Channel and Versus for free, but if you want \nto watch the Australian Open on the Tennis Channel, you need to pay \nanother $5 to $8 per month.\n  Yet, Comcast pays the Tennis Channel only a fraction of what it pays \nitself to carry the Golf Channel or Versus, which are much less \npopular.\n  I fear this is a sign of things to come. As media conglomerates get \nbigger and bigger, they have every incentive to make their own content \neasier and cheaper to access than everyone else's content.\n  Now, I have been talking to a lot of people about the possible impact \nof this merger, and do you know what I keep hearing? Do you know what \nsmall businesses and cable programmers are telling me? They are coming \nto my office discreetly, and they are saying that they oppose this \nmerger--but they can't speak out because they are worried about \nretaliation from Comcast. And to me, that is the definition of a \ncompany with too much market share.\n  Comcast has put out the word that this merger is a fait accompli. \nThey have announced a slate of 43 officers for NBC, despite promising \nto refrain from doing so until the review of the merger is complete.\n  So it is no surprise that small--and some not so small--cable \nnetworks see the writing on the wall and are not willing to take the \nchance of opposing this deal publicly, again, for fear of retaliation \nby Comcast.\n  And they are probably right. If this deal goes through, Comcast will \nhave the power to put them out of business. If you knew that, would you \nstand up and complain to the FCC about Comcast? Probably not.\n  This type of anticompetitive conduct is exactly why we need the \nDepartment of Justice and the FCC to stop this merger.\n  And this merger is only the first domino in a cascade that is sure to \ncome. Make no mistake, if this merger is approved, if this deal goes \nthrough, it will be only a year or 2 before we see AT trying to buy \nABC/Disney, or Verizon trying to buy CBS/Viacom. And you know what \nthese companies will say? ``You let Comcast and NBC do it, now it is \nour turn.'' And what will the FCC or the Department of Justice say \nthen?\n  Now is the time to decide whether we want four or five companies \nowning and delivering all content. Imagine a world with no independent \nvoices, and no competition.\n  But now let me go back specifically to Comcast. Not just its cable \nprofile. Let's talk about Comcast's control of the Internet. There is \nno better example of how Comcast plans to use its virtual monopoly than \nwhat we have seen in the last few weeks with its treatment of Netflix.\n  I think we can all agree that Netflix has changed the way many \nAmericans watch movies, and it all started because one of its founders \nwas sick of paying late fees for movie rentals. This company is one of \nour Nation's great success stories--it now has almost 17 million \nsubscribers and generates hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue--\nand it all happened in just over a decade. But most importantly, it \noffered an alternative and less expensive option for consumers to watch \nmovies.\n  Netflix now has a lot of money and can write big checks to buy movies \nand video content, so I didn't think I needed to worry about them. But \nthen I heard that being the highest bidder for content may not be \nenough.\n  As it turns out, cable companies are worried about Netflix's success. \nIt represents the first real competition they have seen in a long time, \nand they want to shut Netflix down. How can they do that? By cutting \noff Netflix's access to the things people want to watch. And when is \nthis most problematic? First, it is when Netflix's competitors--like \nComcast or Time Warner Cable--also own the programming that Netflix \ncarries. Second, it is when Netflix's competitors are also the ones \nthat sell--and control--access to the Internet.\n  Neither of these are theoretical. Just last week, Time Warner's CEO \nbrazenly stated that Netflix's deals with Time Warner may not be \nrenewed. Other studio executives are saying the same thing.\n  And what I am hearing is that Comcast, which is not yet even in \ncontrol of NBC, plans to reverse course and ultimately pull NBC/\nUniversal's programming from Netflix.\n  Comcast also recently announced that they are imposing a new fee on \nLevel 3 Communications, the company slated to become the primary \ndelivery mechanism and backbone for Netflix's online streaming movies \nand TV shows. Coincidentally, Netflix is one of Comcast's main \ncompetitors for video delivery, which makes this price hike seem just a \nlittle fishy to me.\n  Regardless of Comcast's motives for charging Level 3, this is a clear \nwarning sign of what we can all expect if this deal goes through.\n  If this deal goes through, Comcast will make it harder and more \nexpensive for you to watch movies online through any service other than \nits own. If this deal goes through, Comcast will have the power to \nlimit your choices to watching Comcast-owned content over Comcast's \nservices, like its video OnDemand service.\n  I use the phrase ``if this deal goes through'' because this is \nexactly the sort of anticompetitive behavior that the Department of \nJustice and the FCC are supposed to stop.\n  What is even more ludicrous is that this is happening when Comcast \nand NBC should be on their best behavior. Right now, they are under \nclose scrutiny by two Federal agencies, the FCC and the DOJ. Yet they \nseem to be making even more bold-faced power grabs without any concern \nabout government oversight.\n  But in addition to the Comcast-NBC merger, what is also before the \nFCC is a new set of proposed rules that will make it easier for large \nmedia conglomerates--like Comcast--to do nothing short of controlling \nthe Internet. The chairman of the FCC is calling this a ``net \nneutrality'' proposal. But let's be clear. This is not real net \nneutrality.\n  I believe this is one of the most serious issues facing our country \ntoday. Let me take a step back and explain what net neutrality is. Put \nsimply, it is the idea that big corporations shouldn't be able to \ndecide who wins or loses on the Internet. It is the idea that the \nInternet should be a level playing field for everyone, from a blogger \nto a media conglomerate, from a small businessperson to a powerful \ncorporation. I believe that net neutrality is the free speech issue of \nour time.\n  The Internet wasn't created by corporations. It was created using \ntaxpayer dollars, and it has dramatically altered our daily lives in \nmore ways than any of us could have ever dreamed. It is an incredible \nsource of innovation, a hotbed for creativity, and an unbelievable \nproducer of wealth and jobs in this Nation. It was instrumental in \nputting President Obama in office--but it was also equally instrumental \nin helping the Tea Party become a powerful force in American politics.\n  I may not agree with everything the Tea Party movement has done, or \neverything it stands for, but I do firmly believe that the Tea Party \nhas a right to organize and to post its views on the Internet.\n  Strong net neutrality principles would ensure that everyone--from the \nmost liberal blogger on Daily Kos--to the most conservative fan of Fox \nNews--would continue to have an equal right of access and an equal \nability to communicate with like-minded people.\n  If corporations are allowed to control the Internet, all of that \nwould change. The Internet has become the public square of the 21st \ncentury. This is why Tea Party activists and anyone who cares about \npersonal liberties and freedoms should care about net neutrality.\n  One popular Minnesota blogger should be able to get his or her \ninformation to you as quickly as MSNBC. Or to say it another way, MSNBC \nshouldn't be able to pay millions to get their Web site to load faster \non your computer. We do not want corporations to be able to drown out \nthe voices of smaller, less powerful individuals.\n  Unfortunately, the proposal before the FCC--which I will admit I \nhaven't seen because it has not been made public--would reportedly \nallow companies\n\n[[Page S10692]]\n\nto do just that. It would allow Internet providers to create a fast \nlane for companies that can afford to pay a premium. It would allow \nmobile networks, like AT and Verizon Wireless, to completely block \ncontent and applications whenever it suits them--for either political \nor business reasons.\n  Let me underscore this--this is the first time the FCC has allowed \ndiscrimination on the Internet.\n  Let me give you an example. Maybe you like Google Maps. Well, tough. \nIf the FCC passes this weak rule, Verizon will be able to cutoff access \nto the Google Maps app on your phone and force you to use their own \nmapping program, Verizon Navigator, even if it is not as good, even if \nthey charge money, when Google Maps is free.\n  If corporations are allowed to prioritize content on the Internet, or \nthey are allowed to block applications you access on your iPhone, there \nis nothing to prevent those same corporations from censoring political \nspeech.\n  The Obama campaign used a mobile app to help organize volunteers. And \nnow there are a bunch of Tea Party apps you can download. But maybe not \nfor long. Not if your wireless carrier doesn't want you to get them. \nAnd that is something every American should care very deeply about.\n  I am here on the floor today because I think Americans need to \nunderstand just how critical net neutrality really is.\n  This is complicated stuff. But it directly affects all of us.\n  And it is not just about speech, it is also about entrepreneurship \nand innovation. It is about our economy.\n  There is no question in my mind that without significant changes, the \nproposal currently pending before the FCC would be bad for our economy.\n  Think about companies like YouTube, which started in a tiny office \nabove a pizzeria, and grew to be worth billions of dollars. At the \ntime, Google had a competing product, Google Video, which was then the \nstandard but was widely seen as inferior. Had Google been able to pay \nComcast large amounts of money to make its website faster than \nYouTube's, YouTube would be nowhere. Fortunately, Google could not pay \nfor priority access, and the rest is history.\n  Think about Facebook. Once upon a time, it was a small startup. \nRemember Friendster or MySpace? They were once the dominant social \nnetworking sites before Facebook won over users with a vastly superior \nproduct. But that might have never happened if Friendster or MySpace \nhad paid lots of money to reach users faster. If Facebook had taken a \nsignificantly longer time to load on your computer, it never would have \nsucceeded.\n  These are just some examples of how today's free and open Internet \nhas fostered innovation, which has created jobs, and has spurred \ncompetition, which has benefited all consumers. Now think of the next \nFacebook or the next YouTube or the next Amazon. The only way to \nguarantee that innovation will continue is to have strong net \nneutrality rules that will protect and maintain today's free and open \nInternet.\n  So the FCC has to make two big decisions, one on the Comcast-NBC \nmerger, and one on net neutrality. These decisions will impact every \nAmerican for years to come.\n  You may not know this, but the FCC is an independent agency. \nIndependent agencies are nonpartisan. They are not beholden to Congress \nor to the President, and they certainly should not be beholden to the \nindustries they regulate. That is why I am concerned when I hear that \nthe Chairman of the FCC is calling the CEOs of companies they are \nsupposed to be regulating, seeking their public endorsement of his net \nneutrality proposal.\n  Independent agencies are charged with acting in the public interest. \nSo when I hear that the FCC is considering a net neutrality proposal \nthat is supported by the largest media corporations in America, I am \nsuspicious, and you should be too. The FCC should not be worrying about \ngetting the sign-off from the very corporations that it is supposed to \nbe regulating, period.\n  The FCC has made public its plans to act on its flawed net neutrality \nproposal this coming Tuesday. I sincerely hope that the FCC will make \nsignificant improvements before then, and that each of the \nCommissioners will think long and hard before they vote to approve a \nproposal that could actually make things worse for all Americans.\n  I have also heard that the FCC is going to be acting very soon on the \nNBC-Comcast merger, and it needs to do this in the light of day, not \nhidden in the middle of Christmas and New Year's. The American people \nhave a right to know about this merger. I will be supremely \ndisappointed if approval of the merger is slipped through when most of \nAmerica is unwrapping presents and spending time with their families, \nnot worrying about their cable or Internet bills.\n  We are at a pivotal moment and we need to stop the cascade of dominos \nthat will forever change how we pay for TV and browse the Internet. But \nit is not too late. The government has a role to play here, and I hope \nthe FCC will step up, be brave, and do what is right for the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/18/senate-section/article/S10692-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S10692-S10693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTES TO RETIRING SENATORS\n\n\n                                kit bond\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, At the end of each session of Congress it \nhas long been a tradition in the Senate to take a moment to express our \nappreciation and say goodbye to those who will not be returning in \nJanuary for the beginning of the next Congress. One of those I know we \nwill all miss in the months to come is Kit Bond.\n  I still remember the first time Kit Bond was drawn to our attention \non a national basis. It was 1974 and then Governor Kit Bond was being \nhonored for his work in state and municipal affairs by the Jaycees as \none of the Ten Outstanding Young Americans of that year. He was in his \nthirties and he was already making his mark in the day to day life of \nhis home State at a time when most people his age were still trying to \nfind the ``right'' career to focus their energies on that would be both \nchallenging and rewarding. After seeing him so recognized and realizing \nwhat it meant, I was inspired myself. I have been in awe of him ever \nsince.\n  That honor that Kit received so many years ago proved to be one of \nthe first to come his way during a four-decade career that now includes \nhis service to the people of Missouri on the State and the Federal \nlevel. Over the years he has been a champion for the people of his home \nState and that is why they have elected and reelected him numerous \ntimes. Simply put, he has been an outstanding and highly effective \nlegislator.\n  It is no secret. Kit has an amazing resume. Actually, it is more a \nrecord of success that lists what he has achieved and the results he \nhas been able to obtain that reflect the work he has been a part of \nthat has helped to make our country a better place for us all to live.\n  Looking back, Kit had already begun to make a name for himself when \nhe graduated from the University of Virginia's law school. He was first \nin his class and had a number of opportunities awaiting him, some of \nwhich he explored, before he returned home to Missouri. Once there he \nbegan his career of public service as the State's assistant attorney \ngeneral under former Senator John Danforth.\n  Soon thereafter Kit won his first statewide race when he was elected \nto serve as State Auditor. Two years after that, he became the State's \nfirst Republican to serve as Governor since the days of World War II. \nHe was also the youngest Governor the State had ever had.\n  As Governor he learned a lot of lessons that stemmed from being a \nRepublican Governor with a general assembly with 70 percent Democratic \nmajorities in both Houses. He has commented that those days taught him \na great deal about the meaning of bipartisanship. That is why, when he \nran for and won a Senate seat, he soon became known for his ability to \nwork with all of his colleagues on a long list of issues.\n  Over the years, for example, he has been a tireless supporter of our \nNation's military. He has also been a fighter for our veterans and \ntheir right to the benefits they have earned through their service.\n  Another issue close to his heart has been the need to increase the \navailability of safe and affordable housing and improve the \ninfrastructure of Missouri and the rest of the Nation.\n\n[[Page S10693]]\n\n  These and many other issues that Kit has taken up during his career \nreflect his belief in the importance of doing everything we can today \nto make our tomorrows better for our children and our grandchildren--\nsince their future is ours, too.\n  I know I am not the only one who will have a moment from time to time \nnext year when I will wish Kit was still around here, walking around \nwith that trademark smile of his, caught up in yet another battle for \nsomething he believed in, something he knew would be important to the \npeople of Missouri and the future of our Nation.\n  Fortunately, whenever we feel the need for a little of his advice or \nan observation or two we will know where to find him--just down the \nstreet, back home in Missouri.\n  Now that this chapter of Kit's life has ended, I have no doubt \nanother will soon begin. As Kit pointed out, ``there are many ways to \nserve'' and ``elective office is only one of them.''\n  As he leaves the Senate, I would like to thank him for his \nwillingness to serve; his wife Linda for her support and encouragement \nalong the way; his son Sam for his heroic service in our Armed Forces; \nand all the members of his family who stood behind him over the years.\n  Diana and I send our best wishes and heartfelt appreciation to them \nall. We especially want to thank Kit and Linda for their friendship and \nfor all they have meant to this Senate family of ours that extends from \none corner of our Nation to the other.\n  Keep in touch. We will always enjoy hearing from you with your \nthoughts about whatever we happen to be taking up on the Senate floor. \nGood luck and God bless.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/18/senate-section/article/S10693-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10693]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                         Enrolled Bills Signed\n\n  The President pro tempore (Mr. Inouye) announced that he had signed \nthe following enrolled bills on December 17, 2010, which were \npreviously signed by the Speaker of the House:\n\n  S. 3447.

Mr. President, I have long argued in favor of greater \ndiversity and localism in broadcasting. Today, Congress takes a \npositive step by making available more radio broadcast outlets for \nlocal content.\n  I am pleased that Congress has finally passed and sent to the \nPresident the Local Community Radio Act, which will increase the number \nof frequencies available for low power FM, LPFM, radio stations. I am a \ncosponsor of the Senate version of this legislation, and have been an \noriginal cosponsor of similar legislation in each of the previous two \nCongresses. I commend Senator Cantwell for her hard work in reaching an \nagreement with full power broadcasters that will ensure they are \nprotected.\n  The rash of nationwide consolidation we have witnessed in the \nbroadcast industry over the last decade has been alarming, if \npredictable. Low power FM stations offer a valuable counterweight to \nthis trend. By using low power stations, community groups can access \nunderutilized spectrum and provide content tailored to smaller \ncommunities. The Local Community Radio Act rolls back unnecessary \nrestrictions that have limited the number of frequencies on which LPFM \nstations can operate.\n  This legislation is important because LPFM stations provide \nopportunities for local organizations to serve local communities. \nVermont has 11 LPFM stations serving local communities in Vermont from \nHyde Park to Brattleboro to Warren. There is room for more in Vermont \nand across the country.\n  Low Power FM provides the opportunity for truly local content to \nflourish, and today's legislation will make more such stations \navailable.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of H. Con. Res. 335 just \nreceived from the House and at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       A concurrent resolution (H. Con. Res. 335) honoring the \n     exceptional achievements of Ambassador Richard Holbrooke and \n     recognizing the significant contributions he has made to \n     United States national security, humanitarian causes, and \n     peaceful resolutions of international conflict.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nconcurrent resolution.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, today the Senate has been asked to concur \nwith our colleagues in the House and approve a resolution honoring our \nfriend and a great public servant, Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, who \npassed away on Monday.\n  We remember Richard not just as one of America's most distinguished \nand accomplished statesmen, but as a man who--from Vietnam to his last \nmission in Afghanistan--really was a warrior for peace. It is fitting \nthat we honor him by approving this resolution.\n  Richard was an incredible combination of the best qualities of the \nhuman spirit--a serious thinker who embraced relentless action; a \ntough-as-nails negotiator who commanded an enormous and infectious \nsense of humor; and perhaps above all, a diplomat who knew firsthand \njust how difficult and frustrating engagement could be, but in his \nlife's legacy reminded all of us just how much engagement could \naccomplish.\n  Richard's passing is almost incomprehensible, not just because it was \nso sudden, but because I cannot imagine Richard Holbrooke in anything \nbut a state of perpetual motion. He was always working. Always hard-\ncharging in the best sense of the word--he had an immense presence--and \na brilliance matched only by his perseverance and\n\n[[Page S10697]]\n\nhis passion. He once complained that the bureaucracy in Washington all \ntoo often saw suffering around the world as an abstraction. He took \nHannah Arendt's famous phrase and flipped it around, saying that \nsometimes our biggest battles were against the ``evils of banality.''\n  Well, Richard waged--and won--his share of battles against banality \nand inertia. He was always a man on a mission, the toughest mission, \nand that mission was waging peace through never-quit diplomacy--and \nRichard's life's work saved more lives in more places than we can \nmeasure. He simply got up every day knowing that--even in difficult \ncircumstances where history's verdict is yet to be handed down--every \nounce of energy and every drop of sweat held the promise of making \nthings better for people.\n  Yes, Richard had an outsized personality, and it was one that he \nhimself could joke about, even relish. He earned the nickname ``The \nBulldozer'' for a reason. But Richard did not push people away. He drew \npeople to him. He was incredibly appreciative of those who worked with \nhim and was unfailingly loyal to them. I remember last January, when \nRichard came to the Foreign Relations Committee to testify on the war \nin Afghanistan, he stopped the hearing to introduce his top staff--some \n16 people. More than just colleagues, they were his partners. He knew \ntheir families and he knew the names of their children. At the State \nDepartment he didn't just create an office for Afghanistan and \nPakistan, he built a family.\n  His staff returned his affection and loyalty many times over. Foggy \nBottom is filled with men and women inspired and mentored by Richard. \nEver since Richard fell ill last Friday morning, dozens of friends and \nfamily and staff gathered in the lobby of George Washington Hospital to \nshow their support and wait for news of his condition. When I stopped \nby on Sunday night, I couldn't help but be moved by the love and the \nconcern. And when news of his passing spread, people began \nspontaneously gathering at the hospital. And then--something that \nRichard would have understood and appreciated--they went out together \nand shared stories about him.\n  It was impossible to know Richard and not come away with ``Holbrooke \nstories.'' Certainly I have my share. Our public careers were \nintertwined in so many ways, from Vietnam to my Presidential campaign \nto the conflict in Afghanistan. There were long conference calls, \nimpromptu policy debates when we found ourselves on the same shuttle to \nLaGuardia, stories shared about our children and lessons learned about \nbeing modern Dads, and wonderful wine-filled dinners where we came up \nwith brilliant plans for peace that didn't always seem so brilliant--if \nthey were remembered at all--in the light of day. Richard always made \nit fun because it is a pleasure to be in the company of someone who \nloved the job they were doing for the country they loved. And make no \nmistake--just shy of 70, with a back-breaking schedule--Richard \nHolbrooke loved what he was doing.\n  And so, wherever chaos and violence threatened American interests and \nhuman lives for nearly a half century, wherever there was a need for \ncourage and insight, Richard Holbrooke showed up for duty. He spent his \nformative years as a young Foreign Service officer in Vietnam, where he \nworked in the Mekong Delta and then on the staffs of two American \nambassadors, Maxwell Taylor and Henry Cabot Lodge. Given the storied \nexpanse of his career, people sometimes forget that Richard wrote a \nvolume of the ``Pentagon Papers,'' the seminal work that helped turn \nthe course of the Vietnam war. And as with all of us who served in \nVietnam, Richard's experience there informed his every judgment, and \nleft him with the conviction that time spent working even against long \nodds to see that peace and diplomacy prevailed over war and violence, \nwas time well-invested for the most powerful of nations and the most \ndetermined of diplomats.\n  He was a pragmatist devoted to principle. He believed that the United \nStates could help people around the world at the same time as we \ndefended our interests. Richard once wrote about a meeting he attended \nin the Situation Room in 1979, when he was Assistant Secretary for East \nAsia and the Pacific. The South China Sea was being flooded with tens \nof thousands of refugees from Vietnam. They were fleeing the regime \nthere, looking for safe haven somewhere else. But most of them were not \nmaking it. Instead, they were drowning.\n  The Seventh Fleet was nearby and could divert to rescue them. But \nthere were those in our government who did not want the Navy to be \ndistracted from its other missions. And besides, what would we do with \nthe refugees? And wouldn't our actions just encourage more people to \nset sail in rickety boats in an attempt to find freedom? Back and forth \nthe debate went. Ultimately, Vice President Mondale made the decision: \nAmerica would not stand idly by while people drowned. Richard wrote \nthis: ``At this time and distance it may be hard to conceive that the \ndecision, so clearly right, was almost not made. There are people who \nare alive today because of Mondale's decision; of very few actions by a \ngovernment official can such a thing be said.''\n  Well, we can certainly say that--and more--of Richard Holbrooke. \nEarlier this week, we marked the 15th anniversary of what was perhaps \nhis greatest legacy. On December 14, 1995, the Dayton Peace Accords \nbrought an end to a 3\\1/2\\ year war in Bosnia that had claimed tens of \nthousands of lives and displaced millions. It is a war that would have \ninflicted far more misery if Richard had not tirelessly shuttled \nbetween the Serbs and the Croats and the Bosnians. He laid the \ngroundwork for the peace talks. And then, over 20 days, he charmed, he \ncajoled, and ultimately he convinced the three principal leaders to end \na war. In the years since, ``Dayton'' has become a byword for the kind \nof aggressive diplomacy that Richard practiced. At Dayton, Richard \nHolbrooke brought himself and the Nation he represented great honor.\n  We loved that energy, we loved that resolve--that is who Richard was, \nand he died giving everything he had to one last difficult mission for \nthe country he loved. It is almost a bittersweet bookend that a career \nof public service that began trying to save a war gone wrong, now ends \nwith a valiant effort to keep another war from going wrong. Over the \nlast 2 years, he and I worked closely together on our policy in \nAfghanistan and Pakistan. His honesty could be bracing, and I loved \nthat about him. He was always solution-seeking--and always so committed \nto the mission that he never hesitated to leverage the skills of those \naround him because it was success he sought, not spotlights.\n  Through this resolution, we acknowledge his extraordinary public \nservice and we extend our heartfelt sympathy to his family, especially \nhis extraordinary wife Kati; Richard's two sons, David and Anthony; his \nstepchildren Elizabeth and Chris Jennings; and his daughter-in-law \nSarah. We are reminded how much richer all of our lives have been \nthanks to the intelligence, humor, and warmth that Richard brought to \nevery day of his life. And we mourn your loss with you.\n  I will miss working with Richard Holbrooke. And I will remember \nsomething he said last year about his enduring faith in America despite \nthe many trials we now face. He said, ``I still believe in the \npossibility of the United States . . . persevering against any \nchallenge.'' It is difficult to imagine wrestling with the challenges \nof Afghanistan and Pakistan without him, but we are all sustained by \nthe decades-long example Richard set making the possibility of American \nperseverance more of a reality. And for that our Nation will always be \ngrateful.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.

It is no surprise \nthat Mr. Feller was inducted into the Hall of Fame in 1962, his first \nyear of eligibility.\n  But, we do not just honor Feller because of his athletic \nachievements. We recognize him as a great American and patriot. He \nserved our Nation in the Navy during World War II, enlisting 2 days \nafter the attack on Pearl Harbor. Although he lost four baseball \nseasons due to his war service, he never regretted his choice.\n  Feller said recently, ``A lot of folks say that had I not missed \nthose almost four seasons to World War II--during what was probably my \nphysical prime--I might have had 370 or even 400 wins. But I have no \nregrets. None at all. I did what any American could and should do: \nserve his country in its time of need. The world's time of need. I knew \nthen, and I know today, that winning World War II was the most \nimportant thing to happen to this country in the last 100 years.''\n  Mr. President, this week we lost a great American.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and any statements related to the resolution be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S. Res. 703) was agreed to.\n  The preamble was agreed to.\n  The resolution, with its preamble, reads as follows:\n\n                              S. Res. 703\n\n       Whereas Robert William Andrew (``Bob'') Feller was born on \n     November 3, 1918, near Van Meter, Iowa;\n       Whereas Bob Feller learned to play baseball on his parents' \n     farm in Dallas County, Iowa, and commented that ``What kid \n     wouldn't enjoy the life I led in Iowa? Baseball and farming, \n     and I had the best of both worlds'';\n       Whereas Feller attended Van Meter High School where he \n     pitched for the baseball team;\n       Whereas Feller, at the age of 17, joined the Cleveland \n     Indians, where he played for 18 years, his entire career;\n       Whereas Feller led the American League in wins 6 times;\n       Whereas Feller led the American League in strikeouts 7 \n     times;\n       Whereas Feller pitched 3 no-hitters, including the only \n     Opening Day no-hitter, and shares the major league record \n     with 12 one-hitters;\n       Whereas Feller was an 8-time All-Star;\n       Whereas Feller was a key member of the 1948 World Series \n     Champion Cleveland Indians;\n       Whereas Feller threw the second fastest pitch ever \n     officially recorded, at 107.6 miles per hour;\n       Whereas Feller ended his career with 266 victories and \n     2,581 strikeouts;\n       Whereas Feller remains the winningest pitcher in Cleveland \n     Indians history;\n       Whereas Feller was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in \n     1962, his first year of eligibility;\n       Whereas Feller enlisted in the Navy 2 days after the attack \n     on Pearl Harbor in 1941;\n       Whereas Feller served with valor in the Navy for nearly 4 \n     years, missing almost 4 full baseball seasons;\n       Whereas Feller was stationed aboard the U.S.S. Alabama as a \n     gunnery specialist;\n       Whereas Feller earned 8 battle stars and was discharged in \n     late 1945; and\n       Whereas Bob Feller, one of the greatest baseball players of \n     all time, placed service to his country ahead of all else: \n     Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) honors Bob Feller for transcending the sport of \n     baseball in service to the United States and the cause of \n     democracy and freedom in World War II;\n       (2) recognizes Bob Feller as one of the greatest baseball \n     players of all time; and\n       (3) extends its deepest condolences to the family of Bob \n     Feller.\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nspeak about this last resolution. Bob Feller was a Clevelander through \nand through. Senator Harkin is the prime sponsor of this resolution. I \nhave joined him on it. Senator Harkin sponsored the resolution because \nBob Feller was born in Van Meter, IA.\n  He was signed by the Cleveland Indians at the age of 16, apparently \nfor $1 and an autographed baseball. He struck out 15 batters in his \nfirst Major League start. He struck out 17 in a game at the age of 17. \nHe is the only Major League player in history to strike out in one game \nthe number of batters comparable to his age.\n  His greatness was he was, perhaps, the hardest throwing pitcher ever \nin Major League Baseball. He pitched three no-hitters, then a record. \nIt has been passed since. He pitched 12 one-hitters also, sharing that \nMajor League record.\n  He would have shattered, perhaps, all pitching records short of Cy \nYoung's number of career wins, perhaps, and Walter Johnson's, if he had \nnot served his country for almost 4 years in World War II.\n  He gladly did it. He won eight battle stars. He served on the USS \nAlabama as a gunnery specialist. He was so proud of his service to his \ncountry. He turned down a huge contract with the Indians in 1942--huge \nin those days--to join the military to serve his country. He spoke \nabout it frequently and was always very proud of that service.\n  He barnstormed the country with Satchel Page, the great Black pitcher \nwho was not allowed in the Major Leagues in those days before the color \nline was broken. Feller and he traveled the country in the ``White \nMajor League Baseball'' offseason and drew huge crowds, with Page and \nhe facing each other in game after game after game.\n  He was a key member of the last Indians World Championship in 1948.\n  I saw Bob Feller pitch once. I was 4 years old, so I do not really \nremember it. My dad took my brothers Bob and Charlie and me to Bob \nFeller Day at old Cleveland Municipal Stadium in, I believe, 1957.\n  My dad loved Bob Feller. He was a legend in Cleveland. His statue is \nthe only professional athlete's statue in Cleveland. Right outside \nJacobs Field, on East 9th Street, you can see Bob Feller's statue, with \nhis famous windup.\n  When you go to an Indians game in the new ballpark at Progressive \nField--new, it is now more than 15 years old--when you go to the \nballpark, people always say: I will meet you at the Bob Feller statue. \nThat is sort of the place where you meet up with your friends and get \nyour tickets and all of that.\n  He brought great joy to so many, such as my father. He was, perhaps, \nthe greatest pitcher who ever lived. He died at the age of 92 in Gates \nMill. He is survived by his wife Anne; his children Steve, Martin, and \nBruce.\n  I was proud to have gotten to speak a number of times to Bob Feller. \nI do not pretend to have known him well. But he was always a major \npresence in Cleveland baseball and a major presence in Cleveland civic \nlife. We are all grateful to him and indebted to him for his service to \nhis country in World War II and to our community before, during, and \nafter World War II. So I wanted to honor with that resolution, with \nSenator Harkin, his name and his life.\n\n[[Page S10704]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "year": "2010"}, {"day": "18", "month": "12", "url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/12/18/senate-section/article/S10704-1", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S10704]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     MODIFIED ORDER OF RECOGNITION\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio.
