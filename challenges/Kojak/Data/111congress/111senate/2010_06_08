Madam President, I had the good fortune of having been put \non the Environment and Public Works Committee from the first day I came \nto the Senate. It has been a great experience to serve on that \ncommittee. I have served under Chairman Chafee, Chairman Moynihan, and \nChairman Baucus. Some remember I gave up my chairmanship for Jim \nJeffords from Vermont. The committee is terrific. I love the \njurisdictional swing that committee has.\n  As a result of this background, I have watched the oilspill in the \ngulf very closely. But I say to everyone within the sound of my voice, \nyou do not have to have longstanding experience on the Environment and \nPublic Works Committee to understand how terrible this has been to the \nenvironment. We do not know the outcome of the degradation to our \nenvironment as a result of this tragedy, and that is what it is. The \nCoast Guard admiral who is in charge has indicated there is no longer a \nplume. There is oil going in different places. Remember, the oil well \nis a mile below the surface of the ocean. So there are tar balls, \nsheets of oil for hundreds and hundreds of miles. Sadly, the worst is \nprobably yet to come.\n  The one thing we tend not to focus on very much is the loss of life. \nOf course, we see the dead animals, and that is tragic. It is so sad. A \npelican is an animal. It is not on the endangered species list. We took \nit off that list in the last year or so. Now these animals are dying by \nthe dozens every day.\n  What we do not focus on as a result of the negligence--gross \nnegligence--\n\n[[Page S4630]]\n\nperhaps criminal acts of BP is that 11 people are dead; 11 people were \nkilled. That seems to be overshadowed a lot of times. Eleven people are \ndead. Brothers, fathers, and sons were killed on the night of that \nterrific explosion. I hope we do not, in spite of the horrible \nconditions that have been caused to our environment, lose track of the \nfact that this is a personal tragedy for lots of people. Eleven people \nwere killed and many others were injured. The American people are going \nto have to not forget the personal tragedies of these people who were \nlost. I am sure they will not.\n  I thought it important this morning to remind everyone that this is \ncertainly an environmental disaster. But for the persons involved as a \nresult of the cutting of corners that BP did--it is not just me \ntalking. We see it on TV shows and the evidence is coming in. I talked \nwith one oil executive over the weekend, and he is flabbergasted. He is \nflabbergasted as to what had taken place. There was no redundancy. This \ncompany simply did not follow rules that are in place to prevent things \nlike this from happening.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/08/senate-section/article/S4630-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   RECOGNITION OF THE MINORITY LEADER\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, amid all the various crises Americans \nface at the moment, one of the most exasperating has to be the \nincreasingly high cost of health care. The American people do not \nunderstand how an administration that devoted more than a year talking \nabout health care could end up with a bill that actually raises the \ncost of care instead of lowering it.\n  Seniors are particularly upset about this legislation, and that is \nwhy the White House is staging an event today aimed at convincing them \nthey are actually getting a good deal. But seniors are right to be \nskeptical. They were told this law would strengthen Medicare, when, in \nfact, it takes $\\1/2\\ trillion out of Medicare to fund a new government \nprogram. They were also told that if they liked their plan, they could \nkeep it. Yet now we hear that millions of seniors will lose their \nMedicare Advantage benefits they already have and like as a result of \nthe Democratic health care bill.\n  The centerpiece of today's event is a $250 rebate check the \nadministration will pass out to the fraction--fraction--of seniors who \nqualify for it. I am sure anyone who gets these checks is happy to take \nthat extra cash, especially in the current economy. What the \nadministration, however, will not mention at today's event is that for \nevery senior who gets a check, more than three other seniors will see \nan increase in their prescription drug insurance premiums. In other \nwords, behind every $250 check is more than three seniors who will be \npaying more as a result of this bill. The reason for this is that the \nhealth care bill Democrats forced on Americans earlier this year \nrequires higher government-mandated minimum standards for everyone. \nThose who opted for anything below that minimum will now see their \npremiums go up, and the number of seniors in this category far, far \noutnumbers those getting a check. The administration can tout the check \nit is giving out to some seniors, but by failing to mention those \nseniors for whom it is causing rates to go up, it is hiding the whole \ntruth.\n  That has been the story all along about this bill--a lot of promises \nthat could not be kept. That is why the story now is not the bill \nitself but the administration's broken promises. Americans never wanted \nthis bill. They never wanted it in the first place. And they are \nreminded every day why they opposed it.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/08/senate-section/article/S4630-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4630]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I ask that the Chair lay before the \nSenate a message from the House with respect to H.R. 4213.\n  The Acting President pro tempore laid before the Senate the following \nmessage from the House of Representatives:\n\n       Resolved, That the House agrees to the amendment of the \n     Senate to the bill (H.R. 4213) entitled ``An Act to amend the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to extend certain expiring \n     provisions, and for other purposes,'' with the House \n     amendment to the Senate amendment.\n\n\n                Motion to Concur with Amendment No. 4301\n\n                (Purpose: In the nature of a substitute)\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I move to concur in the House amendment \nto the Senate amendment to the House bill with an amendment which I \nsend to the desk.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana [Mr. Baucus] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 4301 to the House amendment to the Senate amendment \n     to H.R. 4213.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be waived.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, a few moments ago, the Republican leader \nsought once again to throw mud at the new health care law that Congress \nenacted earlier this year. Let me take a moment to set the record \nstraight.\n  The Republican leader said the premiums would go up for some \nAmericans. What the Republican leader did not say is the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office found that health care reform would lower \npremiums for the overwhelming majority of Americans. After taking into \naccount the tax credits to help buy insurance, health insurance will \ncost less for 9 out of 10 Americans--no small amount.\n  The Republican leader mocked the new payments to seniors the \nPresident is highlighting today; that is, the $250 for drug benefits. \nThe President made the point that that is important for seniors. The \ntruth is, seniors will welcome the help they will soon be receiving to \npay for prescription drugs in their coverage gap, the so-called \ndoughnut hole. Starting very soon seniors will receive $250 to help pay \nfor their prescriptions. By the time health care reform is fully phased \nin, we will have completely eliminated the doughnut hole. This is \nsomething seniors care about very much.\n  No longer will seniors have to choose between their rent and the \nprescriptions they need. No longer will seniors have to cut their pills \nin half just to get by. No longer will seniors live in unnecessary pain \njust because of drug costs. So the fact is, health care reform will \nhelp to control the costs in health care. Health care reform will \nreduce costs for the taxpayer over the decades to come. That is not my \nassertion, it is that of the Congressional Budget Office. Health care \nreform will increase access to lifesaving medical treatments for \nmillions of Americans who all too often now must do without.\n  Madam President, on the matter before us today, 15 million Americans \nhave lost their jobs during this great recession. Although the \nunemployment rate came down some last month, it remains near 10 \npercent. At the depth of the great recession, during the first months \nof last year, the economy lost an average of 750,000 jobs a month. That \nis practically the population of my State. We have come a long way \nsince then. Even if we exclude temporary census jobs, in the first 5 \nmonths of this year the economy has created nearly half a million new \njobs. But we still have a lot more to do. We have to get more Americans \nback to work.\n  We began doing just that with the Recovery Act. We enacted that as \none\n\n[[Page S4631]]\n\nof the first things the new Congress did in February of last year. \nAccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the Recovery \nAct increased by between 1.2 million and 2.8 million the number of \nAmericans employed.\n  We continued getting more Americans back to work with the Hiring \nIncentives Act that we enacted in March of this year. The HIRE Act \nshould help to bolster job creation in coming months.\n  We are continuing again today with the American Jobs and Closing Tax \nLoopholes Act. This bill would create jobs by improving our Nation's \ninfrastructure. It would reduce the cost to local governments to build \nroads, bridges, and water treatment facilities that would create jobs.\n  This bill would also extend provisions that expire at the end of May. \nThese provisions would provide important relief for many Americans.\n  Americans who are out of work are depending on our job creation \nefforts. This bill extends the needed lifeline of unemployment benefits \nto more than 5 million Americans who would not be able to support \nthemselves or their families without this help.\n  We are talking about people who have worked, want to work, and will \nwork again. These are our neighbors. And they need our help.\n  In my home State of Montana, we have seen some promising signs of \nrecovery. In Yellowstone County, unemployment is down from 6 percent in \nMarch to 5.2 pesent in April. That is good news. But there still remain \npeople who need our help.\n  Some counties in Montana have unemployment as high as 16.8 percent. \nIn Montana, as with the rest of country, we have seen an increase in \npeople looking for work.\n  Unemployment rates will continue to hover around 10 percent even as \nthe economy improves. As the economy adds jobs, many unemployed people \ngrow more hopeful and resume their search for work. That is one reason \nwhy economists call unemployment a lagging economic indicator.\n  The bill that we are considering today includes improvements to the \nunemployment insurance program. This bill would eliminate the penalty \nin unemployment insurance for getting part-time or temporary work. \nUnder current law, if people who are unemployed take part-time or \ntemporary jobs, and then lose that job, they receive lower benefits \nthan people who did not take short-term work. This bill corrects that \ninequity.\n  This bill also expands the Trade Adjustment Assistance Community \nCollege and Career Training Program. The bill would broaden the program \nto include workers who are eligible for unemployment insurance. This \nwill help more Americans who are looking for work to get the education \nand looking career training that they need.\n  If we do not pass this bill, doctors who see Medicare and TRICARE \npatients will take a 21 percent pay cut. More and more physicians are \nthreatening to leave the Medicare and TRICARE programs if this happens. \nSeniors and military families could lose access to their doctors.\n  We cannot keep postponing this issue every month or two. Seniors \nworry they will lose their doctors. And physicians cannot run a \nbusiness with this much uncertainty.\n  We need to pass a long-term reform. I would life to fix the problem \npermanently. But the votes are not there today. We will permanently \nreform Medicare's system to compensate doctors as soon as we can.\n  In the meantime, this bill provides security to doctors and the \npatients they see for the next year and a half through 2011. It \nprovides a modest payment increase to physicians for the rest of this \nyear and next year.\n  This multi-year provision would prevent the untenable cut in \nphysician payments. And this bill would provide a pathway to a \npermanent change in how doctors are paid.\n  The budget rules have to score a permanent reform as a cost. But we \nall know that this is something that we have to do for America's \nseniors, military families, and doctors.\n  This bill would also provide tax relief for American families and \nbusinesses. This bill would help communities that have suffered a \nnatural disaster. And this bill includes important tax incentives to \nimprove America's energy independence.\n  For individuals and families, this bill provides much-needed tax \nrelief in a time of economic uncertainty.\n  This bill would extend the teacher expense deduction for teachers who \nbuy school supplies for their classrooms. And it would extend the \nqualified tuition deduction to help with college costs.\n  This bill would extend much-needed relief for communities that have \nsuffered from natural disasters.\n  And it would extend important business tax provisions to help create \njobs and make our companies competitive in a global economy.\n  The bill would extend the research and development credit to help \nbusinesses to continue to be on the cutting edge.\n  The bill would also extend important energy tax incentives. For \nexample, the bill would extend the dollar-per-gallon credit for \nbiodiesel and renewable diesel. And the bill would extend the \nmanufacturer's credit for the construction of new energy-efficient \nhomes.\n  In addition to these important provisions that provide direct \nassistance in job creation, the bill includes other proposals that will \nprovide relief for businesses and individuals.\n  One such provision is pension funding relief.\n  With the weak economy, American employers are faced with the need to \nmake higher pension contributions. Several factors have combined to \nrequire these higher contributions.\n  There is the funding changes of the Pension Protection Act of 2006.\n  There is the slide in the stock market in 2008.\n  And then there is the ensuing great recession.\n  These requirements for higher contributions are coming upon employers \njust when they are facing lower asset values and lower cash flow. \nMeeting the new funding rules could divert resources that employers \ncould use to keep workers on the payroll.\n  We addressed this bind temporarily in 2008. But employers are still \nfacing the prospect of closing plants and stores. Employers are still \nfaced with the possibility of letting workers go in order to make up \nfor lost asset values.\n  This bill contains additional temporary, targeted, and appropriate \nrelief for these employers. And at the same time, the bill still \nmaintains the pension security system.\n  These tough economic times have hit the States hard, as well. In last \nmonth's employment report, for example, State and local governments cut \n22,000 jobs.\n  So, included in the substitute amendment is a 6-month extension of \nthe additional Federal financial assistance for State Medicaid \nprograms. This would allow States to plan for their next fiscal year \nwith the greater certainty.\n  Additional Federal Medicaid match money, known as FMAP, helps the \neconomy grow. According to the economist Mark Zandi, this funding has a \nreturn on investment of about $1.40 for every dollar invested.\n  The nation's governors have repeatedly asked for an extension of this \nFederal assistance. And this bill answers their pleas.\n  With so many Americans out of work, our country needs Congress to \nenact this legislation.\n  This bill continues valuable tax incentives to families and \nbusinesses that will help them in these difficult economic times. And \nthe bill sustains vital safety-net programs that will also help foster \neconomic growth.\n  This legislation is important to the American people. It would \nprevent millions of Americans from falling through the safety net. It \nwould extend vital programs that are set to expire. It would put cash \nin the hands of Americans who would spend it quickly, boosting economic \ndemand. And it would extend critical programs and tax incentives that \ncreate jobs.\n  And so, let us help America's businesses to create more jobs. Let us \njoin together to work across the aisle on this common-sense \nlegislation. Let us enact these tax incentives and safety-net \nprovisions into law.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4632]]\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I get a fair amount of mail. I \nreceived the other day a nice envelope from the Department of Health \nand Human Services addressed to Andrew L. Alexander, Jr., in my \nNashville residence, with a nice brochure here: Medicare and the New \nHealth Care Law; What It Means to You.\n  I am one of those 40 million Americans who is 65 or older, so I am a \npart of Medicare. I was very interested to read the brochure, because I \nspent a lot of time, as did the Senator from New Hampshire, and the \nSenator from Montana probably spent even more, on the new health care \nlaw.\n  As I read through this brochure, it did not bear very much \nrelationship to the way I understood the law I voted on Christmas Eve \nat the end of last year when we passed this health care law.\n  This brochure, which has been mailed at taxpayer expense to more than \n40 million Americans, is an attempt by the administration to explain \nthat the health care law does what it does not do or does not do what \nit does. Let me be specific about why I say that. Throughout the \ndebate, those of us on the Republican side of the aisle said the health \ncare law would cut Medicare, raise premiums, raise taxes, pass Medicaid \ncosts on to States, and add to our national debt. Those on the other \nside said we were wrong. Since they had the votes, they passed the \nbill. It is now law. But let me take two or three examples from the \nmail I got the other day. The brochure claims, in the first paragraph, \nthat the new health care law will result in ``increased quality health \ncare.'' Well, that would mean, to me, I would think, as I read that, \nthat I, an individual on Medicare, or that any individual in the United \nStates, would continue to have at least the coverage I am having today \nand hopefully more.\n  Yet Medicare's own Chief Actuary noted in an April 22 memorandum that \nwithout intervening legislation to correct a payment cut in the new \nlaw, some providers would ``end their participation in the program''--\nthat is Medicare--with the effect of ``possibly jeopardizing access for \nbeneficiaries.''\n  It looks to me if you want to be accurate in writing 40 million \nAmericans about what is happening with Medicare, you would add that in \nthere and say there is another view by the Chief Actuary of Medicare in \nthe Obama administration.\n  The Chief Actuary also concluded that 15 percent of Part A \nproviders--we mean by that hospitals, skilled nursing facilities, \nhospices, home health agencies--may be unable to sustain their \noperation in the next 10 years as a result of drastic Medicare cuts in \nthe new law. That does not sound like ``increased quality health care'' \nto me.\n  No. 2, the second paragraph of the brochure says: The new health care \nlaw will keep Medicare strong and solvent.\n  Here is the truth, at least as we see it. The $529 billion in cuts to \nMedicare--no one disputes that we have those--are being used to pay for \na $1 trillion--when fully implemented over 10 years--health care bill, \nnot to shore up Medicare.\n  According to the same people who put out this brochure, the CMS Chief \nActuary, you cannot double-count the Medicare cuts as both paying for \nexpanding the health care delivery system and increasing the solvency \nof the program. I mean, common sense says if you take $529 billion out \nof Medicare over the first 10 years, or $1 trillion out of Medicare \nover 10 years, when it is fully implemented, and you spend almost all \nof that on something other than Medicare, that is not the way to make \nMedicare more solvent, even if it is a new Medicare Program. Any \nsavings from Medicare, we believe, ought to be spent on Medicare, \nrather than running up the fiscal deficit in Medicare.\n  No. 3, on the second page, the brochure says if you are in a Medicare \nAdvantage plan, you will still receive guaranteed Medicare benefits. \nThis is one of the most disingenuous comments in the brochure. If you \nread that and are one of the more than 11 million people on Medicare \nAdvantage, you would think: My Medicare Advantage must be OK. The truth \nis, Medicare Advantage plans will have less generous benefit packages, \naccording to the CMS, the group that puts this out, according to the \nChief Actuary. He says it will result in less generous benefit \npackages. The Congressional Budget Office Director Doug Elmendorf \ntestified that fully half the benefits currently provided to seniors \nunder Medicare Advantage would disappear under the proposal in the \nearlier bills offered by the Senator from Montana, which were virtually \nthe same as this bill.\n  Here is the difference. They will come back and say: But we said \n``guaranteed benefits.'' They would be right about that. But guaranteed \nMedicare benefits are what everybody has. If one wants Medicare \nAdvantage, which they pay a little more for to cover dental, vision, \nand hearing, or other extra benefits, that is why they buy Medicare \nAdvantage. The truth is, the Medicare cuts in the health care law will \nlimit plan choices and reduce benefits for almost 11 million seniors \nenrolled in Medicare Advantage on those extra benefits. That is \nrelatively one-fourth of all seniors in Medicare, and there are 40 \nmillion of us in Medicare. In my State of Tennessee, there are nearly a \nquarter of a million on Medicare Advantage who will lose those \nbenefits. So it is not true--or at least it is disingenuous--that \nbenefits will not change. Guaranteed benefits won't, but extra benefits \nlikely will.\n  Finally, it says the new law preserves and strengthens Medicare. That \nis also disingenuous, because the new law does not include paying \ndoctors who serve Medicare patients proper compensation. We call this \nthe sustainable growth rate, the SGR. Some people call it the doc-fix. \nOne would think a comprehensive health care law would include proper \ncompensation for doctors who serve Medicare patients, but it does not. \nWhy? It would have, according to the President's budget, added $371 \nbillion to the cost of the bill and made it add to the debt, which we \nsaid it would.\n  So what did we do instead? We simply passed a health care law, the \nmajority did, and claimed it doesn't add to the debt, expand the health \ncare delivery system--which we all know costs too much already--and \nwent on our way. And we still have with us the big cut in payments to \ndoctors which will increasingly create, for those on Medicare, a sort \nof health care bridge to nowhere or to the emergency room, as we find \nAmericans who are on the big government programs, Medicare and \nMedicaid, unable, in the case of Medicaid or Medicare, to find doctors \nwho are willing to serve them at the lower rates and, in the case of \nthose who go to Walgreens in Washington State, a drugstore company that \nwon't fill present description drugs for Medicaid patients because of \nthe low rates.\n  I am disappointed that the administration, in its effort to make the \nhealth care law sound better, would send out what amounts to \npropaganda. There is a Federal law against propaganda. It says annual \nappropriations can't be used for publicity or propaganda purposes \nwithin the United States. I know a little about that. When I was \nEducation Secretary in 1991 and 1992, I sent out what I thought was a \nvery carefully written article to teachers about President Bush's, the \nfirst, education program, and the Democrats in Congress hauled me up \nbefore the committee and had the General Accounting Office investigate \nme and castigated me for putting out publicity and propaganda in \nviolation of the law. Some House Members have written the General \nAccounting Office and said this violates the law. I don't know whether \nit violates the law, but it doesn't tell the truth in the way we \nMedicare beneficiaries deserve to have the truth told to us about what \nthe health care law does. I am disappointed in it. I hope the Center \nfor Medicare and Medicaid Services will be more accurate in the future \nand present a more balanced characterization of the law. I am sure \nduring the rest of this year there will be a great many Americans who \nwill take a closer look at the law and agree with Republicans who said \nno to this because it will raise premiums, raise taxes, and it will \nsend new costs to States and will cut Medicare.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Montana.\n\n[[Page S4633]]\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, it is with interest that I listened to \nmy colleague from Tennessee for several reasons. One, he is debating a \nlaw that has already passed. It is strange to me that he wants to \nrelitigate health care reform. But it is not so strange because I know \nthat that is the tack the other side is going to be taking for the rest \nof this year. At every opportunity, Senators on the other side of the \naisle, all of whom voted against health care reform, will sow the seeds \nof doubt in the minds of the American people. They don't come up with \nconstructive ideas on how to improve the work of something that has \nalready passed into law. Rather, they stand on the law and tear down \nsomething that has passed, sowing the seeds of doubt with \nmisinformation.\n  It is unfortunate, because it has caused the American people to \nwonder who they can trust, especially when one side only speaks ill of \na major program such as health care rather than trying to come up with \nconstructive ideas. That is what is happening right now. We heard a \nstatement from a Senator who is trying to basically score points in the \nNovember elections by sowing the seeds of doubt and confusion over \nhealth care reform.\n  The truth is not what the Senator just said. The Senator from \nTennessee takes issue with efforts of the government to explain the new \nhealth care law. He is implying that it is disingenuous, that it is not \nfair, that it is one-sided. I remind all my colleagues that when the \ndrug benefit came out, proposed by the administration of a different \npolitical philosophy, they didn't pay for it--all unpaid for, every red \ncent. They put all kinds of literature out, all kinds of brochures to \ntout the drug benefit. There were some who thought it wasn't fair. \nThere were some who thought it was biased. I will not litigate that \nissue, but I do know that charge was made many times when the \nadministration of a different political persuasion was touting the drug \nbenefit legislation that passed not too long ago.\n  I have spoken with this administration several times about getting \nthe proper information out; that is, not to tilt, gild the lily, bias. \nAt hearings I have made that clear to administration officials. I for \none do not want this administration or any administration to be unfair \nin explaining the program to the American people. I think the brochure \nthe Senator talks about is fair and straightforward. I just happened to \npull up the Web site yesterday and looked at it to see what it said. I \nwas impressed. There is a lot of information there I didn't know about. \nIt didn't at all come across to me, trying to be objective and fair, as \none-sided. It was an honest effort to explain to the American people \nwhat health care reform is.\n  The new law takes steps to improve the quality of health care. Let me \ngo back to what the Senator said. No. 1, he took issue with the \nparagraph that said the new law increases the quality of health care. \nOf course, the new law increases the quality of health care. The \nSenator from Tennessee is sowing the seeds of doubt as to whether this \nnew law actually does increase the quality of health care. Let me \nexplain how it does. First, there is delivery system reform. We get rid \nof a lot of the waste in the American health care system. It is paid on \nthe basis of quality, not on the basis of quantity and volume. Every \nexpert who has looked at the American health care system knows we have \nto move in this direction. This bill does that. It is going to \nreimburse doctors, hospitals, and health care providers more on the \nbasis of quality outcomes than on the basis of the number of services \nprovided or the quantity of services.\n\n  The doughnut hole will be filled. That will increase the quality of \nhealth care for seniors. The statement that the Senator refers to from \nthe HHS Actuary actually says that health care reform will extend the \nlife of the Medicare trust fund for another decade. I think that \nimproves the quality of health care. Anyone who objectively has looked \nat the health care reform legislation and attempted to determine one \nissue; that is, the life of the Medicare trust fund, has concluded that \nthe passage of health care reform will extend the life of the Medicare \ntrust fund for 8 to 10 years. That clearly gives seniors a little peace \nof mind. It is going to be there. It gives peace of mind to people who \nare about to be seniors, that it is going to be there. That is a major \nimprovement in quality.\n  It is true what the brochure says. It does increase the quality of \nhealth care. There is no doubt about it. Anyone who thinks otherwise \nshould think through the entire legislation and be objective about it.\n  No. 2, he refers to the assertion that it keeps Medicare strong and \nsolvent and claims that is not true. The Actuary says that health care \nreform will extend the life of the Medicare trust fund for another \ndecade. That is 100 percent refuted.\n  Third, the Senator from Tennessee quibbles with the assertion that \nMedicare Advantage beneficiaries will continue to receive their \nguaranteed benefits. The Senator at first admits this is true, but the \nlarger point is that health care reform reduces overpayment to Medicare \nAdvantage plans. And why should other beneficiaries pay extra for the \noverpayments made to some people who are beneficiaries of Medicare \nAdvantage plans? I have talked to a lot of executives who work for \nMedicare Advantage plans in the last week or so. They are interested, \nand they like it. They like the change in the law. Why? Because they \nknow they are going to be reimbursed now more on the basis of quality.\n  Medicare Advantage plans will be paid more if they can show better \noutcomes, higher quality, not just the standard ``you get the same \nrate'' benchmark compared with fee for service and so forth. A CEO of a \nmajor Medicare Advantage plan said: Senator, we think that is good \npolicy. We like that. We are ready. We are anxious. We want to do a \nreal good job. We think that is a good change in the law. That is going \nto, frankly, help seniors--higher quality, better benefits under \nMedicare Advantage plans. That will help.\n  Essentially, I want to make it clear, the Senator from Tennessee \ncomplains the health care law did not correct for payment of doctors. \nHere is his opportunity. He could vote for this bill today. If he \ndoesn't want doctors to take a 21-percent cut, if he doesn't want that, \nhe should vote for this bill. This bill before us today would prevent \nthat cut from taking place.\n  I very much look forward to seeing the Senator from Tennessee voting \nfor this bill so that doctors do not get a cut in their payment. That \nwould be the right thing to do, support this bill so doctors don't get \ncut.\n  Again, the Senator takes issue with the assertion that health care \nreform would help keep Medicare solvent. The fact is, the nonpartisan \nMedicare Actuary said health care reform will extend the life of the \nMedicare trust fund for a decade longer.\n  I return to my first point: The health care reform law has passed. \nThe President signed it. My gosh, why don't we work together \nconstructively, both sides, with good points, praise, criticism, both \nsides of the aisle, all constructively to help the American people? Why \nare we here? We are here to help the American people. We are not here \nto score political points. We are the hired hands. We are the \nemployees. We work for the American people. The American people want \ngood health care reform. They want costs lower, and they want higher \nquality care. So let us work together to help the American people get \nthat. That is what we should be doing here, not trying to score \npolitical points and cause disruptions for the American people for the \nupcoming elections in November.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nFlorida is recognized.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                               Venezuela\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Mr. President, I am here again today to talk about my \nconcerns that are emerging from the problems we are seeing in \nVenezuela.\n  Last May 25--just a couple weeks ago--I wrote a letter to the \nSecretary of State, Secretary Clinton, that was signed by 11 of my \ncolleagues and myself. Senator Ensign from Nevada and I wrote this \nletter together, and we were\n\n[[Page S4634]]\n\nwelcome to have 10 other Senators join in the letter to Secretary \nClinton to speak about our concern--in fact, what we would call a \ngathering storm of concern--about the country of Venezuela.\n  The letter seeks to have a review by the Secretary of State and the \nDepartment of State as to whether Venezuela should be added to the list \nof states that we consider state sponsors of terror. The letter goes \nthrough a number of issues I have spoken about on the floor before \nconcerning some very questionable behavior by Hugo Chavez and \nVenezuela.\n  One of the issues it talks about is the support of Venezuela for the \nnarcoterrorists in Colombia, the FARC. Evidence has come forward that \nVenezuela's weapons have found their way into the hands of these \nnarcoterrorists.\n  Another of the things we talk about in the letter is the concern with \na plot that was revealed by a Spanish judge in March of this past \nyear--a plot to assassinate President Uribe in Colombia, where the \nSpanish judge has accused Venezuela of being behind that plot, along \nwith a Spanish terrorist group called the ETA.\n  The letter also speaks about Hezbollah's activities in Venezuela--\nHezbollah, the Middle Eastern terrorist group, supported by Iran.\n  The letter also speaks of the troubling new information that for at \nleast 3 years Venezuela and Iran have been putting factories together \nin remote areas of eastern Venezuela, which is the area believed to be \nrich in uranium.\n  In December of 2008, Turkish customs authorities caught one of these \njoint companies, literally called VenIran--``Ven'' for Venezuela--a \n``tractor factory,'' attempting to smuggle 22 containers of explosive \nmaterials labeled as ``tractor parts.''\n  Since 2007, we have pointed out, there have been direct flights \nbetween Caracas, Venezuela, and Tehran, Iran, without proper controls \nor customs verifications.\n  We have also pointed out in the letter there are increasing \nparamilitary Iranian forces operating in Venezuela.\n  We know from recent reports from the IAEA, the International Atomic \nEnergy Agency, that Iran now looks to have the nuclear fuel which will \ngive them the capability to build nuclear weapons. We have had open \ntestimony in front of the Armed Services Committee that within 3 to 5 \nyears Iran may have the intercontinental ballistic capability to \ndeliver those weapons across the ocean and put the United States in \njeopardy.\n  But Venezuela is a lot closer. There is no need for an ICBM from \nVenezuela. In fact, a flight from Venezuela to Florida is about the \nsame length in time as a flight from Florida to Washington, DC.\n  So we brought this letter to the attention of Secretary Clinton in \nMay. We wrote this letter on May 25, 2010.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 25, 2010.\n     Hon. Hillary Rodham Clinton,\n     Secretary of State, U.S. Department of State, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Clinton: We are deeply concerned about \n     Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez' growing ties with U.S.-\n     designated foreign terrorist organizations and state sponsors \n     of terrorism. This letter is to present you with a number of \n     questions that we believe should be thoroughly addressed \n     within the Department of State's 2009 Country Report on \n     Terrorism which was due to Congress on April 30, 2010. We \n     realize that thorough answers to some of these questions may \n     require a classified annex.\n\n\n                   PRESIDENT CHAVEZ' SUPPORT OF FARC\n\n       The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) is South \n     America's oldest and best armed terrorist group. As pointed \n     out in the 2008 Country Report on Terrorism, the FARC is \n     notorious for carrying out a full range of terrorist \n     activities to include kidnappings, murders, mortar attacks, \n     hijackings, and bombings against Colombian political, \n     military, and economic targets.\n       On March 1, 2008, a Colombian military strike against a \n     FARC camp in Ecuadorian territory successfully killed senior \n     FARC members, including Luis Edgar Devia Silva (aka Raul \n     Reyes). Silva was a known terrorist responsible for numerous \n     atrocities within Colombia, and his death and the subsequent \n     capture of his computer laptop provided a treasure trove of \n     intelligence. Chavez mourned the loss of Reyes and eulogized \n     this terrorist as a ``good revolutionary'' while amassing \n     troops on the Colombian border in an attempt to intimidate \n     his Latin American neighbor.\n       In light of what the U.S. government has discovered from \n     the ``Reyes'' documents and other sources, we ask that the \n     annual terrorism report provide attention to the following \n     questions:\n       What does the information found on Reyes' computer reveal \n     with regard to the depth of the relationship and support that \n     the FARC receives from high-ranking officials in the Chavez \n     government? Based on information gleaned from the laptop, \n     what type of surface-to-air missiles or man-portable air \n     defense systems (MANPADs) has Venezuela provided to the FARC \n     or enabled the FARC to obtain, and what threat do those \n     systems pose to Colombia and U.S. counterdrug efforts in the \n     region?\n       In September 2008, the U.S. Department of the Treasury's \n     Office of Foreign Assets Control designated two senior \n     Venezuelan Intelligence officials, Hugo Armando Carvajal \n     Barrios and Henry de Jesus Rangel Silva, and one former \n     senior security official, Ramon Rodriguez Chacin, for \n     materially assisting the FARC's illicit activities.\n       What types of weapons have these three senior Venezuelan \n     government officials enabled the FARC to acquire? To what \n     extent does the FARC use proceeds from illicit drug \n     trafficking to acquire weapons from the Venezuelan \n     government?\n       In late July 2009, the government of Sweden requested an \n     explanation from Venezuela about how the FARC obtained \n     Swedish-made anti-tank rocket launchers that had been sold to \n     Venezuela in the 1980s. Three of the launchers, matched by \n     their serial numbers, were recovered from a captured FARC \n     arms cache in October 2008.\n       Do we have the intelligence resources in place to properly \n     monitor the flow of guns and money from Venezuela to the \n     FARC? Are known FARC officials, such as Rodrigo Granda, Marin \n     Arango (aka Ivan Marquez), and Rodrigo London Echeverry (aka \n     Timochenko or Timoleon Jiminez) able to operate and move \n     freely within Venezuela?\n       Do you agree with Director of National Intelligence (DNI) \n     Dennis Blair's March 2009 testimony before the Senate Armed \n     Services Committee in which he stated that despite setbacks \n     brought about by the Colombian government's tireless efforts \n     ``the FARC leadership has shown no signs it seeks to end \n     hostilities or participate in serious peace talks'' and \n     further, that the FARC benefits from cross-border sanctuaries \n     in Venezuela?\n       It is well known that cocaine trafficking funds FARC \n     operations. The United Nations World Drug Report for 2009 \n     revealed that nearly one-third of all cocaine produced in the \n     Andean region passes through Venezuela. To what extent does \n     the Venezuelan government's involvement in the international \n     drug trade allow for millions of dollars to flow into the \n     coffers of narco-terrorists?\n       Recently, the Treasury Department, in an unprecedented \n     move, labeled an active foreign military official as an \n     international drug ``kingpin'' for enabling massive shipments \n     of cocaine from Venezuela into West Africa. Americans are now \n     banned from doing business with Ibraima Pap Camara, the Air \n     Force Chief of Staff in Guinea Bissau and the former head of \n     Guinea-Bissau's Navy and Jose Americo Bubo Na Tchuto, and any \n     assets the two might have had in the United States are now \n     frozen.\n       To what extent are drugs from Venezuela flowing into West \n     Africa, and what impact does that have on political \n     corruption, drug smuggling, and terrorist operations in the \n     region? Should President Chavez be held accountable under the \n     Kingpin Act for his role in the flow of drugs to the rest of \n     the world?\n       How much do terrorist groups such as Al-Qaida in the \n     Islamic Maghreb (AQIM) profit from trafficking drugs that \n     originate in or flow through Venezuela? What specific steps \n     is the United States taking to cooperate effectively with \n     countries in South America, North Africa, and the Sahel to \n     blunt the trafficking of drugs across the Atlantic and into \n     West Africa?\n\n\n                  HEZBOLLAH'S ACTIVITIES IN VENEZUELA\n\n       Prior to September 11, 2001, no terrorist group had killed \n     more Americans than Lebanon-based Hezbollah. On June 18, \n     2008, the U.S. Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets \n     Control announced that it was freezing the U.S. assets of two \n     Venezuelan based supporters of Hezbollah--Ghazi Nasr al Din \n     (a Chavez employed ``diplomat'') and Fawzi Kan'an for \n     providing direct support to Hezbollah. According to the \n     Department of Treasury, these two individuals were involved \n     in the planning of Hezbollah operations, including terrorist \n     attacks and kidnappings.\n       What is your assessment of the presence and activities of \n     Hezbollah inside Venezuela? What is your assessment of the \n     purpose and implications of a meeting in Beirut on or about \n     February 1, 2010, between Adel El Zabayar and Imad Saab, \n     deputies of the Venezuelan National Assembly, and Nawaf \n     Musawi, director of international relations of Hezbollah?\n       On November 3, 2009, our Israeli allies stopped the cargo \n     ship MV Francop before it could reach its destination in \n     Syria, which is a state sponsor of terrorism. The Francop was \n     loaded with 36 shipping containers holding 500 tons of \n     Katyusha rockets, mortars, grenades, and a half-million \n     rounds of small-arms ammunition suspected to be bound for \n     Hezbollah.\n       Is there information confirming that the Francop had \n     stopped in the Venezuelan port of Guanta before sailing for \n     Syria and at the\n\n[[Page S4635]]\n\n     same time that Venezuelan Foreign Minister Nicolas Maduro was \n     in Damascus visiting with Syrian President Bashar Al-Assad? \n     Are there any indications of a substantial Iranian security \n     presence in Guanta?\n\n\n        PRESIDENT CHAVEZ SUPPORT FOR STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM\n\n       In addition to his documented support for Hezbollah and the \n     FARC, President Chavez has closely aligned himself with Cuba \n     and Iran, both of which are already on the State Sponsors of \n     Terrorism List.\n       Venezuela's financial support for state sponsors of \n     terrorism is evident by Chavez's extensive support of the \n     Castro regime in Cuba, which is calculated to amount to $1 \n     billion a year. To what extent does Venezuelan assistance to \n     the Cuban regime facilitate the regime's ongoing repression \n     of the pro-democracy movement and forestall a transition to \n     democracy in Cuba? How deeply are Cuban advisors involved in \n     the intelligence and security apparatus of the Venezuelan \n     government?\n       What is your assessment of the role of long-term Castro \n     confidant Ramiro Valdez as a special advisor to the \n     government of Venezuela and the impact it will have on pro-\n     democracy leaders and movements in Venezuela? What role, if \n     any, did Valdez play in the recent purge of over 100 \n     Venezuelan military officers?\n       With respect to Iran, President Chavez has repeatedly \n     expressed support for that country's covert nuclear program \n     and announced in September 2009 a plan for the construction \n     of a ``nuclear village'' in Venezuela with Iranian \n     assistance.\n       In your judgment, to what extent is Venezuela supporting \n     Iran's covert nuclear enrichment program development? What is \n     the current state of Venezuela's nuclear program, and to what \n     extent is Iran providing nuclear knowhow to Venezuela? Under \n     the present conditions, does Venezuelan-Iranian nuclear \n     cooperation violate the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and \n     United Nations International Atomic Energy Agency protocols?\n       We have seen reports of suspicious Venezuelan-Iranian \n     companies sprouting in remote areas of Venezuela, including \n     the VenIran ``tractor factory.'' In December 2008, Turkish \n     customs inspectors intercepted 22 shipping containers bound \n     for VenIran that were labeled ``tractor parts'' but instead \n     contained an ``explosives lab'' and chemicals that could be \n     used to manufacture explosives. What is your assessment of \n     the activities carried out by VenIran? Is it possible that \n     its facilities are a front for illicit, possibly even \n     nuclear, technology-related activities?\n       Congress is close to authorizing a comprehensive set of \n     sanctions aimed at restricting Iranian access to refined \n     fuels in a bid to stop Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons. \n     At the same time, Iran has a growing financial presence in \n     Venezuela, and President Chavez has pledged to provide Iran \n     with 20,000 barrels of gasoline per day.\n       To what extent are Venezuela's financial institutions \n     assisting the Iranian nuclear enrichment program? Are you \n     concerned about the activities of the Venezuelan Banco \n     Internacional de Desarrollo and the Banco Binacional Irani-\n     Venezolano? To what extent could Venezuela's financial \n     institutions and energy resources help Iran undermine \n     bilateral or international sanctions designed to stop its \n     covert nuclear program?\n       The 2008 Country Report on Terrorism confirmed that Iran \n     and Venezuela continued weekly flights connecting Tehran, \n     Syria, and Caracas and that passengers on these flights were \n     only subject to ``cursory immigration and customs controls.'' \n     What is the U.S. government's understanding of the number of \n     passengers and nature of their travel as well as the type of \n     cargo transported on these flights? Is the Administration \n     concerned that these flights are being used for nefarious \n     purposes?\n       On April 21, the Secretary of Defense issued a report \n     regarding the current and future military strategy of Iran. \n     The report states that Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard \n     Corps-Qods Force maintains world-wide operational \n     capabilities and that ``recent years have witnessed an \n     increased presence in Latin America, particularly \n     Venezuela.''\n       What threat does the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps-Qods \n     Force presence in Venezuela pose to the United States and our \n     interests in Latin America? What if any measures is the \n     Administration taking to verify the extent of terrorism \n     activities in Venezuelan territory? How is the Administration \n     ensuring that all appropriate branches of the U.S. government \n     are aware of these key findings?\n\n\n  IMPLICATIONS OF ADDING VENEZUELA TO THE STATE SPONSORS OF TERRORISM \n                                  LIST\n\n       The State Department currently designates four nations--\n     Syria, Cuba, Sudan, and Iran--as state sponsors of terrorism. \n     These countries provide ideological support and material \n     assistance to terrorist groups. Once you consider the \n     evidence behind Venezuela's substantial ties with U.S.-\n     designated terrorist organizations and state sponsors of \n     terrorism, we would like to know the strategic implications \n     of designating Venezuela a state sponsor of terrorism. We \n     would also like to know the implications for the integrity of \n     this list if Venezuela continues to evade designation.\n       Looking into the future--and short of designating Venezuela \n     a `State Sponsor of Terrorism'--what other concrete measures \n     are available to curb President Chavez' threatening ties with \n     terrorist groups and state sponsors of terrorism? Under what \n     conditions would the Administration apply such measures? Does \n     the U.S. government have a contingency plan to respond to a \n     sudden and prolonged unavailability of Venezuelan oil exports \n     to the United States?\n       Given that Chavez is expected to receive a $20 billion loan \n     from the Chinese Government and his government has just \n     signed yet another multi-billion dollar arms deal with Russia \n     for weapons that far exceed any rational analysis of \n     Venezuela's national defense requirements--it is clear that \n     this is the time to revisit our polices within the region. We \n     encourage you to work with all appropriate federal agencies \n     in obtaining thorough answers to these questions. We look \n     forward to further discussions about what steps the \n     Administration plans to take in order to address these \n     disturbing developments within our hemisphere.\n           Sincerely,\n         John Ensign,\n         George S. LeMieux,\n         James M. Inhofe,\n         Jon Kyl,\n         John McCain,\n         James E. Risch,\n         Roger F. Wicker,\n         Sam Brownback,\n         Jim Bunning,\n         Scott Brown,\n         Robert F. Bennett,\n         John Cornyn.\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. We hope to receive a response from the Department of \nState. I know firsthand that Secretary Clinton is focused on Latin \nAmerica. I have spoken to her on several occasions. I know she knows we \nneed to do a better job promoting democracy in Latin America. She \nshares that concern. We have had those conversations.\n  For too long, Latin America has been neglected by the United States \nin our diplomatic relations. For a variety of reasons, some of them \nwith good merit, we have been focusing to the east. But we cannot \nneglect our friends in Central and South America. We cannot neglect our \nfriends in Colombia, for example, or in Panama. That is why I have come \nto the floor on several occasions and called for the ratification of \nthe free-trade agreements between our country and those countries that \nonly makes sense. It not only makes sense for jobs and commerce, but it \nalso makes sense in terms of our good relations with our friends in the \nregion. No better friend do we have than in Colombia, right next door \nto this very concerning state of Venezuela.\n  The reason I come to the floor specifically today is that when we \nsent this letter on May 25, we expected to receive a response. Yet just \nlast Friday, Assistant Secretary Arturo Valenzuela, Assistant Secretary \nof State for Western Hemisphere Affairs, was asked about this letter \nbecause there was an upcoming trip by the Secretary of State to South \nAmerica.\n  Secretary Valenzuela was asked why Secretary Clinton was not going to \nVenezuela, and he explained. Then the question of this letter came up, \nand his response was:\n\n       Oh, I don't--because I was traveling, I don't know anything \n     about that letter, so I'd have to find out.\n\n  Now, I know they get a lot of letters over at the Department of \nState, but this letter is signed by 12 Senators. It has been widely \ncovered in the media. It was relevant enough that someone would ask the \nquestion at a press conference. Yet Mr. Valenzuela, through some \noversight, was unaware of the letter.\n  I look forward to getting a response from Secretary Clinton and \nAssistant Secretary Valenzuela to this letter. There is a gathering \nstorm in Venezuela. As much as we have to look across the ocean to our \nfears about Iran, their development of nuclear weapons and what they \nare going to do with those nuclear weapons, there is a concern to our \nsouth, very close to our shores in Venezuela, and a dangerous \ncombination which is occurring between Iran and Venezuela, Ahmadinejad \nand Hugo Chavez.\n  If we do not stay focused on it, mark my words, 3, 5 years from now \nwe are going to be seeing all the same developments in Venezuela we \nhave seen in Iran. We are going to see them starting to develop a \nnuclear presence for ``peaceful'' purposes. They are going to be \nplaying from the same playbook Ahmadinejad has played from in Iran.\n  We have to take aggressive measures against Iran. I have called, as \nmany Senators have, for this administration to get to work in a more \nexpeditious way to impose those sanctions--meaningful, hard sanctions \non Iran to stop\n\n[[Page S4636]]\n\ntheir nuclear program. We are reading in the newspaper today about \nIran--all the circuitous efforts it takes to reflag ships, rename ships \nso they can get weapons back into Iran and avoid our sanctions. We have \nto crack down on that. That is the diplomatic and foreign affairs \nproblem of today. But the diplomatic and foreign affairs problem of \ntomorrow is Venezuela, and steps should be taken right now to work \nahead of that problem so that 3 to 5 years from now we are not having \nall the same troubles with Venezuela that we are now having with Iran. \nYet they are far closer to the United States than Iran is.\n  So we sent this letter, and we look forward to the response. There \nare a lot of ramifications of declaring a country a state sponsor of \nterror. I am not asking that be done today. But I am asking it be \nseriously evaluated. That is why Senator Ensign and myself, along with \n10 other of our colleagues, sent this letter, and we would like to hear \na response. We would like it to be taken seriously. We would like this \nadministration to focus on Venezuela before it is a problem that gets \nahead of us, before it is a problem we do not have enough time to \naddress in a proactive and thoughtful manner.\n  Little problems become big problems. This problem is already beyond \nbeing little. Let's get on top of it. Let's evaluate it. We hope we get \na response to this letter as soon as possible, from the Secretary of \nState and the Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere \nAffairs.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                          Gulf Coast Oilspill\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I wish to say a few words about the \noilspill in the gulf and what has or has not been happening recently. I \ndon't think there is an American citizen who can really avoid seeing on \ntelevision or hearing on the radio or reading in the newspapers about \nthe devastating consequences of the oilspill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  The fact is, we have drilled for oil and have been producing oil in \nthe gulf for a long time, dating back to the 1940s. I believe something \nlike 50,000 wells have been dug offshore. So it is not a surprise that \nthere has been oil development offshore in this country, and we have \nachieved drilling a fair amount of oil for the needs of this country. \nBut it is also the case that deep well drilling--in this case, a well \nthat is drilled into the ocean floor a full mile below the surface of \nthe water and then down another 30,000 feet below that--is a very \ndifferent situation.\n  It is also now clear that this company, the company that was engaged \nin drilling this well, did not have the wherewithal, the technical \ncapability to decide: If something disastrous happens, we should be \nable to shut down the gusher of oil. I would have thought and would \nhave expected that the company would have covered the worst possible \ncircumstances. What if the worst thing happens? Do we have the \ncapability to address it? The answer at this point is no.\n  This is the 50th day in which oil has been gushing out into the Gulf \nof Mexico from this oil rig blowup. It is pretty clear to everybody \nthat, after trying a series of different things, the BP Corporation \ndoes not know how to address this gusher of oil into the gulf.\n  I was reading this morning another news story about this.\n  I confess to my colleagues that I don't live on the gulf. I am not \nfrom one of those States. They would, perhaps, know much more about it \nthan I would. But most of us in this country are learning from the \ninvestigations that are being done, and we are learning more and more \nabout not only what has happened, but what the consequences are.\n  The story this morning: ``Rate of Oil Leak, Still Not Clear . . . '' \nSo 50 days later, we don't understand how much is coming out of the \nfaucet, how much is spilling from this gusher into the Gulf of Mexico.\n  It is difficult or almost impossible to measure what has been the \neffect in recent days of some amount of containment that has been \nsuccessful. We know they are not containing all of the oil, but they \nare gathering some of the oil. The question is, What amount? What \npercentage of the oil that is gushing into the gulf is being contained?\n  One of the things that bothered me a fair amount is I am quoting now \nfrom a New York Times piece:\n\n       On Sunday, engineers halted their efforts to close all four \n     vents on the capping device, because even with one vent \n     closed, the amount of oil being captured was approaching \n     15,000 barrels a day, the processing capacity of the \n     collection ship on the surface.\n\n  If you are going to be able to collect more oil, why would you not \nhave enough ships on the surface to be able to allow you to close more \nof those vents and to capture more oil and have the requisite number of \nships on the surface to deal with it? I don't understand that at all. \nBut it seems to me that every time we read something new about this, it \nis that somebody didn't plan properly to try to address this issue.\n  The story goes on to say:\n\n       Some scientists involved in the Flow Rate Technical Group \n     say they would like to produce a better estimate, but they \n     are frustrated by what they view as stonewalling on BP's \n     part, including tardiness in producing high-resolution video \n     that could be subjected to computer analysis, as well as the \n     company's reluctance to produce a direct measurement of the \n     flow rate.\n\n  Continuing to quote:\n\n       They said the installation of the new device and the rising \n     flow of oil to the surface had only reinforced their \n     conviction they did not have enough information.\n\n  A Dr. Leifer said:\n\n       It's apparent that BP is playing games with us, presumably \n     under the advice of their legal team. It's six weeks that \n     it's been dumping into the gulf, and still no measurements.\n\n  Again, that is a direct quote from Dr. Leifer in this article.\n  All of us understand that the consequences of this are devastating. \nWe stand here and debate and talk and we go to hearings, yet there are \npeople at the end of a dock in some small town who look out, and all of \nthose fishing boats are idle, sitting at the dock, because it has \ndestroyed the fishing in that area. The shrimpers who would normally be \nout dealing with the shrimp beds, their boats are idle, their nets are \nidle. Those are people who are losing money every day, the people who \ncan't make a monthly payment on their boat that is sitting on the dock \nbecause they can't go out because their fishing industry is gone. Those \npeople have to make payments at the end of the month. The person with \nthe cafe or the restaurant on the dock that has very few people \nvisiting these days is losing money hand over fist. You could go on and \non about the consequences of what this has meant to the gulf--to the \nfamilies, to small businesses, to the fishing industry, the shrimpers, \nand so on.\n  So it seems to me it is time now, after 50 days, to ask a couple of \nother questions, and I am going to make a suggestion. I asked at a \nhearing recently whether the BP commitment, which says: We will pay or \nreimburse for all ``legitimate'' costs--I asked the Justice Department \nin a hearing: Is this pledge by BP a binding commitment? Does it bind \nanybody? The answer by the Justice department representative is that, \nno, it is not binding. It is a pledge.\n\n  I think that is certainly better than not having a pledge--to have a \ncompany whose rig has caused this gusher of oil, this unbelievable \nspill into the Gulf of Mexico--if that company makes a pledge, it is \nbetter than having a company walk away. On the other hand, a pledge \nwithout a binding commitment doesn't mean very much.\n  What I suggest at this point is that we, after 50 days, decide to go \nbeyond that pledge. I have seen people interviewed who have said: we \nhave submitted to BP what is happening to our small business, our \nfamilies, and our boats, and haven't gotten a response, or we got \nturned down, or this or that. It seems that we ought to understand the \nconsequences of this, and the depth of the costs is going to require \nsomething very different.\n  What I propose is the following: I think on this 50th day of the \nspill, what I believe should happen is that the Justice Department \nshould go to BP and\n\n[[Page S4637]]\n\nsay: Let us formalize an agreement in which you put the first $10 \nbillion from BP into a gulf coast recovery program. That gulf coast \nrecovery fund would be available and would be run by two interests. One \nwould be a special master who would represent the public interest, and \nthe second would be a counselor who would represent BP's interest, and \nthey would jointly manage the $10 billion gulf coast recovery funds--\nand it may need much more than that. At least the first step is that \nyou have $10 billion in a fund, and you have some public interest that \nis now involved in making judgments. Look, BP has its own interests at \nheart. I don't doubt that it wants this gusher stopped. I understand \nthat. I don't doubt at all that BP wants to minimize the damage. I am \nnot suggesting otherwise.\n  I am suggesting this: When presented with a range of alternatives, or \nof opportunities, or of actions, that a company will have to act in its \nbest interest. That is the requirement for its shareholders. That may \nwell not be in tandem or may not travel parallel with what is in the \npublic's interest. That is why I think that it is now time to say to BP \nthat you have made a pledge; is the pledge binding? Does it have real \nmoney behind it?\n  We read and see that they have spent $1.5 billion at this point. This \nis a company that made $150 billion in net profit in 10 years. That is \n$15 billion a year. Again, what I suggest is a $10 billion payment into \na gulf coast recovery fund, which the company would have a part in the \nmanagement of, and a special master representing the public interest \nwould have the management of, and that we proceed from there and \ndetermine how much more is required.\n  Perhaps if the $10 billion is not all required, the company gets \nreimbursed. My own expectation is that the cost of this spill will far \nexceed the $10 billion when it is all done. This is going to last for \nyears. We know that. This is not something that will be resolved in the \nnext 6 months. I am talking now about the costs. Let us hope that \nfinally, at long last, this spill, this gusher, gets shut down. But \nwhen that happens, there is so much more to do to try to understand \nwhat this means to the families who made their living on that coast. \nWhat does it mean to them? How do we go forward and recover? With what? \nThat is why I think this gulf coast recovery fund, with BP's money and \na special master involved in at least bringing the public interest into \nthe discussion about what kind of outlays from that fund are made and \nto whom and for what purposes, is critical.\n  I am going to write to the Justice Department today suggesting that \nthis is an approach that should be taken. Look, if BP is approached and \nBP says, you know what, we don't intend to put money into a fund, that \ntells us a little something, doesn't it? Is the money going to be \nthere, or isn't it? That is a partial answer to that. If the company \nsays we don't intend to put money into a gulf coast recovery fund--if \nthat is the case, then we have legislation on the floor with which we \ncould address that issue. There are ways to address this with fees and \nother applications to the company that caused this damage. Better, it \nseems to me, to take the company at its word when it pledges that it \nwill reimburse legitimate costs; but also say to them, as a result of \nthat pledge, let's now make it binding and let's begin to put together \nthis gulf coast recovery fund that represents a binding commitment from \nthe company.\n  If the company ultimately doesn't pay these costs, we know what would \nhappen. It will go on the backs of the American taxpayer. That is not a \nfair way to resolve this, and it is not acceptable. It is a very large \ncompany. It has made a substantial amount of money. It made $6 billion, \nas reported, in the first quarter of this year alone. Surely a $10 \nbillion initial commitment into a gulf coast recovery fund is not too \nmuch to ask, to begin the construction of a fund that would merge both \nthe public interest, which is important, with the private interest of \nBP, to make sure the funding is not only made available but that it is \nused in a way that addresses the significant costs that have been \nvisited upon the people who live and work in that region.\n  I know there are many ideas that are being kicked around in the \nCongress and elsewhere to try to address a wide range of issues. Many \nof them have great merit. It seems to me that we need to do something \nfor the family this morning who is wondering whether it is going to \nsurvive, whether its business can survive, whether it can make its boat \npayment on the fishing boat at the end of the month when there are no \nfish to catch. When the restaurant pulls the shades because it has no \ncustomers and it is right near the dock--all these folks, and so many \nothers, who have lost their jobs and who confront this questions of: \nWhat about us? What are we going to do? Will there be recovery for us, \nfor my family, and for our small town?\n  I think the best way for us to address this is to say let's make sure \nthe pledge made by BP becomes a binding one. I think that can be done \nwithout legislation. It can be done by this administration and the \nJustice Department reaching out and signing an agreement creating such \na fund, creating a special master with BP, having BP deposit the money \nso it could begin a robust, significant, and real recovery fund. If \nthis company says that is not their intent, that they don't intend to \ndo that, or they are not interested in doing that, then it seems to me \na binding requirement is one we should take up here on the floor of the \nSenate, and very quickly. There are plenty of ways--and I will not go \ninto them now--for us to address the question of whether the company \nthat caused this spill, this gusher of oil, which is certainly the most \nsignificant disaster in the gulf in the last century and perhaps more--\nif the company that caused that--whose rig caused that, says we don't \nintend to be a part of something like this, then there are approaches \nwe can use here in the Senate to make that company responsible for it \nin a binding way.\n  Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4303 to Amendment No. 4301\n\n       (Purpose: To establish 3 year discretionary spending caps)\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I call up the amendment that is at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Alabama [Mr. Sessions], for himself and \n     Mrs. McCaskill, proposes an amendment numbered 4303 to \n     amendment 4301.\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator McCaskill and I are again \noffering this amendment that would place a cap on discretionary \nspending in which we participate in every day but that tends to violate \nthe budget.\n  Our budget is a critically important component of our financial \nmanagement. I have been a member of the Budget Committee for a number \nof years, and it is very frustrating to see how it has gotten around \nthe budget. The legislation that is before us is just another example \nof violating the budget in ways that are not responsible. For example, \nthe unemployment compensation and the payments to physicians are not \nemergencies. They are just not. Any responsible household, any \nresponsible city, county, or State government knows that. When those \nleaders deal with financial crises, they have to figure out how to \nhandle them.\n  What we are doing with this legislation before us is borrowing money \nto pay a fundamental obligation of the United States of America, which \nis to pay doctors an adequate wage for doing Medicare work. They are \nalready paid less for Medicare than private insurance pays them for \ndoing the very same procedures, but we have another shortfall here. If \nCongress does not pass legislation, physicians will take a 21-percent \ncut in the amount of money they are paid. That cannot work because our \nphysicians are already, in\n\n[[Page S4638]]\n\nmany cases, losing money on Medicare treatment of our seniors. They \ncannot take a 21-percent cut. They will quit doing the work. This is \nnot a matter of debate. It will collapse the Medicare system. We need \nto do this, but that is the kind of expenditure that is fundamental. It \nis part of the obligation we have had for many years to pay physicians \nto do Medicare work. They do not do it for nothing. It ought not to be \npaid for by borrowing the money on top of all the debt we are now \nrunning up in this country.\n  Our national debt just hit $13 trillion. We will, in 5 years--now 4--\ndouble the national debt, and in 10 years we will triple the national \ndebt. Why? Because we are taking items that are baseline requirements \nof this government and miraculously converting them to emergencies and \nthen breaking the budget. If anybody objects, such as Senator Bunning \ndid on behalf of his 40-some-odd grandchildren, he is attacked as being \nagainst physicians or against the unemployed. Senator Coburn has raised \nthese issues. I support both of them. They are both right.\n  If the American people understood how irresponsibly we are managing \ntheir money, they would be even more upset with us than they already \nare. The American people are right to be upset with us. We are \nconverting fundamental governmental obligations to emergency spending. \nWhy? Because we do not have to pay for it; we can just borrow it. That \nis not right.\n  Senator McCaskill, my Democratic colleague, is concerned about these \nissues. We have worked together to offer this amendment that would make \nit harder to violate the budget caps, to make it more difficult and to \nhelp us to be more responsible in our spending. Quite a number of my \nDemocratic colleagues joined with us in this amendment and voted for \nit. Fifty-nine Senators voted for it on one of our previous votes. We \nwere one short of what is necessary to make it law--just one vote \nshort.\n  We are offering this amendment again. We have taken quite a number of \nsteps to make this legislation palatable and to respond to concerns \nthat some have raised, such as, would it impact the military? No. Would \nit impact legitimate emergency spending? No.\n  We have done some things that some may believe weaken the amendment a \nbit, but it still adds some real strength to it and real value. This \nkind of budget cap legislation is what allowed us to balance the budget \nin the late 1990s. I know President Clinton has touted that he balanced \nthe budget. If I recall, Congress--which appropriates every dollar that \nis spent--shut the government down at one point to try to contain \nPresident Clinton's proposed spending, and succeeded in doing so. That \neventually led to a balanced budget. The legislation that was in effect \nat that time, which was very similar to this proposal, expired, and \nthis is one reason spending has surged.\n  I thank the Chair for the opportunity to offer this amendment. We \nwill talk on it again later. I hope that we can enact these provisions \ninto law and that we will get that one extra vote necessary to make a \nreal bipartisan statement. We had bipartisan support for this amendment \nlast time, and it would make a real bipartisan statement to the whole \nfinancial world that we are beginning to take seriously our \nresponsibility to reduce this surging deficit. Only then will we begin \nto see the kind of stability in our economic markets that we must have.\n  I thank the Chair, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, today, our body starts debate on \nexpiring tax and health provisions. Around this Capitol building, the \nnickname of these items is called extenders. I wish to make a couple of \npoints on the process before I get into the substance of the \nsubstitute. My first point will reflect on how much the Democratic \nleadership has avoided a simpler, clearer, bipartisan approach. My \nsecond point will consider all of the other time-sensitive, unfinished \ntax legislation that appears to be abandoned with only a few weeks left \nin this session.\n  My first point deals with a conscious decision to use a partisan \nprocess for bipartisan issues. What I find surprising is that we are \ntaking up a package that, like the HIRE Act jobs bill of a few weeks \nago, absolutely belongs to the bicameral House and Senate Democratic \nleadership. It was negotiated between House and Senate Democratic \nleaders, with some input from their tax-writing committees and staff. \nThese discussions occurred entirely behind closed doors. As far as I \nknow, it was a Democrats-only discussion. It is not a conference \nagreement, where things are worked out in a sophisticated conference \ncommittee made up of people from the House and Senate.\n  Then, in addition, at the very last minute, the compromise took on \nthe properties of an amoeba. In that amoeba fashion, the House Rules \nCommittee split the bill into two pieces, one dealing with the so-\ncalled Medicare doctor fix and the rest of the bill dealing with the \nbalance of that package. Then, under the magic of the House Rules \nCommittee, this amoeba-like bill was reconstituted into one legislative \nproduct, and that is the underlying bill Leader Reid has brought before \nthe Senate this very day.\n  I am relieved to see that it appears the Senate will process \nextenders in a way that is different from the way the HIRE Act jobs \nbill was handled. It looks as though we Senators will have a chance to \nrepresent our constituents and shape this bill, because Leader Reid has \nnot filled the amendment tree or filed cloture at the start of debate. \nThat is a real relief around this body, where amendment trees have been \nfilled and cloture has been filed.\n  Back home, folks wonder why it is taking Congress so long to deal \nwith these routine extenders. As an example: As I left church Sunday in \nCedar Falls, IA, a person who has investment in a biodiesel plant wants \nto know when we are going to pass the biodiesel tax credit bill. Most \nof the tax provisions expired almost a half a year ago, on December 31, \n2009. Folks are angry that Congress seems to be dithering, among other \nthings, on the 71 tax provisions. In my State, it is a biodiesel tax \ncredit that always comes up, but people are wondering about the \ndithering generally. And, of course, we even have physicians across the \ncountry being frustrated that this Congress has allowed a 21-percent \ncut in payments to go into effect again this year. Payment cuts of this \nmagnitude severely impact physicians and health care providers and \npractitioners throughout the country, and they significantly threaten \nbeneficiary access to care.\n  Medicare beneficiaries' access to physicians and other needed medical \ncare has been jeopardized this year as never before because Senate \nDemocratic leadership has once again failed to pass an essential \nphysician update in a timely manner. We could have wrapped up this \ntime-sensitive legislative business 4 months ago. We could have taken \nup a bipartisan package that I put together with my friend, Finance \nCommittee Chairman Baucus of Montana. To be sure, some of the structure \nin this package reflects the agreement that my friend and I reached. \nBut this package, in terms of the impact on the deficit, is likely \nseveral times the size of the package we agreed upon. Virtually all of \nthe additional cost is due to proposals I would not have agreed to in \nrepresenting my Republican Conference.\n  I was under the impression that the Senate Democratic leadership was \ngenuine in its desire to work on a bipartisan basis, but clearly I was \nmistaken. Although the Senate Democratic leadership was highly involved \nin the development of a bipartisan bill, they arbitrarily decided to \nreplace it with a bill that skews toward their liberal wing. That is \nwhy we are where we are this very day. There is a liberal agenda that \nexalts open-ended deficit hiking, spending, and tax increases, and \ndoing it above everything else. Angry vocal members with that view seem \nto have dominated the decisionmaking of the Democratic leadership in \nresolving routine items.\n  The actions in the House a couple of weeks ago go on to further prove \nmy point. The Senate Republican leaders backed the Baucus-Grassley \ncompromise of last February. To them, it seemed to be a balanced \npackage. It was largely offset, it was leaner than most Democrats \nwanted, but it was thicker than most Republicans wanted. Republicans \npreferred a fully offset package using spending cuts; Democrats \nresisted most spending cut offsets\n\n[[Page S4639]]\n\nand wanted many multiples of the level of spending with which \nRepublicans were comfortable. So it is ideal, because this is the way \nit works most of the time between Senator Baucus and me.\n  The Baucus-Grassley compromise was a genuine middle ground. But for \nthe liberal core of the Democratic caucus, it was their way or the \nhighway. Leader Reid responded to that pressure and scuttled the \nBaucus-Grassley compromise. Ironically, almost 4 months later, it looks \nas though the Democratic caucus is moving closer to the structure of \nthe Baucus-Grassley compromise of last February.\n  The Senate Republican Conference, seeing the alarming growth in \ndeficits and debt in the intervening 4 months, will press hard for a \nfully offset package. For those in my conference, several fiscal \nevents--and these all occurring in the intervening 4 months since the \nBaucus-Grassley bill was scuttled--have been compelling on my side of \nthe aisle viewing this legislation a little bit differently.\n  The first event is the second opinions we are receiving on the fiscal \nimpact of the health care bill. The Congressional Budget Office has \nrevised the official spending upward.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \na copy of the CBO's May 11 letter to Congressman Jerry Lewis. The \nletter is accompanied by two tables that identify explicit \nauthorizations of discretionary funding. These tables are available \nalong with the full text of the letter on the CBO's website at \nwww.cbo.gov.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2010.\n     Hon. Jerry Lewis,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Appropriations, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman: As you requested, the Congressional \n     Budget Office is providing additional information about the \n     potential effects of H.R. 3590, the Patient Protection and \n     Affordable Care Act (PPACA, Public Law 111-148), on \n     discretionary spending. The following analysis updates and \n     expands upon the analysis of potential discretionary spending \n     under PPACA that CBO provided on March 13, 2010. In \n     particular, it provides an update of the earlier tally of \n     specified authorization amounts, as well as a list of \n     programs or activities for which no specific funding levels \n     are identified in the legislation but for which the act \n     authorizes the appropriation of ``such sums as may be \n     necessary.''\n       Potential discretionary costs under PPACA arise from the \n     effects of the legislation on a variety of federal programs \n     and agencies. The law establishes a number of new programs \n     and activities, as well as authorizing new funding for \n     existing programs. By their nature, however, all such \n     potential effects on discretionary spending are subject to \n     future appropriation actions, which could result in greater \n     or smaller costs than the sums authorized by the legislation. \n     Moreover, in many cases, the law authorizes future \n     appropriations but does not specify a particular amount.\n       CBO does not have a comprehensive estimate of all of the \n     potential discretionary costs associated with PPACA, but we \n     can provide information on the major components of such \n     costs. Those discretionary costs fall into three general \n     categories:\n       The costs that will be incurred by federal agencies to \n     implement the new policies established by PPACA, such as \n     administrative expenses for the Department of Health and \n     Human Services (HHS) and the Internal Revenue Service for \n     carrying out key requirements of the legislation.\n       Explicit authorizations for a variety of grant and other \n     program spending for which specified funding levels for one \n     or more years are provided in the act. (Such cases include \n     provisions where a specified funding level is authorized for \n     an initial year along with the authorization of such sums as \n     may be necessary for continued funding in subsequent years.)\n       Explicit authorizations for a variety of grant and other \n     program spending for which no specific funding levels are \n     identified in the legislation. That type of provision \n     generally includes legislative language that authorizes the \n     appropriation of ``such sums as may be necessary,'' often for \n     a particular period of time.\n       CBO estimates that total authorized costs in the first two \n     categories probably exceed $115 billion over the 2010-2019 \n     period, as detailed below. We do not have an estimate of the \n     potential costs of authorizations in the third category.\n       Implementation Costs for Federal Agencies--The \n     administrative and other costs for federal agencies to \n     implement the act's provisions will be funded through the \n     appropriations process; sufficient discretionary funding will \n     be essential to implement this legislation in the time frame \n     called for. Major costs for such implementation activities \n     will include:\n       Costs to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of implementing \n     the eligibility determination, documentation, and \n     verification processes for premium and cost-sharing credits. \n     CBO expects that those costs will probably total between $5 \n     billion and $10 billion over 10 years.\n       Costs to HHS, especially the Centers for Medicare and \n     Medicaid Services, and the Office of Personnel Management for \n     implementing the changes in Medicare, Medicaid, and the \n     Children's Health Insurance Program, as well as certain \n     reforms to the private insurance market. CBO expects that \n     those costs will probably total at least $5 billion to $10 \n     billion over 10 years.\n       Explicit Authorizations of Discretionary Funding--Explicit \n     authorizations are identified in Tables 1 and 2. Table 1 \n     presents a list of items for which PPACA specifies the \n     authorized amount of funding for at least one year. It also \n     includes items for which initial specified funding levels \n     existed under prior law but for which PPACA extends the \n     authority for continued spending. The specified and estimated \n     amounts shown in Table 1 total about $105 billion over the \n     2010-2019 period.\n       Table 1 differs from CBO's table of specified \n     authorizations provided on March 13, 2010, in the following \n     ways:\n       Certain provisions that extend (existing) authorizations \n     with a specified level have been added. (In the previous \n     version of that table, only new authorizations were \n     included.) Also, provisions that provide mandatory grants for \n     2010 but authorize future spending of such sums as necessary \n     (subject to appropriation) have been included. Those \n     provisions are noted in the updated table.\n       Table 1 includes an estimate of the cost of section 10221 \n     of PPACA, which incorporates the provisions of S. 1790, the \n     Indian Health Care Improvement Reauthorization and Extension \n     Act by reference. (CBO had not completed an estimate of the \n     Indian health provisions for the March 13 version of the \n     authorization table.) Those provisions authorize the \n     appropriation of such sums as are necessary for the Indian \n     Health Service (IHS) for carrying out responsibilities \n     broadly similar to those in law prior to enactment of PPACA. \n     As a result, the amounts included in Table 1 reflect recent \n     appropriations for those IHS programs, with adjustments for \n     anticipated inflation in later years.\n       Table 1 also includes a few corrections to the table \n     provided on March 13. For example, section 5207, which \n     authorizes funding for the National Health Service Corps, was \n     inadvertently left off the March 13 table but is included in \n     Table 1.\n       Table 2 presents a list of new activities for which PPACA \n     includes only a broad authorization for the appropriation of \n     ``such sums as may be necessary.'' For those activities, the \n     lack of guidance in the legislation about how new activities \n     should be conducted means that, in many cases, CBO does not \n     have a sufficient basis for estimating what the ``necessary'' \n     amounts might be over the 2010-2020 period.\n       Although Tables 1 and 2 provide more information about the \n     discretionary costs associated with PPACA, they do not \n     represent all of the potential budgetary implications of \n     changes to existing discretionary programs--including both \n     potential increases and decreases relative to recent \n     appropriations. Some of those changes could affect spending \n     under existing authorizations or may lead the Congress to \n     consider making changes--up or down--in the funding for \n     existing programs. Moreover, some of the potential new costs \n     for individual provisions of the legislation may be covered \n     by the broad estimate of $5 billion to $10 billion for \n     administrative costs to HHS.\n       I hope you find this information useful. If you have any \n     questions about this updated analysis of PPACA's implications \n     for future discretionary appropriations, please contact me or \n     CBO staff. The primary staff contacts for this analysis are \n     Jean Hearne and Julie Lee.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Douglas W. Elmendorf,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. That letter documents CBO's projections that health \nreform will result in at least $115 billion in additional spending \nbeyond what was previously included in the total of last March.\n  In addition, Douglas Elmendorf, Director of the Congressional Budget \nOffice, recently indicated that the landmark health care reform bill \nwould not accomplish its primary fiscal objective of reducing Federal \nhealth expenditures.\n  Dr. Elmendorf made this point in a presentation to the Institute of \nMedicine on May 26, of this year. The presentation is titled ``Health \nCosts and the Federal Budget'' and is available on the CBO website as \nwell.\n  The second event is the record buildup of public debt. Last week, the \nFederal public debt passed $13 trillion. On that monstrous number, $1 \ntrillion was added in the last year all by itself.\n  The third event is the continuous mounting of the cost of the \nstimulus bill. Recent Congressional Budget Office scoring shows that \npolicy, instead\n\n[[Page S4640]]\n\nof being roughly $800 billion, is now exceeding $1 trillion.\n  The fourth event is the fiscal troubles in the country of Greece. Too \nmuch spending and public debt has put Greek public finance in a state \nof distress.\n  The fifth event is the troubling developments in States with large \nopen-ended social spending programs and already very high income taxes. \nThe people who send us here are also reading these reports and they are \nrightfully worried about these fiscal troubles. They are sending one \nmessage to Washington, and it is as clear as any bell. They are saying: \nReverse course on deficits and debt. They say we in Congress ought to \nrestrain ourselves and our policies; pull back on extra spending. \nRepublicans heard that message a while ago, and it looks to me as \nthough Democrats are hearing the same thing.\n  To sum up at this point, on the first point I have been speaking \nabout--on process--the Democratic leadership, by avoiding a genuine \nbipartisan compromise, is continuing to take a very long path to \nresolving this overdue unfinished business. The bipartisan path to \nsucceed was set forth almost 4 months ago--early February--and that was \nthe Baucus-Grassley compromise.\n  Unfortunately, the tax offsets--largely noncontroversial--were lifted \nfrom that compromise and used for something totally unrelated, but to \ncover the bloated spending in the health care bill. To retain the \nspirit of that compromise, those offsets would need to be replaced by \nrestraints on spending. Republicans, in our alternative, will show the \nway to achieve those savings.\n  As has been the case for the last year and a half, those who pay \nincome tax and those who receive government checks aren't treated \nsimilarly.\n  Even with those revisions, keep in mind on net, the taxpayer is \npaying at least $40 billion more in this bill. Spending constituents \nreceive almost $100 billion in new spending.\n  My second process point goes to time-sensitive legislative business \nthat is yet unfinished in terms of revenue and taxpayers affected. The \nother unfinished tax legislative business dwarfs the measures in this \nbill now before the Senate.\n  There are three major policy areas that need to be addressed. I do \nnot know when they are going to be addressed. These three issues are \nthe death tax, the current alternative minimum tax fix--that is an \nannual process we go through--and, three, the bipartisan 2001 and 2003 \ntax relief plans. So I want to go into these in some detail.\n  I have a chart that shows the status of these three policy issues. \nLet's start with the death tax, or the estate tax, whatever you want to \ncall it. Since the first of the year there has been no death tax. If \nyou died, up to this point, presumably, your estate is going to be tax \nfree. At the end of this year, the death tax then reappears, and not in \na very friendly way.\n  After failing to act for almost 3 years in the majority, the House \nDemocratic leadership put a death tax reform measure before the House \nlast year at the same time it should have been discussed in the Senate. \nBut the Senate has not acted on the House bill.\n  I might suggest to you that we had to act on that health care bill \nbecause it takes effect in 2014, but tax extenders and the estate tax \nthat had to be settled in December were not even discussed.\n  In Iowa I can tell you that confusion and the anxiety over the \nuncertain state of the death tax comes up in my town meetings all the \ntime. I would be surprised if other Senators are not hearing the same \nthing. I got a letter signed by 750 lawyers and accountants in my State \nsaying: How do we advise our clients? What is the estate tax going to \nbe for the future?\n  It is not a case of just what the tax law is, it is the case of \nmillions of people wanting to plan estates and cannot do it. I refer \nagain to my friend, Chairman Baucus, who was working on a compromise \nproposal with Senators Lincoln, Kyl, and myself.\n  Unfortunately, the liberal core of the Senate Democratic caucus seems \nto prefer no action at all. My friend, the junior Senator from Vermont, \nhas been transparent about his desire to leave the law as it is; in \nother words, next year only have a million-dollar exemption.\n  Others feel just as strongly, but perhaps are not as transparent as \nthe junior Senator from Vermont. In any event, the effect of failing to \nreform current law will be to raise the number of people hit by the \ndeath tax by a factor of 10 times. What I am saying is, stalling out a \nbipartisan reform, which seems to be the liberal core's objective, will \nlikely mean 10 times as many family farmers and small businesses will \nbe hit with the death tax. A reform like the one envisioned by Senators \nLincoln and Kyl will mean only the richest 10 percent of dead peoples' \nestate will face the death tax.\n  Now I would like to turn to a second major area of unfinished \nbusiness; that is, the alternative minimum tax fix. This is one of \nthose yearly or biannual things the Congress goes through so that \nmiddle-class Americans will not pay a tax that was meant just for the \nvery wealthy. So we are talking about this year's tax fix already.\n  The law says 30 million Americans, or maybe more accurately 24 \nmillion Americans, ought to be paying this income tax right now. The \ntrouble is they do not file until next year, so it gives us a chance to \ndo something about it. But for those filing quarterly, if they are not \ntaking that into consideration they are violating the law.\n  In the next week, on June 15, the second installment of this year's \nestimated income tax is due. Last year, 24 million middle-income \nfamilies were spared from the unfair hit of the alternative minimum \ntax. The fix meant $2,300 per family. This year those figures are going \nto go up.\n  If the law is not changed, all those families will have to pay at \nleast $2,300 more per family. In my State of Iowa, it means at least \n124,000 middle-income families will be paying additional income tax \nthat was only meant for the very wealthy.\n  No bill has been marked up or passed in the House that deals with \nthis problem. Under current law, some of these millions of families \nshould be paying estimated tax next week, June 15.\n  Finally, let's take a look at the third major area of unfinished tax \nbusiness. Here we have a chart, and I am referring to the widely \napplicable rate cuts in family tax relief from the 2001 and 2003 \nbipartisan tax relief plans.\n  Virtually every American who pays income tax, and millions more who \ndo not under current law, will have a higher tax bill if we do not \nextend the 2001 and 2003 bipartisan tax relief bills. For years I have \nreferred to the sunset of these plans as a tax wall. Middle-income \nfamilies will run right into a very firm wall of tax increases.\n  For a family of four with an income of $50,000, that tax wall is \n$2,300. For a single mom with two kids earning $30,000, that tax wall \nis $1,100. No bill has been marked up or passed in the House that deals \nwith this problem.\n  You may hear some on the other side say: Too bad about the sunset. \nThey argue that the bipartisan group wrote the tax relief plans with a \nsunset. The sunset, therefore, is the responsibility of the bipartisan \nauthors of these plans.\n  If that argument is advanced by members of the current majority, \nkeeping in mind they have had control of Congress for 3\\1/2\\ years, I \nwait for that as an opportunity to quickly respond. My response will be \nto provide a citation of all of the filibusters led by the Democratic \nleadership on Republican attempts to make all three of these areas of \nbipartisan tax relief permanent law.\n  The bill before us has very timely and important measures. In nearly \nall instances, the expiring tax provisions are treated the same way as \nthey were treated under the Baucus-Grassley agreement of almost 4 \nmonths ago, going back to early February.\n  I thank my friend, the chairman of the committee, Senator Baucus, and \nthe Democratic leadership for holding on to those pieces of the Baucus-\nGrassley agreement. Especially important is an extension of the \nbiodiesel tax credit because we have thousands of workers--and I have \nseen the figure of 23,000--who have been idled throughout 44 States of \nthe United States as they have shut down the plants.\n  So if you really want a jobs bill, reinstate the biodiesel tax credit \nand you will put thousands of workers in Iowa back to work, and about \n23,000 nationally.\n  Likewise, Iowa companies, such as Rockwell Collins in Cedar Rapids, \nIA,\n\n[[Page S4641]]\n\nhave taken charges to earnings as the research and development credit \nhas lapsed. Unfortunately, there are some notable deviations from the \nBaucus-Grassley agreement of last February. Two pieces of the \nMidwestern disaster relief package were dropped from the Baucus-\nGrassley agreement in the Senate bill. The alternative fuels credit was \naltered to remove coal-to-liquids and other promising cutting edge \ntechnologies.\n  The bill before us actually also leaves out some very important \nprovisions of rural health care. These rural health care provisions \nwhere included in the Baucus-Grassley agreement of last February but \nhave since been dropped by the Democratic leadership.\n  Here again we will have a Republican alternative that will show the \nway on including these important items and having them offset; in other \nwords, they will be paid for. These important rural health care \nprovisions would keep ambulances running in rural areas and improve \nMedicare payments for both urban and rural hospitals so they are able \nto keep their doors open.\n  There is also an important provision left off the bill that ensures \nthat physicians in rural areas are paid fairly relative to urban \nStates.\n  Is that such a hard thing to figure, that if you are under Medicare, \na national program, you ought to be treated the same in rural areas as \nurban America?\n  The bill before us also fails to protect beneficiaries from having \ntheir physical and occupational therapy cut off. It also fails to \nextend the add-on payment for Medicare mental health services furnished \nby psychologists and mental health counselors.\n  This add-on has been critical in improving access to mental health \ncare services for Medicare beneficiaries and even military personnel \nsuffering from stress and other mental health issues. Again, the \nRepublican alternative will afford these protections and offset the \ncosts; in other words, it will be paid for.\n  The bill before us also fails to extend the Q-I program, which \nprovides assistance to low-income beneficiaries. The Q-I program covers \nthe Part B premium and out-of-pocket costs for seniors. Without it, \nmany low-income seniors will be forced to decide between getting needed \nmedical care and basic necessities such as food.\n  The bill before us misses the opportunity to fix the incredibly \nshort-sighted policy in the health reform bill that created a Medicaid \npayment cliff for primary care providers.\n  Have we not learned anything from our Medicare provider payment \nproblems? The Republican alternative converts the 2-years of additional \npayments to Medicare providers to a grant program to get States to \nincrease payments to providers. The same dollars, but we do not end up \nhaving a cliff where there will have to be a lot of money made up at \nsome future time.\n  On the offsets side, as I indicated above, revenue raisers that were \nnoncontroversial were lifted, and these were, in a sense, transferred \nfor yet more spending in that bloated health care reform bill that \npassed in March.\n  This meant the bicameral Democratic leadership had to yet scrape \ndeeper to this offset barrel. They pulled out a House-passed change on \ncarried interest. They raided the international tax policy area. They \nmoved revenue-raising ideas out of that area and used them to offset \nproposals like yet another expansion of the Build America Bonds. That \nis a program I have questioned in the past.\n  This transaction cannot bode well for efforts to reform our outdated \nand uncompetitive international tax titles.\n  It follows the destruction of the bipartisan tax policy reform of the \nworldwide interest allocation rules. The losers are U.S.-based \ncompanies and their workers. The net tax cost of doing business \nglobally will rise for American-based firms. We already have a \nnoncompetitive corporate tax system. Why would we want to make it more \nuncompetitive? Why would we want to transfer more jobs overseas? This \nwon't rise for competing firms based in other countries. So Japan, the \nUK, Germany--name any country--those competing firms will have a leg up \nbecause of the tax policy in this bill.\n  Some characterized these generic tax increases as ending a tax \nincentive for shipping jobs overseas. As I have indicated, the opposite \nwill occur. The embedded higher taxes burden only U.S.-based companies. \nIn a globally competitive environment, with much of the growth in sales \noverseas, the impact of those taxes will have to be absorbed here in \nthe United States. The after-tax rate of return on those U.S.-based \nbusiness activities will decline. The costs will have to be cut \nelsewhere to pull the rate of return back up to a competitive level \nbecause, in this global economy, we have to compete. U.S.-based labor \nand other expenses will, as we might not be surprised, be cut.\n  As with the health care bill, the American people are sending a \nmessage to those of us representing them in the Congress. The message \nis this: Finish these time-sensitive matters and do it in a fiscally \nresponsible manner. Of course, that is a message that has been ignored \nfor several months.\n  Now we get to these tax extenders. They have been attacked as fat-cat \ntax breaks one week. Then a week later the same critics have labeled \nthem as job incentives. They have been hijacked and manipulated for \npartisan purposes. That is why, 4 months after scuttling a bipartisan \ncompromise on bipartisan policy, the Senate finds itself struggling to \ncomplete this bill. It could have been done so easily in February. This \nis somehow routine, unfinished business the American people rightly \nexpect us to complete.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I take this time to talk about amendment \nNo. 4304, which I hope I will be able to get cleared by setting aside \nthe pending amendment in order to offer it.\n  At this time, let me bring to the attention of my colleagues what the \namendment would do. This amendment would affect the Federal employees' \nhealth benefit plans by allowing the administrator to change the \ncurrent rules to enroll children up to the age of 26. Currently, the \nrestriction for Federal employees is that they can only enroll \nunmarried children to age 22.\n  There are 8 million Federal employees and retirees covered under the \nFederal Employees Health Benefits Plan. As I am sure everyone is aware, \nunder the law recently passed and signed by President Obama, we have \nnow extended coverage for children up to the age of 26. However, that \nbecomes effective under the law for plans entered into after September \n23, 2010. For most plans, the requirement to include children being \nable to enroll up to age 26 would begin on January 1 of next year when \nthe plan year begins.\n  Private insurance companies have responded. They understand that this \nis not really a cost issue and that it makes sense to allow the \nchildren of the plan holders up to the age of 26 to be enrolled \nimmediately. Most of the private insurance companies have responded by \nopening enrollment now.\n  OPM Director John Berry would like to do the same. He has stated he \nwould like to begin expanding coverage for enrollee adult children now, \nrather than wait until January to offer this cost-saving benefit. The \nproblem is, current law prevents him from doing that because of the \ndefinition of a dependent child being an unmarried child, age 22.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to give OPM the authority to start \nto enroll now children who have not reached their 26th birthday. This \nis particularly important knowing we are in the graduation season. Many \nof us are very proud to attend our children's graduations. Many of \nthese children would like to remain on their parents' policy now that \nthey are no longer eligible for insurance at college. Unfortunately, \nwithout this change, they will have to wait until January of next year, \nwhich will cause a lapse in coverage.\n  The scoring of this is insignificant. We are not talking about a \nsignificant amount of additional cost. In fact, we believe it is really \na cost-savings issue.\n  This amendment was offered as a bill and enjoys bipartisan support. \nSenators Collins, Lieberman, Akaka, Rockefeller, Mikulski, Bingaman, \nJohnson, Kaufman, Kerry, Landrieu, Stabenow, Warner, Dodd, Dorgan, \nLevin, Cantwell, Casey, and Hagan have joined in cosponsoring this \nlegislation. It has the support of the National Active and Retired \nFederal Employees Association, the National Federation of Federal \nEmployees, the American Federation of Government\n\n[[Page S4642]]\n\nEmployees, the National Treasury Employees Union, and the list goes on.\n  This amendment makes abundant sense. Our clear intent is to allow \nthose who are under Federal employees' health benefit plans to take \nadvantage of enrolling their children now. This amendment basically \nclarifies that law so that OPM can move forward to enroll children up \nto the age of 26 immediately and not wait until January of next year, \ncausing a lapse in coverage. It is a bipartisan amendment, \ninsignificant cost. I hope it will be cleared so I may offer it, and \nhopefully we can act on it without too much time.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/08/senate-section/article/S4642-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4642]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senator from Alabama took issue with \nthe use of an emergency designation in the substitute before us. Let me \ntake a moment to explain why that use of the emergency designation is \nentirely appropriate.\n  First, the concluding section of the amendment designates two items \nas emergency items. Those items are unemployment insurance and \nadditional payments to States under Medicaid. Both of these items are \ndirectly related to the economic emergency that we find ourselves in; \nnamely, the great recession.\n  From the beginning of emergency designations, with the Budget \nEnforcement Act of 1990, Congress has recognized periods of recession \nas true emergencies, and that makes good economic sense as well. It \nmakes good sense to allow automatic stabilizers such as unemployment \ninsurance and Medicaid to spend more when the economy is in rough \nshape. Programs such as unemployment insurance and Medicaid help to \ncushion the blow for those hurt by bad economic times. Programs such as \nunemployment insurance and Medicaid help to increase economic demand, \nand that helps to keep the recession shorter than it otherwise would \nbe.\n  That is why the old Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law provided for exceptions \nto budget discipline in periods of recession. It is why the Budget \nEnforcement Act carried on that policy by allowing exceptions for \nbudget emergencies, and budget resolutions have carried that policy \nfurther to the current day.\n  The Senator from Alabama also took issue with the budgetary treatment \nof payments to doctors under Medicare. That provision is in our \namendment, paying doctors at the end of next year. In our amendment, \nthe provision on doctors' payments simply says this provision will be \naccounted for as Congress provided in the Pay-As-You-Go Act. This \nprovision does not evade the budget law. This provision merely provides \nfor this bill's treatment in accordance with the budget law. So the \nbudgetary treatment of this bill is consistent with the budget law and \nit is entirely appropriate.\n  The Senator from Alabama has once again offered his amendment to put \ncaps on appropriated spending. That is basically the same amendment the \nSenate has repeatedly rejected. The Senator from Hawaii, the \ndistinguished chairman of the Appropriations Committee, will no doubt \nhave more to say about this in due course. At this point let me note \nthe Sessions amendment violates the Congressional Budget Act and I \nexpect a point of order to be raised against the Sessions amendment \nlater today.\n  Mr. President, I now ask unanimous consent that the Sessions \namendment be temporarily laid aside so the Senator from Maryland may \noffer an amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4304 to Amendment No. 4301\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 4304.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Mr. Cardin] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 4304 to amendment No. 4301.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To provide for the extension of dependent coverage under the \n               Federal Employees Health Benefits Program)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ____. EXTENSION OF DEPENDENT COVERAGE UNDER FEHBP.\n\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the ``FEHBP \n     Dependent Coverage Extension Act''.\n       (b) In General.--\n       (1) Provisions relating to age.--Chapter 89 of title 5, \n     United States Code, is amended--\n       (A) in section 8901(5)--\n       (i) in the matter before subparagraph (A), by striking ``22 \n     years of age'' and inserting ``26 years of age''; and\n       (ii) in the matter after subparagraph (B), by striking \n     ``age 22'' and inserting ``age 26''; and\n       (B) in section 8905(c)(2)(B)--\n       (i) in clause (i), by striking ``22 years of age'' and \n     inserting ``26 years of age''; and\n       (ii) in clause (ii), by striking ``age 22'' and inserting \n     ``age 26''.\n       (2) Provisions relating to marital status.--Chapter 89 of \n     title 5, United States Code, is further amended--\n       (A) in section 8901(5) and subsections (b)(2)(A), \n     (c)(2)(B), (e)(1)(B), and (e)(2)(A) of section 8905a, by \n     striking ``an unmarried dependent'' each place it appears and \n     inserting ``a dependent''; and\n       (B) in section 8905(c)(2)(B), by striking ``unmarried \n     dependent'' and inserting ``dependent''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall become effective as if included in the enactment of \n     section 1001 of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \n     Act (Public Law 111-148), except that the Director of the \n     Office of Personnel Management may implement such amendments \n     for such periods before the effective date otherwise provided \n     in section 1004(a) of such Act as the Director may specify.\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I took the floor a little earlier today to \nexplain that this amendment allows the members of the Federal Employees \nHealth Benefits plan to be able to enroll their children up to age 26 \nimmediately rather than waiting for the beginning of the year, which \nwould effectively deny those who are graduating from college today, who \nmay not qualify as being under 22 and single, to be able to stay or \nenroll on their parents' Federal Employee Benefits plan. This is an \namendment that the OPM Director supports in that he would like to do \nthis but can't do it under the current law. It has minimal cost.\n  Private insurance companies are allowing up to 26-year-olds to enroll \non their parents' policies today. This allows the government workforce \nto have those same rights. It would normally take effect at the \nbeginning of the year. It makes sense to do this now. It is bipartisan. \nIt is supported by Democratic and Republican Senators. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  With that, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I rise to speak to the pending bill and a \npotential amendment Senator Vitter is preparing and hopes to offer, an \namendment which would make sure that any increase in the trust fund for \noilspills would be spent on cleaning up oilspills. That might seem \nrather obvious, but it turns out that the bill before us increases the \nrequired contribution of oil companies to this trust fund to clean up \noilspills from 8 cents to 41 cents per barrel and then spends the money \nnot to clean up oilspills but, rather, to pay for other items in the \nunderlying legislation, the so-called extenders bill.\n\n[[Page S4643]]\n\nThat is not right. If we are going to increase the money to pay for \noilspills, we ought to spend the money to clean up oilspills.\n  What the Vitter amendment does is very simple. It says if that is \nwhat we are raising the money to do, then that is what we should spend \nit on. I will quote from the amendment:\n\n       The revenue resulting from any increase in the Oil Spill \n     Liability Trust Fund financing rate under section 4611 of the \n     Internal Revenue Code of 1986 shall--\n       (1) not be counted for purposes of offsetting revenues, \n     receipts, or discretionary spending under the Congressional \n     Budget Act of 1974 or the Statutory Pay-As-You-Go Act of \n     2010; and\n       (2) shall only be used for the purposes of the Oil Spill \n     Liability Trust Fund.\n\n  It is fairly straightforward.\n  Why do we have to have this amendment? Because the underlying bill, \nthe extenders bill, raises the required contribution to the trust fund \nand then spends that money not on cleaning up oilspills but to pay for \nthe extension of benefits under the so-called extenders bill. It \ndoesn't pay for anything in particular; it is simply used to offset the \n$100-plus billion expenses in this legislation.\n  The particular provision in the underlying bill that raises the \ncontribution of the oil companies from 8 cents a barrel excise oil tax \nto 41 cents is section 431. The House-passed extenders package \nincreased it to 34 cents a barrel, and then, under the provisions of \nthis legislation, it is increased to 41 cents a barrel.\n  Why is this being done? The reason this is being done is to offset \npart of the expense of the $100-plus billion of this extenders bill. It \ndoesn't offset all of the expenses, obviously.\n  If we are going to raid the oil trust fund, which otherwise would be \nused to clean up the oilspill, we better have a very good reason for \ndoing so, especially since all attention is focused right now on the \nvery difficult job of dealing with this big disaster. In fact, it has \nbeen described as the biggest disaster of its kind in all of history \nfor the United States. We are going to need every dime we can get in \norder to pay for the oilspill.\n  What happens? About the time we seek to get the money to deal with \nthis disaster, whoever is in charge of the money says: We are sorry. It \nis all gone. We spent it on the tax extenders bill.\n  We ask: What does the tax extenders bill have to do with the 41 cents \nper barrel collected from the oil companies?\n  Nothing. But we needed the money, so we spent it instead.\n  That reminds me of two other examples. We pay into the Social \nSecurity trust fund so that when we retire, the funds are there to pay \nus. It turns out that each year more money is paid into the fund than \nis necessary to pay out in benefits. As a result, we take that money \nand we put it away so we will have it in the future, right? Wrong. \nCongress spends it.\n  So when Social Security needs that money to pay seniors' retirement, \nit goes to the bank and says: We need some of that money now.\n  The bank says: We are sorry. Congress has already spent it all. You \nwill have to raise taxes on the American public so there is enough \nmoney to pay seniors their retirement.\n  But didn't seniors already pay into the retirement?\n  Yes, they did.\n  What happened to the money?\n  Congress spent it.\n  A more recent example is the health care legislation. We decided--not \nwe; the other side--it would be a good idea to save $500 billion from \nMedicare; in other words, to reduce the expenses of Medicare by $\\1/2\\ \ntrillion over 10 years. Some of us thought it is certainly the case \nthat the Medicare trust fund is in trouble. There isn't enough money in \nthe Medicare trust fund to continue to pay benefits for seniors' health \ncare. At least what they are trying to do will extend the life of \nMedicare. In fact, the claim was made by many on this side of the \naisle: This is going to extend the life of Medicare, extend the trust \nfund's viability for 17 years. It was either 17 years or until the year \n2017--I cannot remember.\n  Then the Actuary of CMS issued a report and said: Not so fast. It \nturns out that money is not going to be used to extend the viability of \nMedicare. We are going to spend it on new entitlements in the health \ncare legislation.\n  I remember talking to the distinguished chairman of the Finance \nCommittee at the time in the Chamber. Since the Actuary of CMS says we \ncan't spend this money twice, we can't spend it both on the new \nentitlement in the health care legislation and still count it as \npreserving the viability of Medicare, which is it going to be? We never \ngot an answer. In truth, I suspect it is going to be spent on the new \nentitlement and we will not be extending the viability of Medicare. You \ncan't spend the same dollar twice. That is what the CMS Actuary pointed \nout.\n  Time and time again, when Congress is deceiving the American people \nby raising funds for something, a specific purpose--to clean up the \noilspill, to save Medicare, to fund Social Security--we steal that \nmoney from the fund that was created for a specific purpose and spend \nit on other things. We should be honest with the American people.\n  The Vitter amendment will at least make clear that to the extent we \nraise money by raising the price per barrel oil companies must pay into \nthe trust fund, to the extent we collect money from that, we have to \nspend it on cleaning up the oilspill, not on the other things in the \nbill that is pending.\n  I hope when the time comes we will be able to consider the Vitter \namendment and we will be honest with the American people and say that \none of the first things we have to do is to make sure we can clean up \nthe oilspill. And if we think it is a good idea to make the oil \ncompanies spend more money in order to do that, then that is where we \nought to be spending the money, not taking that money and using it to \npay for other things in this legislation. We have already done it with \nSocial Security. We have already done it with health care. We have done \nit with a lot of other things.\n  The American people are getting sick and tired of this duplicity on \nthe part of the Congress. All we do is spend around here. Then when it \ncomes time to pay for it, we say: We are going to pay for it. We are \nnot going to increase the deficit. We will pay for it by taking it from \nsome other fund. The money was raised for some other purpose. That is \nhow we will pay for it. That is as dishonest as not paying for it in \nthe first instance and instead sending the bill to our kids and \ngrandkids.\n  At some point, Congress has to start paying for what we are spending \nmoney on. If we really want to continue to increase spending--and this \nbill spends over $100 billion--let's be honest and find sources of \nrevenue that really reduce spending in some case so that we can then \napply that funding here, or if the other side would like to raise \ntaxes--and there are certainly a lot of taxes in this legislation, \nwhich I oppose--the other way we can do it is to raise taxes and hurt \nbusinesses so that we don't create as many jobs. That is a great thing \nto do in the middle of a recession, but that is another way to do it. \nEither reduce spending somewhere else or generate more revenue through \ntaxes. But don't generate revenue for the oilspill trust fund and then \nimmediately take that revenue and spend it on this bill. That is not an \nhonest way to offset spending in the underlying legislation.\n  This is another example of why the American people are upset with the \nCongress.\n  I would hope that before this legislation is finally disposed of, we \nwould either drop this provision from the bill, this section 431, or we \nwould adopt the Vitter amendment which would ensure whatever funds are \ncollected under that provision are used for the purposes for which they \nwere collected; namely, to clean up the oilspill, and not to offset \nspending in other parts of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman).

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about an issue I am \nvery concerned about, and I know every Member of this body is concerned \nabout: the number of families losing their homes to foreclosure.\n  When I go back to Minnesota, and I know when the Presiding Officer \ngoes home to Delaware, we are bombarded by stories from folks in our \nStates who have worked their entire lives to own a home but who may \nlose it. They want to know why this is happening to them after they \nhave worked so hard and why the government is not doing more to help.\n  The reality is, the government has done something. The President \ncreated a program called HAMP, which incentivizes mortgage servicers to \nmodify home loans to keep families in their houses. But while that \nprogram is a good step forward, it has also been plagued by mistakes. \nPeople are losing their homes just because of human error. Let me \nrepeat that. People are losing their homes simply due to errors.\n  When I spoke about this previously on the Senate floor, I mentioned a \nhomeowner named Barbara, who lives in Minneapolis. She fell behind in \nmortgage payments because her husband lost his job and her son got \ncancer. But when she tried to use the President's mortgage modification \nprogram, her mortgage servicer claimed she was not eligible for a \nmortgage modification, and he did so using incorrect information about \nher finances. When she pointed out the problem, they claimed there was \nnothing she could do because she had already been denied.\n  Take another woman from Minneapolis. Let's call her Susan. She did \nnot want me to use her real name. After Susan fell behind in mortgage \npayments, she went through HAMP and paid all of her monthly payments on \ntime. Her mortgage servicer, however, seems unwilling or unable to \ndecide one way or another if she is eligible for a ``final \nmodification,'' which would allow her to continue paying a lower amount \non her mortgage and stay in her home.\n\n[[Page S4645]]\n\n  In the meantime, the company continues to schedule sheriff sales for \nthe property, which, in turn, increases the amount that Susan owes in \nfees. In other words, because HAMP is not working the way it should, \nSusan may owe more money than she would otherwise, and she may be even \nmore at risk of losing her home.\n  This is not the way the government is supposed to work. If we are \ngoing to have a government program, let's make sure it operates \neffectively. I think we can all agree on that. Let's have good \ngovernance. People should not be losing their homes just because we \ncannot get all our ducks in a row.\n  Today, Senator Snowe and I are offering an amendment to fix the HAMP \nappeals process so that homeowners have a place to turn when the system \nfails. This amendment would create an Office of the Homeowner Advocate \nwithin Treasury, modeled after the very successful Office of the \nTaxpayer Advocate at the IRS, which has worked wonderfully. Homeowners \nwould be able to call this Treasury office and know that someone has \ntheir back--someone with the authority to actually fix the problem.\n  Staff at the Office of the Homeowner Advocate would have two \nimportant powers. First, they could make sure servicers actually follow \nthe rules of the program or suffer the consequences. Secondly, they \nwould be able to temporarily delay a servicer's ability to sell a \nperson's home, giving the office time to resolve the problem before it \nis too late.\n  The office would be temporary, lasting only as long as HAMP does. \nWhile it lasts, though, it would make sure that government actually \nworks the way it is supposed to work. If we are going to set up a \nprogram to help keep people in their homes, let's actually make sure it \nkeeps people in their homes.\n  Significantly, this amendment does not authorize any additional \nappropriations. Let me repeat that. There are no additional \nappropriations. It would be funded by existing HAMP administrative \nfunds.\n  Our amendment is supported by a large number of national groups, \nincluding the Center for Responsible Lending, the National Consumer Law \nCenter, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the \nConsumers Union, the Consumer Federation of America, the Service \nEmployees International Union, and the National Council of La Raza. I \nam happy to say the amendment is supported by over a dozen groups in \nMinnesota.\n  Senator Snowe and I first proposed this amendment during the Wall \nStreet reform debate. The amendment was supported by the Treasury \nDepartment and made the White House's list of the top 10 amendments \nthat would improve the bill. But it never received a vote.\n  Now we are putting it to the Senate again. Let's have an actual vote \non this issue on whether to fix this foreclosure program we have \ncreated. Homeowners in all our States deserve that much.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Gulf Oilspill\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, I come to the floor to talk about the \nongoing oil disaster in the gulf. Being from Louisiana, we view this, \ncorrectly, as an ongoing disaster. This is not history. This is not a \npast event. This is not just some issue to debate in Washington. It is \nan ongoing crisis, an ongoing oil flow that continues to pollute the \ngulf and continues to devastate the region economically.\n  So in that context, there is, perhaps, only one thing that is more \nfrustrating than an inadequate response from BP or an inadequate \nFederal response. The only thing more frustrating than that--in fact, \nmore infuriating--is when this ongoing crisis and disaster is used and \nabused politically for other purposes.\n  I think that is exactly what is going on in this extenders bill. \nBecause in this bill there is a huge increase in taxes that go to the \nOil Pollution Act trust fund, but that money is not going to oil \ncleanup in the gulf. It is primarily being used to go into the trust \nfund to be stolen from it for unrelated spending to mask the deficit \nspending in this bill. Quite frankly, when we are going through an \nongoing crisis in the gulf, that is not frustrating, it is outrageous.\n  What am I talking about exactly? This is what I am talking about: \nRight now, under Federal law, there is a tax levied on petroleum \nproducts of 8 cents per barrel. That funds the Oil Pollution Act trust \nfund. In this extenders bill, that tax is proposed to be increased by \nthe majority side from 8 cents to 41 cents--over a fivefold increase.\n  If that were necessary and crucial to fund cleanup operations in the \ngulf, I would be completely open to it. We need to do whatever it \ntakes. But that is not how that money is being used. It is being used \nas a cover to increase taxes and to offset other unrelated spending. \nBecause in this bill that tax is increased from 8 cents to 41 cents, \nand then, just as quickly, that money is stolen from the trust fund to \npay for other unrelated items in the bill.\n  Put another way, it is double counted. It is used as an offset on \nother spending items in the bill that have nothing to do with the oil \ndisaster, nothing to do with the cleanup. It is double counting. It is \nan unfair offset. It is stealing from the trust fund to mask other \nspending. Unfortunately, I think this is a classic example of the old \nRahm Emanuel quote from early on during this administration. Around \nFebruary of 2009, Rahm Emanuel, the White House Chief of Staff, said: \nWe are not going to let a good crisis go to waste. At the time, he was \ntalking about the financial crisis and harnessing that to push forward \nthe Obama administration's unrelated, left-leaning agenda.\n  Tragically, exactly the same thing is going on here: We are not going \nto let a good crisis go to waste. They are going to use the ongoing oil \ndisaster in the gulf to help mask runaway Federal spending. Because, \nagain, they are proposing to increase this tax from 8 cents to 41 \ncents--over a fivefold increase--but it does not go for gulf cleanup. \nIt is stolen from there just as quickly as it is levied to pay for \nunrelated spending. It is double counted to mask the runaway spending \nalso in the bill.\n  Again, that is not just frustrating; as a Member from Louisiana, that \nis downright offensive. This is an ongoing crisis. It is an ongoing \nchallenge and we need to meet it. We need to focus on it. We need to \ndeal with it. We do not need to use it and abuse it politically to push \nforward a preexisting, leftist agenda up here to pay for runaway and \nunrelated Federal Government spending.\n  I will have an amendment on the floor in this debate to address this \nissue. I will formally offer it and make it pending tomorrow. But my \namendment, which will be cosponsored by Senator Judd Gregg, the ranking \nmember of the Budget Committee, is real simple. It is going to say that \nwhatever Congress does with this new revenue into the OPA trust fund, \nit cannot steal that revenue for unrelated spending. It cannot use that \nrevenue, double count that revenue to mask other unrelated runaway \ndeficit spending. That is what my amendment is going to say and that is \nwhat my amendment is going to do.\n\n  We have a crisis in the gulf. It is ongoing. It is not over yet, \nunfortunately, by a long shot, because the flow is ongoing, the \npollution is ongoing, and it is getting worse and worse. We need to \nmeet that crisis. We need to meet that challenge and do whatever it \ntakes. We don't need to use and abuse that crisis to push forward other \nunrelated agendas here in Washington, DC.\n  This provision in the extenders package is doing just that. It is \nusing and abusing that crisis to put money in the OPA trust fund just \nto take it out, to steal it for unrelated programs, to double count it, \nto mask runaway deficit spending completely unrelated to the oil \ndisaster. As a Senator from Louisiana, I am crying foul. I am saying \nthat is not only wrong, it is offensive. We shouldn't use and abuse an \nongoing crisis in the gulf for other unrelated political purposes.\n  So, again, I will have a very clear amendment. It will say whatever \nwe do with the OPA trust fund, that money can't be stolen from the \ntrust fund and used for unrelated purposes. That\n\n[[Page S4646]]\n\nmoney can't be double counted to help mask runaway government spending \nhaving nothing to do with the ongoing crisis in the gulf. If it is a \ntrust fund, let's treat it as a trust fund, and that means we take the \nrevenue and we truly preserve it for that use and that use alone and it \ncan't be stolen for anything else, and it can't be double counted to \nmask other deficit spending.\n  I think it comes down to a pretty fundamental decision: Are we here \nin the Senate going to meet the ongoing crisis in the gulf? Are we \ngoing to meet that challenge? Are we going to come together across \nparty lines and do the right thing? Or, are some folks here going to \nuse it and abuse it to advance an unrelated political agenda; to steal \nthat money for unrelated spending; to double count it and help mask \nunrelated, runaway Federal Government spending? We shouldn't do that. \nThat is rubbing salt in the wound of gulf coast residents. That is \ntruly offensive and truly wrong.\n  I urge all of my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to support \nthis amendment. I will formally introduce it and make it pending \ntomorrow. Again, the idea is very simple. Whatever we do with the OPA \ntrust fund, it should be to deal with the crisis in the gulf. It should \nbe to preserve that and protect that in a true trust fund; not to steal \nit out of the trust fund to pay for unrelated spending; not to double \ncount it to mask soaring Federal Government deficits having nothing to \ndo with our response in the gulf.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I look forward to continuing this debate. I \nlook forward to filing, introducing, and making this amendment pending \ntomorrow, and I look forward to a positive vote.\n  With that, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I am here to speak to this bill we are \nconsidering, the American Jobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act. Too many \npeople in New Hampshire and across this country are still struggling. I \nwish to talk today about some of the provisions that are in the \nlegislation before us, provisions that will create jobs, grow small \nbusinesses, and help unemployed Americans who are still struggling to \nget back to work.\n  As you know, Mr. President, we have been here before. On March 10 of \nthis year, almost 3 months ago, the Senate took up and passed a bill \nthat contained most of the provisions we are considering today. That \nday, the Senate voted, with bipartisan support, to stand with working \nfamilies and extend the safety net legislation and investment \nincentives that are helping us get through and out of this recession.\n  Unfortunately, we have not yet been able to send this bill to \nPresident Obama for his signature. For the last 3 months, we have had \nalmost weekly standoffs on temporary measures to do what we already \nvoted to do back in March, which is help people throughout this country \nget back to work. This delay has had real consequences. Over the last 6 \nmonths, the Federal unemployment program has expired four times--most \nrecently, over Memorial Day.\n  Mr. President, you and I know the American people deserve better. The \nlegislation before us will create jobs, it will increase demand for \ngoods and services, and it will provide stability for Americans who \nhave lost their jobs during this recession. In addition to extending \nunemployment benefits through November, the bill also renews a tax \ncredit to support research and development; it waives the fees on \nbusiness owners who take out Small Business Administration loans; it \nhelps municipalities make critical infrastructure improvements; and it \nfunds a much needed summer youth jobs program.\n  I know there are some people who think we have done all we should do. \nI, too, believe we must get back on a path to a balanced budget, but \nthe best way to do that is to get this economy moving again. The latest \njobs report from last Friday showed that we still have a lot of ground \nto make up. During these very difficult economic times, it is still \nnecessary for the Federal Government to step up and help stimulate job \ncreation through investments and tax cuts.\n  The national unemployment rate is still over 9 percent. In many \ncommunities, it is much higher than that. What is more, nearly 7 \nmillion people--nearly half of all Americans collecting unemployment \nbenefits--have been out of work for 6 months or longer. They have run \nout of the benefits provided by their States. These are the workers who \nare collecting Federal unemployment benefits, which they are using to \npay the rent, make mortgage payments, buy groceries, and put gas in \ntheir cars to go out and look for the next job. This legislation \nextends this vital program until the end of November.\n  Another group of Americans who are helped by this legislation and who \nare hurting right now are teenagers. These young people have an \nunemployment rate that is more than double the national average. In \nfact, right now young people are having a harder time finding jobs than \nat any time since World War II.\n  Last week, I visited Nashua, NH, and Dover High School in Dover, NH, \nwhere I used to teach school. A lot of the students in both of those \ncommunities are pretty excited about summer beginning. Many of those \nstudents want to work this summer. Many of them need to work to help \nsave for college, to help their families. Unfortunately, because of the \nrecession, it is more difficult for a teenager to get a job today than \nit has been in a very long time. High unemployment has forced more \nadults to compete for every job, and they are often filling jobs that \nonce went to young people. That is a problem for young people, and it \nis a threat to the future of the economy.\n  Last year, Congress stepped in and created a summer jobs program to \nemploy tens of thousands of teens, which included over 500 young people \nin New Hampshire.\n  I got to meet two of those students last week. Dawn White, who will \nbe a senior at Dover High School this fall, talked to me about her \n``life-changing summer job experience'' that she had last summer as a \nresult of the dollars we put in to help fund summer jobs. She worked \nsetting up exhibits at a local children's museum. Dawn told me that \nhaving that summer job built her confidence and helped her identify a \nnew goal for the future to work with children. In Nashua, I met \nElizabeth Madol, a senior at Trinity High School in Manchester. She \nworked at the public library in Manchester and helped young children \nwith summer reading and other activities. She told me that this had \nbeen her first job and that because of it she now has the skills and \nwork experience she needs to get another job this year. Those are just \ntwo stories out of hundreds of young people in New Hampshire and all \nacross this country. Those are young people who, because of those \nsummer jobs, have had phenomenal results.\n  An independent study showed that young people were excited by the \nskills they gained through summer work and they left better prepared to \njoin the workforce. They were exposed to new careers and new \nopportunities. They learned about responsibility and developed \nprofessional relationships. Many even left with job offers for after \nthey graduated. This is particularly important for us because many of \nthese young people are young people who, without those summer jobs, \nwould never have a chance to enter the workforce or they would enter at \na time that would leave them behind for years to come.\n  The legislation before us contains $1 billion to extend the summer \njobs program for another year, creating tens of thousands of jobs and \ngiving hundreds more young people in New Hampshire and hundreds of \nthousands more across this country the chance to work. We can't build a \n21st-century economy unless we start building our young workforce. We \nneed workers with all kinds of skills and interests. By giving \nteenagers a foot in the door today, they will give back to our economy \nin the future. That is the power of what the funds in this legislation \nfor summer jobs can do.\n\n[[Page S4647]]\n\n  Finally, the legislation we are considering takes away tax breaks \nthat reward corporations for sending jobs overseas, and it gives tax \nincentives to small businesses to create jobs right here in America.\n  This is a good bill. It is legislation that will make a real \ndifference in our communities by creating jobs and helping struggling \nfamilies. It is an investment in our present, and it is an investment \nin our future. I urge my colleagues to once again support the American \nJobs and Closing Tax Loopholes Act.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Health Care Reform\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I come to the floor today because the \nPresident of the United States earlier today had a townhall meeting to \ntalk about the new health care law, the law he has promoted and talked \nabout and which has been a major point of discussion, debate, and then \nvote in this Chamber over the last year.\n  I come as someone who has practiced medicine in Casper, WY, since \n1983, as an orthopedic surgeon, taking care of families all around the \nState of Wyoming, and working on prevention, working on early detection \nof medical problems through what is called Wyoming Health Fairs.\n  I come to the floor today, having watched and read the comments by \nthe President, to take a look at some of those comments and see what \nthe American people heard from the President and what I see as my \ndoctor's second opinion about this health care law. It is a law that I \nbelieve is bad for patients, bad for payers--the American taxpayers--\nand bad for our medical providers--our nurses and our doctors--who take \ncare of those patients. Like most Americans, I believe this is going \nto, unfortunately, raise the cost of care for American families and \nlower the availability and quality of that care.\n  I wish to point out a few of the comments the President of the United \nStates said today, and I want to do that from my perspective as someone \nwho goes home to Wyoming on weekends and visits with patients. Just a \nfew minutes ago, earlier today, I visited with a patient, someone I had \noperated on, done surgery on her knee about 10 years ago.\n  One of the things the President talked about today was Medicare \nAdvantage. Medicare Advantage, in my opinion, is a program that has a \nlot of advantages. That is why one out of four Americans on Medicare \nsigns up for Medicare Advantage. It deals with preventive care. It \ndeals with coordinating care, so care is coordinated in a way that \npatients get better care.\n  The President said Medicare Advantage benefits will not change. He \nsaid:\n\n       First and foremost, what you need to know is that the \n     guaranteed Medicare benefits that you've earned will not \n     change, regardless of whether you receive them through \n     Medicare or Medicare Advantage.\n\n  Seniors who know a lot about Medicare Advantage know that is not the \ncase. You do not have to go very far back to find it. Yesterday's Wall \nStreet Journal talked about Medicare, and specifically Medicare \nAdvantage. I will quote from this article. It says:\n\n       Dozens of Medicare Advantage providers--\n\n  These are the insurance companies that help with Medicare Advantage--\n\n     plan to cut back vision, dental and prescription benefits.\n\n  ``Plan to cut back vision, dental and prescription benefits.''\n\n       Some plans are eliminating free teeth cleanings and gym \n     memberships, and raising fees for hearing aides, eye glasses \n     and emergency-room visits.\n\n  Wait a second. The President of the United States said Medicare \nAdvantage benefits will not change. This says there are a couple of \nreasons why he is wrong. One of the reasons is that the rate the \ngovernment will pay private insurers to run the plan is frozen. It is \nfrozen in 2011 at the 2010 levels, while medical costs are expected to \nincrease an average of at least 6 percent.\n  I thought we went into this whole health care debate and discussion \nwith the idea of getting the costs down. Now what we are seeing is, no, \ncosts are going to go up in spite of, or perhaps because of, this \nlegislation. ``Such price increases and benefit cuts will help'' the \ncompanies ``recoup that difference . . . ''--the losses.\n  Medicare Advantage benefits are certainly going to change, and they \nare going to change in a way that is detrimental to the seniors of the \ncountry regardless of what the President said today in his townhall \nmeeting.\n  Then he went on and said the health bill ``will actually reduce the \ndeficit, reduce costs.'' That is what the President said today at his \ntownhall meeting in Maryland.\n  It is astonishing because I do not believe any person in this Chamber \nbelieves that. I do not think anyone listening at home or at the \ntownhall meeting believed it. And the President's Chief Actuary does \nnot believe it. Actually, the Chief Actuary a month or so after the \nbill was passed, after it was signed into law, released projections \nthat said the health care overhaul will likely cost about $115 billion \nmore--more--in spending over the next 10 years than the original cost \nprojections, taking the total estimated costs to above $1 trillion.\n  The President says this will actually reduce the deficit and reduce \ncosts. This is at a time of record deficits, when the American people \nare very concerned about the deficits and the incredible debt.\n  From the transcript of the President's speech, as he goes through, he \nsays:\n\n       And finally, we're going to reduce by half the amount of \n     waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare system. . . .\n\n  That is an admirable goal. There is significant waste, fraud, and \nabuse in the Medicare system. How much waste, fraud, and abuse is \nthere? I am not sure anyone knows for sure exactly how much there is, \nbut the Associated Press, with a lot of study, has said it is about $47 \nbillion a year--$47 billion a year.\n  What do the budget people who looked at this health care law say \nabout how good is it going to be, how effective? The President is \ntalking about cutting it in half from $47 billion. If you can save $23 \nbillion a year, that is an accomplishment. The Congressional Budget \nOffice estimated that Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health \nProgram, with the integrity provisions--those are the provisions aimed \nat waste, fraud, and abuse--they are thinking that over the next 4 \nyears, they will save about $2.2 billion and over the next 10 years, \nthey will save almost $7 billion.\n  Savings are good, but they are going to save $7 billion over 10 years \nwhen, according to the Associated Press, we are losing almost $500 \nbillion over 10 years to waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  The savings, according to the Congressional Budget Office, are \nminuscule, but yet the President today, talking to this crowd, said we \nare going to reduce it by half.\n  I don't know, maybe he is talking about introducing a new law because \nit sure is not in the health care bill that was signed into law and \npassed with 60 votes in this body.\n  After the President went through all of these, he then said:\n\n       So that's what the law does. Now, having said that, there--\n     some of the folks who were against health reform in \n     Congress--\n\n  I don't think anybody is actually against health reform. But I will \nsay there are a lot of people who are against this bill. He said:\n\n       In fact, you have an entire party out there that's running \n     on a platform of repeal.\n\n  It is not a party. Sixty percent of the American people are saying we \nshould repeal and replace this health care law.\n  The President had this meeting, but there are a lot of things the \nPresident of the United States did not tell the American people. It is \nthose things--that is the reason 60 percent of the American people are \nopposed to this new law.\n  He did not mention that Medicare cuts will be $550 billion, and those \nare cuts to hospitals, cuts to nursing homes, cuts to home health \nagencies, cuts to hospice to help people in the final days and hours of \ntheir lives. He did not mention that at all.\n  He did not mention that the new Medicare Director--someone he \nrecently named--loves the British health care system and says we are \ngoing to need to ration care. The new Director of Medicare is planning \nto ration care. We did not hear that mentioned to the seniors today.\n  We did not hear him mention the fact that up to $18 million has been \nspent\n\n[[Page S4648]]\n\non a mailer about the new health care law that many have referred to as \npropaganda because it fails to clearly and honestly express what is \ngoing to happen to people on Medicare as they cut $550 billion from \ntheir health care over the next years.\n\n  I do not think he mentioned that one in six hospitals is going to \nfind they are in the red living under the new system. That is what the \nChief Actuary has said.\n  I don't think he mentioned the $25 million plan that was mentioned \nyesterday in the New York Times: ``White House and Allies Set to Build \nUp Health Law and Democrats Who Backed It.'' It said:\n\n       President Obama and his allies, concerned about deep \n     skepticism over his landmark health care overhaul, are \n     orchestrating an elaborate campaign to sell the public on the \n     law, including a new tax-exempt group that will spend \n     millions of dollars on advertising to beat back attacks on \n     the measure and Democrats who voted for it.\n\n  That is what we hear. We now have a health care law that, as Nancy \nPelosi said, you have to pass before you get to find out what is in it. \nThe American people are finding out what is in it. Week after week, \nthey are finding some new unintended consequence, something they do not \nwant, something they do not think is good for them. That is why week \nafter week I come back to the floor to talk about a health care law \nthat failed to pay for doctors who take care of patients, failed to pay \nto train doctors, and failed to deal with lawsuit abuse.\n  It did have money for a lot of new IRS agents to try to enforce the \nlaw that is mandating everyone to buy insurance. But I think if you \ntalk with people in any of our home States, they are going to say: We \nneed more new doctors; we don't need more IRS agents.\n  That is why I come to the floor with my second opinion, an opinion \nwhich says it is time to repeal the legislation and replace it with \nlegislation that is really a health care system and program that is \npatient centered, that will allow Americans to buy insurance across \nState lines, that will provide the same tax relief for individuals who \nbuy their health insurance personally--they would get the same tax \nrelief that the big companies get--that would provide individual \nincentives, such as premium breaks, to encourage healthy behavior, that \nwould deal with lawsuit abuse, and would allow small businesses to join \ntogether to provide less expensive health insurance for their \nemployees.\n  That is why today I offer my second opinion that it is time to repeal \nand replace this bill and get patient-centered care for the American \npeople.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up my amendment No. 4302.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Texas [Mr. Cornyn], for himself and Mr. \n     Kyl, proposes an amendment numbered 4302 to amendment No. \n     4301.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. I ask unanimous consent that reading of the amendment be \ndispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To increase transparency regarding debt instruments of the \n United States held by foreign governments, to assess the risks to the \n        United States of such holdings, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, add the following:\n\n       TITLE __--TRANSPARENCY REQUIREMENTS FOR FOREIGN-HELD DEBT\n\n     SEC. _01. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Foreign-Held Debt \n     Transparency and Threat Assessment Act''.\n\n     SEC. _02. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this title:\n       (1) Appropriate congressional committees.--The term \n     ``appropriate congressional committees'' means the following:\n       (A) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Relations, the Committee on Finance, and the \n     Committee on the Budget of the Senate.\n       (B) The Committee on Armed Services, the Committee on \n     Foreign Affairs, the Committee on Ways and Means, and the \n     Committee on the Budget of the House of Representatives.\n       (2) Debt instruments of the united states.--The term ``debt \n     instruments of the United States'' means all bills, notes, \n     and bonds issued or guaranteed by the United States or by an \n     entity of the United States Government, including any \n     Government-sponsored enterprise.\n\n     SEC. _03. SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the growing Federal debt of the United States has the \n     potential to jeopardize the national security and economic \n     stability of the United States;\n       (2) the increasing dependence of the United States on \n     foreign creditors has the potential to make the United States \n     vulnerable to undue influence by certain foreign creditors in \n     national security and economic policymaking;\n       (3) the People's Republic of China is the largest foreign \n     creditor of the United States, in terms of its overall \n     holdings of debt instruments of the United States;\n       (4) the current level of transparency in the scope and \n     extent of foreign holdings of debt instruments of the United \n     States is inadequate and needs to be improved, particularly \n     regarding the holdings of the People's Republic of China;\n       (5) through the People's Republic of China's large holdings \n     of debt instruments of the United States, China has become a \n     super creditor of the United States;\n       (6) under certain circumstances, the holdings of the \n     People's Republic of China could give China a tool with which \n     China can try to manipulate the domestic and foreign \n     policymaking of the United States, including the United \n     States relationship with Taiwan;\n       (7) under certain circumstances, if the People's Republic \n     of China were to be displeased with a given United States \n     policy or action, China could attempt to destabilize the \n     United States economy by rapidly divesting large portions of \n     China's holdings of debt instruments of the United States; \n     and\n       (8) the People's Republic of China's expansive holdings of \n     such debt instruments of the United States could potentially \n     pose a direct threat to the United States economy and to \n     United States national security. This potential threat is a \n     significant issue that warrants further analysis and \n     evaluation.\n\n     SEC. _04.

CORRECTIVE ACTION TO ADDRESS UNACCEPTABLE AND \n                   UNSUSTAINABLE RISKS TO UNITED STATES NATIONAL \n                   SECURITY AND ECONOMIC STABILITY.\n\n       In any case in which the President determines under section \n     ___04(b)(4)(C) that a foreign country's holdings of debt \n     instruments of the United States pose an unacceptable risk to \n     the long-term national security or economic stability of the \n     United States, or the Comptroller General of the United \n     States makes a determination under section ___5(b)(3), the \n     President shall, within 30 days of the determination--\n       (1) formulate a plan of action to reduce the risk level to \n     an acceptable and sustainable level, in a manner that results \n     in a reduction in Federal spending;\n       (2) submit to the appropriate congressional committees a \n     report on the plan of action that includes a timeline for the \n     implementation of the plan and recommendations for any \n     legislative action that would be required to fully implement \n     the plan; and\n       (3) move expeditiously to implement the plan in order to \n     protect the long-term national security and economic \n     stability of the United States.\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Madam President, I won't detain the Senate long, but I \ndid want to call up this important amendment early on in considering \nthis underlying legislation.\n  This amendment would improve transparency in reporting of foreign \nholdings of our debt, providing taxpayers with more information about \nwhich countries are financing our deficit spending. This amendment is \nbased on legislation Senator Kyl and I introduced in April called the \nForeign-Held Debt Transparency and Threat Assessment Act. This \nlegislation would require the President to provide Congress with \nquarterly risk assessments on the national security and economic \nhazards posed by current levels of foreign holdings of our debt. It \nwould require the President, in the event that risk level was too high, \nto submit a plan of action to the Congress to bring down the risk in a \nway that reduces Federal spending.\n  Regarding the national debt itself, the bill instructs the GAO to \nprovide Congress with an annual risk assessment on national security \nand economic hazards posed by the national debt as well as \nrecommendations for reducing Federal spending.\n  We know the President's budget puts this Nation on a roadmap for \ndoubling the national debt in 5 years and tripling it in 10 years. The \ninterest payments alone will reach $900 billion in 10 years, which is \nmore than the United States currently spends on education and national \ndefense combined. In addition, according to the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, the pending legislation will add almost \n$80 billion to the deficit.\n  While the President likes to say he inherited the Nation's debt from \nhis predecessor, the fact is, from the day President Obama took office \nuntil the last day of fiscal year 2010, the debt held by the public \nwill have grown by $2.3 trillion, according to the White House Office \nof Management and Budget.\n  It is important to note that the explosion in the Nation's debt is \nbeing financed by foreign investors who, unsurprisingly, may not always \nhave our best interests at heart. The more we need to borrow from \nforeign investors, concerns about our Nation's fiscal health increase.\n  The chairman of the Budget Committee noted at a hearing last February \nthat last year, 68 percent of the new debt financing came from abroad, \nwith China now the biggest funder of the United States. We have had the \nChinese warn us publicly and privately that they are increasingly \nreluctant to finance that debt.\n  In fact, it is worse than that. Chinese Government officials have \nthreatened to use their debt holdings to retaliate against U.S. \npolicies they oppose. In a recent response to a U.S. decision to sell \ndefensive weapons to Taiwan, an official of China's People's Liberation \nArmy warned that China might sanction the United States by dumping U.S. \nGovernment bonds.\n  Many believe a rapid Chinese divestment of U.S. debt holdings would \nhave a destabilizing effect on the U.S. economy.\n  For all these reasons, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant editor of the Daily Digest proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, we are on the jobs and tax bill, but we \nseem not to be making a lot of progress tonight. Senators are under no \nconstraint to come to the floor and say what is on their minds about \nany subject under the Sun.\n  I wish to address a couple remarks given by Senators recently.\n  Most recently, I share the concerns of the Senator from Texas about \nthe debt that is owned by lots of different folks, not just Americans \nbut owned by foreigners. He made special reference to China. I think it \nwould be better if the United States could avoid borrowing so much. It \nis unfortunate the United States has borrowed a lot to run its affairs.\n\n  So have other countries, I might add. It is not just the United \nStates. There are many countries, regrettably, that have overborrowed. \nGreece comes to mind, as do other European countries: Spain, Portugal, \nperhaps even Hungary. It is becoming quite a concern worldwide. It is \none reason we have the Deficit Reduction Commission set up to figure \nout the proper way to reduce our deficits, which by definition would \nmean that other countries would be borrowing less from other countries.\n  But I also think we need to act responsibly. The Senator from Texas \nsent a resolution--I think it is a resolution--which was pretty \nstrongly worded in its implied criticism of China. It somewhat reminds \nme of the Pogo cartoon: We have met the enemy, and he is us. But, in \nany regard, we need to avoid taking actions that might unsettle bond \nmarkets in these very uncertain times. The markets are jittery right \nnow. So I look forward to working with the Senator from Texas to \nimprove his amendment. We have to be very responsible on this subject \nand not cause a greater problem by acting too precipitously.\n  On another matter, Madam President, just prior to the Senator from \nTexas speaking, the Senator from Wyoming addressed the Senate, and he \ndelivered a full-throated diatribe against health care reform. He \ncalled his attack ``a second opinion.'' But instead of offering a \nsecond opinion, which he did not do at all, he delivered, frankly, the \nsame old negative criticisms that many on his side of the aisle have \nbeen delivering since enactment of health care reform. Not one \nRepublican voted for health care reform--not one--and that bill passed. \nWe do live in a democracy. The majority vote rules. The President \nsigned the bill. I would think that issue has been settled. Health care \nreform has been enacted into law, signed by the President. So I am a \nlittle confused as to why he still wants to criticize this bill so \nmuch, except he does say: Well, gee, it should be repealed.\n  The Senator from Wyoming, for example, derided the antifraud \nprovisions in the health care reform bill. He called them \n``miniscule.'' But I might say, as a matter of fact, we advanced every \nantifraud provision we could possibly find. In the meantime, working \nwith the Senator from Florida, Mr. LeMieux, we are also looking to find \nother antifraud provisions to cut back waste and get rid of the waste \nin our health care system.\n  But we needed the health care reform law to pass so we can weed out \nthat waste, get rid of that waste, and to pass these antifraud \nprovisions. If the Senator has another health care fraud measure, I \nsure would like to hear it. It reminds me of that phrase: Where's the \nbeef. He keeps criticizing, but I hear no solutions. I hear no \nalternatives. I am a little surprised at that because he is my \nneighbor. We in Montana know a lot of folks in Wyoming, and we like to \nthink we are people who do not just bellyache and complain but we are, \nrather, people who come up with positive solutions, constructive \nsolutions, as good neighbors do.\n  The Senator from Wyoming goes on further to say that the President's \nnominee to head CMS ``plans to ration care.'' This is simply a libel, \nMadam President. If the Senator were not protected by the speech and \ndebate clause,\n\n[[Page S4650]]\n\nhe would be subject to a suit for slander. Certainly truth would not be \na defense. The Senator from Wyoming uttered a slanderous statement. He \nis protected by the speech and debate clause of the Constitution of the \nUnited States, and that is about the only place he could make \nslanderous statements like that with impunity.\n  The Senator from Wyoming says his ``second opinion'' is that Congress \nshould repeal the new health care law--just repeal it. But by calling \nfor repeal of health care reform, the Senator from Wyoming apparently \nseeks to repeal one of the biggest budget reduction measures in the \ndecade. I say that because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office \ntells us that health care reform will reduce the Federal deficit by \none-half of 1 percent of GDP in its second decade. It will reduce the \ndeficit.\n  I would think the Senator from Wyoming would like to reduce the \nFederal budget deficit. I am quite certain he wants to reduce the \nFederal budget deficit. But if he asks for repeal of health care \nreform, I guess he no longer cares about reducing our Federal budget \ndeficit.\n  By calling for repeal of health care reform, the Senator from Wyoming \nseeks to repeal the law that reins in insurance companies. Boy, in the \nprivate market there is just so much abuse of individuals by insurance \ncompanies. By calling for the repeal of health care reform, apparently \nthe Senator from Wyoming wants to bring back the ability of insurance \ncompanies to discriminate against people who have preexisting \nconditions, to discriminate against Americans who are denied insurance \nbased upon some health care status or to go back and deal with the \nrating provisions of States where the States, unfortunately, allowed \ninsurance companies to take advantage of certain groups of people.\n  By calling for repeal of health care reform, apparently he seeks to \nbring back the doughnut hole and preserve it in the future. He seeks to \ncontinue hardships for seniors who need help paying for their \nprescriptions.\n  Madam President, this health care reform bill closes the doughnut \nhole. What is the doughnut hole? That is the dollar amounts above which \nand under which people have to pay all their prescription drug \nbenefits. When they get up to the doughnut hole, they get a certain \nbreak. When they get above the doughnut hole, I guess 90 percent of \ntheir drugs are paid for--something like that.\n  But within the doughnut hole, if you are a senior, you do not get any \nhelp. Apparently, the Senator from Wyoming says: Oh, that is fine. \nThose people don't deserve to get any breaks in their prescription drug \nbenefits. He wants to repeal health care reform, so the effect of that \nwould be: Seniors, you are not going to get any help. Sorry. No help in \nthe doughnut hole.\n  By calling for repeal of health care reform, the Senator from Wyoming \nseeks to eliminate the tax credits that the new law will give Americans \nto help them buy insurance. I guess he does not care about that, the \nSenator from Wyoming. He does not want to give people tax credits. He \ndoes not want to give people tax credits to help them buy insurance.\n  And by calling for repeal of health care reform, the Senator seeks \nnothing less than the continuation of a system where millions of \nAmericans struggle, struggle by, struggle without health insurance, \nstruggle without quality health care. They struggle because of greater \npain and discomfort and greater risk of early death.\n  I could go on and on and on and on as to the reasons the Senator from \nWyoming's so-called second opinion is defective, to say the least. I \nknow some on the other side oppose health care reform. But this is, as \nI mentioned earlier, a democracy. In our country, the majority \ngenerally determines whether a law passes. Congress and the President \nenacted health care reform, and I wish my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle would just stop fighting the last war--stop fighting the \nlast war. Rather, let us try to find opportunities to work together to \nimprove the law together. Let's leave behind the politics of \ndestruction. Let's work together to build a better health care system \nfor America because, after all, we are here to help the people who sent \nus here. The people who sent us here want a better health care system \nthan they now have.\n  So let's work together to find that better solution. Let's not forget \nthat health care is basically indiscriminate. Poor people, wealthy \npeople get cancer. Women, men get cancer. Cancer strikes anybody. It \ndoes not make a difference whether you are a Republican or a Democrat. \nThe same thing is true with any other health discomfort or condition.\n  So I am just beside myself in trying to figure out why it is that the \nother side of the aisle just keeps attacking health care reform. The \nonly conclusion I can come up with is they just want to stir up things. \nThey want to cast all kinds of doubt and confusion in the minds of \nAmericans, with respect to perhaps these elections coming up this next \nNovember. That is a conclusion I do not like to reach but, logically, \nit is the only one I can possibly come up with.\n  I will say something else. This health care reform is going to be \nrelitigated again when we in the Finance Committee take up the \nnomination of Don Berwick to be the new CMS Director. I know, as sure \nas I am standing here, those who voted against health care reform--and \nthey all happen to be Republicans--are going to be just relitigating \nhealth care reform. They are going to accuse this administration of \nabout anything under the Sun, including Don Berwick. It is going to be \nvery unfortunate. It is my job--it is going to have to be as chairman \nof the committee--to try to keep the debate, if you will--it will not \neven be a debate; in part, it will be a diatribe in certain \ncircumstances--to just keep the discussion, the debate on a \nconstructive level so we can serve our country and serve our \npeople. But I felt compelled to speak in the wake of the remarks by the \nSenator from Wyoming because they deserved a response.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, we have had an interesting start today on \nthe jobs-tax bill, but it has been fruitful and productive. We have \nfour amendments pending. That is progress. Tomorrow, I want to move \nahead and clear out the underbrush, if you will, to get those \namendments disposed of. I have spoken with the leader, and we have \nagreed that it makes good sense to get those four amendments processed \ntomorrow morning before we do much else and that we go to other \namendments subsequent to that. I hope we can get those amendments \nprocessed so that we can proceed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/08/senate-section/article/S4650-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4650]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Mr. President, half of heart-related deaths in the \nUnited States are caused by a hard-to-diagnose condition called sudden \ncardiac arrest, SCA. Different from a heart attack, SCAs are caused by \nan electrical problem in the heart that, once triggered, requires \nimmediate treatment: survival rates plummet 7 to 10 percent with every \nminute that passes. Each year, only 8 percent of the 295,000 people who \nsuffer an SCA outside of a hospital survive. A few years ago, June 1-\nJune 7 was designated as CPR/AED Awareness Week to share these \nstartling statistics and to begin to change them. By educating and \nencouraging communities to establish organized programs that could \nprovide CPR and AED training to the public, lives have already been \nsaved. Anyone can suffer a sudden cardiac arrest, no matter one's age \nor gender. In fact, many victims appear healthy, not having a known \nheart disease or any other risk factors. For example, student athletes \nwith no previous heart ailments\n\n[[Page S4651]]\n\nhave been stricken with SCA in the middle of practice or during games.\n  Josh Miller was one such student athlete. The act that bears his \nname--the Josh Miller HEARTS, Helping Everyone Access Responsible \nTreatment in Schools, Act--creates a grant program through the \nDepartment of Education for public and private schools to purchase \nautomated external defibrillators, AEDs, and to train staff in the use \nof CPR and defibrillation within the context of a coordinated emergency \nresponse plan. Josh was a 15-year-old high school honor student from \nBarberton, OH, who suffered sudden cardiac arrest during a high school \nfootball game. Though Josh had never previously demonstrated symptoms \nof a heart problem, he passed away before paramedics arrived at the \nscene. There were no AEDs on site that might have been used to save \nJosh's life.\n  The U.S. House of Representatives passed the Josh Miller HEARTS Act \non June 2, 2009, and Senator George Voinovich and I introduced the bill \nin the Senate on June 8, 2009. Currently, the legislation has seven \ncosponsors and is pending before the Committee on Health, Education, \nLabor, and Pensions.\n  The combination of early, immediate CPR and defibrillation helps \nrestore normal heart rhythm before emergency personnel arrive and \nincreases a victim's chances of survival. Tragically, lives are lost \nevery day because there are not enough AEDs and persons trained in \nusing the devices and performing CPR to provide this life-saving \ntreatment. On average, response times for emergency medical teams run \napproximately 6 to 12 minutes. Yet according to the American Heart \nAssociation, the chance of survival of sudden cardiac arrest decreases \nby 7 to 10 percent with every passing minute.\n  In order to have a strong emergency response system, communities need \nthe resources to help save lives. I encourage my colleagues to follow \nthe House's lead and take up and pass the Josh Miller HEART Act as soon \nas possible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/08/senate-section/article/S4651-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4651]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MEMORIAL DAY 2010\n\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, the English author Albert Pine wrote: \n``What we have done for ourselves alone, dies with us; what we have \ndone for others and the world remains and is immortal.'' On Memorial \nDay we come together to recognize and honor those who have truly ``done \nfor others and the world'' and to ensure their service and sacrifice \nremains immortal.\n  Each year since 1868 we have paused to pay tribute to those who have \nmade the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom and democracy. This freedom \nwe cherish is not free and comes at a horrific price, a price borne by \nour veterans, both past and present. Our veterans never fought for \nempires or dominance but, rather, for a cause bigger than any one \nindividual. That cause is freedom and democracy, something many of them \nwould sadly never live to see.\n  There is no greater service to one's country and no greater act of \nheroism than to stand between our Nation and those who would do us \nharm. So it is today, Memorial Day 2010, we again come together as a \nnation recognizing and honoring the valor and courage of the men and \nwomen who have given so much--warriors who paved the road of freedom \nwith their service and sacrifices.\n  Alaska has a proud tradition of military service. During World War \nII, long before Alaska's statehood, the Alaska Territorial Guard \nstepped up and played a key role in defending Alaska and protecting \nAmerica's interests. Today Alaska is home to more than 28,000 Active-\nDuty men and women, many of whom have served multiple tours of duty in \nthe wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Alaska Army and Air National \nGuard is also playing a key role in these conflicts by deploying \nhundreds of Alaskans to combat duty.\n  It is all of our Active-Duty men and women--and their families--whom \nwe should also thank and honor today. To the veterans among us--thank \nyou for your service. We also remember warriors still missing and \nunaccounted for and continue our commitment to provide the fullest \npossible accounting and to return them home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/08/senate-section/article/S4651-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4651-S4652]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            THE RELEVANCE AND IMPORTANCE OF NATIONAL SERVICE\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

In 1988, these two Harvard Law \n     School roommates enriched us all by acting on their belief in \n     the power of citizen service by creating City Year.\n       And now as a key member of the AmeriCorps network, City \n     Year and its growing cadre of diverse and talented corps \n     members has become a model for service in America. Thank you, \n     Michael for this gift to the nation.\n       I also want to thank Lisa Paulsen, President and CEO of the \n     Entertainment Industry Foundation for co-sponsoring this \n     summit and for adding the drop-out crisis to your growing \n     portfolio of service campaigns. Lisa has been a good friend \n     to me and to the Corporation. Last year, under her \n     leadership, EIF launched iParticipate. As part of that \n     effort, last October, more than 100 TV shows focused their \n     programming and storylines on service. EIF has also been a \n     supporter of City Year, ServiceNation and a number of other \n     service organizations. Thank you, Lisa, for inviting \n     Hollywood into our service family.\n       As many of you know, I was confirmed as CEO of the \n     Corporation for National and Community Service on February \n     18th, so today marks my third month on the job. I've been out \n     on the road to see the impact that our programs, members and \n     partners are having across the country.\n       A couple of weeks ago, I was in San Antonio delivering the \n     commencement address at the University of Texas and had the \n     pleasure of seeing the Diplomas Now collaborative in action \n     during a visit to McAuliffe Middle School. One of the most \n     illuminating aspects of that visit was when the school \n     principal told me that City Year and Communities in Schools \n     had been working in McAuliffe for some time. But it was when \n     they chose to partner and focus single-mindedly on helping \n     students that he began to see remarkable progress.\n       Los Angeles is also a place where Diplomas Now is making a \n     real difference. Early results from two of LA's toughest \n     middle schools--Leicthy and Hollenbeck--show remarkable \n     progress: a 40 percent decrease in students failing math and \n     a 43 percent decrease in students failing English.\n       I remember coming to this country as an immigrant and \n     hearing from my high school counselor, as he looked across \n     the table with earnest concern, that I wasn't college \n     material and that I should go to trade school--I ended up \n     going to night school and working my way through college. \n     After seeing Diplomas Now in action, I wonder how different \n     my journey would have been had I been surrounded by young \n     people in red jackets who were more interested in seeing me \n     succeed than in telling me that I couldn't.\n       Your red jackets have become a symbol of hope for a whole \n     generation of young people who might otherwise be shackled \n     with the chains of low expectations.\n       It is fitting that this summit has brought us here to Los \n     Angeles--a city of many community challenges but also of \n     tremendous assets and wealth. A place where diversity and \n     disparity live side by side.\n       City Year is changing lives here in LA, in Chicago, \n     Philadelphia, New Orleans and throughout this nation. The \n     results you are achieving show us we have the power to beat \n     back the drop-out crisis, and that service has a central role \n     to play in this effort. Education is the engine that drives \n     our nation's progress. But more than that, it is the gateway \n     to a life of purpose and meaning.\n       In this global economy, education will be the fault line \n     between success and failure, not only for our young people, \n     but for our country.\n       Ben Franklin said, ``An investment in knowledge always pays \n     the best dividends.''\n       There is nothing more critical to the future of this nation \n     than making sure that every school . . . in every community . \n     . . is equipped to give every young person in America the \n     knowledge and the skills . . . to build lives of meaning . . \n     . and to compete and win in the global economy.\n       But make no mistake--this is an unforgiving competition--\n     one in which there are no excuses for failure and few second \n     chances.\n       Since our inception, education has been one of our top \n     priorities at the Corporation.\n\n[[Page S4652]]\n\n     We understand that closing the achievement gap and reducing \n     the drop-out rate requires not only government action, but \n     also the involvement of families and communities. In the past \n     15 years, we have supported a number of education programs \n     throughout the country.\n       For example, right here in Los Angeles, through their work \n     with the National Farm Workers Service Center, AmeriCorps \n     members are achieving remarkable results. They are raising \n     reading and math scores for children of families living 60 \n     percent below the poverty line. Families that are too often \n     overlooked and left behind.\n       I believe one of the significant challenges we face in \n     service today is how we build communities from the inside out \n     while also ensuring that they have access to the best \n     national resource like City Year. That is where success lies. \n     We cannot continue to believe that we can change lives, \n     change communities but leave them out of the change process. \n     We need to do a better job of aligning our resources in \n     communities, engage stake holders, and demonstrate the power \n     of service.\n       You know, many of us think of ourselves as organizers--\n     movement builders. If we are to use the rhetoric of grass \n     roots organizing, then it should be grass roots and it should \n     be organized.\n       Only by bringing together national leaders and communities \n     can we demonstrate the power of service in solving problems.\n       I saw this very thing yesterday when I visited Hope for the \n     Homeless here in L.A. This program is changing the face of \n     AmeriCorps. They have recruited AmeriCorps members who have \n     lived the very lives they are trying to change.\n       Sitting before me in their blue shirts, they talked about \n     leading lives of purpose, about leading lives of meaning, \n     about realizing what it means to have people depend on them, \n     believe in them.\n       Some have spent the better parts of their lives in prison, \n     others on the streets, but all in the crippling prison of \n     despair. But all of them--every single one of them, has been \n     transformed by AmeriCorps, by service.\n       I was struck. Not just by their stories, but also by how \n     similar those stories were to those I've heard from other \n     AmeriCorps members--from NCCC members in Colorado, from VISTA \n     Volunteers in West Virginia, and from City Year members in \n     Texas.\n       No matter where they come from, no matter what their \n     experience--blue shirts or red jackets, the transformation is \n     real, it is tangible, it is profound.\n       Transformation is not easy. If it were, we'd have it done \n     by now. It takes courage. The courage to cross boundaries, \n     the courage to reach out of our comfort zones, most of all \n     the courage of humility. But if the AmeriCorps members at \n     Hope for the Homeless have the courage to change their lives, \n     and the City Year Corps members have the courage to go into \n     some of the toughest schools in the toughest communities, \n     then surely we have the courage to be bold.\n       That's really why all of us are here today. This is not \n     about feeling good and good intentions--it is about the kind \n     of future we are creating for ourselves, our children.\n       This is an exciting time to be in what I like to call the \n     solutions business. We now have a President and a First Lady \n     who understand something we've known for a very long time--\n     service is not secondary to solving the drop-out crisis and \n     other pressing problems--it is essential to solving them. \n     President Obama has issued a challenge that every American \n     become engaged in some way in their community.\n       Every American, everyone, has a role, and service can \n     illuminate that path, can help people find themselves in the \n     solution.\n       Last year, with the help of many of you in this room, the \n     President signed into law the Serve America Act, the most \n     sweeping expansion of national service in a generation.\n       The Act challenges us to do a better job of demonstrating \n     and measuring our effectiveness in solving problems.\n       Undergirding that mandate are four major goals: First, to \n     fulfill the promise to make service a solution for big \n     national problems. Second, to expand opportunities for more \n     Americans of all ages and backgrounds to serve. With new and \n     diverse voices come new and innovative ways to approach and \n     solve problems. So we need to embrace innovation by expanding \n     proven programs and seeding promising emerging ones and \n     finally we need to build the capacity of individuals, \n     organizations and communities by giving them the tools they \n     need to succeed.\n       City Year, with its laser focus on solving the drop-out \n     crisis is a case-study in the fulfillment of all these goals. \n     You are making service a solution. You are expanding \n     opportunities for young people from diverse communities to \n     serve.\n       And you're building the capacity of teachers, \n     administrators and communities to turnaround failing schools \n     but most of all you are giving students who need it most, the \n     help they need to succeed. The entire service community has \n     much to learn from you.\n       While Congress has expanded our mandate and given us more \n     resources, the American people now expect us to use this \n     opportunity to take service to the next level.\n       That means more of a focus on measuring outcomes to ensure \n     that our efforts are making a difference.\n       At the end of the day, it won't mean a thing if we increase \n     the number of volunteers and a million kids are still \n     dropping out of school. It won't mean a thing if 15 million \n     people are still out of work. It won't mean a thing if our \n     communities continue to decline.\n       For too long, too many of us have been satisfied with \n     saying that ``we tried.'' That's no longer good enough. We \n     must not only try, we must succeed. But the only way we will \n     be successful, the only way we will win, is if we have the \n     courage to plant a stake in the ground, draw a line in the \n     sand and say that we are willing to be measured, to be \n     judged, to be held to account.\n       At a time of great need, Americans are responding to \n     President Obama's challenge.\n       But, to fulfill this new vision for service, we need a \n     stronger investment from every sector. We don't only need \n     more volunteers; we need them focused, like City Year, on \n     solving specific problems. We don't just need more volunteer \n     hours; we need to make sure those hours add up to results.\n       In order to do this, we need full funding of the \n     President's budget request for the Corporation and its \n     programs. The President's 2011 budget request of $1.4 billion \n     will strengthen our nation's civil society, foster innovation \n     and civic engagement, and engage more than 6 million \n     Americans in solving problems through service. If we make \n     these needed investments. If we face the future with the \n     courage to change. Then, and only then, will we fulfill our \n     commitment to the American people.\n       So, let me say again, thank you to City Year for showing us \n     the way. Thank you to the young AmeriCorps and City Year \n     members who go into classrooms everyday to mentor, teach, and \n     inspire struggling students. And thank you to everyone in \n     this room who is a part of making service a solution.\n       The great American educator, Mary McLeod Bethune once said, \n     ``We have a powerful potential in our youth, and we must have \n     the courage to change old ideas and practices so that we may \n     direct their power towards good ends.''\n       What I've seen City Year do in classrooms throughout this \n     country is give young people the hope for a better tomorrow . \n     . . the support they need to overcome the odds . . . the \n     strength and the courage to dream big dreams. And so, I want \n     to say to Michael and the City Year corps members here today, \n     when someone asks you 20 years from now where did you stand \n     when more than half of young people in some of our largest \n     cities were not finishing high school . . . Where did you \n     stand when more than 12 million children were living in \n     poverty . . . where did you stand when we were struggling to \n     lift up students whose dreams were crumbling as fast as the \n     schools around them . . . you can proudly say, I stood with \n     City Year. I stood with AmeriCorps. I stood with service.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/08/senate-section/article/S4652-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4652-S4653]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            2010 NEW HAMPSHIRE EXCELLENCE IN EDUCATION AWARD\n\n Mrs. SHAHEEN.

A bill to amend chapter 303 of title 46, United States Code, \nto provide fair treatment for the families of those killed on the high \nseas; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I introduce the Survivors Equality \nAct to ensure that everyone is treated equally under the Death on the \nHigh Seas Act. I thank Senator Whitehouse for joining me in this \nimportant effort to provide justice for victims. Earlier today, the \nSenate Judiciary Committee held a hearing to examine liability issues \nrelated to the British Petroleum, BP, oil spill disaster in the Gulf of \nMexico. The testimony received at this hearing made it clear that \nseveral of our laws need updating.\n  As a result of the BP oil spill, countless Americans in the Gulf \nRegion have been devastated. Waters, fisheries, wetlands, and \ncoastlines, and the wildlife that enriches those environments, have \nbeen injured profoundly. Their livelihoods and way of life will take \nyears of hard work to reclaim.\n  Among the victims of the explosion that led to the oil spill are 11 \nmen who lost their lives on the Deepwater Horizon oil rig. Their \nfamilies, including more than a dozen children, have experienced a \nterrible loss. As Congress responds to the needs of the Gulf Region, \nthese men and the families who lost them must have justice. The \nlegislation I introduce today is a step toward that goal.\n  The Death on the High Seas Act is one of few Federal remedies for the \nsurvivors of those who were killed on the Deepwater Horizon. The \nfamilies of these men cannot seek justice under the laws of their \nstates.\n  In 2000, in response to a tragic airline crash, Congress amended the \nDeath on the High Seas Act to permit recovery of non-pecuniary losses \nfor the surviving family members of air crash victims. While this was \nthe right thing to do, it did not go far enough. Though well-\nintentioned, this amendment resulted in an inequity based solely on the \nmanner in which a victim was killed. Congress made some strides in \nmodernizing this law then. Now it must finish the job.\n  Current law provides greater protection to a person killed in an \naircraft disaster over international waters than it does for a person \nkilled in a boat or other ocean vessel such as an oil drilling rig. \nUnder the Act today, the surviving family members of a person \nwrongfully killed in international waters in a boat or other ocean \nvessel may only recover pecuniary damages. This means they can only \nseek the lost income of their loved one, and what that person provided \nto the family in monetary terms.\n  Not only is this law internally inconsistent, it is out of the legal \nmainstream. Families who lose a loved one in a workplace accident on \nland are eligible for more compensation. For example, the families of \nthe 15 employees who were killed in a 2005 BP Texas City refinery \nexplosion had a full range of legal remedies simply because the \nfacility was on dry land. It is unfair that the men on the Deepwater \nHorizon are afforded less protection because that facility was at sea. \nTheir jobs were no less dangerous, and their losses no less tragic.\n  In the Judiciary Committee this morning, Senators heard testimony \nfrom Christopher Jones. Mr. Jones' brother, Gordon Jones, was among the \n11 men who perished on the Deepwater Horizon rig. He died while working \nto support his young family. Yet simply because of where he was \nworking, his family has less protection under the law than the \nsurvivors of a person who loses their life in an aircraft. This is \nnonsensical and wrong.\n  Where Federal law provides an exclusive remedy to those who lose \ntheir lives in international waters, it should not be unfair. In the \nlaw, as in society, great value is placed on the bonds that hold \ntogether families. The destruction of those bonds through the \nmisconduct of another is a loss that is recognized by the law. Today, \nthe Death on the High Seas Act fails to recognize universally what it \nmeans to a child who will no longer have the guidance of a loving \nfather or a spouse who will no longer have the care and comfort of a \ndevoted wife or husband. It is time for Congress to finish the work \nthat was started a decade ago and make this law fair for all to whom it \napplies.\n\n[[Page S4660]]\n\n  As Congress moves forward to address the terrible tragedy that has \noccurred in the Gulf of Mexico, I urge all Senators to join me in \nsupport of this legislation to help the families of the 11 hardworking \nAmericans who were killed during the explosion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3463\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

This potential threat is a \n     significant issue that warrants further analysis and \n     evaluation.\n\n     SEC. _04.
