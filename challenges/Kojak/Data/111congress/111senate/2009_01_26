Mr. President, in the last Congress, the Senate passed an \nextension of the Children's Health Insurance Program with an \noverwhelming majority of 69 votes. In a Congress too often marred by \npartisan divide, this strong vote last session in favor of healthy \nchildren briefly stood as a bright example of the good that comes from \nGovernment--putting people ahead of politics.\n  Regrettably, President Bush chose to veto our bipartisan children's \nhealth legislation and because of a few too many loyal House \nRepublicans in a narrowly divided House, that veto was upheld.\n  In Nevada, low-income families have been forced to put their children \non waiting lists for future health coverage. In the year and a half \nsince the veto, millions of children have been shut out of regular \ncheckups, medicine, and hospital trips.\n  From coast to coast, more than 4 million children who would have been \ncovered if our legislation had passed are not getting regular checkups \nor the care they need when they get sick.\n  Jeopardizing the health of American children is not a political \nvictory for anyone. It is a loss for everyone, and it is long past time \nwe corrected it.\n  This week, we have the chance, beginning tonight, to keep our promise \nto America's children by passing a new Children's Health Insurance \nProgram. With the support of Democrats and Republicans in Congress and \na new President in the White House poised to sign this bill into law, \nwe can ensure that more low-income families can provide their children \nwith the medical care they need to grow up strong and healthy.\n  Our legislation give States the resources and ability to insure an \nadditional 4 million children. Our legislation covers the lowest income \nchildren first by giving States new tools to enroll uninsured children \nwho qualify for Medicaid and rewarding States for successful \nenrollments in the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  Our legislation doesn't just provide more children with health care \nbut also improves the quality of care they receive.\n  In Nevada and across America, the number of uninsured children is \nrising. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that for every 1-point \nrise in our\n\n[[Page S798]]\n\nnational unemployment rate, 700,000 more children join the ranks of the \nuninsured. In Nevada and across America, the number of uninsured is \nrising every day. The number of uninsured children is rising every day, \nwhich makes it seem so unbearable for America to have so many uninsured \nchildren. The number of children who are not getting checkups, \nmedicine, and emergency care is rising every day.\n  This week, the Senate will engage in an open, fair, and lively debate \non this critical legislation. There will surely be points where \nRepublicans and Democrats disagree on specifics. Democrats would have \nwritten this legislation to cover more children, but we compromised to \ncreate a bill Republicans would support.\n  Republicans may raise points of concern during the debate, and \nDemocrats will consider their differing views. But during this debate, \nwe should remember that the overwhelming majority of Democrats and \nRepublicans agree on the fundamentals of this legislation.\n  I look forward to a productive debate, and I look forward to \nPresident Obama signing into law an extension of the Children's Health \nInsurance Program that will allow children of Nevada and all 50 States \nto get the care they need and deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/26/senate-section/article/S798-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RESERVATION OF LEADER OF TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, on Friday, at the National Press Club, \nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell delivered an important address \nthat everyone concerned about the future of our country ought to read.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nat the conclusion of my remarks Senator McConnell's speech.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, Senator McConnell congratulated the \nPresident for reminding many in Washington, including many Republicans, \nthat the American people want their leaders to work together to solve \nproblems, not to set traps. He suggested that among the issues on which \nwe could cooperate are reducing the national debt, energy independence, \nand lowering taxes. Specifically, Senator McConnell urged the President \nto follow up on his pledge to put the power of the Democratic \nmajorities to work on entitlement spending, the automatic spending that \nthreatens within just 9 years to consume nearly 70 percent of the \nFederal budget and to create a national debt that equals our Nation's \nannual gross domestic product. Already, each American's share of the \nnational debt is $35,000.\n  In order to do that, Senator McConnell said the President will have \nto reject the hyperpartisanship that exists in some quarters of \nCongress and engage Republicans on the merits of our ideas.\n  Senator McConnell said that as Republican leader of the Senate, he \nwould make this a firm principle of his dealings with the new \nadministration, and he said that if the new President follows up on his \npromise to address entitlement spending, Democrats can expect more \nconsideration from the Republicans than the last President received \nfrom them.\n  This is a major statement by an experienced Senate leader who has \nproven he knows how to stop bad legislation but is offering to go to \nwork with the new President to shape and improve good and needed \nlegislation, if the new majorities will meet Republicans on the merits \nof our ideas.\n  Some time ago, Senator McConnell invited President Obama to come to \nthe Senate and meet with Senate Republicans. And we all hope that soon \nhe may do that.\n  The kind of cooperation Senator McConnell talked about in his speech \non Friday did not happen often in the last few years. It did on energy, \nit did on American competitiveness, to some degree on foreign \nintelligence issues. Earlier, it happened on education and some other \nissues. But when President Bush, for example, made reforming Social \nSecurity the major thrust of his second term, Democrats said no. \nNeither side moved off their position, and so deficit spending and our \nnational debt kept going up.\n  If any subject over the last few years deserved cooperation, it was \nthe war in Iraq. Senator Salazar and I assembled 17 Senators, 9 \nDemocrats, and 8 Republicans, and there were 63 Members of the House \nalmost evenly divided between the parties who sponsored a resolution to \nset as a goal for the country to end the war on the principles \nrecommended by the Iraq Study Group.\n  President Bush would not support our legislation. The Democratic \nleaders refused to bring it to a vote. I remember telling both \nPresident Bush and Senator Reid I believed we were the only ones who \nactually united them on Iraq. They were both against what we were \ntrying to do. But if either President Bush had supported our resolution \nor if Senator Reid had allowed it to come to a vote, I believe the \nresolution would have been enacted, sending a message to our troops, to \nour country, and to our enemy that we were united in bringing an \nhonorable and successful end to that conflict.\n  Ironically, we are now headed in Iraq toward a conclusion that now \nseems to have the general support of both President Bush and President \nObama, presided over by the same Secretary of Defense, who has served \nthem both. That is approximately the same result that was recommended \nby the Iraq Study Group.\n  That is not just my opinion. Toward the end of last year I asked both \nSecretary Gates and Secretary Rice whether the path toward conclusion \nof the Iraq war that was agreed upon by the Iraqis and the United \nStates and is now basically being recommended by President Obama, \nwhether that was the path recommended by the Iraq Study Group, and each \nof them said yes.\n  There is a lesson here for the new administration. Technically, \nPresident Bush did not need Congress's approval to wage the war in \nIraq. He is the Commander in Chief. But if he had won that \ncongressional approval for the last 2 years of the war, that would have \nmade the war easier, perhaps more successful, and certainly the Bush \nPresidency more successful.\n  Technically, President Obama, with large Democratic majorities in \nCongress, does not need Republicans to pass most legislation. ``We won \nthe election; we will write the bill,'' said Speaker Pelosi. That is \nthe way to pass many bills, but as President Bush found out, it is not \nthe way to have a successful Presidency.\n  The President and the Democratic majorities on their own can pass \nmany bills, and we Republicans, with 41 or 42 votes in the Senate, can \nblock some things and slow down almost anything. But most of us \nRepublicans agree with Senator McConnell: That is not what we are here \nto do. And what President Obama said in his inaugural address is that \nis not the kind of Presidency he wishes to have.\n  The new President is off to a good start in his relationships with \nRepublican Members of the Senate. Even the Senate Democratic majority \nis showing some encouraging signs of letting the Senate function as it \nis supposed to function, as a guardian against the tyranny of the \nmajority, warned of by de Tocqueville, by allowing debates, by allowing \namendments and rollcalls on major pieces of legislation. That is what \nwe are here for; we are here to represent the men and women who live in \nour States on those issues.\n  Tomorrow morning, there is a bipartisan breakfast, the first one of \nthis year. We had them during the last 2 years. At that breakfast, we \nwill be discussing the resolution of Senator Conrad and Senator Gregg \nto create a Bipartisan Task Force for Responsible Fiscal Action. In \nother words, to get serious about dealing with runaway entitlement \nspending. Already we have, I\n\n[[Page S799]]\n\nbelieve, 26 Members of the Senate, almost evenly split among Democrats \nand Republicans, who have accepted to come to that breakfast tomorrow \nmorning. That is an unusual number of Senators for such an event.\n  Republicans and Democrats will not always agree. We emphasize \ndifferent principles. We have different solutions. We are here because \nwe were nominated in partisan conventions or partisan elections. We are \nhere to contend, we are here to debate, we are here to offer our ideas. \nBut to get here, almost all of us had to earn Independent votes and \nsome votes from the other party.\n  When we got here, we all took an oath to represent all our \nconstituents.\n  What will make this Presidency and this Congress different is if \nafter we conclude delivering our sermons to one another, we put aside \nthe 20 percent on which we disagree, and see if we can come to some \nresult on the 80 percent on which we agree, as Senator Enzi of Wyoming \nlikes to say.\n  This will not happen if the majority takes the position: We won the \nelection, we will write the bill; or if the Democratic leader seeks to \nmuzzle our constituents by not allowing amendments and debates and \nvotes on the Senate floor. It can happen, as the Republican leader, \nSenator McConnell, said in his address on Friday, if we in the Senate \nact like grownups and have the courage to put aside hyperpartisanship \nand reject the advice of groups that protect narrow interests and find \nways to work together to solve the real problems that are facing our \ncountry today.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n      [From the Office of Senator Mitch McConnell, Jan. 23, 2009]\n\n             Meeting Challenges: A Way Forward for Congress\n\n       Remarks of U.S. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell \n     (as prepared for delivery) National Press Club, January 23, \n     2009.\n       ``Thank you, Donna. I also want to thank John Donnelly of \n     Congressional Quarterly for inviting me here today. I'm \n     delighted to be here, and I'm honored to be joined by such a \n     distinguished group of reporters.\n       ``For more than a century, the National Press Club has \n     served a vital national purpose as a forum for newsmakers and \n     those who cover them. A free press is essential to our \n     Democracy. And today I thought I'd come over here to look for \n     some free press.\n       ``This past Tuesday, millions of Americans who are old \n     enough to remember past inaugurations were reminded of one of \n     the great hallmarks of our republic, and millions of young \n     people experienced for the first time the rejuvenating effect \n     of the peaceful transfer of power. Of all our civic rituals, \n     few elicit the same feelings of national pride at home or \n     more admiration abroad.\n       ``But the inauguration of President Obama was somehow \n     different, and not only because we were moved at seeing an \n     African American take the oath of office from the steps of a \n     building built by slaves. This year's inauguration was \n     different because this year's election was different.\n       ``For the first time in awhile, America has a president who \n     isn't viewed by most people as an overly polarizing figure. \n     Americans are intrigued by President Obama's promise of post-\n     partisanship. And this afternoon I'd like to share some of my \n     thoughts on the possibility of a new era of cooperation.\n       ``As others have noted, the President does not govern \n     alone.\n       He can't sign a bill Congress hasn't already passed. He \n     can't spend money Congress hasn't appropriated. If President \n     Obama's promise of post-partisanship is to be realized, he'll \n     first need some cooperation from Congress.\n       ``And so, in the spirit of overcoming divisions, let me \n     start out by saying that I agree with President Obama's \n     assertion on Tuesday that many of today's problems are simply \n     too great for us to pass over in the interest of protecting \n     narrow interests. The normal constituencies must be widened.\n       ``On issue after issue, members of both parties have too \n     often fallen into the habit of asking narrow interest groups \n     what they think should be done about something before \n     thinking about what the average American thinks should be \n     done.\n       ``This is how a group like CodePink could end up having so \n     much influence in a national debate about the conduct of a \n     war. This is why a prominent labor leader thinks he can tell \n     a reporter that he expects `payback' from Democrats for the \n     support he gave them during last year's elections. And this \n     is how vulgar insults hurled from overcaffeinated activists \n     can suddenly pass for legitimate political discourse.\n       ``When these things happen, it's easy to see why cynicism \n     about government persists.\n       ``And it's easy to see why something needs to change.\n       ``Both sides are guilty. Republicans need to reevaluate the \n     way decisions are made in Washington, and so do Democrats. \n     But one thing is clear: every decision cannot be made based \n     on a political calculation--because the usual interest groups \n     so seldom agree.\n       ``President Obama seems to understand this. His campaign \n     was based on the notion that ordinary Americans would have a \n     seat at the table in his administration. And broadening the \n     old constituencies is, as he has suggested, one sure way to \n     uphold that pledge.\n       ``Once we do this, there are many issues on which we can \n     cooperate. President Obama mentioned several of them on the \n     campaign trail: reducing the national debt, increasing energy \n     independence, and lowering taxes. There are others.\n       But achieving any one of them will be impossible without \n     cooperation between both parties in Congress and between \n     Congress and the White House.\n       ``Now, I realize that if you told most people Mitch \n     McConnell was down at the National Press Club hoping for \n     bipartisanship, they'd tell you that's like an insurance \n     agent hoping for an earthquake. Most people don't exactly \n     view me as the Mr. Rogers of the Senate. But, respectfully, I \n     think reporters too often confuse being conservative with \n     being partisan. And while my voting record clearly reflects \n     my core values, it also reflects a long commitment to working \n     with others.\n       ``Senator Feinstein has been my closest collaborator in \n     fighting human rights abuses in Burma. For years, I worked \n     alongside Senator Dodd on the Senate Rules Committee, where \n     we teamed up to pass the Help America Vote Act. And more \n     recently, I took a lead role in brokering a bipartisan \n     financial rescue plan just a few weeks before my own \n     reelection bid in November.\n       ``I fought for the rescue package because I thought the \n     country needed it, even though my party could have done \n     without it--and I ended up paying for my efforts. Soon after \n     the deal was struck, one of the very people who had sat at \n     the negotiating table with me ended up running ads against me \n     on that very issue. He saw that it made me vulnerable back \n     home, and tried to capitalize on it politically, which I \n     certainly didn't expect. But these are the risks that \n     politicians have to take from time to time in order to \n     achieve something worthwhile. And it's a risk I was willing \n     to take.\n       ``There was, of course, a time when working on a bipartisan \n     basis to achieve big things for the nation didn't mean \n     exposing oneself to attack ads by one's own colleagues. For \n     years, the Senate was a place where real friendships across \n     party lines were common. One thinks of the breakfast meetings \n     between Mike Mansfield and George Aiken; or Jim Eastland and \n     Gaylord Nelson--men as far apart ideologically as you could \n     find--spending time together after a long day's work. My \n     Senate mentor, John Sherman Cooper, had a close relationship \n     with President Kennedy.\n       ``These friendships were always good for the Senate, and \n     occasionally they paid major dividends for the whole country. \n     One of the great examples of this in the modern era is the \n     Social Security fix of 1983, brokered by Pat Moynihan and Bob \n     Dole. And it's an example we could learn a lot from today.\n       ``As Moynihan later recalled it, the genesis of that \n     particular achievement came on the morning of January 3, \n     1983. Dole had published an op-ed piece in that day's edition \n     of the `New York Times' in which he said that Republicans \n     were eager to accomplish big things in the coming year.\n       ``He cited Social Security as a case in point, arguing that \n     the looming insolvency of Social Security should overwhelm \n     every other domestic priority. By accelerating already-\n     scheduled taxes and reducing future benefit increases, Dole \n     said, Social Security could be made solvent for decades.\n       ``At some point later in the day, Moynihan approached Dole \n     on the Senate floor. If Dole really thought Social Security \n     could be saved, he said, why not try to do it together? Well, \n     13 days later, an agreement was reached, and the Social \n     Security crisis had passed.\n       ``Twenty years later, Bob Dole could say that he had been \n     the longest serving Republican Leader in history and the \n     Republican nominee for president of the United States. But \n     when a reporter asked him what he considered his proudest \n     accomplishments in a lifetime of public service, the first \n     thing that came to mind was the Social Security fix of 1983. \n     Dole explained it this way: 'Those things that are lasting \n     are bipartisan. If you don't have a consensus, it's not going \n     to last.'\n       ``This kind of bipartisan consensus has been increasingly \n     rare in recent years, and the nation has suffered as a \n     result. We saw this four years ago, when President Bush, \n     newly reelected and with expanded Republican majorities in \n     Congress, had the courage to put Social Security reform on \n     the agenda. When he asked for bipartisan help, not one \n     Democrat in Congress stepped forward. Every single one of \n     them turned his or her back, reflexively choosing politics \n     over governing--and the nation lost out on an opportunity to \n     fix a crucial program in desperate need of reform.\n       ``Today, Democrats have substantial majorities in the \n     Senate and the House. They control the White House. And now \n     Democrats assume responsibility for a number of pressing \n     problems--including the one they refused to face in 2005. \n     The problem with entitlement spending has not gone away.\n       ``On Social Security in particular, the situation is \n     increasingly dire: in 1950, 16 workers paid for every one \n     person who received Social Security benefits. Today, it's \n     about 3 workers per beneficiary. And within 10 years\n\n[[Page S800]]\n\n     times, more money will be coming out of the Social Security \n     fund than going in.\n       ``Looking at entitlements in general, Social Security, \n     Medicare, Medicaid, and other programs will soon consume \n     about twice the percentage of the federal budget they did \n     four decades ago. If we don't rein this spending in, soon \n     we'll have only have a fraction left for things like defense, \n     roads, bridges, and special ed. And this is not a problem \n     that raising taxes will solve. In order to meet all our \n     current entitlement promises, we'd have to extract $495,000 \n     from every American household.\n       ``The expansion of entitlement spending is a looming crisis \n     that has been overlooked for too long. And with control of \n     the White House and big majorities in Congress, Democrats now \n     owe it to the American people to put their power to work on \n     this vital issue. And here's my pledge: If they do so, they \n     can expect more cooperation from Republicans than the last \n     President received from them.\n       ``President Obama has said he wants to tackle the \n     entitlements crisis. But in order to succeed, he'll have to \n     continue to reject the hyper partisanship that exists in some \n     quarters of Congress. And he will have to engage Republicans \n     on the merits of our ideas.\n       ``The good news is that most people think ideas should be \n     assessed on their merits, not on the senator or the president \n     who proposes them. Our new President seems to think the same \n     thing. And as Senate Republican Leader, I also pledge to make \n     this is a firm principle in my dealings with the Obama \n     Administration.\n       ``President Obama's campaign reminded many in Washington, \n     including many Republicans, of the aspirations that the \n     Americans people have about their government.\n       People want their leaders to work together to solve \n     problems, not to set traps. The challenge now is for both \n     parties to cooperate, not just in word but in deed.\n       ``In all this, politics will have its place. But at this \n     moment, achieving big things for the country is where my \n     ambitions lie. Voters from both parties think Washington is \n     broken. And that's a shame. But if both parties have helped \n     create this cynical view of government, then both parties \n     will have to work to correct it. And we can start, once the \n     current debate over the Stimulus is through, by working to \n     reform Social Security and Medicare.\n       ``In this and in other efforts, there will be \n     disagreements. But they can be principled disagreements, and \n     the result of principled disagreement is often principled \n     cooperation. The result won't satisfy everyone. As Bob Dole \n     said of the 1983 Social Security fix, `No one got everything, \n     and everyone got something.'\n       ``But many of the domestic problems we face are simply too \n     great to kick the can down the road any longer. We need to \n     summon the courage to act on issues that are of grave concern \n     to our nation's future. And the long-term sustainability of \n     entitlements is one of them.\n       ``As Republicans look for common ground in this and other \n     areas where legislative progress can be made, some will no \n     doubt accuse us of compromise. But those who do so will be \n     confusing compromise with cooperation. And anyone who \n     belittles cooperation resigns him or herself to a state of \n     permanent legislative gridlock. And that is simply no longer \n     acceptable to the American people.\n       ``President Obama has shown himself to be a man of \n     legislative ambition. He reaffirmed this on Tuesday when he \n     called on the country to recognize collective failures, and \n     when he called on politicians to step up to the unpleasant \n     tasks and seek first the interests of the whole.\n       ``Make no mistake: Some of our new President's proposals \n     will be met with strong, principled resistance from me and \n     from others. But many of his ambitions show real potential \n     for bipartisan cooperation. And if we see sensible, \n     bipartisan proposals, Republicans will choose bipartisan \n     solutions over partisan failures every time.\n       ``Thank you very much.''\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Mr. President, I rise to speak in opposition to the \nnomination of Timothy Geithner to be Secretary of the Treasury. Of the \nmany positions in the Federal Government about to be filled, the \nTreasury Secretary is among the most critical today. We are confronted \nby several financial panics and disasters, and one false move by the \nSecretary of the Treasury could result in years of stagnation and high \nunemployment.\n  Even before the disclosure of Mr. Geithner's tax problems, I had \nserious reservations about his nomination. Mr. Geithner has been \ninvolved in about every flawed bailout action of the previous \nadministration. He was the front-line regulator in New York when all \nthe so-called financial innovations that have recently brought our \nmarkets to their knees became widespread. He went along with all the \nflawed monetary policy decisions of Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke, \nand he stretched the law beyond recognition to bail out Bear Stearns \nand later AIG. All those actions, or failures to act, raise questions \nabout the nominee's judgment, but his failure to pay his own Social \nSecurity and Medicare taxes, despite clear evidence he knew he owed the \ntaxes, reflects negligence or worse toward the law he will be \nresponsible for enforcing.\n  The financial crisis we are in the middle of today did not happen \novernight and it could have been prevented. Easy monetary policy under \nformer Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan provided the fuel for a \nspeculative asset bubble that burst. Finally, it popped. Mr. Geithner \nhelped Chairman Greenspan keep pouring that fuel on the fire from the \nday he got to the New York Fed.\n  More careful regulation by Mr. Greenspan, his successor Ben Bernanke, \nand other regulators could have better contained the damage from the \nbubble. Mr. Geithner sat at their side from 2003 until now. Yet he \nraised not one objection to their flawed regulations.\n  Even worse than supporting the flawed Greenspan and Bernanke \npolicies, Mr. Geithner failed himself as a regulator. One of Mr. \nGeithner's most important jobs was to prevent the collapse of the \nlargest and most important banks. One look at Citigroup today shows how \nhe failed in that job. Although he talked about the great threat or the \nsystemic risk, Mr. Geithner sat idly by as risk became more and more \nconcentrated in the hands of a few large financial institutions and the \npricing of risk became detached from reality. Trillions of dollars in \nsavings held by Americans are being destroyed as a result.\n  When the crisis worsened last fall, Mr. Geithner helped craft the \n$700 billion bailout presented to Congress. The Geithner-Paulson-\nBernanke plan, as sold to Congress, was to buy toxic assets to bail out \ntheir Wall Street buddies--no strings attached. But soon, Treasury \nchanged course, choosing to take equity in banks--an option explicitly \nrejected before Congress. Sadly, Mr. Geithner went along with all these \ndecisions.\n  Finally, we have learned that Mr. Geithner is comfortable with giving \ntax dollars away, but not so much with paying them himself. Documents \nshow he repeatedly acknowledged his tax obligation and then ignored \nclear instructions to pay. I find Mr. Geithner's explanation that this \nwas a careless mistake unconvincing and unsupported by the facts.\n  His failure to pay what he owed cost Social Security and Medicare \nmore than $34,000, part of which would never have been repaid if Mr. \nGeithner was not nominated to be Secretary of the Treasury, a position \nwhich oversees tax enforcement. And he was able to convince the IRS to \nrefund the penalties they initially charged. I hope Mr. Geithner will \nremember this experience when considering the tax issues of ordinary \nAmericans.\n  This is all the more unfortunate because America needs a strong and \ncredible Secretary of the Treasury now more than ever. The most recent \nSecretary treated Congress with borderline contempt and hostility. He \nwas not forthcoming with information or explanations, only marching \norders. I do believe Mr. Geithner understands the important role \nCongress has to play in our economic policies, and until his evasive \nand unsatisfactory answers about his tax problems, I thought he would \nat least do a better job than Secretary Paulson at working with \nCongress. When Mr. Geithner is indeed confirmed--and I know he will be \nby this body--I hope he will follow through on his promises to be a \nresponsive and respectful Secretary of Treasury to Congress.\n  Mr. President, for all these reasons I have discussed, I cannot, in \ngood conscience, support this nomination.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S801]]\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Mr. President, I rise today to comment on Mr. Geithner's \nnomination to be the Secretary of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. \nAlthough I became a member of the Senate Finance Committee only \nThursday, I have spent considerable time reviewing the nomination \ndocuments and testimony of Mr. Geithner. I also brought to bear my \nexpertise as an accountant and long-time member of the Senate Banking \nCommittee to make a determination on Mr. Geithner's qualifications. \nAfter thoughtful deliberation, I voted against his nomination in the \nSenate Finance Committee. I continue to oppose his nomination today, \nand urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The position of Secretary of the Treasury is one of the most \nimportant nominations this chamber considers. The Treasury executes the \ndomestic and international economic policy of the United States; our \ntrade policy, the purchase and sale of public debt, regulation of \nnational banks, and of course our tax policy. All revenues of the \nFederal Government pass through the doors of the Treasury.\n  This position is even more meaningful when we consider the economic \ncondition of the United States today. We are in the middle of a global \nfinancial crisis. The U.S. economy is slowing and Americans are losing \ntheir jobs, homes, and retirement savings at an alarming rate. The \nSecretary of the Treasury will be immediately tasked with turning our \neconomy around. This challenge can only be met by the most capable and \nqualified candidate. Unfortunately, I do not believe that candidate is \nMr. Geithner.\n  As chairman of the New York Federal Reserve, Mr. Geithner helped to \norchestrate major bailouts for Bear Stearns, AIG, Citigroup, and \nothers. These bailouts have cost American taxpayers billions of \ndollars. The AIG bailout alone cost $85 billion in September, 2008. \nMany of the actions taken by the New York Federal Reserve, under \nGeithner's leadership, were beyond the purview of the Emergency \nEconomic Stabilization Act and taken without the explicit consent of \nCongress.\n  The money used in these bailouts was spent without transparency or \naccountability. They were also spent on corporate retreats and \nexecutive compensation instead of loans to thaw our frozen credit \nmarkets. Mr. Geithner's career at the New York Fed should be described \nmore as a financier of Wall Street than as a steward of American \nmonetary policy. I am apprehensive about supporting the nomination of \nsomeone who puts shareholder interests above the needs of hardworking \ntaxpayers.\n  Mr. Geithner has also failed to provide specifics about his plans to \nuse the remaining $350 billion in TARP funding. His testimony before \nthe Senate Finance Committee last week displayed the same urgency and \nstrong language as former Secretary Paulson's testimony before the \nSenate Banking Committee in September. Soon after, however, we saw that \nmoney spent in ways unaccountable to and unintended by the U.S. Senate \nand the American taxpayer. Measurable goals and clear direction are \nabsolutely required if American taxpayers are to fully understand how \nand why their money is being spent to assist failing banks and \ncompanies. So far, Mr. Geithner has provided neither. I have not and \nwill not support massive Government intervention to rescue private \nindustry.\n  Finally, I believe Mr. Geithner's failure to pay $34,000 in Social \nSecurity and Medicare taxes is inexcusable. The Treasury Secretary is \nin charge of the Internal Revenue Service and the enforcement of our \nNation's tax code. As one of my colleagues already noted, ``How do I \nexplain to my constituents that I voted to confirm someone who will \nmake them pay taxes, but sometimes does not pay his own taxes?'' This \nnegligent behavior deserves more than a simple slap on the wrist or \nhalf-hearted apology before a Senate committee.\n  In previous years, nominees for positions that do not oversee tax \nreporting and collection have been forced to withdraw their nomination \nfor more minor offenses. They have been ridden out of town on a verbal \nrail. They have been forced to withdraw. The fact that we are in a \nglobal economic crisis is not a reason to overlook these errors. It \nshould be a reason to more closely scrutinize Mr. Geithner's record and \nhis judgment.\n  The Treasury Secretary makes policy decisions every day that impact \nthe global financial markets and put America on a new economic path. \nThese decisions are often made without the explicit consent, or even \nknowledge, of those outside the administration. While the Senate cannot \nscrutinize and debate every decision the Secretary makes, it is our \nduty to ensure the President's nominee has the character and judgment \nnecessary to perform these duties successfully. Mr. Geithner's past \nnegligence casts doubt on his qualifications in this regard.\n  Some of my colleagues in the Senate have argued that, despite these \nconcerns, President Obama should have his choice of economic counsel \nconfirmed because he is the President. I respectfully disagree. We are \ncharged with the advice and consent of nominees under the Constitution. \nAre we saying there is only one person in the whole world qualified to \nhandle the situation as it is today? With the broad authority granted \nto the Treasury Secretary and the enormous challenge facing the new \nSecretary to right our country's economic ship, President Obama's \nchoice impacts every American in a very personal way. The Senate would \nnot be doing its duty if we simply confirmed this nominee without \naddressing these issues.\n  Many of my constituents are asking, ``Are you seriously considering \nputting someone who failed to pay their taxes in charge of the \ndepartment which controls the IRS? You couldn't find anyone better?'' \nYet that is exactly what we are doing. Many of your constituents are \nasking the same thing, but my voice seems to be one of the few of \ndissent. But that is not why we have a Senate. The Senate is not \nsupposed to be a group of ``yes men'' rubber stamping everything the \nexecutive branch sends us. We are supposed to stand out, stand up and \nreason during the rush. We are supposed to think and then act based on \nunderstanding and knowledge. We are not doing so today.\n  Mr. President, I intend to vote against the nomination of Mr. Timothy \nGeithner as Secretary to the U.S. Department of the Treasury. The \nSenate needs more time to fully address the problems I have identified \nand debate Mr. Geithner's qualifications. I respectfully urge my \ncolleagues to vote no.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan).

Madam President, this week the Senate is considering the so-\ncalled SCHIP bill, the State Children's Health Insurance Program, which \nis what SCHIP stands for. It is a program that has been worthwhile to \ntake care of kids who are from families of lower income and need help \nwith their health insurance. Last year, we attempted to work in a \nbipartisan way to get a reauthorization of the so-called SCHIP bill. \nThis year, however, the Democratic majority has decided to work it \nalone, to write a partisan bill without Republican input. In fact, \nevery single one of the Republican amendments offered during the \nFinance Committee markup of this bill last week was defeated. There was \none small amendment that was accepted; otherwise, they were all \ndefeated.\n  It is my judgment that this is not the best way to start off the \nyear--working together, bridging the partisan gap, all of the things \nPresident Obama talked about, trying to put the old politics behind \nus--if we are simply going to approach something this important on a \npartisan basis.\n  I rise to talk about four specific ways in which I hope we can come \ntogether and work in a more bipartisan way to improve the bill. It \ndoesn't put low-income children first, and that should be the whole \npoint of the SCHIP bill.\n\n[[Page S802]]\n\n  First, it expands SCHIP to higher income families--in fact, for two \nStates and only two States, for families making $88,200 a year. That is \nnot for the State of the Presiding Officer or for my State. That is \nonly for New York State. People in New York State would be able to make \n$88,000 per year--actually, about $40,000 even above that--and qualify. \nSo it is not about helping low-income children.\n  Second, it removes about 2.5 million people who are already in \nprivate insurance programs with their employer. It will result in their \nleaving the employer's health care coverage to come to a Government-\nsponsored program, something called the ``crowd out'' effect.\n  Third, it is actually not even paid for in the sense that we normally \ntreat these authorization bills. We try to make sure that whatever new \nspending we provide is offset by some other spending. But there is a \nbudget gimmick that is used to account for the spending in this bill.\n  Finally, for the first time it significantly expands the program to \ninclude not only citizens but legal immigrants, primarily green card \nholders. It eliminates most of the requirement for demonstrating \neligibility for citizens, which would result in a lot of illegal \nimmigrants getting coverage.\n  In these four important areas, we ought to work together and find a \nway to amend the bill before we end up voting on it, perhaps at the end \nof the week.\n  Let me first turn to the question of the budget gimmick. Sometimes \nyou say how much something costs. In the Senate, our scoring always \nrequires that we show a 5-year cost and a 10-year cost. That is a good \nthing to do. What they do in this bill is make it work, in effect, for \nabout 4.5 years, then they slow the spending way down so that it \ndoesn't look as if it is going to cost any more. The result would be \nthat we would have to disenroll millions of children. Think about it. \nAre we being honest when we have a level of spending for 4.5 years and \nthen it drops off a cliff to virtually nothing? Are we honest to say \nthat is the 10-year cost of the bill when we know we would have to \ndisenroll kids in order to make it work that way? No. The reality is, \nwe are going to continue to keep the level of spending for the entire \n10 years, and the bill, therefore, will cost about twice as much as we \nsay it is going to cost. In fact, the Congressional Budget Office, \nwhich pays attention to these things, says the cost of the bill is \ngoing to be about $115.2 billion over 10 years, of which only $73.3 \nbillion is offset. So the net result is a $41.6 billion deficit \nspending bill for fiscal years 2009 through 2019. That is the first \nproblem.\n  The second problem is that the bill is not limited to low-income \nfamilies. In fact, it is extended to quite high-income families. It \npermits States to cover children from families earning as much as \n$66,150 per year. That is 300 percent of poverty. That is well above \nSCHIP's original intent of 200 percent of poverty. Of course, the more \nyou increase the income level, the more likely it is that you are going \nto crowd out people who already have insurance.\n  As I mentioned, there is even an exception for New Jersey and New \nYork which would allow families in New Jersey earning approximately \n$77,175 per year to qualify, and in New York, $88,200 a year or 400 \npercent of poverty. Let me put this in perspective. In Arizona, the \nArizona KIDS Program covers families earning $44,100 per year or 200 \npercent of poverty. That is low-income families. But under this bill, \nArizona's hard-earned taxpayer funds will be sent to cover families who \nearn twice that much in New York State. That is not fair. It is not \nright.\n  To make matters worse, the committee acknowledged that States may \nintentionally disregard tens of thousands of dollars worth of income in \norder to make a child eligible. They could disregard, for example, \n$20,000 a year in housing expenses, $10,000 a year in transportation \nexpenses, $10,000 a year for clothing expenses. The net result is that \nif Congress sets this level of $88,200 for New York and then allows \n$40,000 worth of income disregards, children could actually come from \nfamilies earning nearly $130,000 and still be eligible for SCHIP. That \ndoes not comport with what either Senator Obama said he wanted or what \nmost of us think would be fair.\n  Third, I talked about the crowd-out effect, especially by extending \nthis to higher income families. We are going to replace a lot of \nprivate insurance with Government insurance. In fact, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office, about 2.5 million individuals will lose \ntheir private coverage under this bill.\n  It is interesting that last year we raised this problem. It was \nconsidered to be a serious problem. But my amendment to try to deal \nwith that failed. Nevertheless, when the Democratic House leaders and \nDemocratic Senate committee members got together, they wrote a \nprovision to deal with the crowd-out, recognizing that it was a serious \nproblem. They passed the bill. This was written in part by the chairman \nof the Finance Committee. That crowd-out provision, however, was \ndropped from this year's version of the bill. There is no crowd-out \nprovision. So in the committee, I offered an amendment to insert their \ncrowd-out language, the language drafted by the chairman of the \ncommittee, passed by the House and Senate last year. That amendment \nfailed.\n  Well, maybe it is premature to deal with the problem of crowd-out. We \nknow there is going to be crowd-out. The Congressional Budget Office \nsays there will be, and the time to deal with it is before we adopt the \nlegislation, not after.\n  Finally, let me close with the immigration-related section, section \n214. This eliminates the current 5-year bar allowing Federal coverage \nof Medicaid or SCHIP coverage for legal immigrants. These are primarily \ngreen card holders. Not even the House bill goes this far. The Senate \nbill actually eliminates the requirement that sponsors of immigrants \nreimburse the Federal Government for immigrants' coverage. This would \nbe for the first time since actually 1882--our Federal law dates back \nthat far--with regard to immigration.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. We invite immigrants to come here. My \ngrandparents are immigrants. We want to make sure that when they come \nhere, they don't immediately become a public charge or go on welfare. \nThat is why, starting as far back as 1882, we said: You need to take \ncare of yourself when you come here and not ask the Government to do it \nor at least have your sponsor affirm that he or she will take care of \nyou. That was affirmed in 1996 when we updated the legislation.\n  This mark would eliminate that requirement, so that from now on legal \nimmigrants, primarily green card holders, would be able to avail terms \nof this coverage. It is about 300,000 individuals estimated at a 5-year \ncost of $1.3 billion. I don't have the CBO number for the 10-year cost. \nThat number doesn't even begin to take into account people who are here \nillegally but who might actually make legal under some kind of \nimmigration reform, if that were to happen. It is also estimated that \nabout 100,000 of these 300,000 individuals would be crowded out from \neither private insurance or State insurance coverage. So we continue to \nhave the crowd-out effect here.\n\n  The problematic section is section 211. This will likely increase the \nnumber of illegal immigrants and other ineligible individuals because \nit eliminates the current document verification to demonstrate that you \nare entitled to accept the benefits of the program. What this does is \nto say that all you have to do is provide a Social Security number. In \nmy State, all of the illegal immigrants--virtually all of the illegal \nimmigrants have Social Security numbers. In fact, they have a lot of \nSocial Security numbers sometimes, most of which are probably not \nvalid, some of which, however, are valid. So even if they are checked \nthrough the system, which this bill does not require, you would catch \nthem. All you have to do is to say: Here is a Social Security number. \nNow let me avail myself of the benefits. That is the whole point of the \nimmigration reform legislation. That Social Security number proves \nnothing with regard to eligibility. That would be substituted for the \nrequirements already in the bill.\n  Are the requirements already in the bill onerous? I think not. There \nare four different levels of documentation you can provide. The last \ndocument, tier 4, is when you can't do any of the other things, you can \nsimply have two\n\n[[Page S803]]\n\nindividuals affirm your citizenship. You can do this by mail. You don't \neven have to show up in person. So it is not as if we have onerous \nrequirements today to participate in the program.\n  Even with the very generous provisions we have, it is my \nunderstanding from a GAO study in 2007 that we think most of the people \nwho are eligible are signing up and we are not getting a lot of \nineligible people signing up. In other words, people are not gaming the \nsystem, and that is a good thing. But why make it easier to game the \nsystem, especially to play into the hands of those who are here \nillegally, who use a Social Security number for work purposes and now \ncould use it for this purpose, signing up for SCHIP.\n  We will have amendments that deal with each of these subjects. The \nbottom line is, we should get back to dealing with this subject in a \nway in which both Democrats and Republicans can have input into the \nbill and actually solve some of the problems. I know some of my \nDemocratic colleagues were interested in this eligibility issue because \nthey don't want a lot of people getting benefits who aren't entitled. \nIt will only hurt those who are entitled. We need to have strong \neligibility requirements.\n  We don't want to begin to expand this program to people who are not \ncitizens of the United States and who have a contract with the United \nStates when they come here as our guests, either on a temporary basis \nor on a green card. They understand their obligations when they come \nhere. One of their responsibilities is not to begin to receive benefits \nof this kind from the taxpaying American citizen.\n  For these four reasons, I hope that when this legislation comes \nbefore us, we are able to not only amend the bill, work to amend the \nbill, but will actually have amendments adopted and that we can improve \nthe legislation so that we can all be proud to support it at the end of \nthe day. If not, an awful lot of Republicans, including myself, will \nnot be able to support the legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, we all know because of what \nwe have seen in our various States that our people are hurting; they \nare losing their homes; they are losing their jobs; they are falling \nbehind in their mortgages; They are losing their businesses; and they \nare losing their life savings.\n  Now, we clearly have the mandate that, if it is humanly possible, we \nneed to turn this economy around. So the people of this country are \nexpecting to see us take some real action--real action--on trying to \nturn this economy around. We, in this position, representing our \nStates, are very privileged to have the public's trust and the \nresponsibility that comes with that trust. Part of that responsibility \nmeans when there is a problem, we have to shine light on the problem \nand find out what it is.\n  Take, for example, what we have seen recently on the Wall Street \ngreed, when you have a former Merrill Lynch executive spending almost a \nmillion and a half dollars on his office renovations while his company \nwas forcing layoffs as well as having huge losses and while the company \nthat was acquired--his company--was asking for billions of dollars, and \nreceiving it, from the public moneys. Well, there is obviously a \nproblem.\n  A number of us have filed legislation that is going to try to get at \nthis issue. Even with this being put in the law, a new law saying none \nof this bailout money can be used for office renovations and political \ncontributions or to go off on all these extravagant conferences or for \ncorporate aircraft or for entertainment and holiday parties or for \nexecutive bonuses--all of these things that have come forth when the \nlight of day is shone on them, having so enraged our people and our \nconstituents--well, even if we get this into the law--and I hope we \nwill be able to pass this legislation a number of us have filed--it is \nstill going to take the administration riding herd on this issue every \nday, and that means primarily the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  We are going to be voting on the confirmation of the Secretary of the \nTreasury at 6 o'clock today. It is this Senator's intention to vote for \nTimothy Geithner. But what is it going to take to get Wall Street's \nattention and to restore the American family's quality of life? It is \ngoing to take real accountability. That means the next Secretary of the \nTreasury is going to have to ride herd and, when he appoints an \naccountability board, to make sure that board is meeting--like the last \nSecretary of the Treasury did not. They did not meet once to see how \nthat first tranche of $350 billion of the bailout money was being \nspent--not once.\n  So I come from the sunshine State. We believe in letting the sun \nshine in. This means not getting ahead of ourselves when Wall Street \ncomes crying that one of their unregulated financial schemes threatens \nto destroy our way of life, and then turns around and throws some party \non some Caribbean island. It means putting in place regulations with \nthe right carrots and sticks so we are not gambling with our country's \nfuture.\n  So as we are about to confirm the next Secretary of the Treasury, \nthere is not a more important mandate than for him to crack the whip \nand make sure this Federal money, this public money, this taxpayer \nmoney, is being spent as it was intended, and holding people \naccountable, and reporting the results. If we do not get the \naccountability and the transparency, if we do not get what we expect \nfrom the banks that willingly accept this money, then we should demand \nthe public's money back.\n  I have spoken personally to the nominee, and he has said--and I want \nto quote him--``I completely get it.'' So I am assuming he is going to \nbe confirmed today. I will vote for him. I expect swift action to back \nup these words. The American people expect swift action by all of us to \nbring Wall Street and this economy back in line. We do not have any \ntime to waste. There is simply too much at stake.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this is the first full week of our new \nadministration, and many of us sense things have changed for the \nbetter, and we are hopeful. We can't assume anything because there is a \nlot of hard work ahead, and we are going to have to try everything we \ncan to resolve some of the major issues that face our country that we \ncan address in the Senate.\n  We were successful last week, in passing with 61 votes--bipartisan \nrollcall--the Lilly Ledbetter legislation. This was a bill which tried \nto cure a problem created by a Supreme Court decision that was \nquestioned about whether women should be entitled to equal pay for \nequal work. Lilly Ledbetter, after 15 or 16 years working at a tire \ncompany in Alabama, discovered that within her job classification men \nwere being paid more than she as a woman. She did not discover this \nuntil she was about to retire. So she filed a lawsuit and the Supreme \nCourt across the street reached a conclusion which no other court had \nreached and said Ms. Ledbetter could not recover because she didn't \nreport the first discriminatory paycheck paid to her in--I think it was \n180 days. Her answer, which most people who work in the private sector \nwould say, is, How am I supposed to know what the fellow next to me is \ngetting in his paycheck? They don't publish these things. So when she \ndid discover it and filed it, they said she was too late.\n  So we changed the law so, if there is discrimination, a person will \nhave their day in court. They will have a fair hearing. The reasonable \nattempts to discover the information are enough. The Supreme Court \nstandard was unreasonable. So that is the first thing we will pass, \nsending that to our new President, President Obama. It is a bill which \nwe considered before under\n\n[[Page S804]]\n\nPresident Bush but did not have the votes to pass before. So now a \nbipartisan group is sending it to the President.\n\n  This week we are on a new issue, and the new issue is another matter \nthat has come before us in previous Congresses and is returning. It is \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. This was a program that was \nstarted back in 1997 under President Clinton and a Republican Congress. \nThe object was a good one.\n  We know across America there are some 15 million children who are \nuninsured, and we need to find a way to bring them insurance. If these \nchildren are in the poorest families in America, we take care of them. \nThe Medicaid Program for the poorest kids in America provides for these \nchildren. However, if they are not among the poorest and their parents \nare not lucky enough to have health insurance, they fall right in the \nmiddle.\n  Here are kids whose parents get up and go to work every day where the \nwork does not provide health insurance. So we said to the States: We \nwill give you a special deal because we think it is important for \nAmerica to provide health insurance for as many kids as possible. What \nwe will do is give you more Federal funds than usual as an incentive to \nbring these kids in, get them insured.\n  The States got involved, and it has been a success. More and more \nkids have been brought into the program. In my State of Illinois, about \n65 percent of the cost is paid by the Federal Government, 35 percent by \nthe State. So whenever a Governor comes up with an idea to bring more \nkids in, that Governor knows he has to put the money on the table, at \nleast 35 percent of the cost, to bring in more kids.\n  Unfortunately, the program was expiring and many of the kids had not \nbeen reached. Currently, we have 9 million children under the age of 18 \nwho are uninsured and 6 million of them are eligible for CHIP and a \ncombination with Medicaid. We wanted to try to bring up this number. It \ncosts money because we are putting Federal money into it. So we said: \nWhat is a reasonable way to pay for it? It happens to be a way I voted \nfor consistently and that is raising the tax on tobacco products.\n  Some people may see this a little differently, but, by and large, I \nknow, and our life experience proves, that when the cost of tobacco \nproducts goes up, fewer kids will buy them. If we can stop a kid from \nstarting to smoke before the age of 18, there is a better than 50-50 \nchance they never will smoke. Expensive products with the taxes that \nare imposed discourage kids from buying them and provide the revenue \nfor this program. So the 61-cent new Federal tax was going to be used \nto provide health insurance for kids.\n  I think it is a fair tradeoff. I will vote for that proposal. I have \nvoted for it. We passed the bill twice and sent it to President Bush. \nHe vetoed it both times. So now it is coming back.\n  We are going to consider this bill in this week's debate. I have had \nreports about my Republican colleagues who have come to the floor \ncritical of this bill. It is their right to oppose it. I have opposed \nbills they supported in the past. That is what the Senate is all about. \nBut I would like to address each of the arguments they are making.\n  First, there is no doubt in my mind this is important. How important \nis it for a parent to know their kids have access to a doctor? I think \nit is one of the most important things. If you have ever had a sick \nchild, particularly one who needed care, it breaks your heart to know \nyou cannot take them to the best doctor or hospital, maybe not to any \ndoctor or hospital.\n  We all know that if you can reach a child with a problem such as \nasthma at an early age and start treating the child, it is less likely \nthat child will have serious problems later on.\n  Most of us understand intuitively that providing health insurance for \nkids is not only compassionate, it is the smart thing to do. Those kids \nare more likely to be healthy. They are more likely to go to school and \nnot be absentees. They are more likely to grow up to be healthy adults. \nThat is a pretty good outcome for this country.\n  The opposite is true as well. Without health care, these kids may \nhave little problems that grow into big problems. They will start \nmissing school, and they may become chronically ill at a point where \nthey become extremely expensive, not to mention compromising their \nquality of life.\n  So here we are trying to expand the Children's Health Insurance \nProgram, and the argument on the other side is we should not do it, at \nleast not the way we have proposed.\n  I think it is priority. I am glad President Obama has asked us to \nsend him this bill as quickly as we can. I want to get these kids \ncovered. The sooner we do, the better for them and their families and \nthe better for our country.\n  We know when this policy was instituted 10 years ago, more and more \nkids received the basic care that people want them to receive.\n  There are some other considerations too. Here is how we define \n``eligibility.'' We say that if you are no higher than 200 percent of \nwhat we call the poverty income, then your kids are eligible. What does \nthat mean? It is about $42,000 a year in income. Then we say to the \nStates: If you want to expand that to a higher level, up to 300 \npercent, a family income of $63,000--each State has that option, but if \nyou expand it, you have to put State money on the table. You do not get \nthis free.\n  Some of the Republicans and columnist George Will have argued we are \nbeing too generous, that we are providing health insurance to families \nwho ought to be able to pay for it themselves. I disagree, and I think \nsome people making this argument are out of touch with what these \nfamilies face.\n  Imagine if you are a family making $42,000 a year, and by way of \nspeculation, most people pay about 40 percent of their gross pay in \nFICA and taxes. So you are likely to see about $26,000 a year in take-\nhome pay out of $42,000--maybe a little bit more but $26,000. That \ncomes out to a little more than $2,000 a month to live on for \neverything--for your mortgage or rent, your utilities, putting gas in \nthe car, automobile insurance, food, clothing--the list goes on. A \nlittle more than $2,000 a month.\n  I have a niece who is a part-time worker. She works here and there \nwhere she can. She is a mother whose child is now an adult. I asked her \nrecently: Paula, what do you pay? What would you pay for health \ninsurance?\n\n  She said: It is $400 a month. That is what they quote me. She said: I \ncan't pay that. And I understand why she cannot pay it.\n  If we use that as a hypothetical figure, $400 a month, out of a take-\nhome pay of $2,000 or $2,200 a month, that is a big piece of the \npaycheck. So to help these people with children's health insurance, at \nleast to cover their kids, is not unreasonable. It is not like we are \ngiving a subsidy to rich people.\n  Elizabeth Warren is a Harvard professor of law whom I respect. She \nmay be one of the best speakers for consumers, particularly middle-\nincome consumers, across America. She took a look at people making \nabout $49,000 a year, smack dab in the middle of the middle class, and \nwhat happened to them over the last 8 years. What she found was their \nincome did not keep pace with the cost of inflation. We know that is \ntrue. People were not getting paycheck increases to keep up with the \ncost of living.\n  She calculated that between 2000 and 2007, these people lost about \n$1,100 because the cost of living went up and their paychecks did not \ngo up. Food costs were up $205; telephone bills $142; appliance costs, \ngas bills--the list goes on and on, including mortgage payments, \ngasoline, and childcare costs.\n  It turned out those people smack dab in the middle of the middle \nclass, making what middle-income families made at $49,000 a year, had \nactually fallen behind over 7 years by $5,000.\n  The point I am getting to is this: I think it is hard for us as \nMembers of the Senate who get paid pretty nicely, I might add, and have \nsome benefits to go with it, to stand here and say, if you have $42,000 \ncoming in, even if you have $63,000 gross pay coming in, you don't need \nany help in paying for health insurance. That is not true. I don't \nthink it is accurate.\n  This program should be in a position where it can look at families \nand say: We will give you a helping hand to make sure your kids are \ncovered. That is reasonable.\n  So as to needing the program, we certainly need it with 9 million \nuninsured kids under the age of 18. Whom it should reach: Certainly \npeople making $42,000 a year gross income are not wealthy or not well \noff, even up to\n\n[[Page S805]]\n\n$63,000, 300 percent of poverty. It is hard to imagine they have so \nmuch money that they couldn't use a helping hand with health insurance.\n  The final point that is made is a tougher one, and it is one we are \ngoing to be debating this week. Here is what it comes down to: Should \nwe cover the children of people who are in the United States legally \nbut not citizens for the first 5 years they are here? We have had this \ndebate back and forth for 10 or 12 years. We have decided from time to \ntime to extend food stamps to these people legally here but not \ncitizens. The question is: Should their children receive health \ninsurance coverage if they are legally in the United States?\n  There will be some who will argue: No, don't do it. I am not one of \nthose people. I honestly believe America is not better off with sick \nchildren. I do not believe we should be naive enough to think a sick \nchild, who happens to be an American citizen sitting in the classroom \nwith your own child, is not going to spread the germs, is not going to \nhave problems that could reach other kids. I guess this betrays my own \npersonal values. I would much rather see these kids healthy and given a \nchance. Yes, it is going to add some costs, but they are legally here. \nWe are not talking about undocumented people. They are legally here, \nand they are in the status of on the way to citizenship or at least \ntemporarily legal in the United States.\n  That is an issue we will debate. This law does not require them to be \ncovered. Each Governor has to decide. It is the State's decision. If \nthe States don't want to cover them, that is their decision.\n  These folks are likely to become tomorrow's citizens. Census data \nshows most immigrants who enter the United States when they are \nchildren become U.S. citizens. These are the children who will grow up \nto be the adults we need to be in our workforce and to be productive \ncitizens, people who will make contributions to the U.S. economy, pay \ntheir taxes, start businesses, serve in the military, and participate \nin America's civic life.\n  There are 18,000 legal immigrant children in my home State of \nIllinois. These are future adults who will go to school, make a career, \nand create families. How can we continue to support a policy that says \nto our future American citizens: You have to wait 5 years to see a \ndoctor, to get your immunizations, to feel better. No child should have \nto wait 5 years for health care. Five years can be a lifetime to a \nlittle boy or girl.\n  In the 5-year waiting period, we may miss an opportunity to diagnose \nand treat asthma, autism, hearing impairments, or vision problems. \nThese are conditions that may have lifelong consequences for a child's \nhealth, educational attainment, and well-being.\n  Our country is better than that. We will debate these amendments, as \nwe should. That is what the Senate is about: deliberation, votes, and \nresolution of issues. Then I believe we will send this Children's \nHealth Insurance Program to President Obama. Despite the two vetoes by \nPresident Bush, we are going to extend this program because our vision \nof America was articulated by President Obama at the beginning of his \ncampaign. He used to talk--in fact, he spoke this way when he was a \nSenator from Illinois and even a candidate for the senate in Illinois--\nthat the misfortune of a child in East St. Louis had an impact on his \nlife in Chicago; the misfortune and lack of education of a child on the \nsouth side of Chicago affects people living in better-off suburbs.\n  Bottom line, in a few words, we are in this together. If we improve \nthe quality of life for our children, give them a fighting chance to be \nhealthy and well educated, to become participants in America, we will \nbe a better nation. To turn our back on them, to shun and push aside \nmillions of kids, for whatever reason, is not good for our country in \nthe long run. It is not the value system we are all about.\n  We provide foreign aid, and I support that, to countries around the \nworld to help kids who may never set foot in the United States. We do \nit because we are caring people. Shouldn't our care be extended first \nto our own children to make sure they have basic health insurance?\n  I am looking forward to this debate. I hope it is the beginning of a \ngood debate and a good outcome and that this bill will be sent to \nPresident Obama, who will have a chance to sign it into law to give \nthese kids a fighting chance for decent health care.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

GEITHNER TO BE SECRETARY OF TREASURY\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the Senate shall \nproceed to executive session to consider the following nomination, \nwhich the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       Department of Treasury, Timothy F. Geithner, of New York, \n     to be Secretary of the Treasury.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nthe confirmation of Timothy Geithner as President Obama's choice as \nSecretary of the Treasury. I am aware this nominee is not free of \ncontroversy. My office has received many calls from Utahns who are \nconcerned about Mr. Geithner's admitted errors in initially failing to \nreport and pay his own self-employment tax. Many of them brought up the \nvalid point that the Secretary of the Treasury, the person who is \nultimately in charge of collecting taxes from all Americans and who \noversees the Internal Revenue Service, should be beyond reproach in his \nown tax filings. Many of our colleagues on both sides of the aisle are \nalso uneasy about this problem. I understand and I share this concern.\n  The Senate has a solemn responsibility in confirming key officials in \nthe executive branch, and the Treasury Secretary is among the very most \nimportant roles in the administration, both historically and \nparticularly at this critical time. My guiding principle for approving \nthe President's nominees has always been that the President, as chief \nexecutive of the Nation, should be entitled to the person he or she \nchooses, and that the Senate has an obligation to confirm those choices \nexcept in cases where it is obvious the nominee is either incompetent, \ncorrupt, or unethical. While not all my colleagues share this view, I \nbelieve it is the correct one, and that it helps us stay above the \npetty partisanship that sometimes enters into these nomination \nprocesses and harms the effectiveness of our Government.\n  Upon careful examination of this nominee, it is obvious that Timothy \nGeithner is neither incompetent nor corrupt, and certainly not \nunethical, and that he should be confirmed as Secretary of the \nTreasury. I have reached this decision after weighing the facts of his \ntax situation with his impressive education, experience, and \nintelligence, and keeping in mind the desperate financial crisis \ncurrently facing this country.\n  In announcing this conclusion, I believe I owe it to the people of \nUtah to explain that I view Timothy Geithner's tax issue as a very \nserious matter. He is the top tax officer in the United States of \nAmerica and, I might add, next to the President himself, is the person \nwho bears the ultimate responsibility for collecting the revenue this \nNation needs in order to operate. As such, the Treasury Secretary must \nbe an example to all Americans in tax and financial issues, and any \nshortcomings in this area can be an impediment to effective tax \ncompliance. The fact Mr. Geithner has had this issue arise, and that he \nadmitted committing serious oversights on several of his tax returns, \nis indeed regrettable. It has marred an otherwise singularly \noutstanding nominee's record and has\n\n[[Page S806]]\n\ngiven pause to some in the Senate about his fitness to serve.\n  At the same time, it is important to note that people make mistakes \nand commit oversights. Even the most intelligent and gifted--two \nadjectives that certainly apply to Mr. Geithner--make errors in their \nfinancial dealings. For his part, Mr. Geithner has corrected the \nproblems by filing amended returns and paying the taxes due, with \ninterest. I recognize he did not come forward and pay the taxes for the \nearlier 2 years which were not covered by the audit until shortly \nbefore his nomination was announced. This is true even though he was \ncredited for those taxes by the International Monetary Fund, and I wish \nthis were otherwise. But the nominee has stated that he wishes he had \nacted differently as well.\n  Mr. Geithner has admitted his errors and expressed regret for them. I \nbelieve he is sincere. I have had a number of meetings with him and I \nam convinced he is sincere, and that he was when he testified that \nthese omissions were mistakes and were not intentional. I think anyone \nwho would talk to him personally and go through this with him would \ncome to the same conclusion. While these mistakes have, to some degree, \ncast a shadow on Mr. Geithner's selection, it is important that they \nnot be allowed to overshadow his impressive credentials and the very \nreal expertise he will bring to this job--an expertise that is sorely \nneeded at the present time. And that is acknowledging that Mr. Paulson, \nour current Secretary of the Treasury, has tried to do a very good job, \nand has done a very good job under the very pressing conditions he has \nfaced.\n  Let there be no mistake, Mr. Geithner is not merely acceptable for \nthe job, he is highly qualified. Indeed, his portfolio, knowledge, and \nskills make him uniquely qualified to serve and are sorely needed by \nthis Nation as we face the current economic crisis. He is intimately \nfamiliar with all arms of U.S. policymaking.\n  For instance, he is no stranger to the Treasury Department, where he \nserved in significant positions for 8 years. That means he knows the \nagency, the personnel, and the tasks that will face him when he is \nconfirmed. It means he can hit the ground running on day one and has \nthe know-how to get the economy moving again, although that is going to \nbe a monumental job even for Mr. Geithner.\n  Moreover, Mr. Geithner has already been a major player in addressing \nthe Nation's response to the economic situation. As head of the New \nYork Federal Reserve--actually president of the New York Federal \nReserve--he has worked closely with Secretary Paulson and Federal \nReserve Chairman Ben Bernanke in crafting the Government's response to \nthe financial crisis. He knows firsthand what has worked and what has \nnot, and is therefore best equipped to apply the remedies that will be \nmost successful. He knows the issues and he knows the landscape and the \ntools available to address these problems.\n  Have our actions to date in responding to this economic calamity been \nperfect? Almost certainly not. Have mistakes been made? Yes, they \nundoubtedly have. Unfortunately, it is too early to assess with \ncomplete accuracy the effectiveness of our response to this complex and \nunprecedented situation. However, the fact that Mr. Geithner recognizes \nmistakes have occurred makes him more valuable, in my view, in the \ncontinuing effort to right our economic ship. I would rather have at \nthe helm a battle-hardened veteran who knows the shoals and whirlpools \nthan a neophyte who has to wade into these churning waters for the \nfirst time. It is imperative to the Nation to have a Treasury Secretary \nwho won't sink or merely tread water but will swim. In my estimation, \nMr. Geithner is that man.\n  Because of his experience at the Treasury and the Federal Reserve, \nand the fact that he has been working arm in arm with Secretary Paulson \nand Chairman Bernanke, Timothy Geithner is more aware of the \ncomplexities of the issues facing us than probably anyone else the \nPresident might have chosen. Moreover, he knows the financial markets \nand the counterpart officials to the Treasury Secretary around the \nworld. That is evident from his experience in the Clinton \nadministration as Under Secretary for International Affairs and the \ncritical role he played in devising the successful United States \nresponse to the Asian financial crisis--not an easy thing to handle, \nand he did it amazingly well.\n  I am comfortable that despite the blemishes of his tax problem, Mr. \nGeithner should be confirmed to this vital position. The fact that this \nis an unprecedented and dangerous time makes it all the more imperative \nthat we vote quickly on this nomination. I do not believe we have the \nluxury of leaving this position unfilled even another day. Rejecting \nthis nominee would lead to a delay of weeks in getting our new \nexecutive branch economic team focused on the problems at hand. Such a \ndelay could be hazardous to a timely turnaround to the financial and \neconomic crisis. Moreover, rejection of Mr. Geithner brings about the \nvery real risk that the next person the President might nominate could \nbe less effective for the job, even if he or she had a spotless tax \ncompliance record.\n  I might add for my fellow conservatives out there, who are very upset \nabout this--some up in arms about it--you are not going to get a better \nperson for this job than Mr. Geithner, and you better be darned happy \nthat the President has been willing to go to somebody who is a lot less \nideological than any of us ever expected in this very important \nposition. It is one thing to raise the issues. It is one thing to \ndecide to vote against him. It is another thing to not acknowledge that \nthis is a man who could really help this country at this time.\n  Moreover, Mr. Geithner will not approach the job of Treasury \nSecretary from an ideological or partisan perspective. At least that is \nwhat he has told me, and I believe he is a man of honor. A less \nexperienced and perhaps more partisan and ideological nominee could \nprove divisive here in the Senate, thus leading to even more delay, \nand, if confirmed, that person could find himself or herself engulfed \nin a maelstrom without the experience from which to navigate. Timothy \nGeithner, I am convinced, will steer clear of partisanship. I believe \nhe will chart a course for bipartisan cooperation rather than embark on \nleftwing solutions that would divide the Congress and endanger our \nbeautiful and wonderful country.\n  As I conclude my remarks, I feel constrained to point out what I see \nis a double standard, illustrated in this nomination. Having lived \nthrough the last 8 years with President Bush, I do not think there is \nany question that if this had been a Republican nominee with these same \nproblems, many in the media and some on the left of this body would \nhave reacted with such an outcry to the tax compliance issue that the \nPresident would have had no choice other than to withdraw the \nnomination. A Republican nominee in Mr. Geithner's position would not \nhave even gotten a committee vote. We all have seen that. Time after \ntime, some of the most qualified people were rejected, were not even \ngiven a chance. I do not believe that was the right thing done then, \nand I do not think it is the right thing now. I do think people in a \nprincipled fashion can vote one way or the other on Mr. Geithner, but I \nhope for the sake of our country they will vote to support him.\n  I believe that if Timothy Geithner is confirmed, it will largely be \ndue to the fact that many on my side were willing to put partisanship \nto the side for the sake of what is best for the country at this time.\n  Looking forward, I see a real need for continued cooperation on a \nbipartisan basis. The current financial downturn affects all of us--\neverybody in America. I hope all Americans and their elected \nrepresentatives can continue to put politics aside in our pursuit to \nfind the best policies to help us out of this quagmire.\n  I expect we will be working closely with Timothy Geithner if he is \nconfirmed today, as I expect he will be. Our expectations of him are \nvery high. A less qualified or talented person might not have expected \nto survive this confirmation process. Even an equally gifted veteran \nmight not have made it through a less turbulent and risky time.\n  Mr. Geithner, I just have to tell you, as you resume work on solving \nour thorniest financial problems, we send with you our best wishes even \nas we recall your pledge to give it your all because we are going to \nneed everything you have.\n\n[[Page S807]]\n\n  Madam President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  I ask unanimous consent that a quorum call be entered and that all \nquorum calls during this debate on Mr. Geithner be equally charged to \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today to speak on President \nObama's nomination of Timothy Geithner to serve in his Cabinet as \nSecretary of the Treasury. Over the weeks since Mr. Geithner has been \nnominated, I followed closely the information regarding his background \nreviewed and discussed by members of the Senate Finance Committee. \nAdditionally, I have been hearing from Georgians who are seriously \nconcerned with the failure of Mr. Geithner to properly pay his taxes.\n  In this time--a time of such economic volatility and severe fiscal \nchallenges the likes of which we, as a nation, have not seen in \ndecades--there is no more important official or role in our Government \nother than the President himself and the Secretary of the Treasury. \nFurthermore, while facing these challenges, something our economy needs \nnow is confidence in our leaders and in Government.\n  With the critical nature of the job, with the authority over the \nInternal Revenue Service, payment of necessary taxes in the required \ntime parameters is essential.\n  I have listened to some of my colleagues who have indicated that but \nfor these extraordinary economic times, they would find Mr. Geithner's \nmistakes disqualifying of his nomination. I believe extraordinary times \ncall for extraordinary leaders, leaders who inspire and hold the \nconfidence of the American people, a Secretary who must set the highest \nstandard for the employees of the Department of Treasury and the \nInternal Revenue Service. For example, taken to its logical conclusion, \ntaxpayers must know that the Internal Revenue agent with whom they are \nmeeting has paid his or her appropriate taxes and that the agent's, \nultimately, departmental superior, the Secretary, has paid his taxes \nfully and on time.\n  A week ago today, last Monday, I was coming through the Atlanta \nairport, and a gentleman walked up to me and introduced himself.\n  He said: I am a retired Internal Revenue Service employee who was \ngoing to send you an e-mail today, and you saved me from having to send \nyou that e-mail. During my tenure at the Internal Revenue Service, I \nwas called upon to fire three separate people who committed exactly the \nsame offense as Mr. Geithner committed.\n  This is not a criminal offense, but there are certain standards that \nmust be adhered to. I know Mr. Geithner is extremely qualified. He is \nbright. I don't know what kind of replacement the President may come up \nwith in lieu of Mr. Geithner. But at this point in our history, at this \npoint as we change administrations and the people are looking to \nWashington for some clear and distinct evidence that things are going \nto be different, here we are making an exception to the rule. I simply \nthink it is not the time to make that exception.\n  Last, I would say that this weekend I spent part of my time filling \nout IRS documents relative to an employee on whom I have paid taxes for \nyears and years. Every year at this time, I fill out a schedule H, and \nI also fill out a W-2 form for that employee. I pay the taxes on that \nemployee. I am getting ready to pay them as soon as I file my tax \nreturn, exactly as I have done for decades. That is the law. That is \nwhat we are required to do.\n  When we ask the people in this country to write that check on April \n15 every year, a lot of them do not like to do it, but they do it. We \nneed for them to know that the leadership at the Department of Treasury \nis called upon and does act exactly the way they have to act.\n  Needless to say, it is troubling to me that only after Mr. Geithner \nwas nominated to this post did he realize his failure to pay his taxes \nwhile employed at the International Monetary Fund.\n  I, therefore, am standing here today to say that I am going to vote \nagainst this confirmation. Whether he is confirmed or not, I hope the \nPresident looks very closely at future nominees whom he sends to the \nSenate and insists that all of the individuals who are nominated comply \nwith appropriate laws that they know exist.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, let me join my colleague from Georgia \nfor some of the same reasons and for some reasons he did not mention. I \ndeclared some time ago that I would oppose the confirmation of Timothy \nGeithner for the position of Secretary of the Treasury.\n  First, I do not believe Mr. Geithner has been remotely candid about \nhis tax issues. I think he has been less than forthcoming about all of \nthe facts. For example, Mr. Geithner accepted compensation from his \nemployer to offset taxes when he had never paid those taxes to begin \nwith. And, having been informed about his oversight from the tax years \n2003 and 2004, he never bothered to check for 2001 or 2002.\n  Now, I can tell you I am sure he did check, but he is denying he did. \nI can tell you for the people in Oklahoma and across the country, very \nmuch like the people in Atlanta who were referred to by the Senator \nfrom Georgia, that small businesses or an individual who made an honest \nmistake on their taxes have found their Government's treatment of them \nslightly more aggressive than they have seen in their treatment of Mr. \nGeithner, a man about to lead the IRS.\n  It is one of those things that makes people so angry about their \nGovernment. The man who wants to be in charge of the IRS messed up with \nhis taxes and got a pass from the Senate. Now, for as much as we talk \nabout leveling the playing field, it sure looks as if we do not walk \nthe walk.\n  I was very proud of one of our Senators in the hearing; that is, John \nKyl. He spent a long time--he tried; I counted about 20 different ways. \nHe was trying to ask the same question to get an answer. He never got \nan answer. But he did everything he could.\n  I emphasize my objection to Timothy Geithner's nomination to head the \nTreasury Department is not just about what we have been talking about--\nhis tax problems and the tax issues. The matter which compels my coming \nto the floor is far more serious in my mind.\n  I want Senators to realize what a vote for Mr. Geithner really is. It \nis ratifying aggressive Federal Government intervention in the economy. \nIt is the flippant use of billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars to prop up \nfavored institutions and to pick winners and losers in the marketplace.\n  This has created a great uncertainty in the market, which is \nprecisely what we do not want right now. I do not criticize anyone who \nvoted in favor of the $700 billion bailout. I looked at it. I saw we \nwere giving the largest amount of money ever--you could use the word \n``authorized''--to one person, and that person being an unelected \nbureaucrat. There was no oversight responsibility from the Senate.\n  We were all criticizing Paulson. I criticized Paulson, the Secretary \nof the Treasury. But Geithner was there putting this thing together at \nthe same time. Let me say not all Federal intervention during a \nfinancial crisis is created equal. The FDIC did a good job managing the \nbiggest bank failure in U.S. history while we in Congress were all \ndebating TARP.\n  What I object to is the midnight rescue packages, the ad hoc \napproach. I object to the ``say one thing and do another thing'' type \nof programs. I object to the complete lack of any policy framework, \nexplanation of principles or coherent approach. I object to the \nabsolute lack of any transparency whatsoever. I object to the \nindifference to the taxpayers' interests. Put very simply, I object to \nthe bailout mania we have all witnessed.\n  I can remember when we did this matter, the $700 billion bailout. \nWhen I was opposed to it, I made some statements. I said: We start \nbailing people\n\n[[Page S808]]\n\nout, if that is the new policy of Government, who is going to be next \nin line? I think the airline industry; they have problems. I mentioned \neven the auto industry. Of course, we saw what happened. People got all \necstatic, even those who voted for the $700 billion bailout. They were \nall upset about the fact that we were bailing out the auto industry.\n  That amounted to 2 percent of the $700 billion. People lose sight \nwhen they hear big numbers. What I do when I am explaining it, so that \nI understand it and my 20 kids and grandkids will understand it and the \npeople of Oklahoma will understand it, I try to put it in some kind of \nperspective to see how it affects us personally.\n  If you take the total number of families in America who file tax \nreturns and divide that into $700 billion, do your own math. It comes \nout to $5,000 a family. That is huge. We have to understand we are not \ntalking about their money when we talk about Government bailouts, we \nare talking about our money; and Geithner is all a part of this.\n  It all started with Bear Stearns a year ago. The initiator of the \nBear Stearns deal was not Secretary Paulson or Chairman Bernanke, \nthough, of course, they signed off on it. It was Timothy Geithner.\n  After the deal was announced, Robert Novak reported in his column \nthat an unnamed Federal official confided in him at the time that ``we \nmay have crossed a line'' in bailing out Bear Stearns. Mr. Novak wrote \nthat it was an understatement, and that we would not know the \nramifications of this decision for a long time. Well, now we \nunderstand.\n  We are now trillions of dollars past that line, and we are beginning \nto comprehend the course on which that decision has set us. I \npersonally believe we are trillions of dollars past that line, and we \nare not much better off. I would say enough; the Government has gone \ntoo far, and under Mr. Geithner all indications are that we are not \ngoing to slow down anytime soon.\n  We need a change of course, and we need to finally, trillions of \ndollars later, find the strength to let those who made poor decisions \nbear some of the consequences, instead of the taxpayers. Timothy \nGeithner may take the helm of the Treasury Department at a time, if he \nis confirmed, when the Government has entangled itself into the economy \nto an unprecedented extent.\n  Given his strong support, stronger than by many accounts Secretary \nPaulson himself, for ad hoc bailouts of big firms, I cannot support \nthis nomination. I think those people, and I know the people I talked \nto in Oklahoma because I am back every weekend--I call this going back \nand talking to real people, and they all look at this and say: Only in \nWashington could something like this happen, could we start with the \n$700 billion bailout.\n  I would say this: Anyone who supported that at the time, if they want \nredemption, this is the time to get it because you can be redeemed by \nopposing Geithner in his confirmation. So, anyway, there are several \nreasons I hold for opposing his nomination, and I will act accordingly.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. THUNE. I thank my colleague from Oklahoma for yielding. What is \nthe present business before the Senate?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nomination of the Secretary of the \nTreasury.\n  Mr. THUNE. Thank you. That is the subject on which I wish to speak. I \nwould start by saying our country is going through some very hard \neconomic times. When you are going through hard economic times, you \nneed several things to get through. You need the resolve and the \nresilience of the American people. You need the skill, the talents, and \nthe creativity of America's best and brightest thinkers when it comes \nto solutions. You need wisdom from your political leaders. You also \nneed one other thing from your political leaders: you need the presence \nof character. You need leaders who will lead by example.\n  Unfortunately, the hard times in which we find ourselves were borne \nof excess. We spent too much, we borrowed too much, and we saved too \nlittle.\n  Corporate CEOs saw fit to pay themselves huge bonuses while running \ntheir companies into the ground. Some very clever people found ways to \ncreate new financial instruments, such as credit default swaps, making \nenormous amounts of money for themselves on every transaction while \nexposing their companies and their shareholders to trillions of dollars \nin liabilities.\n  At the same time, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were running amok, \nmaking risky home loans that helped cause this economic crisis in which \nwe now find ourselves. It is because of the excesses of the few that \nall of the American people are left holding the bag and are being \ncalled upon to clean up the mess.\n  Today we vote on whether to confirm a very smart, able, and skilled \nbusiness leader to help lead America out of the mess we are in. No one \nquestions Tim Geithner's intellect, his knowledge of financial markets, \nor his skill in managing complex business problems. He has, as many \nhave said, the type of experience that is necessary to navigate the \nturbulent waters that lie ahead. I believe he is smart. I believe he is \ntalented. I believe he is experienced. But, as I said earlier, that is \nnot enough.\n  There are lots of smart, talented, and experienced people who got us \ninto this economic mess. It will take more than smarts, talent, and \nexperience to get us out. It will take leaders who have the trust of \nthe American people because they are willing to lead by example.\n  I don't know Mr. Geithner's state of mind when he made the mistake of \nnot paying his payroll taxes between 2001 and 2004. He said it was \n``careless mistakes, avoidable mistakes.'' Perhaps so. But the one \nthing I do know is he should have known better, not just because he is \na highly educated businessman who had prior service as a top-ranking \nofficial at the Treasury Department but because he was notified several \ntimes of his tax liability by his employer at the time and even signed \ndocuments acknowledging that he owed the taxes. Again, he should have \nknown better. I don't judge Mr. Geithner as a person. None of us is \nperfect; we all make mistakes. We all need redemption. But as a \nSenator, I have a responsibility to vote. I have to vote on whether I \nbelieve Tim Geithner should serve as our next Treasury Secretary. As a \nSenator, I am concerned about the message Mr. Geithner's confirmation \nwill send to the people. As Treasury Secretary, he will oversee the IRS \nand, therefore, be tasked with enforcing our Nation's tax laws. Yet for \n4 years he failed to pay his lawful taxes after being informed of his \nobligation to do so. If I were to support this nomination, I don't know \nhow I would explain such a vote to my fellow South Dakotans who work \nhard and pay their taxes every year, on time and in full.\n  As many of my colleagues have pointed out, these are extraordinary \ntimes, and they call for extraordinary leadership. I couldn't agree \nmore. But leadership is about more than smarts; it is about more than \nskill. By all accounts, Mr. Geithner is a good man. I respect his \nwillingness to serve. I expect he will be confirmed. And when he is, he \nfaces a daunting challenge in stabilizing our financial markets and \nstrengthening our economy. Once he is confirmed, I look forward to \nworking with him to meet this challenge. I hope he is successful and we \nas a country are successful. But for the reasons I have stated, I \ncannot add my support to his nomination.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, the Senate has traditionally given the \nPresident, especially a new President, great leeway in choosing his \nCabinet. I like to follow this practice when I can, as a matter of \ngrace and in the spirit of cooperation, believing that a President has \nan understandable desire to want trusted advisors in his Cabinet who \nare sympathetic to his programs. But I also take very seriously the \noath I swore to support the U.S. Constitution and to faithfully \ndischarge the responsibility entrusted to each Senator in\n\n[[Page S809]]\n\nadvising and consenting to the appointment of all officers of the \nUnited States.\n  Some very serious questions have been raised about the President's \nnominee to be Secretary of the Treasury, Timothy Geithner, and his \nfailure to pay Social Security taxes on income he earned at the \nInternational Monetary Fund--IMF--between 2001 and 2004. According to \ndocuments released by the Senate Finance Committee, Mr. Geithner \nrecently filed amended tax returns for the years 2001-2002, 2004-2005, \nand 2006, reporting additional taxes and interest totaling $31,536. In \naddition to adjusting his claims for certain expenses and credits, Mr. \nGeithner paid Social Security taxes on income he earned at the IMF from \n2001 through 2002. This follows an audit by the IRS in 2006, when Mr. \nGeithner was required to pay Social Security taxes for income earned in \n2003 and 2004, totaling an additional $16,732 in taxes and interest. At \nthe time of the 2006 audit, Mr. Geithner chose not to pay the Social \nSecurity taxes he owed for 2001 and 2002, apparently because he had \nbeen advised that the statute of limitations had expired requiring the \npayment of those taxes.\n  I believe Mr. Geithner when he expresses regret for his failure to \npay these taxes, but that doesn't explain why the failure happened. \nThis embarrassing ``mistake'' occurred despite Mr. Geithner receiving \nannual and quarterly documents from the IMF and signing annual tax \nallowance requests that were supposed to serve as reminders about his \ntax obligations. He also failed to pay these taxes despite having \naccountants review his tax filings, and despite using software to \nprepare his tax returns. He only paid these taxes in full after being \nselected to be Treasury Secretary.\n  Had he been nominated to head almost any other position, perhaps this \nmight not seem so egregious. But this matter seriously undermines Mr. \nGeithner's credibility to be the Nation's top tax enforcement officer. \nIt suggests serious negligence on his part and creates the impression \nof someone trying to game the system. Mr. Geithner showed poor \njudgement in waiting so long to pay these taxes, and then doing so only \nbecause it became a political necessity. Certainly most American \ntaxpayers do not have that luxury.\n  Whatever his qualifications and talents for addressing the banking \nproblems that are plaguing our economy, I cannot in good conscience \nvote to confirm this nomination.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of the \nnomination of Timothy Geithner to serve as our Nation's Treasury \nSecretary. I believe most Americans, regardless of political persuasion \nor how they voted in November, would agree that we are living in \nprobably the worst economic crisis of their lifetime. You would have to \nhave been alive in the 1920s to remember days that even resemble the \nones we are in today. So this afternoon, in the moments before we are \nabout to vote on this nomination, I rise to express my views.\n  I know Tim Geithner. I wouldn't ask my colleagues to support his \nnomination because I know this person, respect and admire him and think \nhe is qualified to serve as Treasury Secretary. I am asking my \ncolleagues to support him because he is one of the most talented people \nI have met in the area of financial services and in understanding the \nregulatory architecture that not only exists today but the one that we \nmust create in order to get our country back on its feet again. While \nthere are certainly issues raised, including the one raised a moment \nago about back taxes--and I don't minimize that--it is also extremely \nimportant that we keep this nomination in perspective and that we \nunderstand the issues at hand. While I have served here for the last \nquarter of a century, I can only count on less than one hand the number \nof nominations I voted against in Democratic and Republican \nadministrations. Not because I have agreed with all of them but because \nI happen to believe that administrations that are elected deserve to \nhave the official family they choose, barring disqualifying concerns \nabout a nominee's ability to serve. To be sure, a nomination to the \nPresident's Cabinet is worthy of congratulations, and I congratulate \nMr. Geithner. But with our economic trouble so severe and our future so \nuncertain, this nomination deserves less our congratulations than our \nvery best wishes and commitment to work in partnership.\n  Mr. Geithner's arrival at Treasury could not come at a more critical \nmoment for our Nation. It comes on the heels of excessive unchecked \nfinancial practices that have brought our economy and the world's \neconomy to its knees. Next to the President himself, no single \nindividual will bear more of a responsibility to steer our Nation out \nof this crisis than the new Treasury Secretary. Charting a course of \nrecovery requires understanding the causes of the crisis in the very \nfirst instance. As chairman of the Banking Committee, I have convened \nmore than 80 hearings and markups in the last 24 months to help \ndiagnose and remedy our Nation's economic troubles. It is not a \nresponsibility I sought, nor one which I relish. Certainly, I would \nmuch rather be talking about how to grow our economy than how to save \nour economy, but that is where we are today.\n  We have an obligation, all of us, regardless of party or ideology, \nnot only to determine how we got into this situation, but also--and \nmore importantly, in many ways--what is needed to get us out of it.\n  It is by now beyond dispute that the current crisis threatening our \neconomy started several years ago in a relatively discrete corner of \nthe credit market known as subprime mortgage lending. Federal Reserve \nChairman Bernanke, previous Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson, and many \nother individuals have all agreed on that fact. There is no dispute \nabout it. Mortgage market participants from brokers to lenders to \ninvestment banks to credit rating agencies exploited millions of \nunsuspecting, hard-working Americans seeking to own or refinance a \nhome. It is clear that greed and avarice overcame sound judgment and \nprudent lending. But what makes this crisis different from others was \nthe abject failure of regulators to adequately police the markets. \nRegulators resisted the call to regulate new markets and financial \ninstruments, even when they had the tools to do so.\n  The Federal Reserve, for example, ignored a power granted by Congress \nover 14 years ago to regulate mortgage markets, State-chartered and \nfederally chartered lending institutions. Not a single regulation was \never promulgated under the Bush administration until the problem was \nwell out of hand. This wasn't a matter of there not being enough laws \non the books--quite the contrary--but, rather, a matter of regulators \nfailing to enforce the ones they had been given. What resulted was a \nregulatory failure of historic proportions.\n  Of the many lessons learned from this crisis, the most revealing is \nthat the failure to enforce consumer protections can lead to the \nfailure of the entire financial system. For decades, ideology prevented \nregulators from acknowledging this fact. It takes a crisis, \nunfortunately, of global scale to understand the dangers of failing to \nprotect consumers. It is now painfully clear that when American \nhouseholds are preyed upon in such systemic and abusive ways, our \nentire financial system is threatened. Never again should we allow \nfinancial regulators to treat consumer protection as a nuisance or of \nsecondary importance to safety and soundness regulation. Never again \nshould we permit the kind of systemic regulatory failures that allowed \nreckless lending practices to mushroom into a global credit crisis.\n  The safety and soundness of our financial system depends upon the \nwell-being of the customers and investors who use that system every \nday. Unfortunately, most of the Government actions taken in recent \nmonths have largely ignored this fact and have addressed the symptoms \nof the credit crisis rather than its root causes. For nearly 2 years \nnow, I have urged, along with others, forceful and definitive action to \nreverse the rising tide of foreclosures that began to chip away at \nAmerican households in 2007. In fact, it was exactly 2 years ago next \nweek, I had chaired the Banking Committee for only one month, when we \nheld the\n\n[[Page S810]]\n\nvery first hearings on the mortgage credit crisis, in February of 2007. \nFor 2 long years, we had hearings and meetings and countless efforts to \ntry and convince the administration of the seriousness of what was \nhappening in the residential mortgage market. Not until last summer did \nwe finally get some recognition, but it was far too late at that point.\n  All of my colleagues can recount in great detail the events that \ncascaded since July through the fall of this past year. Noted \neconomists and analysts from across the political spectrum have also \nsounded the alarm, including such distinguished individuals as former \nCarter and Reagan Fed Chairman Paul Volcker, Nobel Prize winners Joseph \nStiglitz and Paul Krugman, former Reagan chief economic adviser Martin \nFeldstein, and American Enterprise Institute Resident Fellow Alex \nPollack. These and other experts agreed that the key to our Nation's \neconomic recovery is recovery of the housing market and that the key to \nrecovery of the housing market is, of course, reducing foreclosures, of \nwhich nearly 9,000 occur every day.\n  Without addressing the cause of this crisis as swiftly, aggressively, \nand decisively as we have tackled the symptoms of the crisis, home \nprices will continue to fall. The value of assets based on mortgages--\ntrillions of dollars of which are on the books of our major financial \ninstitutions--will continue to be virtually unknowable. The longer we \nallow foreclosures to erode family wealth, tear apart neighborhoods and \nfreeze our markets, the longer our economy will take to recover from \nthis crisis. However hard our regulators work, the result will be a \ncontinuation of volatility and paralysis in our economy. If ever there \nwas a time that called for new thinking, this is that moment. As Tim \nGeithner takes the helm of the Treasury, he will be responsible for \nleading administration efforts to revitalize the credit markets and \nrestore confidence and integrity in our financial system. It is a tall \norder, to be sure. No one could assume that one individual is going to \nsolve all of this. But in my view, we can achieve these results for the \nAmerican people through four key steps.\n  First, Mr. Geithner and the rest of the administration's economic \nteam must develop and clearly communicate a long-term, comprehensive \nplan, a framework for using TARP funds to support the financial system \nand communicate effectively to the American people so they understand \nexactly where we are, how we got here, and what the intended steps are \nto move us out of it. The previous administration's piecemeal lurching \nintervention from one side to the next in the financial system \ncontributed to the confusion and the volatility that has dragged down \nconsumer and investor confidence. Outlining a clear direction as to how \nthe Government will use taxpayer money going forward would provide \nfamilies and businesses with the clarity and assurance they need to \nmake important economic decisions.\n  Second, we must safeguard the use of taxpayer money through increased \ntransparency and strengthened taxpayer protections. Instead of lending \nmoney to consumers and small businesses, TARP recipients have \neffectively been given a free pass to hoard taxpayer funds and pay \nlavish bonuses to senior executives and handsome dividends to \nshareholders. In order to provide meaningful taxpayer protection, I \nbelieve at least the following conditions are necessary: stricter \nlimits on executive compensation, additional limits on executive \ncompensation, including restricting the payment of bonuses to \nexecutives; strictly limit dividends, prohibit the payment of dividends \nto shareholders beyond de minimis amounts; establish appropriate \nlending targets for recipients of TARP funding and the means of \nmonitoring them; limit acquisitions, prohibit the use of TARP funds to \npurchase healthy institutions; increase transparency and \naccountability, require that TARP recipients submit regular reports no \nless than quarterly specifying how they are using TARP funds or \notherwise furthering the purposes of the emergency economic \nstabilization law and how they are complying with these TARP \nconditions. These reports should include information about consumer and \ncommercial loans, details about acquisitions, and the number and type \nof loan modifications. We must implement measures to prevent \nforeclosures, which I should have listed at the top of the list, \nrequire recipients of TARP funds that service or own mortgages to take \nmeasures to mitigate preventable foreclosures and use TARP funds to \nestablish or support foreclosure prevention programs.\n  The Obama administration is already committed to making these changes \nand is working on a more detailed strategy. I look forward to reviewing \nthat plan and to continuing the committee's close and detailed \noversight of the implementation of this program. That is why I intend \nto hold hearings on the TARP in the coming weeks and to ask the very \nquestions I am raising this afternoon.\n  Third in this list is to apply the same sharp and urgent focus to \nhelp individual homeowners whose plight is the root cause of this \ncrisis. Stopping foreclosures must be our top priority, putting a \ntourniquet on this hemorrhaging that is occurring across the country. \nFailing to do so will have devastating consequences for the economy.\n  Finally, to fix the failures in the regulatory system that led to \nthis crisis, if we are going to regain the confidence of investors, \nconsumers, and businesses at home and around the world, we must have \nassurances that our financial institutions are properly capitalized, \nregulated, and supervised.\n  The Senate Banking Committee has already begun an ambitious schedule \nof meetings and hearings to understand the strengths of our regulatory \nsystem and to address forcefully its weaknesses. Senator Shelby and I \nwelcome diverse parties and points of view. I am guided by several core \nprinciples: Regulators must be strong cops on the beat rather than turn \na blind eye to reckless lending practices; regulators must stop \ncompeting against each other for bank and thrift ``clients'' by \nweakening regulations; regulators must be able to identify and, if \nnecessary, take action against risks at the institutions they \nsupervise; regulators and market participants need more transparency so \nthey understand the risks present in the financial system and to \nprevent trillion-dollar markets from operating in the dark.\n  Each one of these steps--communicating a long-term plan for \nGovernment assistance, strengthening transparency and taxpayer \nprotections, preventing avoidable foreclosures, and fixing regulatory \nfailures--will help not only our economic recovery but also help \nrestore, most importantly, the confidence of the American people. You \ncannot enumerate confidence, but it is critical. I can not tell you \nexactly the mathematical formula that will get you there, but in the \nabsence of these steps, I do not believe confidence will be restored, \nand that is the intangible quality more than any other that we need to \nregain for investors and for the American people, who have been the \ndriving force for our Nation's innovation and productivity.\n  I commend Tim Geithner for taking on this extraordinary \nresponsibility. In many ways, you wonder why he is willing to do it, \nconsidering the incredible problems we face. But we are fortunate to \nhave a talented individual who is willing to step up and assume this \nresponsibility. Rather than decrying it and lambasting him, we ought to \nbe thanking him. None of us are perfect. Every one of us has made \nmistakes along the way, and to suggest that Tim Geithner is unqualified \nfor this job or should not be confirmed because of his tax issue is to \nfail to understand the value his nomination is to our country.\n  My hope is my colleagues will do what I have done over the years. I \nhave been highly criticized by people in my party. When I voted for \nJohn Ashcroft to be the Attorney General, I was highly criticized. When \nI voted for John Tower to be the Secretary of Defense, I was highly \ncriticized. But I happen to believe Presidents deserve their teams to \nbe in place to do their job.\n  Tim Geithner is the kind of individual we need. He will listen to \npeople. He will pay attention to different points of view. And he can \nmake a difference for our country. In an hour such as this, we ought \nnot to be divided in this Chamber, but to stand united, to give this \nyoung man a chance to get a job done for our Nation at one of the most \ncritical periods in our history.\n  We have a lot of work to do, and we ought to get about the business \nof\n\n[[Page S811]]\n\ndoing it, not as Democrats or Republicans but as Americans. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this nomination. At this moment, communication, \ncooperation, and consultation are not only preferable as we steer our \ncountry through these tough times, they are absolutely essential.\n  I look forward to Tim Geithner's confirmation and to working with \nhim, as I do my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, along with our \nnew President. This is a defining moment in our history, and restoring \nour economy is our defining challenge. I believe Tim Geithner is the \nright person to begin this effort.\n  Madam President, I urge the confirmation of Tim Geithner, and I yield \nthe floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, my good friend, the senior Senator from \nIowa, has allowed me to go before him, and I appreciate it. He has been \nwaiting here patiently on the floor. I have a few remarks I wish to \nmake regarding Mr. Geithner.\n  In this time of economic crisis, I want to add my strong support for \nPresident Barack Obama's nominee for Secretary of Treasury, Timothy \nGeithner.\n  In the past month, some of our country's largest corporations have \nannounced major layoffs numbering in the hundreds of thousands. On the \nnews this morning, major layoffs have been announced throughout \nAmerica. Today, it is hard to comprehend, but the Nevada Department of \nEmployment reported unemployment in the State has jumped to 9.1 \npercent. The foreclosure crisis has not eased. The credit crunch \npersists. Uncertainty continues to reign on Wall Street, draining \npension funds and individual investors of their savings and blocking \nthe flow of credit for families and businesses that need it so badly.\n  This powerful economic storm that we have never seen before demands \nstrong, decisive, and wise leadership. No one, in my opinion, is more \nqualified or prepared for the task than Tim Geithner. He has spent his \nentire career as a public servant. He has worked at the Treasury \nDepartment, the International Monetary Fund, and the Federal Reserve \nBank of New York. With his experience and expertise, Tim Geithner could \nhave written his own financial ticket to the private sector anytime of \nhis choosing and made huge amounts of money. But in an age that has \nbeen tarnished by corporate greed, I think it is refreshing--and we \nshould all feel that way--to see a man of obvious gifts choose to lead \na life of public service. Has he made mistakes? He acknowledged that. \nWere there mistakes he made that any one of us could have made? Of \ncourse.\n  He was part of the core team that designed the Government's response \nto the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, as well as the current \ncrisis. At the New York Fed, he worked with Secretary Paulson and \nChairman Bernanke. He has seen the crisis unfold, as well as the \ninitial Bush administrations's response. I think he is uniquely suited \nto know the difference between what has worked and what has failed. \nSome has worked and a lot has failed.\n  During his confirmation hearings and in meetings with Members in \nrecent weeks, Tim Geithner has shown a calm temperament and an \neagerness to listen and cooperate with Congress. He clearly recognizes \nthat Congress is an equal partner and that it will take a unified \neffort to right our economy. Just as important, he understands that \npart of what we face is a crisis of confidence and that the public's \nconfidence cannot be restored without transparency, oversight, and \ntaxpayer protections.\n  There are few who envy the road ahead for the next Treasury \nSecretary. There will be no easy fixes or cheap answers, but no one is \nbetter prepared today than Tim Geithner to fill this critical role.\n  This nominee has my support, and once he is confirmed, I expect him \nto have the support of Congress in the difficult months and years \nahead. I hope the support and I am confident the support will come from \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle. There are some who may \nchoose not to vote for him, but I would hope that after this \nconfirmation takes place, we will all join to help this good man try to \nbring our country back to financial security once again.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, thank you. For at least as long as \nChairman Baucus and I have served as the leaders of the Finance \nCommittee, and certainly during those times I was chairman, all \nindividuals nominated by the President who were subject to the \njurisdiction of the Finance Committee have been subject to a thorough \nand nonpartisan vetting process. In addition to filling out a detailed \ncommittee questionnaire, all nominees submit tax returns and the \ncommittee is provided with financial disclosures. The review of these \ndocuments has nothing to do with the nominee's political affiliation or \npolicy goals.\n\n  The Finance Committee's nomination process is there to ensure basic \ncompliance with the law and to confirm that these individuals can be \ntrusted with the incredible responsibilities that come with public \nservice.\n  My vote on this nominee will be a vote of confidence in the Finance \nCommittee's vetting process; it is a vote for the importance of \ncharacter and integrity in those who serve; and, specifically, it is a \nvote for treating Presidential nominees, and all people, in a \nconsistent manner.\n  This nominee is not the first nominee to run aground on the Finance \nCommittee's vetting process. There are other individuals who, after \nlengthy discussions with Senator Baucus, me, and committee staff, \ndecided to withdraw from consideration.\n  In these situations, the Finance Committee keeps details learned \nduring the vetting process private. In cases where the nominee decides \nto go forward, such as that of this nominee, the committee makes \ndetails public in the interest of transparency and good government. I \nbelieve the public's business ought to be public. Sometimes when \ndetails are disclosed the nominee is confirmed and sometimes the \nnominee is not confirmed. In these situations, Members have to judge \nthe seriousness of the issues at hand, and the nominees have to judge \nhow far they are willing to go. Consequently, if the nominee decides to \nmove ahead, the information will be released.\n  However, in the past, nominees who had tax issues as serious as this \nnominee's, and some who have had less serious issues, have not attained \nSenate confirmation.\n  I feel it is improper to judge this nominee by a different standard. \nI realize that economic times are tough right now, but, if anything, \nthat should be an incentive for us to raise our standards and not lower \nthem.\n  Finally, I believe we also need to treat all people in a consistent \nmanner. The same Internal Revenue Code applies to everyone regardless \nof whether someone is a well-known Wall Streeter or a student earning \nminimum wage. Many people around the country who have not satisfied \ntheir tax obligations have been caught by the IRS, as this nominee was \nfor tax years 2003 and 2004. Many people end up having their houses \nseized, bank accounts frozen, and other assets taken by the Government \nto pay their tax debts. Some people even go to jail.\n  There are many people who settle their liabilities without going to \njail or having assets seized, but can this system operate with \nintegrity if all parts of it report to someone who was unable for a \nlong period of time to meet his own tax obligations and only did so as \na condition of his nomination?\n  Finally, I want to mention differences of perception of different \npeople who have been found to have unsettled tax liabilities. During \nlast year's Presidential campaign, we read a lot about a man named Joe \nthe Plumber who hailed from Ohio. When this man was found to have a tax \nlien for State taxes, some portrayed it as evidence that his opinions \non national tax policy were irrelevant. However, this nominee's tax \nproblems have been revealed to be much larger than Joe's, and this \nnominee's defenders still insist he is the only man for the job of \nTreasury Secretary.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that an article discussing \nthis inconsistency by Jonah Goldberg appearing in National Review \nOnline be printed in the Record.\n\n[[Page S812]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the National Review Online, Jan. 23, 2009]\n\n                 A Free Pass for the Indispensable Man\n\n                          (By Jonah Goldberg)\n\n       During the hothouse days of the presidential campaign, Joe \n     Wurzelbacher became famous because he got Barack Obama to \n     confess that he likes to spread the wealth around. Better \n     known as Joe the Plumber, the Toledo, Ohio, laborer became \n     the target of bottomless venom and scorn because he seemed \n     like an obstacle to Obama's coronation.\n       One of the main talking points, particularly among left-\n     wing bloggers, was that Wurzelbacher was a tax cheat because, \n     it was revealed by ABC News, he had a tax lien of $1,182 for \n     back Ohio state taxes. This fueled the argument that he was a \n     fraud, his opinion didn't matter. Nothing to see here, folks. \n     Move along.\n       Fast-forward to today. Timothy Geithner, President Obama's \n     choice to be the next treasury secretary, quite clearly tried \n     to defraud the government of tens of thousands in payroll \n     taxes while working at the International Monetary Fund. The \n     IMF does not withhold such taxes but does compensate American \n     employees who must pay them out of pocket. Geithner took the \n     compensation--which involves considerable paperwork--but then \n     simply pocketed the money.\n       His explanations for his alleged oversight don't pass the \n     smell test. When the IRS busted him for his mistakes in 2003 \n     and 2004, he decided to take advantage of the statute of \n     limitations and not pay the thousands of dollars he also \n     failed to pay in 2001 and 2002. That is, until he was \n     nominated to become treasury secretary.\n       Obama defends Geithner, saying that his was a ``common \n     mistake,'' that it is embarrassing but happens all the time. \n     My National Review colleague Byron York reports that, at \n     least according to the IMF, Geithner's ``mistakes'' are \n     actually quite rare. Indeed, it's almost impossible to \n     believe that the man didn't know exactly what he was doing \n     given that he would have had to sign documents, disregard \n     warnings, and all in all turn his brain off to make the same \n     ``mistake'' year after year. And keep in mind, Geithner is \n     supposed to run the IRS. So maybe sloppiness isn't that great \n     a defense anyway.\n       The bulk of Senate Republicans seem willing to green-light \n     his appointment because, in the words of many, ``he's too big \n     to fail.'' Wall Street likes this guy and so does Obama. So, \n     who cares if he breaks and bends the rules? Who cares that he \n     took a child-care tax credit to send his kids to summer camp? \n     He's the right man for the job, no one else can do it, he's \n     the financial industry's man of the moment.\n       This strikes me as both offensively hypocritical and \n     absurd. Obama has made much of Wall Street greed. He and his \n     vice president talk about paying taxes like it is a holy \n     sacrament. They both belittled Wurzelbacher for daring to \n     suggest that the Democratic Party isn't much concerned with \n     how the little guy can get ahead.\n       Heck, Obama and pretty much the entire Democratic party \n     insist that they speak for the little guy. But it appears \n     they fight for the big guys.\n       You would think this is a perfect moment for Republicans to \n     stand on principle, particularly since their votes aren't \n     needed to confirm Geithner. What they will tell you is that \n     Geithner is the indispensable man and, in the words of South \n     Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham, ``These are not the times to \n     think in small political terms.''\n       Never mind that there's nothing small about the belief that \n     paying taxes in an honest fashion is a minimal requirement \n     for the job of treasury secretary. What's absurd is that \n     Geithner, who helped regulate Wall Street as head of the New \n     York Fed, is the indispensable man now. He may indeed be \n     qualified to be treasury secretary, but is he really the only \n     man who can do the job? Really? Everyone said the same thing \n     about Hank Paulson not long ago. How'd that work out?\n       I thought the Democrats believed the financial implosion \n     was caused by arrogant and greedy men who thought the rules \n     didn't apply to them because they were so important. I guess \n     they didn't mean it.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I don't make this decision lightly, but, as I have \nsaid, I must uphold the Finance Committee's vetting process; I must \nvote for the importance of character and integrity in those who serve \nin government; and I must vote for treating Presidential nominees, and \nall people, in a consistent manner. Therefore, I must vote against this \nnominee, Mr. Geithner.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask to be notified after 5 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will so notify you.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I don't look forward to criticizing \nthe nominee, Mr. Geithner, for the Secretary of the Treasury. It is not \nsomething I take any pleasure in. I will vote for 98 percent of the \nnominees of President Obama. I believe he is entitled to select good \nnominees to serve, and he gets to basically choose whomever he wants.\n  I would say the American people are unhappy. They are unhappy about \nWall Street. They are unhappy about the way this financial system has \nbeen conducted, and one of the individuals at the very center of it is \nMr. Geithner, the nominee to be the Secretary of the Treasury, a \nposition that now has incredible authority and the power to distribute \n$350 billion virtually any way that individual citizen wants to spend \nit. It was a mistake for Congress ever to give that kind of power to \nMr. Paulson or to Mr. Geithner or whomever the Secretary of the \nTreasury would be.\n  Let me say quickly, as a former Federal prosecutor, I am not taken in \nby the idea that this tax problem is a minor matter. The Secretary of \nthe Treasury supervises every Internal Revenue agent in America. The \nTreasury Department has the IRS inside it.\n  The International Monetary Fund, for which he worked starting in \n2001, sent out this brochure about the tax allowance system that says: \nThe Fund pays the difference between your U.S. self-employment tax, \nwhich is the Social Security tax that self-employed citizens pay. You \npay the employee's share of the Social Security taxes as you would be \nrequired to do if you worked for any U.S. employer.\n  Then it says down here: And a tax allowance is added to help cover \nthe income taxes you owe.\n  You get a special tax allowance. How do you get this tax allowance if \nyou work for the International Monetary Fund? You make an application. \nThe form says: Tax allowance application. You apply for it. You sign at \nthe bottom that says you want the money. What does it say that you \ncertify above your signature? You certify that I will pay taxes on my \nFund income. I authorize the Fund of individual staff members \ndesignated by it for the purpose to ascertain from the appropriate tax \nauthorities whether tax returns were received. I hereby certify that \nall the information contained herein is true to the best of my \nknowledge and belief and that I will pay the taxes for which I have \nreceived tax allowance payments from the Fund.\n  So he seeks a tax allowance application. He certified that any money \nhe gets for this he understands is for tax purposes, and he will pay \nit. That is the certification form. I have blown it up on this chart. \nIt says, again, I certify I will pay the taxes for which I have \nreceived the tax allowance.\n  Now, that was done four times. He personally signed it. That is his \nsignature at the bottom, with his room number, in his hand, and his \nphone number, in his hand--4 different years.\n  I see Senator Kyl, and I will yield to him because I am sorry we \ndon't have much time. In his examination, Mr. Geithner left me with a \nfeeling that he was not candid.\n  Finally, let me say this. I believe the American people want a \nSecretary of the Treasury who was not in the middle of the problem in \nNew York as head of the Federal Reserve Bank when it occurred and who \ngave no warning to the American people whatsoever that this was about \nto happen. The Wall Street Journal recently had six investment experts \non the front page who predicted this would occur. Where was Mr. \nGeithner? The same place as Mr. Paulson: asleep at the switch. Based on \nmerit, I don't believe this is what the American people want. The \nAmerican people desire to have a professional of knowledge, an \neconomically trained person with financial experience and impeccable \nintegrity. I am sad to say, I don't believe Mr. Geithner meets that \nstandard.\n  I thank the Chair and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Iowa for allowing \nme to speak very briefly. I had intended to support Mr. Geithner's \nnomination. He\n\n[[Page S813]]\n\nis not the only person who can do this job, but he is the President's \nchoice and is entitled to some deference and I actually believe he will \ngive the President some good advice.\n  However, there must be an element of trust between us, based on \ncandor and forthrightness. Secretary Paulson and I trusted each other \nand it benefited both of us for the benefit of the American people, I \nbelieve. Unfortunately, Mr. Geithner, in his appearance before the \nFinance Committee, I believe did not demonstrate the requisite candor \nin answer to our questions. As a result, I therefore regret I cannot \nsupport his confirmation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I regret to say I will be voting against \nthe nomination of Timothy F. Geithner to serve as Treasury Secretary in \nthe new Obama administration. I say ``regret'' because I believe \nstrongly that, save extraordinary circumstances, any President should \nhave the right to select his own team and because I believe Mr. \nGeithner is a person of obvious talent and experience. I certainly bear \nno ill will toward him on a personal basis whatsoever. Moreover, I know \nPresident Obama believes Mr. Geithner is the best person for the job, \nand it pains me to go against the President's wishes on this \nmatter. However, after careful deliberation, I simply have not been \nable to overcome my very serious reservations about this nominee.\n\n  As Treasury Secretary, Mr. Geithner would oversee the Internal \nRevenue Service and would be responsible for ensuring that Americans \npay their taxes as required by law. Yet it has come to light that while \nhe was serving as a senior official at the International Monetary Fund, \nMr. Geithner failed to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes. He has \nstated this was an innocent mistake and that there was no intent to \ndeliberately avoid paying the required taxes.\n  However, the IMF informs us that in order to avoid exactly this kind \nof situation, its U.S. citizen employees are fully informed of their \nobligation to pay Social Security and Medicare taxes and must sign a \nform acknowledging that they understand this obligation.\n  Moreover, the IMF gives its U.S. citizen employees quarterly wage \nstatements that detail their U.S. tax liabilities. The IMF pays its \nU.S. citizen employees an amount equal to the employer's half of the \npayroll taxes with the expectation that the individual will use that \nmoney to pay the IRS.\n  So a serious question is raised as to how a person of Mr. Geithner's \nfinancial sophistication could run the gauntlet of these many warnings \nand quarterly reminders and still somehow innocently overlook his \nobligation to pay these payroll taxes.\n  I am also troubled by the fact that when the IRS audited Mr. Geithner \nin 2006 and discovered that he had not paid his payroll taxes from 2001 \nto 2004, he, Mr. Geithner, repaid the taxes only for 2003 and 2004. \nAfter that audit, he chose not to repay the taxes for 2001 and 2002, \nyears for which the statute of limitations had expired.\n  Surely, if the failure to pay the payroll tax was an innocent mistake \nand oversight, then Mr. Geithner would have been eager to make amends \nby willingly paying the payroll taxes for 2001 and 2002, regardless of \nthe statute of limitations. But he chose not to do so until he learned \nhe was going to be nominated for Treasury Secretary.\n  Given this record of failing to pay taxes, if confirmed as Treasury \nSecretary, how could Mr. Geithner speak with any credibility or \nauthority as the Nation's chief tax enforcer? Would his admonition be: \nDo as I say, not as I do? That is not acceptable.\n  Unfortunately, on another point, Mr. Geithner has been equally \nunwilling to accept responsibility with regard to his role in the \ncurrent financial meltdown. As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of \nNew York, Mr. Geithner was a key regulator of the large, mostly New \nYork-based financial institutions that have been at the center of this \nmeltdown. Their reckless practices--reckless practices--have brought \nAmerica's financial system to its knees, pitching our economy into what \ncould be the longest, deepest recession since the Great Depression.\n  I am specifically concerned about Mr. Geithner's history vis-a-vis \nCitigroup, which has now received $52 billion in taxpayer money. As a \nregulator of Citigroup, Mr. Geithner made a number of troubling \ndecisions that relaxed oversight of Citigroup, including, one, lifting \na prohibition against Citigroup's acquiring new firms; second, ending \nthe requirement that Citigroup file quarterly risk management reports; \nand third, allowing Citigroup to use ``hybrid capital,'' which, I might \nparenthetically say, was a product of the Greenspan Fed back in 1996--\nusing hybrid capital to prop up its capital base. These decisions \nallowed Citigroup to increase its already sizable risks and allow \nCitigroup to claim that it had a healthier capital ratio.\n  I am troubled that instead of taking enforcement actions in the face \nof a weakened capital ratio, Mr. Geithner chose only to write a letter \nto Citigroup criticizing its risk management practices. I bet they \nshuddered when they got that letter.\n  Given this action, it is clear that Mr. Geithner was aware that \nCitigroup's capital base was not sufficient. Yet he did not take the \nappropriate steps to correct this glaring problem; he wrote a letter.\n  While I would be much more supportive of the nominee if he had taken \nresponsibility for these failed decisions, he has not done so. For \nexample, in a written response to questions from Senate Finance \nCommittee Chairman Baucus, Mr. Geithner wrote:\n\n       Citigroup's supervisors, including the Federal Reserve, \n     failed to identify a number of their risk management \n     shortcomings and to induce appropriate changes in behavior.\n\n  He says Citigroup's supervisors, including the Federal Reserve, \nfailed. Why didn't he say ``I''? Why didn't he say Citigroup's \nsupervisors, including me as the head of the New York Federal Reserve \nBank, I did, I failed to identify those risk shortcomings, and I failed \nto induce a change in their behavior? He says it is the Fed. He was the \nhead, he was the person making those decisions. And yet he kind of \nbrushed his hands and said: That was the Fed. No, Mr. Geithner, it was \nyou.\n  We need to know what specific failures occurred under his \nsupervision, what he has learned from those failures, and how the \nnominee believes he can correct them in the future. After all, again, \nMr. Geithner was the key decisionmaker in the Federal Reserve on these \npoints.\n  Without the answers to these questions, I am not convinced that Mr. \nGeithner is the right person to lead the Treasury Department at a time \nwhen we need a strong regulator in charge, one who will act with \ntransparency and accountability and forcefulness.\n  I am sure these big bankers and these Wall Street people are nice \npeople, but they are tough and they are going to protect their turf. \nYet what they don't need is a Treasury Secretary who is going to write \nthem a letter. We need a Treasury Secretary who will start banging some \nheads around and will stick up for our small bankers, our independent \nbankers, the people in your State, Madam President, and mine who are \nout there loaning the money for small businesses and small business \nexpansion, who are getting mortgages on houses that have 30-year fixed \nrates, they are conservative about it. We don't need to focus all of \nour efforts and money on the big city banks and then allowing the big \ncity banks to get bigger by buying up other banks with taxpayer money.\n  I want a Treasury Secretary, as I say, who is going to start banging \nsome heads, who is going to call in these big city bankers and say: You \nknow what, you have had a free ride for many years. We have deregulated \nyou. We deregulated all these financial institutions. We have allowed \nyou to engage in what I call--this is my own term--``casino \ncapitalism.'' But it is over. It is over. You are now going to be \nregulated, and I am going to lead the charge in imposing stiff new \nregulations. We are going to be looking over your shoulder, and we are \ngoing to make sure you are accountable to the taxpayers of this \ncountry.\n  The issues of responsibility and judgment are extremely important as \nwe go forward. Two weeks ago, I voted in favor of releasing the second \ninstallment of the TARP funding, but it was after several phone calls \nwith now-Vice President Biden when he assured me--and I spoke about \nthis on the floor; he\n\n[[Page S814]]\n\nsaid I could say it publicly--that President Obama will sign off \npersonally on any significant future disbursement of TARP money and \nVice President Biden will be consulted and be a part of it.\n  So now at least we know where the buck stops with President Obama. I \nam glad he is willing to say the buck does stop there. Yet here is what \nbothers me. If Mr. Geithner is confirmed, he will be the principal \nperson making recommendations to President Obama regarding TARP \nexpenditures. In short, President Obama will sign off on future \ndisbursements, but he would do so on the recommendation and judgment of \nMr. Geithner.\n  I wonder, I really wonder what that means for some of these big city \nbanks in New York and what is going to happen with Wall Street and what \nis going to happen to my small banks in Iowa or independent banks all \nover this country. What is going to happen to our farmers who need an \nadequate supply of low-cost capital coming up this spring. And they are \nhaving a hard time finding it, by the way. They are in a terrible cost-\nprice squeeze right now.\n  Is all that TARP money going to be focused on the big banks or are we \ngoing to start thinking about the little guy out there?\n  Mr. Geithner made serious errors of judgment in failing to pay his \ntaxes. He made serious errors in his job as chief regulator of the \nfinancial institutions at the heart of our current crisis. So at this \npoint, I cannot vote to promote Mr. Geithner to the all-important post \nof Treasury Secretary. I cannot do so at this time.\n  As I told Mr. Geithner on the phone, I bear him no ill will. I do not \nknow him personally. I have friends who say he is a very nice person, \nand I am sure he is. But I wonder, again, about his approach. As I told \nMr. Geithner on the phone, I hope I can come back to the floor a year \nfrom now, 2 years from now and say my vote against him was wrong. I \nhope I can do that, but I will have to be shown.\n  There is no question Mr. Geithner will be confirmed by an \noverwhelming vote in the Senate. As I said, I bear him no ill will \npersonally or anything else. I wish him every success as Treasury \nSecretary. To repeat what I said, nothing would make me happier than \nfor Mr. Geithner to prove me wrong by serving with distinction as \nTreasury Secretary and cracking down on some of this casino capitalism \nthat is going on in this country. I will be joining those rooting for \nhis success.\n  Mr. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise today to state my opposition to \nthe confirmation of Timothy Geithner to be Treasury Secretary.\n  Our current economic crisis is, in part, a crisis of confidence. If \nwe are to return to prosperity, the American people must have \nconfidence in those who would chart our course. Mr. Geithner's \nprofessional background and experience should inspire that confidence. \nThey are overshadowed, however, by the personal issues regarding his \nown tax returns.\n  When these issues first arose, they were cited as examples of the \nbaffling complexity of our Tax Code and of the need for reform. They \nwere described by the nominee himself as ``careless mistakes.'' As more \ndetails have emerged, it has become clear to me that this is not merely \na matter of complexity leading to mistakes, but of inexcusable \nnegligence.\n  Mr. Geithner failed to pay self-employment taxes while working for \nthe International Monetary Fund. He failed to make these tax payments \ndespite the fact that the IMF repeatedly reminded him of this \nobligation. He signed paperwork acknowledging this obligation. He \nreceived extra compensation that he acknowledged at the time was for \nthe purpose of paying this obligation. Yet when he filed tax returns \nfor the years he was employed at the IMF, he did not pay self-\nemployment taxes.\n  After working for the IMF for 3 years, Mr. Geithner was audited by \nthe Internal Revenue Service in 2006, which discovered that he had \nfailed to pay his self-employment taxes. Mr. Geithner was ordered to \ncorrect his tax returns for 2003 and 2004, and he paid the amount that \nhe owed for those years.\n  But Mr. Geithner had made the same omission in 2001 and 2002, years \nthat were outside the scope of the audit. Yet, having been informed by \nthe IRS of his omission for 2003 and 2004, Mr. Geithner took no action \nto correct the deficiency from 2001 and 2002--years for which the \nstatute of limitations had already run. In fact, Mr. Geithner chose not \nto make the payments until he was being considered for this position at \nthe end of 2008.\n  A similar failure to correct omissions when informed of them occurred \nwhen the accountant who prepared Mr. Geithner's tax returns in 2006 \ninformed him that certain deductions Mr. Geithner had taken for 3 \nearlier years were not allowed. These deductions involved writing off \novernight camps as childcare expenses. Mr. Geithner did not attempt to \nclaim the deduction for 2006 but did not correct his returns for the \nprevious years. And again, this deficiency was not addressed until late \nlast year, when Mr. Geithner was being considered for this Cabinet \nposition.\n  Madam President, throughout the State of Maine and indeed throughout \nthe Nation, millions of hard-working Americans pay their taxes on time \nand in full. Our taxation system is essentially an honor system that \ndepends on self-assessment and honesty. When taxpayers make mistakes, \nthey are expected to correct them promptly and completely. How can we \ntell the taxpayers that they are expected to comply fully with our tax \nlaws when these laws have been treated so cavalierly by the person who \nwould lead the Treasury Department and, ultimately, the Internal \nRevenue Service, when he was applying them to himself?\n  Therefore, Madam President, I must oppose this nomination.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Madam President, I regret that I must oppose the \nnomination of Timothy Geithner to be the next Secretary of the \nTreasury. I assure my colleagues, I did not reach this decision lightly \nbut, rather after much thoughtful consideration. Next to the \nconfirmation of Supreme Court Justices, the Senate has no more \nimportant duty than the confirmation of members of the President's \nCabinet. Throughout my time in this body I have held the view that \nelections have consequences and that--barring any extraordinary \ncircumstance--the President should be free to pick his team and \nsurround himself with those he feels can best assist him in attaining \nhis goals.\n  Mr. Geithner's involvement in the failed policies behind the misuse \nof hundreds of billions of taxpayer dollars in the Troubled Asset \nRelief Fund, TARP, has led me to conclude that an extraordinary \ncircumstance exists in this situation. Mr. Geithner played a critical \nrole in the creation of the TARP and should be held accountable for the \nfact that it has been terribly mismanaged and has not achieved its \nintended results. Unfortunately, I have come to believe that Mr. \nGeithner lacks the critical judgment necessary to be an effective \nTreasury Secretary and careful steward of taxpayer dollars.\n  To properly weigh a potential Cabinet member's qualifications, it is \nimportant to pay close attention to the committee hearings held to \nconsider the nomination and the views expressed by both the nominee and \nmembers of the committee. After Mr. Geithner's testimony before the \nSenate Finance Committee, a very well-respected member of the committee \nstated that ``I don't believe that the requisite candor exists for me \nto indicate my support for him with an affirmative vote.'' Another \nmember of the committee stated that, ``Mr. Geithner has been involved \nin just about every flawed bailout action of the previous \nadministration. He was the front-line regulator in New York when all \nthe innovations that recently have brought our markets to their knees \nbecame widespread. . . . All those actions, or failures to act, raise \nquestions about the nominee's judgment.'' I fully agree with my \ncolleagues' sentiments.\n  I am deeply troubled by Mr. Geithner's role in the mismanagement of \nthe TARP. He has enthusiastically supported failed policies that have \ncost the taxpayer hundreds of billions of dollars. Earlier this month, \nI voted with 41 of my colleagues in opposition to releasing the \nremaining $350 billion TARP funds because I had seen no evidence that \nthe additional and substantial taxpayers' money would be used for its \nintended purpose. TARP was created to allow the Treasury Department to \npurchase up to $700 billion in ``toxic assets'' from financial \ninstitutions in order to help homeowners facing foreclosure and to \nstimulate the\n\n[[Page S815]]\n\neconomy. The misuse of the first $350 billion of TARP funds combined \nwith the lack of transparency promised by the Treasury Department were \nreasons enough to oppose releasing additional funds. It is my strong \nopinion that no further TARP funds should be released until we are able \nto impose strict standards of accountability and ensure that the money \nis spent only as intended by Congress--to purchase mortgage-backed \nsecurities and other troubled assets.\n  Unfortunately, I have seen no evidence that Mr. Geithner shares that \nview. He has stated that more oversight and transparency are necessary \nbut to date he has offered no specifics about how the remaining $350 \nbillion in TARP money would be spent and has laid out no criteria for \nserious oversight and accountability of such substantial sums of \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  With no regard for congressional intent, and with the support of Mr. \nGeithner, the Treasury Department has used TARP funds to prop up the \nbanking industry and to guarantee securities backed by student loans \nand credit card debt. But most troubling to me has been the use of TARP \nfunds to help bail out the domestic auto industry--in direct defiance \nof Congress. Last month, after extensive discussion and debate, the \nSenate rejected a plan to pump billions of Federal dollars into the \ndomestic auto industry because we saw no evidence of serious \nconcessions from the industry and no assurance of the domestic auto \nmanufacturers' long-term viability. When asked about the use of TARP \nfunds to further assist the domestic auto industry, Mr. Geithner \nindicated he would support further funding as long as it was \naccompanied by ``a comprehensive restructuring'' of the auto industry. \nAgain--he offered no specifics.\n  Madam President, the American people can no longer afford ambiguous \nassurances of transparency, accountability, and reform. They need and \nwant specifics and particulars--and the person leading the U.S. \nTreasury should be able to provide the American taxpayer with the \ndetails they seek.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Madam President, I will vote against the nomination of \nTimothy Geithner to be the next Secretary of the Treasury. I do so with \nsome reluctance. President Obama, like any other President, is entitled \nto have the Cabinet he wants, barring a serious disqualifying issue. \nAnd Mr. Geithner is a very able nominee in many ways. Mr. Geithner is \nclearly a smart, capable individual, with the qualifications to be \nTreasury Secretary, and he has a host of distinguished individuals \nattesting to those facts.\n  While I am troubled by Mr. Geithner's track record on the issues that \nhave contributed to the credit market crisis, I do not base my vote on \nwhat is, to a certain extent, a matter of policy disagreement. During \nthe last year of the Clinton administration, Mr. Geithner reportedly \nparticipated in the Treasury Department's support for the elimination \nof the Glass-Steagall Act protections which had served to keep our \nbanking system stable since the Great Depression, as well as the \nDepartment's opposition to the regulation of derivatives, the explosive \nfinancial instruments that helped trigger the financial market \ncontagion. It those reports are accurate, Mr. Geithner's actions were \nnot singular by any means. Indeed, while I opposed both moves, they \neach had broad bipartisan support in the House and Senate.\n  His more recent work as President of the New York Federal Reserve \nBank also raises serious questions. At a minimum, he was one of the \nprimary regulators of some of the largest financial institutions in the \ncountry at a time when their activities greatly contributed to the \neventual meltdown of the credit markets.\n  As I have noted in the past, I give any President great deference \nwith respect to his executive branch nominees, and the greatest \ndeference regarding Cabinet appointments, even when I may have \nsignificant policy differences with the nominee. The matters \nsurrounding the credit crisis largely fall into this category.\n  Mr. Geithner's tax liability is a different matter, however. I am \ndeeply troubled by his failure to pay the payroll taxes he owed, \ndespite repeated alerts from his employer at the time, the \nInternational Monetary Fund, that he was responsible for paying those \ntaxes. It is especially troubling because Mr. Geithner signed documents \nat the IMF promising to pay taxes, including the payroll taxes, in \nexchange for a special ``gross-up'' of his income intended to offset \nthe cost of those taxes. Moreover, his earlier interactions with the \nInternal Revenue Service over his failure to pay sufficient payroll \ntaxes for his household employees make Mr. Geithner's explanations of \nhis failure to pay his own payroll taxes even less satisfactory.\n  The failure to comply with our Nation's tax laws would be problematic \nfor any Cabinet nominee, but it is especially disturbing when it \ninvolves the individual who will be charged with overseeing the \nenforcement of our tax laws. Mr. President, surely that individual must \nmeet a higher standard than a failure to establish they deliberately \nevaded their tax liability.\n  With the condition the economy is in today, and the state of our \ncountry's financial institutions, the stakes could not be greater for \nthe next Treasury Secretary. And despite his failure to comply with the \ntax laws, the seriousness of our economic challenges may be the reason \nMr. Geithner is confirmed. Indeed, that seems to be likely.\n  If he is confirmed, Mr. Geithner will be asked to oversee not only a \nfaltering economy but also the rehabilitation of our financial markets. \nNo Treasury Secretary has faced bigger challenges. I hope that if he \nbecomes our next Secretary of the Treasury Mr. Geithner will be a bit \nhumbled by his missteps, policy, and otherwise, and will revisit the \npositions he took when he was in the Clinton Treasury Department in \nlight of the subsequent damage they did to our financial markets, as \nwell as his actions or lack of action as President of the Federal \nReserve.\n  Given the enormous challenges he will face and the great talent he \nappears to have Timothy Geithner has the ability to be a truly great \npublic servant. I hope he will live up to that potential.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I rise today to speak on the nomination \nof Timothy Geithner to be Secretary of the Treasury.\n  The next Treasury Secretary will face unprecedented challenges as the \nUnited States continues to deal with the greatest economic and \nfinancial crises since the Great Depression. Not only must the new \nSecretary oversee an economic recovery at a time when enormous Federal \ndeficits threaten our country's long-term economic outlook, he will \nhave responsibility over the $700 billion Troubled Assets Rescue \nProgram, TARP, to assist struggling homeowners and revitalize our \ncapital markets.\n  While I was extremely disappointed in Mr. Geithner's failure to pay \nhis taxes in a timely manner, I believe that first and foremost we need \na Treasury Secretary who is eminently qualified to help steer the \ncountry through this difficult period. In my opinion, Mr. Geithner's \nbackground as President and chief executive officer of the Federal \nReserve Bank of New York and his previous experience at the Treasury \nDepartment has prepared him for this important position.\n  I have many problems with the ways in which the Treasury Department \nunder the previous administration used the TARP funding. After a series \nof fits and starts, it shifted the intended focus of the program from \nhomeowner relief to financial stabilization. In addition, there have \nbeen widespread reports of companies receiving funds and continuing to \npay executive bonuses and dividends. Clearly, the Treasury Department \nhas not been as transparent as it should be in detailing how these \nfunds have been spent.\n  I have reviewed Mr. Geithner's testimony before the Finance Committee \ncarefully, and I was pleased to see that he intends to reform the TARP \nto be more accountable and transparent--and to be more in line with the \noriginal intent of alleviating the housing crisis. Proper \nadministration and accounting of the TARP funds is essential for \nhelping facilitate an economic recovery. I expect Mr. Geithner to \nfollow through on these important policy changes on how the TARP \nfunding is distributed in the future.\n  Thus, after weighing all of the various factors, I intend to vote in \nfavor of Mr. Geithner's nomination today. And I wish him well as he \nundertakes this significant endeavor.\n\n[[Page S816]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I will vote to confirm Timothy Geithner \nas Secretary of the Treasury. I do so with reluctance because of his \ntax history. For me, this vote is a very close call.\n  Quite simply, I find his failure to pay self-employment taxes \ncompletely unacceptable. I am a former tax commissioner. I have dealt \nwith hundreds of cases like this one. And in normal times, that alone \nwould lead me to oppose his confirmation.\n  But these are not normal times. Our country faces the greatest \neconomic and financial crisis since the Great Depression. I personally \ndon't think we can afford a further delay in filling this critically \nimportant position. I think we are not anywhere near out of the woods, \nthat very serious days lie ahead of us, and that it is absolutely \nimperative that we get a Treasury Secretary in place. And Mr. Geithner \ndoes have the background to contribute to solving this crisis. For \nthese reasons, I will support his confirmation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise with respect to the nomination of \nTimothy Geithner for Secretary of the Treasury.\n  This nomination comes at a tumultuous and precarious time, as our \nNation's economy remains in the throes of an accelerating downturn--\nfinancial markets have fallen precipitously and are threatening the \nretirement security of millions of Americans, credit markets are still \nfailing to function normally, and the budget deficit regrettably is \npoised to reach record heights. And so, as Mr. Geithner well \nunderstands, this nomination could not arrive at a more consequential \nmoment in our Nation's history.\n  The Department of the Treasury states its role as ``the steward of \nU.S. economic and financial systems.'' And undeniably, today, we face a \nsimultaneous crisis in both of these systems on a scale most \nappropriately described as monumental--as this recession approaches the \nlongest and deepest since World War II. The cascading effect of our \ncollapsing housing markets combined with irresponsible, unregulated and \nunchecked instruments and investments in our financial markets has \nresulted in an onrush of disastrous economic repercussions--most \nespecially for hardworking Americans, 2.6 million of whom lost their \njobs last year, with millions more looking forward to this year with a \nsense of profound dread. This is the morass out of which a course must \nbe charted--and this is the challenge to which the next Secretary of \nthe Treasury must be equal--bringing a breadth of experience combined \nwith aggressive management, oversight, and leadership.\n  Given Mr. Geithner's record of achievement and reservoir of \nexperience, which includes more than 5 years as president of the New \nYork Federal Reserve Bank and service to five Secretaries of the \nTreasury, spanning three administrations, it is clear Mr. Geithner \nbrings to this crucial post a high-caliber, comprehensive, and nuanced \nunderstanding of finance, policy, and process that will also prove \ninvaluable at this pivotal moment. At the same time, Mr. Geithner must \nprovide leadership along with the predisposition to turn vision into \naction and to execute solutions. He must also simultaneously concern \nhimself with the financial security challenges presented by this \nperilous period.\n  Which brings me to the Troubled Asset Relief Program or the so-called \nTARP. The Bush administration committed the first $350 billion of the \n$700 billion Congress authorized last October to create TARP, and, now, \nthe second half of the money will be released. I understand people's \nfrustrations and concerns with the TARP program thus far--because I \nshare those concerns. Indisputably, a lack of transparency and \naccountability in the first half of the TARP funding fostered an \nenvironment in which taxpayer dollars were invested in banks and other \nfinancial institutions that have refused to reveal how the money was \nused--and this is unacceptable.\n  At the same time, given the information I have as a member of the \nSenate Finance Committee on the state of the economy and the undeniable \nseriousness of our circumstances, I believe exceptional measures can \nand must still be taken. President Obama conveyed to me personally that \nreleasing the remaining TARP funds is essential for shoring up an \neconomy that continues to plunge further into recession--and the \nPresident has also assured me that his administration would implement \ncritical safeguards while addressing the foreclosure crisis that is \nplaguing our economy along with so many hardworking Americans.\n  Indisputably, it is time for TARP to cease operating in an ad hoc \nmanner that allowed the Treasury Secretary to tell Congress funds would \nbe used to purchase illiquid securities, before--with no congressional \nreview--they were reprogrammed to inject capital into banks, other \nfinancial institutions, and automakers. Therefore, following the \ncommitments articulated by the Obama administration in letters from Mr. \nLarry Summers delivered to Congress on January 12 and 15, I will, in \nthe coming days be looking for Mr. Geithner to announce programs to \nassist credit-starved small businesses and consumers in obtaining the \nloans necessary to create jobs and purchase products and services. The \nbottom line is that Mr. Geithner must restore public confidence in TARP \nby explaining in detail how funds will be used and then delivering on \nthose pledges--because what is at stake is the public's money and the \npublic trust.\n  Additionally, increasing our Nation's financial security will require \nthe infusion of TARP dollars to help forestall our foreclosure crisis \nthat is at the root of our economic troubles. That is why I will be \nvigilant in making certain the Obama administration acts quickly on its \npledge to use between $50 billion and $100 billion of TARP funds to \nhelp keep imperiled families in their homes. Already, we have \nregrettably witnessed 2.3 million foreclosure filings in 2008 or an \nastounding 81 percent increase from 2007, according to a January 15 \nreport by RealtyTrac, an online real estate marketplace that publishes \nthe Nation's largest and most comprehensive foreclosure database.\n  Therefore, we must redouble our efforts to prevent further erosion of \nour financial security in the housing market. Yet indicators tell us \nthat this slide may only worsen. In fact, the proportion of consumers \nwith mortgages that are 60 days or more past due will hit 7.17 percent \nin the fourth quarter of 2009, compared to an expected delinquency rate \nof 4.67 percent at the end of 2008, as stated by TransUnion LLC--a \nnational credit reporting company. Mr. Geithner must not waste any time \nin establishing a program that will offer financial incentives to \ncompanies that agree to reduce monthly payments on mortgage loans.\n  Moreover, I am deeply concerned about the Government Accountability \nOffice's--GAO's--December report that concluded that more oversight \nover the Troubled Asset Relief Program--TARP--is necessary. While \nTreasury and banking regulators have publicly stated that they expect \ninstitutions receiving capital injections as part of the TARP's $250 \nbillion to promote the flow of credit and modify the terms of \nresidential mortgages to strengthen the housing market, Treasury has \nnot yet established policies to ensure the funds are being used as \nintended. Indeed, the Associated Press reported on December 22, that \nwhen it contacted 21 banks that received at least $1 billion in \nGovernment money, not one could provide specific answers on how the \nmoney is being used.\n  Equally disturbing, GAO found that while institutions receiving \ncapital injections are subject to specific restrictions on dividend \npayments and repurchasing shares, the Department of the Treasury has no \nprocedures in place to ensure adherence to these strictures. And while \nI am pleased that the Treasury Department on January 16 issued rules \nrequiring the chief executive officer of a financial institution \nreceiving funds to certify compliance with executive compensation \nrules, Treasury must review all such disclosures to assure their \naccuracy.\n  Indeed, if confirmed, Mr. Geithner must, as the Obama administration \nhas pledged, take steps on day one to address this egregious lack of \noversight, making the protection of taxpayer funds a top priority and \nholding healthy banks accountable for lending--not holding--the public \nfunds they have received. Moreover, these rules should apply not only \nto banks receiving injections in the future, but also to those who have \nalready obtained taxpayer dollars.\n\n[[Page S817]]\n\n  Because of the reasons just cited--in addition to deficiencies I \nlearned about at the confirmation hearing last November of TARP \ninspector general Neil Barofsky--I introduced legislation on November \n20, 2008, to strengthen the inspector general's authority to vouchsafe \ntaxpayer dollars. Among other provisions, my bill would waive \napplicable hiring standards in order to enable the IG to swiftly \nacquire staff, allow the investigation of any program receiving TARP \nfunding, and require a study of whether banks are indeed lending the \ntaxpayer dollars they have been given. This measure represents the \nright course to demanding disclosure, and yet, frankly, it is patently \nabsurd that we even have to divine such a course.\n  All of the provisions in my IG bill were incorporated into the \nSpecial Inspector General for the Troubled Asset Relief Program Act of \nwhich I am an original cosponsor and that the Senate unanimously passed \non December 10, 2008, but regrettably that measure did not pass \nCongress. That is why I am joining with Senator McCaskill in \nreintroducing this measure, which must be considered in short order and \nbe one of the first measures approved by the 111th Congress.\n  In taking up the gauntlet of providing both economic and financial \nstewardship, Mr. Geithner must, in the process, work hand in glove with \nCongress to see to it that we are never again forced to vote on a \nfinancial rescue package. We must renew accountability and transparency \nfrom all of our financial products that have contributed to the \nmeltdown to which we are now responding. And we must have more \neffective mechanisms to understand whether firms are creating systemic \nrisks that could undermine the foundations of our financial system. To \nthat end, last September, I introduced the Federal Board Certification \nAct of 2008, legislation that would better assess the risk \ncharacteristics of the mortgage-backed securities that led to the \nfinancial crisis. This bill would establish a voluntary Federal Board \nof Certification to certify the risk characteristics of mortgage-backed \nsecurities. I hope Mr. Geithner will work with me to make it law.\n  Not only should Mr. Geithner help Congress draft a proposal to ensure \nour system of regulation is viable, but he must also ensure that we do \nnot find ourselves in the situation that occurred with the fall of \nLehman Brothers, which was allowed to fail sending the financial system \ninto a downward spiral--followed by disparate explanations of why \nexactly that failure was permitted.\n  Indeed, according to a December 14, 2008, New York Times editorial, \nQuestions for Mr. Geithner, there are conflicting accounts as to how \nLehman--an institution in existence before the Civil War--was allowed \nto collapse. In testimony before Congress on September 24, 2008, \nFederal Reserve Chair Ben Bernanke said that the Federal Reserve and \nTreasury declined to commit public funds to support Lehman. Bernanke \ntestified that the failure of Lehman posed risks but that the firm's \ntroubles had been well known for some time and investors recognized \nbankruptcy was a possibility. Thus, Bernanke concluded, ``We judged \nthat investors and counterparties had time to take precautionary \nmeasures.''\n  But the same New York Times editorial then said that Chair Bernanke \nchanged his story and on December 1, 2008, said that ``legal \nconstraints'' had prevented the Fed from rescuing Lehman. Additionally, \nthe paper reports that a spokesman for the New York Fed, which Mr. \nGeithner led, also said that the Fed had no legal authority to \nintervene.\n  Regardless of which explanation is true, Federal Reserve Chair \nBernanke, former Treasury Secretary Paulson, and Mr. Geithner should \nhave come to Congress for any additional authority necessary to prevent \na calamity if they believed Lehman's failure was likely to wreak havoc \non the Nation's financial system as it appears to have done, \nparticularly as they saw the effects of such a downfall coming. As \nTreasury Secretary, Mr. Geithner cannot afford to allow such a mistake \nto occur once again. We are counting on him to go to President Obama \nand Congress when conditions warrant and not to stand on the sidelines.\n  Regarding Mr. Geithner's tax return mistakes, they are deeply \ntroubling. After intense scrutiny by the Senate Finance Committee, of \nwhich I am a member, Mr. Geithner acknowledged that his errors were \n``careless'' and ``avoidable,'' and, frankly, should not have \noccurred--a sentiment I strongly share. I am confident this experience \nwill make Mr. Geithner more sensitive to the struggles that average \nAmericans face in dealing with the tax code, and that he will \naggressively utilize his leadership position to advocate and advance \ntax simplification.\n  Looking at the totality of the record--Mr. Geithner's achievements \nand broad experience--and considering all of these factors within the \ncontext of the gravest economic times since the Great Depression, I \nbelieve that Mr. Geithner is well suited to serve as our next Secretary \nof the Treasury, and that President Obama should have his nominee \nconfirmed. Indeed, a recent USA Today editorial echoes this sentiment, \nstating that ``Mr. Geithner deserves rebuke on taxes, then fast \nconfirmation.'' Our Nation deserves the best qualified individual to \ntake the helm of the Treasury Department during these unprecedented \ntimes and to tackle these Herculean challenges to our modern economic \nsystem.\n  And so, for the reasons I have outlined, I will today vote to confirm \nMr. Geithner as the 75th Secretary of the Treasury. I stand ready to \nwork with Mr. Geithner and President Obama not only to help reverse \nthis economic downturn, but at the same time to ensure vigilant and \nvital congressional oversight in the process--and that American \ntaxpayer dollars are being spent wisely, effectively, and as intended \nby Congress and the American people.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, there is no question that our Nation's \nnext Treasury Secretary will have a heavy burden: deregulation run \nrampant has shaken the foundation of our financial system and \nreverberated through our economy with devastating impact. I will \nsupport Timothy Geithner because I believe he has the expertise to meet \nthe enormous challenges posed by this financial crisis and years of \nregulatory neglect.\n  Last week, Mr. Geithner provided responses to detailed questions that \nI submitted to him as part of the confirmation process. His answers \nreflect some important new priorities and policy advances, including \nplacing a priority on ending offshore tax abuses; preserving strong \nU.S. accounting rules; reinvigorating international anti-money \nlaundering efforts; and imposing a 1-year cooling off period before \nfinancial regulators can take a job with a company they regulated. He \nalso recognizes the need to overhaul our financial regulatory \nstructure, including by strengthening regulation of hedge funds, \nderivative traders, and the over-the-counter derivatives markets; and \nstrengthening capital and liquidity requirements for financial \ninstitutions.\n  Despite these positive indicators, I do have some reservations. Mr. \nGeithner is a strong nominee because of his extensive experience, but \nwhile he now indicates support for some regulation of swaps, he has \nbeen reluctant to acknowledge that prohibiting regulation of those \ninstruments was a mistake in 2000, and has offered only tepid support \nfor some of the strong regulatory controls needed. Mr. Geithner has \nalso been a key decisionmaker in the flawed financial rescue effort \nwhich has failed to track the use of TARP funds and failed to mandate \nlending of those funds to creditworthy businesses and to addressing the \nforeclosure flood. He has been reluctant to support requiring TARP fund \nrecipients to track and report on their use of taxpayer dollars and \nrequiring those who receive more than $1 billion in taxpayer assistance \nto provide written viability plans on how they intend to regain \nfinancial stability and repay the funds. Still, Mr. Geithner's apparent \nwillingness to listen to and work with Congress and his openness to \ncompromise is promising for future progress in these and other areas.\n  The job that awaits Mr. Geithner pending his confirmation is an \nextremely tough one. I hope that he is confirmed, and that he lives up \nto the promise of the Obama administration, including implementing the \ntransparent, pragmatic, and thoughtful policymaking that is a hallmark \nof President Obama's approach to government.\n\n[[Page S818]]\n\nOur Nation's economic recovery requires nothing less.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, a Congressman from Pennsylvania said:\n\n       I do believe we are now on the brink of a precipice, that \n     will be dangerous for us to step too fast upon.\n\n  The Pennsylvania Congressman spoke not today, but more than 200 years \nago, in the early days of our Nation.\n  We often forget that our young Nation was born not just in the glory \nof independence and democracy, but with the throes of a financial \ncrisis. At its founding, America was so encumbered by debt that the \nannual interest on its debts alone was three times its foreseeable \nannual income.\n  Finding a way out of that financial mess fell largely to one man, our \nNation's first Treasury Secretary, Alexander Hamilton.\n  Hamilton was not popular. His task was not easy. And he received \nlittle support. But ultimately he succeeded.\n  Again today, our Nation finds itself on the brink of a precipice. \nAgain today, the way out of our financial mess falls substantially on \none man. Again, his task will not be easy. And again, he may not be \npopular with all of my colleagues. But again, he must succeed.\n  Today, we are considering the nomination of Timothy Geithner to be \nAmerica's Treasury Secretary, in a time of unprecedented crisis. Credit \nmarkets are broken. Nearly 3 million Americans have lost their jobs in \nthe past year. Homeowners face foreclosure. And home values continue to \nfall.\n  Financial alchemy, carelessness, excessive leverage, and greed have \ncrippled Wall Street and America's financial institutions.\n  Today, America does not face imminent bankruptcy, as it did in \nAlexander Hamilton's time. Our Nation's creditworthiness remains solid. \nAnd our currency and Treasury bonds anchor the world economy. Today's \nTreasury and Federal Reserve pack financial firepower and resources \nunmatched by any other economy.\n  But in many ways, it will be far more daunting to solve today's \nchallenges than it was in Hamilton's day. The exotic financial \ninnovations that set off today's crisis are unprecedented. And their \nconsequences are therefore not fully known. Today's unconventional \ncrisis will not be solved with conventional solutions.\n  We face this crisis integrated in a world economy through \ninternational trade, foreign direct investment, and global financial \nmarkets. We face this crisis relying on foreign nations to finance our \ncurrent account deficit. And we face this crisis at a time when nearly \nevery economy in the world appears headed for simultaneous--and in some \ncases rapid--recession.\n  President Obama has asked the Senate to confirm Timothy Geithner \nwithout delay. Our economic crisis demands it.\n  The Senate Finance Committee vetted Mr. Geithner thoroughly. We \nquestioned him for 3 hours last week in a public hearing. And we \nexamined him behind closed doors a week before.\n  My colleagues and I strongly support his nomination. And I believe \nthat Mr. Geithner is uniquely qualified for this job, at this time.\n  Tim Geithner is a dedicated, lifelong public servant. He has not \nrelied on money and political influence to rise to positions of \nresponsibility. He did it the old fashioned way--with hard work, \ndedication, and competence.\n  Mr. Geithner began his career at the U.S. Treasury Department. He \nrose to become Under Secretary of the Treasury for International \nAffairs. There, he dealt effectively with financial crises of the past \ndecade. There, he earned the respect and trust of policymakers around \nthe world.\n  As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, Mr. Geithner \noversaw the execution of America's monetary policy, monitored financial \ninstitutions, and advised our economic partners around the world.\n  More recently, Mr. Geithner worked with Treasury Secretary Paulson \nand Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke on the series of initiatives \naimed at thawing frozen credit markets and stabilizing our financial \nsector.\n  History will judge the wisdom of how this past administration handled \nour crisis. But I take comfort in knowing that Mr. Geithner will enter \nhis new job knowing the scope, motivation, and effect of what was done. \nHe will enter his new job knowing what worked, what did not, and what \nmore needs to be done.\n  Mr. Geithner will surely make mistakes. We all do. But Mr. Geithner's \nexperience will help him to avoid repeating the same mistakes that this \npast administration made.\n  Mr. Geithner also knows what we expect of him. He knows that we \nexpect him to be a good steward of taxpayers' money. He knows that we \nexpect vigorous oversight of all financial recovery actions. He knows \nthat we expect Congress to be consulted and informed on all \ninitiatives. And he knows that the well-being of America's small \nbusinesses must be part of every decision he makes.\n  When Alexander Hamilton became Treasury Secretary in the face of \nextraordinary crisis, he said:\n\n       I conceived myself to be under an obligation to lend my aid \n     towards putting the machine in some regular motion.\n\n  With this vote, Mr. Geithner is under an obligation to lend his aid--\nevery last ounce of it--to putting our economic machine in regular \nmotion. America is counting on it.\n  Once again, we are on the brink of a precipice. Once again, our \nPresident calls upon one brilliant man to help to bring the Nation \nback.\n  Let us give him the person whom he has requested. And let us confirm \nour new President's choice for Secretary of the Treasury.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, how much time remains on each side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority has 13 minutes remaining. The \nminority has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I came to the Chamber and heard my \ncolleague from Iowa speak about the nomination before us and speak \nabout the culture of greed and other events that have resulted in the \ncollapse of our financial system. I want to make a point that the \nSenator from Iowa is not alone. There are a number of us who feel very \nstrongly about what has happened on Wall Street, what has happened \nsince the financial collapse, and what is happening every single day. \nYou wake up in the morning and you hear of thousands and thousands of \npeople being laid off, with 2.6 million people losing their jobs last \nyear and an estimated 2.5 million people expected to lose their jobs in \nthe first 6 months of this year alone.\n\n  This is a very serious problem for our economy, which is perched on \nthe edge of a cliff. The question is, Who is going to steer us out of \nthis mess? My notion is that the same people who steered us into the \nditch are not likely to show up with an ambulance to get us out. And my \ngreat concern is that there needs to be a culture change. I must say I \nam concerned as well that we have some people coming to Washington who \nwere part of the culture that got us into this mess.\n  It was 10 years ago when the Financial Modernization Act was on the \nfloor of this Senate. My colleague from Iowa voted against it, and so \ndid I. There were eight of us who voted against it in the Senate. That \nis what caused these big holding companies. Citigroup, or Citicorp at \nthat point, wanted to buy Travelers Insurance but the law wouldn't let \nthem. So they got busy and changed the law. They got Glass-Steagall \nrepealed--the protections put in place after the Great Depression--so \nthat banks could get engaged in riskier enterprises, such as securities \nand real estate and merged it all together into a big holding company \nand said it would be fine.\n  I stood here on the floor of the Senate 10 years ago and said: Mark \nmy words, within a decade, we are going to see massive taxpayer \nbailouts if we pass that bill. I have no pride in being right. But I \nsaid at the same time, if you want to gamble, go to Las Vegas.\n  Why on Earth should we have done in 1999 what we did to fuse banking \nwith\n\n[[Page S819]]\n\ninherently risky enterprises? It created an unbelievable carnival of \ngreed. People at the top were making money hand over fist, taking it \nhome, and putting it in their big banks. Not everyone was making money, \nonly folks at the top. The highest income in 2007 was $3.6 billion for \none person. Think of that. Incomes from outerspace.\n  So what do we have? Well, the fact is some of the same folks in 1999 \npreached the gospel of deregulation--getting rid of those old-fashioned \nthings put in place after the Great Depression--to get what they called \none-stop financial service centers. You would have one-stop financial \nshopping. Now you would be going to one place to do your real estate \nand your securities and your banking. That is what they wanted. Well, \nthey got it. Only eight of us voted no, so they got it. Now the \nAmerican people bear the brunt of this colossal, unbelievable failure.\n  I have to say--and I have told the President this--that I worry some \nfolks coming into this town now were part of the chorus supporting all \nof that deregulation in what was called modernization--the Financial \nModernization Act and a couple of other pieces of legislation that \noccurred thereafter. So I am going to watch like a hawk the folks who \nshow up around here who were part of the supporters back in 1999 who \nhave taken apart the protections that had existed since the Great \nDepression. I am going to watch this like a hawk.\n  We have to fix this, but you can't fix it by tightening a few bolts \nhere and there. We need financial reform. We need to ask basic \nquestions: Was it ever in the public interest to begin securitizing \neverything and passing risk up the line and allowing the most \nunbelievable mortgages to be written--no documentation of income, you \ndon't have to pay any principal at first or you don't have to pay \ninterest for 12 months. All this sort of thing. And by the way, if you \nhave a bankruptcy in your background, come to us, we want to give you a \nloan. If you are slow in paying, have bad credit, or a bankruptcy, come \nto us, we will give you a loan. That is the way it was advertised. \nUnbelievable.\n  This was a carnival of greed that has now toppled the financial \nstructure of this country. And every single day American families \naround this country are bearing the burden and paying the price. \nSomebody is coming home and saying to their spouse, their loved ones, \ntheir friends, I lost my job today. It is not because I am a bad \nworker. It is because there were layoffs at the plant or the office. \nThe price for this greed is unbelievable.\n  Now it has stopped because it has collapsed. But now we have to \nrebuild it. And the question is, who will be the architects who will \ngive us confidence to rebuild a financial system in which underwriting \nis really underwriting; in which we soak out some of the greed and get \nback to basic values; you separate banking from risk; you begin to \nregulate, and you get rid of the folks around here who boasted about \nbeing willfully blind in terms of their responsibility to regulate \nbehavior that long ago should have been regulated?\n  So I wanted to say that the Senator from Iowa speaks for a number of \nus--certainly myself--in being very concerned and determined to watch \nlike a hawk what happens from this day forward with respect to those \nwho are charged with and asked to help us reconstruct this system--a \nfinancial system, a system of employment, a system of production in \nthis country where we put America back on track and give it the \nopportunity to expand, to grow, and to allow the American people to \nhave confidence in the future once again.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The majority whip is recognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, it is my understanding a vote is \nscheduled at 6 o'clock.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I have a statement I wish to make, but \nif Senator Baucus should come to the floor, or his designee, I will \nyield the floor at that point if they want to close the debate. But I \nwant to make a statement in reference to the nomination of Mr. Geithner \nto be the Secretary of the Treasury.\n  Today's press reports were staggering. The largest manufacturer in my \nState, Caterpillar, is cutting 20,000 jobs--18 percent of their \nworkforce; Pfizer is laying off 8,300 workers; Sprint Nextel, 8,000; \nHome Depot, 7,000; Corus, 3,500 workers. That is a shortened list of \nannounced job losses--over 47,000 in total--in just today's newspaper. \nLast week, Harley-Davidson, 1,000 jobs; Microsoft, 5,000; Intel, up to \n6,000; United Airlines, 1,000; Bose, 1,000; Clear Channel, 1,850 \nworkers.\n  It is abundantly clear that our economy is in a tailspin, and it is \nclear to me as well that we will need leadership in the Department of \nthe Treasury. Mr. Geithner, who is the nominee of this administration \nas Secretary of Treasury, has been the subject of hearings. There have \nbeen disclosures concerning taxes that he has paid in the past. He has \nacknowledged his own shortcomings when it comes to some of these \nissues. I would say at this point, now more than ever, we need a person \nwith his background and his skills to lead us in the Treasury \nDepartment. When you take a look at the state of the economy, I hope \nthe Senate will respond as quickly as possible--this evening--in \nappointing him to this position.\n  Then we should move quickly. Once we have finished the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program this week--the majority leader, Senator Reid, \nhas said we will finish it this week--then we need to move into the \nrecovery and reinvestment plan which President Obama is going to offer \nto Congress. Tomorrow, in historic meeting, President Obama is coming \nto Capitol Hill to meet with Republican Congressmen to talk about the \nplan. He is doing everything in his power to work together with \nDemocrats and Republicans to put together the right investment for our \nNation's future.\n  We know what is at stake. It isn't just the immediate job losses, it \nisn't just the unemployment rate we face, which is at a record high \nlevel for the last 16 years, but it also is a question of investment in \nthis country. There are some who want this to be a temporary program. I \nhear that from Senator McConnell--he wants this to be temporary. But we \nhave to acknowledge some of the investments we want to make are long-\nterm investments to stabilize the economy. When we decide to build \nclassrooms, laboratories, and libraries for the 21st century, it \ncreates jobs today and over the next several years, but it also creates \nan asset that will pay back over long periods of time. When we invest \nin information technology when it comes to health care, it is an \ninvestment that will pay off in bringing down the cost of health care \nand reducing the medical errors that result when we don't have accurate \ninformation. When we make investments in providing energy incentives \nfor new green businesses to lessen the dependence of America on \nimported oil, it creates a job today, but it may be something that pays \nback over the long term.\n\n  I don't think the American people expect us to do something which \nwill disappear in 18 months and have to be repeated. They want us to \ninvest this money as best we can in those projects that have long-term \nvalue.\n  Mr. Geithner, the Secretary of the Treasury, will have important \nresponsibilities when it comes to other aspects of this--financial \ninstitutions that will be brought into this equation to find ways to \nstabilize our economy and move us forward--but the key issue, over and \nover again, is the creation of jobs--jobs. We lost over 500,000 \nAmerican jobs in the month of December, we are anticipating losing \n600,000 this month, with no end in sight--17,000 Americans a day losing \ntheir jobs. We have to act quickly--not with haste and not without due \nconsideration, but we have to act quickly to respond to this economic \ncrisis.\n  I think the approval of Mr. Geithner as Secretary of the Treasury is \na first step, and then the recovery plan which will follow. The House \nwill take it up this week, and we will take it up in committee. We are \ngoing to finish it\n\n[[Page S820]]\n\nbefore we leave on February 14. It is a target date which all of us \nunderstand is very serious because we are facing economic circumstances \nwe have not seen in this country in over 75 years. I want to make sure \nwe do this and do it quickly; that we act boldly and swiftly, and at \nthe end of the day we create the jobs that are needed in this country, \nwe cut taxes for working families so they will have more resources to \ncope with the expenses they face, and we invest in long-term \ninvestments that pay off and stabilize our economy. We are talking \nabout roads and bridges and airports and schools, and we need \ntransparency and accountability when it comes to this recovery program.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Warner). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \nnomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Timothy F. Geithner, of New York, to be Secretary of the Treasury?\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. The author Lois McMaster Bujold wrote:\n\n       Children might or might not be a blessing, but to create \n     them and then fail them was surely damnation.\n\n  Before 1997, we largely failed the children of the working poor. The \nChildren's Health Insurance Program changed that. For millions of \nworking families, the Children's Health Insurance Program has truly \nbeen a blessing.\n  Before 1997, kids of the working poor had nowhere to go to get health \ninsurance--nowhere. Their parents' employers did not offer health \ninsurance benefits, and the individual market offered only low-quality \ninsurance options at unaffordable prices. Without health insurance, \nkids could not see the doctor for a checkup, they could not get a \nprescription for an earache, and they could not get treatment for \ncommon chronic conditions such as asthma. Unhealthy kids cannot run and \nplay, they cannot do well in school, and they cannot grow into healthy \nand productive adults.\n  In 1997, Congress took action to address this problem. We established \nthe Children's Health Insurance Program. Today, we finally move forward \nto keep the program going. The Children's Health Insurance Program has \nbipartisan roots, and it has achieved what we created it to do; namely, \nit covers low-income, uninsured kids.\n  Congress enacted the Children's Health Insurance Program as a \nbipartisan compromise. Members of Congress wanted to address the rising \nnumber of children without health insurance, and Senator Rockefeller, \nSenator Hatch, Senator Kennedy, and the late Senator John Chafee led \nthe way. I am proud to have helped write and pass the Children's Health \nInsurance Program 12 years ago. It has been a tremendous success.\n  The Finance Committee reached a compromise that allowed States to set \nup children's health insurance programs that would meet their unique \nneeds. States can choose whether they want to participate in the \nprogram. Within 2 years of CHIP's creation, every State decided to \nparticipate. It was a no-brainer. Every State wanted to address the \nhealth care needs of our most vulnerable children.\n  In its first decade, CHIP cut the number of uninsured children by \nmore than one-third. Today, because of CHIP, nearly 7 million children \nget the doctors visits and medicines they need. Those healthier \nchildhoods will enable those 7 million kids to become healthy, \nproductive adults.\n  Health insurance is important. It is more than important; it is \ncritical. Children with health coverage are more likely to get the \nhealth care they need, when they need it. Because of CHIP, 7 million \nkids have regular checkups, see doctors when they get sick, and get the \nprescription medications they need.\n  The task before us is to reauthorize this important program. Many \nwill recall that we started this process back in the year 2007.\n  Congress worked hard, very hard to pass a bipartisan reauthorization \npackage. I can tell my colleagues, Senators Hatch, Rockefeller and \nmyself and Senator Grassley worked hours on end. I cannot tell you the \nnumber of hours we met and how hard it was, but we worked together and \ngot that compromise. We got it passed on the floor, passed the House. \nBut President Bush vetoed it twice. Times have changed. President Obama \nis looking forward to signing the Children's Health Insurance Program \nbill, and Congress is prepared to act.\n  Americans overwhelmingly support covering kids. The bill before us \ntoday will keep coverage for all children currently in the program, and \nwe will start to reach more than 4 million additional uninsured, low-\nincome kids. In\n\n[[Page S821]]\n\ndrafting this legislation, we relied heavily on the two vetoed bills. \nWe keep CHIP focused on kids. That is the focus. Childless adults whom \nCHIP covers today will transition out of the program. This is focused \non kids. This bill will not allow new waivers for CHIP coverage of \nchildless adults. Low-income parents whom CHIP covers today will \nultimately transition out of CHIP to Medicaid, with its lower match \nrate. This bill precludes new waivers for coverage of parents in CHIP. \nWe cover low-income kids first. We agree that low-income kids are our \nfirst priority, but we do not limit State flexibility in designing CHIP \nprograms. States choosing to cover kids above 300 percent of poverty \nwill receive the lower Medicaid match for those kids. If they want to \ndo so, they can, but they will get the lower match rate. We also \nincluded bonuses for States that meet enrollment targets for kids in \nMedicaid. Nearly three-quarters of uninsured kids are eligible for \neither Medicaid or CHIP but have not enrolled. We encourage States to \nimprove their outreach practices to streamline enrollment procedures to \nkeep them enrolled. We maintain State flexibility. We have given States \nthe option to cover legal immigrant children and pregnant women during \ntheir first 5 years in the United States. States can decide whether \nthey want to cover those children. Currently, Federal law prevents \nStates from covering legal immigrants on Medicaid or CHIP until they \nhave been in the country for 5 years. But some States have found this \nprovision to be too restrictive. Those States have chosen to use their \nown money to meet the needs of their residents.\n  In 2008, for example, 18 States chose to cover legal immigrant \nchildren, and 23 States chose to cover legal immigrant pregnant women, \nrather than deny them the health care they need for 5 years. The \nFederal Government should not penalize States for trying to help needy \npopulations who are here legally. This bill would allow States the \noption to cover legal immigrant children and pregnant women in Medicaid \nor CHIP and receive the appropriate Federal match.\n  More broadly, we have also created a State option that allows States \nto designate CHIP funds to offer premium assistance. Premium assistance \ncan help families to afford private coverage offered by employers or \nother sources. We improve the quality of children's health insurance. \nDiscussions about health insurance often get bogged down in talk about \ncost and coverage but we ignore quality. Discussions about quality \noften ignore the unique needs of children. Our CHIP bill launches a \nsubstantially new initiative to improve children's health quality. This \ninitiative will invest $45 million a year for 5 years to develop \nnational core measures for children's health quality, improve data \ncollection in CHIP and Medicaid, and promote the use of electronic \nrecords. These efforts will help to improve the quality of care \navailable in CHIP and Medicaid.\n  We pay for what we do. Like the vetoed bills, this legislation will \nincrease the Federal tax on a pack of cigarettes by 61 cents. We also \nmake proportional increases for other tobacco products. Increasing the \ncigarette tax will discourage smoking, particularly among teens, and \nthat will be good for kids as well.\n  The bill we are considering today is a good bill. In putting together \nthe Finance Committee's bill, we worked to cover as many low-income, \nuninsured kids as possible. We respected our budgetary limits, and we \nmade compromises in good faith with our Republican colleagues. In \ncommittee, we made further compromises which I hope have strengthened \nthis bill even more. I prefer to be standing here today with all my \ncolleagues beside me, especially my good friends, Senators Grassley and \nHatch. But we could not agree on everything. I hope the remaining \ndisagreements do not prevent Senators from doing the right thing. Let \nus not fail the children of the working poor. Let us get these kids to \ndoctors visits and medications they need, and let us continue the \nblessing that is the Children's Health Insurance Program.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, following along on the lines of the \ndistinguished chairman of the Finance Committee, it has been a very \nlong journey to reach this day. A year and a half ago both Houses of \nCongress passed two CHIP reauthorization bills with overwhelmingly \nbipartisan support. As I recall, the numbers were somewhere around 69 \nin the Senate on each bill. These two bills would have given 4 million \nmore uninsured children a healthy start in life. For those of us in \nAppalachia and for those who live almost anywhere in the country, there \nare parts of their inner cities and rural areas where this is \nabsolutely crucial.\n  No one was more disappointed or, frankly, angry than I was when our \nbipartisan legislation was twice vetoed by President Bush. I could not \nunderstand it. I didn't know what the reason was. But my anger toward \nthat pales in comparison to the heartache and the anguish felt by the \nmillions of children and families who would have directly benefited \nfrom this legislation had it passed in either of its forms. But it did \nnot.\n  So today we are here once again to debate providing health coverage \nto 4 million uninsured children. But this time there is a big \ndifference. President Bush no longer stands in the way of providing \nhealth care to children. President Obama decided, very early in his \ncampaign, this is something he cared about. This time victory for \nchildren is guaranteed. All we to have do is pass it. We should all be \nextremely excited that this bill will finally be signed into law, and \nmore than 11 million children will be enrolled in CHIP each year.\n  Unfortunately, some of my colleagues are less than thrilled about the \nbill before us. I want to put the 11 million children in context. \nPeople say there are anywhere from 42 to 48 million uninsured \nAmericans. If we do our job, about a quarter of our uninsured will \ndisappear and will be insured. So this is a monumental task on which we \nare, in fact, proceeding. Some of my colleagues have tried to raise \nsuspicion and doubt about our intentions on this most recent CHIP bill. \nI regret that. I want my colleagues to know there is no reason for \nsuspicion or doubt on any account. It was called by some ``political.'' \nI will explain that in a moment and why it is a fallacious argument and \nshould be understood by my colleagues as that. Our intentions are \nexactly the same as they were in 2007--to make sure that children in \nAmerica have the health care they need and deserve.\n  I remember this very well, as the Presiding Officer knows, from my \nearly days in West Virginia when I was working in coalfields of \nsouthern West Virginia where no children had any health care insurance. \nThe legislation we are considering this week is virtually identical to \nthe second and to the more conservative CHIP bill that we passed in the \nfall of 2007. However, this legislation also reflects the fact that our \ncountry is not in the same economic situation as was the case at that \ntime. Working families at all income levels are hurting because of the \neconomy. This bill gives the States additional Federal funding and the \nflexibility to cover children in need.\n  One important and necessary change in the legislation before us gives \nthe States the option to eliminate the 5-year waiting period that \nprevents legal immigrant children and legal immigrant pregnant women \nfrom getting timely health care. Allow me to repeat myself. This \nlegislation gives States the option to eliminate the 5-year waiting \nperiod for legal immigrants. It is not, therefore, a requirement. It \nalso does not provide health care for illegal immigrants or their \nchildren. Anyone who says differently is incorrect. Thence rises the \nargument that this is playing politics, as if God had some kind of a \ndifferent view about children who are here and have been here for a \nnumber of years and are trying to live out their life as best they can \nbut they have no health insurance. What is it? Where is it written that \nthese are not children to the equal of yours or mine? It is not \nwritten, because it is not so. All of us are equal.\n\n[[Page S822]]\n\n  In fact, our legislation has language specifically prohibiting \nMedicaid and CHIP coverage for illegal immigrants. I could take it out \nof the bill and read it to you, but that would be unnecessary.\n  There is no acceptable reason for this 5-year waiting period to \nremain in place. All lawfully present children should have timely \naccess to health care in the United States. We are doing our best to \nachieve that and will achieve that through this bill. Five years later, \nif we kept on that requirement, is a lifetime for young children who \nmay have bad teeth or early cases of cancer or any other life-\nthreatening illness or disability, to make them wait 5 years because we \ndon't think maybe they measure up. They measure up. They are kids. They \nare children. That is what we are fighting for.\n  Those who oppose removing this arbitrary waiting period will come to \nthe floor and offer all sorts of unrelated arguments about immigration. \nThis is not about immigration. It is about health care for kids who \nneed it, something that a lot of us have been fighting for since the \nmid-1990s. These arguments are nothing more than a smokescreen. The \nbottom line is that both U.S. citizen children and children in this \ncountry legally should have timely access to health care, period. This \nlegislation covers both those objectives.\n  In closing, I hope we will have the same bipartisan commitment in \npassing this legislation as we did in 2007. Those who look upon one \namendment, which is highly moral, highly deserved and entirely right, \nwill pass it with the same margins we did in 2007. Four million \nchildren are waiting for us to finish the task at hand.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, we have some things that are going to \nhappen this year that are very significant. In the committee I chaired \nwhen the Republicans were in the majority--it is now chaired by Senator \nBoxer--we have two major pieces of legislation coming up.\n  We have the Transportation reauthorization bill and we have the Water \nResources Development Act reauthorization bill. In the case of the \nTransportation reauthorization bill, we had a good reauthorization in \n2005. It is scheduled to be reauthorized again, and I would suggest we \nuse that as somewhat of a pattern of what we are going to plan to go in \nthis coming year, in 2009.\n  In spite of all of the things you are hearing about the inauguration \nand about the various confirmations, business is going to continue. The \nWRDA bill, the Water Resources Development Act, is something that \nshould be done on an annual basis or every other year. Yet the last \ntime we passed it was 7 whole years ago. We had a lot of making up to \ndo. There is not one State represented on this floor that is not way \nbehind in some of the programs that are dealt with in the Water \nResources Development Act.\n  The reason I mention this at this time is we will be dealing with \nsome type of a stimulus bill. When they talk about $800 or so billion, \nI already, in my previous remarks, talked about how big $700 or $800 \nbillion is to individual families in America.\n  We will be dealing with this, and I regret that of the $800 billion, \nonly $30 billion has to do with highway construction. We have a great \nneed in this country for bridge construction, highway construction, \nand, hopefully--Senator Boxer and I both cosigned a letter to try to \nget a much larger percentage of whatever amount we end up authorizing \nin a stimulus bill.\n  So I would hope--and I would ask each Member to look at their own \nStates, as I have done in my State of Oklahoma--Senators look at State \nprojects that are out there that we call spade-ready: they have had \ntheir environmental impact statement, they have had their AS \nstatements, and they are ready to go. They would employ people \nimmediately. For those like me who are conservative, who do not believe \nthe ingredients in this stimulus package, or at least do not believe \nwhat they are looking at in the House is going to really stimulate very \nmuch, one thing we do know is that there is nothing that puts people \nback to work faster than to get something that has already passed all \nof the environmental prerequisites and is ready for construction to \nstart. Then, after it is over, you have something. You have bridges \nthat are rebuilt. You have roads that are rebuilt.\n  So what I would encourage the Senate to try to do is get as much as \nwe can out of the stimulus package that actually does provide jobs and \nprovides things that otherwise we would have to do in the \nreauthorization bill.\n  There is no way in the world we are going to take care of the real \nneed we have with infrastructure in America unless we get a very large \namount in the front end of the stimulus bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/26/senate-section/article/S822-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S822]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    CELEBRATING THE CHINESE NEW YEAR\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to join with the millions of \nAsian Americans around the country in celebration of Chinese New Year. \nLast year, I was pleased to introduce a resolution honoring the \nhistorical and cultural significance of this holiday, and today, I am \nequally delighted to recognize all those welcoming in the Year of the \nOx.\n  The festivities surrounding the Chinese New Year are steeped in rich \ncultural tradition. The 15-day-long celebrations marks one of the most \nimportant times for Chinese Americans and Asian Americans from many \nbackgrounds and ethnicities to gather together with family and friends. \nMouth-watering aromas will fill their homes as families sit down to New \nYear's Eve meals, and children will eagerly await receiving lucky red \nmoney envelopes. Many will watch or participate in vibrantly colored \ndragon dances, a symbol of prosperity and good fortune.\n  In our State of Nevada, the festivities held in Las Vegas, in \nparticular, draw thousands of visitors, where many of the city's hotels \nfeature spectacular decorations, dragon dances, and restaurants serving \ntraditional dishes. And all across our great State, families will flock \nto community festivals featuring dances, crafts, food, and fireworks--\nthe sights, sounds, and smells that make Chinese New Year such a \njubilant celebration.\n  This year marks the 4706th year in the Chinese calendar, based on the \nlunar cycles. As it unfolds, I hope those observing Chinese New Year \nwill enjoy this special time to honor traditions, spend time with their \nfamilies, and eagerly anticipate what blessings the Year of the Ox may \nbring. To the thousands of Chinese American Nevadans and many others \ncelebrating today, I send my best wishes for a joyous celebration and a \nprosperous New Year.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/26/senate-section/article/S822-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S822-S823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. HAROLD C. RELYEA\n\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, on January 30, 2009, after more than 37 \nyears of service at the Library of Congress, Dr. Harold C. Relyea will \nretire as a specialist in American National Government at the \nCongressional Research Service, CRS. His service and devotion to the \nU.S. Congress will be greatly missed.\n  President Thomas Jefferson once observed that ``information is the \ncurrency of democracy.'' He also noted that ``whenever the people are \nwell-informed, they can be trusted with their own government.'' Thanks \nto the fine work of Dr. Relyea and his colleagues at the Congressional \nResearch Service, the people's representatives in Congress are well-\ninformed--and, thus, well-armed--to preserve and defend the ideals, \nstructure, and balance of our government as envisioned by our Founding \nFathers.\n  As Senators and staff come and go, the best CRS specialists become \nrepositories of institutional knowledge, deep wells of experience who \noffer perspective and thoughtful analysis. Such specialists tend to \ntake a long view on issues, having seen issues and trends emerge and \nreemerge in varying forms.\n\n[[Page S823]]\n\nThese public servants enlighten and educate Members, and sometimes \ntestify before congressional committees. These men and women are \nsteeped in their field of expertise, and though some come to be \nrecognized for their published work and analysis, most labor in \nanonymity, satisfied by the pure reward of helping to inform and shape \nthe public debate.\n  Dr. Relyea is, and has been, reliable, authoritative, and humble--a \ngenuine example of the true public servant over the long years of his \ncareer. A native of Oneida, NY, Dr. Relyea earned his doctorate in \ngovernment in 1971 from American University--my own alma mater. He \njoined the Congressional Research Service that same year, shortly after \nthe enactment of the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 that \nprovided the charter for the modern Congressional Research Service. Dr. \nRelyea was promoted to head of the Executive Organization and \nAdministration Section at CRS in 1976. Twenty years later, he became \nthe head of the executive and judiciary section of the government and \nfinance division. As a Specialist in American National Government, Dr. \nRelyea garnered national recognition for his research and writings on \nthe Presidency, and executive branch powers and organization.\n  I came to know Dr. Relyea in 2002, as the Bush administration \nattempted to expand its use of emergency and wartime powers, and I \nincreasingly sought to defend and assert the rights and privileges of \nthe Congress as a co-equal branch of government under the U.S. \nConstitution. I recall sitting across the table from Dr. Relyea in the \nAppropriations Committee hearing room, where I had asked several CRS \nspecialists to brief me on the creation of a new Department of Homeland \nSecurity. I remember being impressed by Dr. Relyea's depth of \nknowledge, and his timely and thorough responses to my requests for \ninformation. Dr. Relyea and others sacrificed their August recess that \nyear, in order to help prepare for a long debate when the Senate \nreturned in September.\n  I welcome this opportunity to thank Dr. Relyea, and to thank everyone \nat the Congressional Research Service for their hard work and \ndedication. As a source of necessary expertise for Members of Congress, \nCRS helps to provide a vital counterweight to a mighty and powerful \nExecutive branch.\n  In a career that has spanned four decades and eight administrations, \nDr. Harold C. Relyea has set a standard of superior service for the \nentire Congressional Research Service. It's clear that Dr. Relyea has \nearned the respect and appreciation of his colleagues. He is a patient \nand generous mentor and has assisted a full generation of CRS analysts \nin developing their skills. In 2008, his colleagues showered praise on \nDr. Relyea as they nominated him for the prestigious Director's Award. \nI think their greatest tribute to him, however, would be to continue \nhis outstanding legacy of scholarship.\n  I thank Dr. Relyea for his extraordinary dedication to the work and \ntraditions of the U.S. Congress and to the country and the Constitution \nwhich we all revere.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/26/senate-section/article/S823-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LILLY LEDBETTER FAIR PAY ACT\n\n\n                                Lost Pay\n\n  Mr. LEVIN.

Under current law, as interpreted by the Supreme Court, \nshe is not able to recover any lost pay because a claimant has 180 days \nto file a claim from the time that the employer first decided to \ndiscriminate, i.e. she had to file by July 1, 2007.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Under S. 181, would she be able to recover the 2007-2008 \nlost wages?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Under S. 181 she would be able to recover lost wages \nfor the previous 2 years from her January 15, 2009, paycheck.

She \nwas very active in the Kay Yow/Women's Basketball Coaches Association \nCancer Fund, in partnership with the V Foundation, committed to finding \ncures for cancer.\n  She also was heavily involved in the creation of the ``Hoops 4 \nHope,'' a basketball game played to raise awareness and help find a \ncure for breast cancer.\n  The North Carolina State University student body embraced Coach Yow, \nand her colleagues recognized her instrumental contributions to the \nsport in which she became and remains an icon.\n  Coach Yow will be deeply missed, but the inspiration and the memories \nthat she created will live forever.\n  Again, I send my sincerest condolences to Coach Yow's family, her \nathletes, her fans, and her friends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/26/senate-section/article/S823-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S823-S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO.

This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today.

That stopped my \n     income--cold. Since then Donna and I have moved in with \n     Donna's aging and widowed mother and have been able to care \n     for her, while at the same time not having to make a house \n     payment. Nobody but Walmart will hire a guy my age with my \n     particular qualifications. So I still have no job. \n     Fortunately\n\n[[Page S824]]\n\n     we have no bills. We were making it OK drawing my Social \n     Security early and making ends meet .  .  . until this gas \n     thing--that was then--this is now.\n       Just this Monday, I filled my tank with 81 octane rating \n     and 16 gallons cost me $65. The net result is that I now \n     drink water instead of milk, I no longer can afford my \n     vitamins, we cannot afford the better whole wheat bread but \n     buy wonder bread because it's cheaper. (I quit eating bread \n     so I guess that's not all bad.), cut back on eggs, buy 75 \n     percent fat free hamburger rather than the 90 percent stuff \n     at Winco. I had to cancel a Doctor's appointment for my blood \n     pressure check because I have no insurance and ran out of \n     money. Should I go on?\n       In short this gas thing is making life difficult. I cannot \n     figure out why the Democrats are so obtuse. We cannot drill \n     here because of some patch of slippery grass or there because \n     we might melt the polar ice cap out from under some bear. Who \n     cares about that stuff in this critical time anyhow? This is \n     all really easy to figure out: Drill here, Drill now, and to \n     blazes with the frog lickkers and tree huggers. It is because \n     of them and their ilk that we have not built any new \n     refineries or opened any new drilling fields in the past 30 \n     plus years. Gee, I wonder how much we would be paying for our \n     own gasoline drilled from our own wells and refined in our \n     own refineries? I am not an educated man but I think I have \n     got a handle on this. What is the matter with all your \n     buddies in Congress?\n       Why is it that everybody else on God's Green Earth is \n     drilling wherever they need (and want to) and we continue to \n     buy oil from people who'd just as soon kill us as look at us. \n     You know what? We have some of the largest oil reserves on \n     Earth and we let some team of morons who think the bears and \n     the slippery grass are more important than me, stop us from \n     drilling in our own back yard?--I don't think so. I \n     haven't slipped on any endangered grass or seen a polar \n     bear face to face except in the zoo--and I do not expect I \n     will in what remains in my life time. But I do have \n     grandkids who don't live close by. What is more important \n     than me seeing my grandkids down in Poky or Ogden? Bears \n     or grass? No siree.

We can only absorb so many increases before we can \n     no longer afford to do business.\n       Our society was built on free enterprise and the inaction \n     of our government to address the energy needs of the country \n     crushes our ability to produce and contribute to the economy. \n     The government has too long tried to appease special \n     interests. For our government to shackle us to dependency on \n     foreign energy when we have everything we need right here is \n     a disservice to the people. We can pursue our own resources \n     with negligible impact on our environment. We must go forward \n     with the pursuit of energy independence, both green and \n     fossil fuels. Free up Anwar, the Atlantic shelf, the Gulf and \n     our natural gas. The government should aggressively subsidize \n     solar, wind and other alternative energy options for the \n     consumer.\n       The statement was made by Senator Obama that there is no \n     immediate solution for high gas prices but when do we start? \n     If we had started eight years ago we would be closer. We must \n     begin now. If this does not change our lives in this country \n     will be irreversibly damaged. As Americans we are being \n     forced to sell pieces of our country to foreign interests in \n     order to survive. This is not the American way. The actions \n     of our government are giving our country away. If this \n     continues, who will we be in ten years? What will be left of \n     our distinct way of life? We Americans are unique in how we \n     live. We choose to pursue happiness and independence and that \n     pursuit has been good for the world, and yet the world \n     criticizes us for having the freedom to do this and would \n     like nothing more than to chain us to their ideals. If our \n     quest for the American dream is smothered by the demands of \n     the world then Democracy dies here and all the sacrifices of \n     the generations before us are lost.\n       Please do all you can at the federal level to persuade the \n     rest of Congress to secure our energy and our economy.\n     Alan and Cathleen Lusk.\n                                  ____\n\n       I wish I could just limit my story to just one. I could go \n     on for days about the way the high energy prices are \n     affecting me and my family here in Idaho. I will cite a few \n     for your information.\n       Heating costs--Just last week, Jan. 14th, we had yet \n     another snow storm--That makes 8 months of snow here in \n     Idaho. But with that it means my home was being heated by \n     Off-Road Diesel again. When I bought this house I was paying \n     $0.95 a gallon for fuel to heat my home for my wife, four \n     kids, and police K-9. Through the last few years I have seen \n     a very large increase in the cost to keep it very cold to \n     just get by. I have had my home insulated and weatherized. I \n     am the low income American. I worked hard to get off of state \n     programs and CHIP. Now it seems that was done for no reason. \n     I still make too much money for aid programs, but now I will \n     have to give up these items I worked hard to get and get off \n     of state programs. I got the American dream just to be priced \n     back out of it. I now spend $1400+ to fill my heating oil \n     tank. As you know natural gas is not up here in Cascade. It \n     is cheaper than oil, but we cannot get it. So I had to make a \n     choice, health insurance or heating my home. I chose to keep \n     my family warm. So now I pray no one gets sick or hurt. When \n     I say warm I mean 64 degrees. I am not sure if you know what \n     that feels like, but it is very cold during the winter. In \n     the summer you would say that your AC was great.\n       Grocery Costs--Here is another area that has seen large \n     price hikes to deal with the cost of transporting food. We \n     live in Cascade and well it costs more to get food to us up \n     here than in Boise. It is nothing new to spend a few more $ \n     on something that is cheaper in Boise. In the last two years \n     milk has gone up over $1.50 a gallon. Eggs almost a $1.00 \n     too. Everything that I consider a must-have item has gone up \n     and up. Know what? My pay has gone down in the same time \n     frame. A slow economy means less hours of work and that means \n     less money in my paycheck. I would not presume to complain to \n     you over the cost of steak and lobster or stuff like that. I \n     cannot remember what a steak taste like and what color is \n     lobster again? I am talking about the things you cannot skimp \n     on here: Milk for my four kids.\n       These higher energy costs are affecting everything that we \n     buy. Because of that, we are having to make choices about \n     what we spend our money on. You can use any inflation score \n     you want, I believe they were set up to have numbers say \n     whatever you want them to say. Like the four out of five \n     doctors line. The proof is in the pudding. The inflation \n     where the metal meets the meat is double digit. We are making \n     choices that people who make six figures a year would never \n     believe. We went from middle class to no class. Every penny \n     at the pump means another though choice at the dinner table. \n     We have to drive to go to work to keep the lights on. There \n     is no choice. We have no buses, no subway, and I don't own a \n     horse. So I get up and get in my American Made truck and \n     drive to a pump where a company who posts record profits but \n     says they are not making any money, gouges me. They should \n     just stand there with a gun and rob me, at least I would feel \n     like I was treated like a man. They would be up front and in \n     my face. No, instead they hide behind Congressmen and a \n     president they have bought with campaign cash.\n       The more and more I think about this as I write it, the \n     more and more I think the system is broke. We cry out to our \n     elected people in Washington for help. There is a lot of good \n     talk about how they are going to help us, but nothing ever \n     happens. We spend too much money on nothing getting done. If \n     we were running Washington DC like a business we would be \n     bankrupt.\n       Mike, I am not attacking you, I support you. You won me \n     over when you came to my town when Boise Cascade left. But I \n     feel you are a working man in a land of people that believe \n     we are here so they can serve in Congress. I believe you know \n     you are there because we put you there. I hope and pray you \n     can find a solution to this madness. The fix has to come now \n     not next year. Smaller countries set the fuel price and they \n     pick up the difference. This is how the economy in those \n     countries is not failing. When Ma Bell got too big you all \n     regulated them. When the cable company got too big you \n     regulated them. When the electric company got too big you \n     regulated them. Where is the regulation on the oil \n     companies? They have shown time and time again that they \n     cannot police their own activities. They will root around \n     in your pockets while you are filling up your car just to \n     take the last bit of cash you have. Americans have more \n     debt now than ever. I know I was debt free three years \n     ago. Now, I am strapped. On the edge of losing it all. I \n     don't have a flat screen TV, no gold silverware. Nothing \n     big and new. Just trying to get by. Putting milk on a \n     credit card. What are we to do? People say we are going to \n     pull out of this soon. I say we will only pull out of this \n     when the energy prices go down. How can anyone but big oil \n     make any more money to pay its employees more money? They \n     cannot, so if I cannot get paid more, then the costs have \n     to go down for me to have more.\n       Just my thoughts.\n     Jason Speer, Cascade.\n                                  ____\n\n       This may be late, however, I still think you should know my \n     story. I am sure it is not much different from many others \n     across our state or America.\n       I own a small cleanup business that services new \n     construction job sites. I started the\n\n[[Page S825]]\n\n     business just over six years ago. I drive anywhere between \n     100 to 150 miles a day--most of which is miles driving to and \n     from the Ada County landfill (2 to 3 trips a day). I am \n     easily putting $50+ a day of fuel into my truck. I drive a \n     Chevrolet Silverado 2500 HD pulling a dump bed trailer. \n     Basically, I am going through a lot of fuel. The prices are \n     up considerably from a year ago. With the continued rise of \n     fuel, I am given two choices. 1) Ask my builders for more \n     money to pay for the fuel, or 2) Quit my business. Both \n     choices will have a chain reaction in how it affects my life \n     (well-being). My builders will complain. Some will understand \n     and be willing to pay more, others will not want my business \n     because my prices are too high. If I quit my business, I will \n     then have to find other means of income for my family. Six \n     plus years of building a business is a hard thing to give up \n     on. The housing industry in Idaho is not very good right now \n     and with the low amount of work, it affects my income. I \n     currently am making just enough to meet costs. With the \n     addition of high fuel costs it hits me twice as hard.\n       I do not know what the right answer is to make things \n     better. Off shore drilling for the United States will not \n     have an effect for many years. The people of Idaho and \n     elsewhere need help now. I do not know much about law or the \n     principles of supply and demand--but it would sure be nice if \n     the government could somehow make a drastic cut in fuel \n     prices. I too would like to take vacations around the state \n     or to Utah to see family. This past weekend it cost $110.00 \n     for my family to make a round trip to Salt Lake City from \n     Nampa. We have a Honda Accord. It will most likely be the \n     only trip we take for the rest of the year.\n       Sorry for all the mistakes in my writing. I have so much on \n     my mind when it comes to my family's well-being, my business, \n     and fuel prices.\n       I'd be happy to share more information.\n     Jonathan Plummer, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       Hello Mike, if you want the answer, here it is. I have \n     traveled this nation throughout my life. I know that from \n     Alaska to California there are thousands of oil wells that \n     sit idle, not pumping at all, at current use over a 150 years \n     of oil in the ground, already drilled no exploration needed, \n     no problems with environmentalists, that is not to mention \n     the millions of gallons of oil that is pumped from the \n     Alaska pipeline directly on to tankers only to leave our \n     country (USA) to be sold to BP or some other company. The \n     Alaska pipeline in the 70's was promised to the American \n     people (one-third of the oil pumped out of the ground in \n     Alaska is pumped back into the ground because the line \n     can't handle it). Now to talk about refineries, the \n     American people have been told we do not have any \n     refineries, we have them in Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, \n     Texas, California . . . four of the major oil companies in \n     the USA are held by one holding company, the last I heard, \n     what they are doing is called price fixing (which is \n     against the law, remember the breakup of Microsoft?). Our \n     government chooses to buy our oil from terrorists, only to \n     support further war, help to build indoor ski resorts (in \n     the desert) and manmade islands some of the largest \n     construction projects ever attempted, at the expense of \n     the American people and our economy. When will we stand up \n     for ourselves? ``Even China has.'' We need to use our own \n     oil (reserves) say no more to the oil companies (break \n     them up like in the 1900s) take control for our country \n     and not let big business run it. ``Regardless of greed'' \n     this is our country and our economy. If the economy fails, \n     what good is money (we are on reserve note not gold \n     standard)? Is not our government supposed to be by the \n     people for the people? I can show a direct correlation \n     between the down turn in the economy and fuel prices. Our \n     soldiers are in the Middle East fighting a war we cannot \n     win, and the Terrorists are winning the 911 war by \n     destroying our core (economy) by controlling the cost of \n     our energy (fuel) and we just sit idle. Our government \n     says, in part, it is because we need to go green, but \n     autos are less than 10 percent of the problem.\n       Here it is:\n       Use our reserves (oil in our ground).\n       Give the Alaska pipe line back to the people.\n       Take our pocket book out of it (political investors).\n       Tell OPEC what we will pay (not what they will have us \n     pay).\n       Break up the oil companies (price fixing is against the \n     law).\n       Let the Middle East take care of themselves. The only value \n     they have is the value the world puts on them. If they are \n     worth nothing then they are nothing.\n       Brazil is 100 percent self sufficient and fuel is less than \n     $1.50 a gallon.\n       We need to stand up and say no, we will use our own oil, \n     you would be amazed how fast the prices would drop, but we \n     would still need to say no, so we can control it and keep \n     control of it (in our country anyway).\n       Of the people by the people we are the U.S.A.\n     Richard Stephens, Caldwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/26/senate-section/article/S825-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                     TRIBUTE TO OPERATION HOMEFRONT\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish today to honor in the \nRecord of the Senate an organization that is doing phenomenal work on \nbehalf of military families across Georgia.\n  Operation Homefront Georgia is located in Marietta, GA, and is a \ncharter member of the Operation Homefront national organization that \nwas founded after the horrific attacks on 9/11. The organization \nprovides emergency assistance and morale to our troops, to the families \nthey leave behind and to wounded warriors when they return home. For \nexample, if a military veteran is unable to pay his or her mortgage due \nto injury or stress from war, Operation Homefront Georgia finds the \nmoney needed for the mortgage. If a soldier needs a wheelchair lift in \nhis or her home, Operation Homefront Georgia finds a company that will \ninstall it for free. The individuals who are a part of this \norganization are truly miracle workers.\n  Operation Homefront Georgia is made up mostly of women, some men, but \nmostly ladies that leave work every day knowing that they made a \ndifference in somebody's life. My office knows that when Operation \nHomefront Georgia calls, there is a dire situation on the line and we \ndo all we can to help. They don't take no for an answer, and their \ninsistence pays off.\n  Our men and women who are going off to fight should be able to know \ntheir loved ones at home are safe and sound. With Operation Homefront \nGeorgia, they don't have to worry. This fine organization makes sure \nour soldiers return with dignity to a well taken care of family.\n  On behalf of a grateful Nation, I thank them for all they do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/26/senate-section/article/S825-2", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   TRIBUTE TO DR. PHILLIP LEE ROBERTS\n\n Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I wish to join with my colleague \nSenator Chambliss to honor in the Record of the Senate Dr. Phillip Lee \nRoberts, oncologist and medical director of the Phoebe Cancer Center at \nPhoebe Putney Memorial Hospital in Albany, GA.\n  For decades, Dr. Roberts has diagnosed and treated patients in \nsouthwest Georgia with a record of care and devotion that is above and \nbeyond the call of duty in his profession. In recognition of his \nremarkable work in the field of cancer treatment, Phoebe Putney Health \nSystem is dedicating its new cancer pavilion as the Phillip L. Roberts, \nM.D. Cancer Pavilion.\n  When Dr. Roberts began his practice in Albany in 1980, there were few \noncologists south of Macon, GA. At that time, a diagnosis of cancer was \noften a death sentence. Dr. Roberts has seen the progression of cancer \ntreatment from the earliest drugs and radiation treatment to the modern \nmethods now used to fight the disease. Today, the progression of \nmedicine and technology allows this remarkable doctor to deliver a \nmessage of hope rather than despair to his patients.\n  Through the years, as technology and cancer treatments have advanced, \nhis steadfast dedication to his patients and his profession has \nremained strong. Well into his golden years, Dr. Roberts is still at \nthe helm of one of the busiest cancer centers in the southeastern \nUnited States. He has yet to slow his pace or his professional battle \nagainst the disease he fights daily on behalf of his patients. Not only \ndoes he continue a full schedule with patients at Phoebe, he travels \nweekly to treat patients at clinics in outlying rural areas, where \naccess to health care is still limited and unattainable for many due to \neconomic and social roadblocks.\n  I am pleased to join Senator Chambliss in acknowledging the great \nwork that is done each day at the Phoebe Cancer Center and the efforts \nof Dr. Roberts over the past 36 years to provide high quality cancer \ncare. Dr. Roberts certainly deserves this recognition, and we offer our \nsincerest congratulations on the dedication of the Phillip L. Roberts, \nM.D. Cancer Pavilion.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/26/senate-section/article/S825-3", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/26/senate-section/article/S825-4", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S825-S826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages\n\n[[Page S826]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States submitting sundry nominations \nwhich were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/01/26/senate-section/article/S826-1", "month": "01", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 2:03 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following joint resolution, in which it requests the \nconcurrence of the Senate:\n\n       H.J.

A bill to resolve water rights claims of the White Mountain \nApache Tribe in the State of Arizona, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Indian Affairs.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, today I am pleased to introduce the White \nMountain Apache Tribe Water Rights Quantification Act of 2009. The \nlegislation would authorize and confirm the tribe's water settlement \nand authorize funding for a key drinking water project on the tribe's \nreservation in northern Arizona--the Miner Flat Dam and Reservoir. The \nlegislation is the product of nearly 3 years of negotiation and the \ntremendous work of the settlement parties.\n  On behalf of the tribe, the United States filed substantial claims to \nwater in the Gila River and Little Colorado River General Stream \nadjudications in Arizona. The settlement of these claims would, among \nother things, resolve the tribe's claims to water by allocating to it a \ntotal annual water right of 52,000 acre-feet per year through a \ncombination of surface water and Central Arizona Project water sources. \nWithout a settlement, resolution of the tribe's claims would take many \nyears, entail great expense, prolong uncertainty concerning the \navailability of water supplies, and seriously impair the long-term \neconomic well-being of all of the parties to the settlement.\n  Late last year, the representatives of the non-federal water \nsettlement parties indicated that a settlement was nearly finalized. \nThe parties' representatives expressed their written support for the \nsettlement and indicated that they will be submitting the settlement to \ntheir respective governing bodies for review and action. A number of \nthe parties, including the White Mountain Apache Tribe, have already \nformally approved the settlement.\n  A major factor driving the settlement is the drinking water needs of \nthe White Mountain Apache Tribe. Currently, a relatively small well \nfield serves the drinking water needs of the majority of the residents \non the tribe's reservation, but production from the wells has declined \nsignificantly over the last few years. As a result, the tribe has \nexperienced summer drinking water shortages. The tribe is planning to \nconstruct a relatively small diversion project on the North Fork of the \nWhite River on its reservation this year. It indicates that when the \nproject is completed it will replace most of the lost production from \nthe existing well field, but will not produce enough water to meet the \ndemand of the tribe's growing population. The Miner Flat Project would \nprovide a longterm solution for the tribe's drinking water shortages.\n  A significant percentage of the water and funding for the White \nMountain Apache settlement has already been set aside in legislation I \nsponsored, the Arizona Water Settlements Act. The Arizona Water \nSettlements Act, which became law in 2004, settled expensive and \nlengthy litigation concerning the Gila River Indian Community's rights \nto Gila River water and other water supplies, and the claims of the \nTohono O'odham Nation for damages from groundwater pumping in southern \nArizona. It also set aside 67,300 acre-feet of Central Arizona Project, \nCAP, water per year to resolve Indian water claims in Arizona and \nestablished a $250 million fund for future Arizona Indian water \nsettlements.\n  Under the White Mountain Apache Tribe's settlement legislation, a \nportion of the CAP water set aside in the Arizona Water Settlements Act \nwill be used to settle the White Mountain Apache Tribe's claims and a \nportion of the $250 million will be used to construct the Miner Flat \nProject. While a potential scoring issue exists relating to the use of \nthese funds, I am confident that these issues will be resolved as the \nlegislation progresses.\n  In sum, not only would the legislation I have introduced today \nprovide certainty to water users in the State of Arizona regarding \ntheir future water supplies, it would provide the tribe with a long-\nterm reliable source of drinking water. Therefore, I urge my colleagues \nto support this legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \nletters of support be printed int he Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 313\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``White Mountain Apache Tribe \n     Water Rights Quantification Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

We understand that authorizations for \n     appropriations included within the draft legislation are \n     still subject to agreement between you and the White Mountain \n     Apache Tribe.\n         Robert Brauchli, White Mountain Apache Tribe; John \n           Weldon, Salt River Project; Frederic Beeson, Salt River \n           Project; Lauren Caster, Arizona Water Company; David \n           Brown, City of Show Low; Michael J.

Jon Kyl,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Kyl: I am writing as counsel for the Central \n     Arizona Water Conservation District regarding legislation to \n     authorize a settlement of the water rights claims of the \n     White Mountain Apache Tribe. As you know, my staff and I have \n     been personally involved in the negotiations to settle the \n     water rights claims of the Tribe. My staff and I have had the \n     opportunity to review the most recent drafts of the \n     authorizing legislation and the settlement agreement and we \n     intend to recommend approval of the settlement to our \n     governing Board. In our judgment, the proposed settlement is \n     consistent with the Arizona Water Settlements Act and \n     represents an important step forward in Arizona's efforts to \n     resolve outstanding Indian water rights claims. We look \n     forward to continuing to work with you and the other members \n     of the Arizona congressional delegation in bringing this \n     important settlement to fruition.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Douglas K. Miller,\n                                           General Counsel, CAWCD.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 315. A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \noutreach activities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, Senator Sanders and I are introducing \nthe Veterans Outreach Improvement Act which will help to ensure that \nall of our veterans know about Federal benefits to which they may be \nentitled by improving outreach programs. I introduced similar \nlegislation in the 108, 109, and 110 Congresses. I am also pleased to \nnote that there is a companion bill in the House, H.R. 32, sponsored by \nRepresentative McIntyre. Last year, the House Veterans' Affairs \nSubcommittee on Disability Assistance and Memorial Affairs approved the \nbill by a voice vote.\n  I would like to thank the junior Senator from Hawaii for working with \nme to improve outreach to veterans. This year, he has introduced an \nomnibus veterans health care bill, S. 252, which includes a provision \ncreating a grant program for organizations that, among other things, \nperform outreach to veterans. At my request, this grant program was \nextended to include State and local agencies that conduct outreach to \nveterans, consistent with provisions of my outreach bill. I greatly \nappreciate the Chairman's willingness to consider the key role these \nagencies play in ensuring that veterans receive the benefits they have \nmore than earned. I would also like to thank Senator Sanders for \nworking with me to expand the scope of this grant program.\n  Based on Senator Akaka's recommendations, I have made a few changes \nto my outreach bill this year. He has informed me of the special need \nto increase outreach to veterans in rural areas. I have modified my \noutreach bill to reflect this important need.\n  I was extremely troubled by revelations of gaps in care as \nservicemembers transition to the VA that emerged as a result of \ninvestigations of the Walter Reed Army Medical Center. I appreciate the \nDepartment of Defense and Department of Veterans Affairs' attempts to \nremedy these gaps, but more work remains to be done. It can be \nextremely difficult for veterans to navigate the VA's health care and \nbenefits systems. This bill will increase congressional oversight of \nthe VA's outreach activities and authorize the Secretary of Veterans \nAffairs to work with State, local and community-based organizations to \nperform outreach.\n  Several years ago, the Wisconsin Department of Veterans Affairs, \nWDVA, launched a statewide program called ``I Owe You.'' The program \nencourages veterans to apply, or to re-apply, for benefits that they \nearned from their service in the U.S. military.\n  As part of this program, WDVA has sponsored several events around \nWisconsin called ``Supermarkets of Veterans Benefits'' at which \nveterans can begin the process of learning whether they qualify for \nFederal benefits from the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA. These \nevents, which are based on a similar program in Georgia, supplement the \nwork of Wisconsin's County Veterans Service Officers and veterans \nservice organizations by helping our veterans to reconnect with the VA \nand to learn more about services and benefits for which they may be \neligible. More than 11,000 veterans and their families have attended \nthe supermarkets, which include information booths with representatives \nfrom WDVA, VA, and veterans service organizations, as well as a variety \nof Federal, State, and local agencies. I was proud to have members of \nmy staff speak with veterans and their families at a number of these \nevents. These events have helped veterans and their families to learn \nabout numerous topics, including health care, how to file a disability \nclaim, and preregistration for internment in veterans cemeteries.\n  The Institute for Government Innovation at Harvard University's \nKennedy School of Government recognized the ``I Owe You'' program by \nnaming it a semi-finalist for the 2002 Innovations in American \nGovernment Award. The program was also featured in the March/April 2003 \nissue of Disabled American Veterans Magazine.\n  In order to help to facilitate consistent implementation of VA's \noutreach responsibilities around the country, my bill would help to \nimprove outreach activities performed by the VA in three ways. First, \nit would create separate funding line items for outreach activities \nwithin the budgets of\n\n[[Page S834]]\n\nthe VA and its agencies, the Veterans Health Administration, the \nVeterans Benefits Administration, and the National Cemetery \nAdministration to ensure oversight of the VA's outreach activities. \nSecondly, the bill would create an intra-agency structure to require \nthe Office of the Secretary, the Office of Public Affairs, the VBA, the \nVHA, and the NCA to coordinate outreach activities. By working more \nclosely together, the VA components would be able to consolidate their \nefforts, share proven outreach mechanisms, and avoid duplication of \neffort that could waste scarce funding. Finally, the bill would give \nthe VA grantmaking authority to award funds to State, local and \ncommunity-based organizations to conduct outreach activities such as \nthe WDVA's ``I Owe You Program.''\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Akaka and the members of the \nSenate Veteran Affairs Committee to make the veteran outreach grant \nprogram a success. As we continue to deploy members of the Armed \nServices overseas at a staggering pace, it is essential that we ensure \na smooth transition into the VA for all veterans in need of care. It is \nthe least we can do.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. LINCOLN (for herself, Mr. Crapo, Mr. Alexander, Mr. \n        Pryor, Mr. Cornyn, Ms. Cantwell, Ms. Landrieu, Mrs. Murray, and \n        Mr. Vitter):\n  S. 316. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to make \npermanent the reduction in the rate of tax on qualified timber gain of \ncorporations, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, I am very pleased to rise today to \nintroduce the Timber Revitalization and Economic Enhancement Act II of \n2009 with my good friend, Senator Crapo of Idaho. I also want to say a \nspecial thanks to our cosponsors, Senators Alexander, Pryor, Cornyn, \nCantwell, Landrieu, Murray, and Vitter.\n  This legislation has commonly been referred to as the TREE Act. I \nappreciate that Congress understood the importance of the TREE Act with \nits inclusion and enactment in the Farm Bill last year. But, \nunfortunately, this tax policy is already set to expire in May. So \ntoday, my colleagues and I introduce the TREE Act II to make this \nimportant forest policy permanent.\n  In my home State of Arkansas, the forest products industry is a \nfoundation of our economy and culture. More than 50 percent of Arkansas \nland is forested. Much of this is sustainably managed to create \nproducts we use every day. In addition, there are jobs associated with \nthe growing of these forests and manufacture of these great products. \nMore than 32,000 Arkansas men and women work in our woods, at our \nsawmills and in our paper mills. These are good jobs located in our \nsmall rural towns.\n  However, these jobs and this industry continue to face many \nchallenges. During this economic crisis, the forest products industry \nhas suffered greater dislocation than many others, and since 2006 has \nlost more than 181,000 jobs or roughly 14 percent of our workforce. The \nwood products industry has been particularly hard hit with 20 percent \ndrops in employment. In Arkansas the impact is even greater, with a \npredicted 24 percent job loss in the wood products industry.\n  The TREE Act II helps address these challenges. Just as it is \nimportant to have diversity in our forests, it is also important to \nmaintain diversity in our forestry industry, and we must ensure that \nall business forms have the necessary tools so they can be successful \nin the global marketplace. Timber companies that are organized as \ncorporations continue to be under intensifying pressure to reorganize. \nIn that case, a corporation that owns substantial manufacturing \nfacilities would be forced to sell some of those facilities and to make \nother structural changes in order to comply with the relevant tax rules \nthat it would newly become subject to. This would likely cause \ndisruptions in many of these communities and would also make it harder \nfor U.S. companies to compete internationally.\n  In Arkansas, like so many other States across our Nation, a strong \nforest product industry is essential to having a strong economy. A \npermanent solution to the TREE Act II is imperative for this industry \nand supporting the jobs it provides. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to ensure this important tax \npolicy is made permanent.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD.\n  S. 317. A bill to repeal the provision of law that provides automatic \npay adjustments for Members of Congress; to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to reintroduce legislation \nthat would put an end to automatic pay raises for Members of Congress.\n  As I have noted when I raised this issue in past years, because \nCongress has the authority to raise its own pay, something that most of \nour constituents cannot do, it ought to exercise that authority openly, \nand subject to regular procedures including debate, amendment, and a \nvote on the record.\n  Regrettably, current law allows Congress to avoid that open debate \nand public vote. All that is necessary for Congress to get a pay raise \nis that nothing be done to stop it. The annual pay raise takes effect \nunless Congress acts to prevent it.\n  This stealth system of pay raises began with a change Congress \nenacted in the Ethics Reform Act of 1989. On occasion, Congress has \nvoted to deny itself the raise, and the traditional vehicle for the pay \nraise vote is the Treasury or more recently the Financial Services \nAppropriations bill. But as I have noted before, that vehicle is not \nalways made available to those who want a public debate and vote on the \nmatter. Last year, for example, Congress enacted a consolidated \nappropriations bill in which all but three appropriations bills were \nincluded. The traditional vehicle for the pay raise vote, the Financial \nServices Appropriations bill, was included in the massive consolidated \nappropriations bill, along with funding for eight other appropriations \nbills. Amendments to that consolidated appropriations bill were \neffectively shut off, thus, in particular, preventing any amendment \nthat would have stopped the automatic pay raise from going into effect \nthree months later in January of 2009. I voted against the consolidated \nappropriations bill in part because it did not permit an up or down \nvote on the Member pay raise.\n  Sadly this is not an uncommon situation. As I have noted in the past, \ngetting a vote on the annual congressional pay raise is a haphazard \naffair at best, and it should not be that way. The burden should not be \non those who seek a public debate and recorded vote on the Member pay \nraise. On the contrary, Congress should have to act if it decides to \naward itself a hike in pay. This process of pay raises without \naccountability must end.\n  This issue is not a new question. It was something that our Founders \nconsidered from the beginning of our Nation. In August of 1789, as part \nof the package of 12 amendments advocated by James Madison that \nincluded what has become our Bill of Rights, the House of \nRepresentatives passed an amendment to the Constitution providing that \nCongress could not raise its pay without an intervening election. On \nSeptember 9, 1789, the Senate passed that amendment. In late September \nof 1789, Congress submitted the amendments to the States.\n  Although the amendment on pay raises languished for 2 centuries, in \nthe 1980s, a campaign began to ratify it. While I was a member of the \nWisconsin State Senate, I was proud to help ratify the amendment. Its \napproval by the Michigan legislature on May 7, 1992, gave it the needed \napproval by \\3/4\\ of the States.\n  The 27th Amendment to the Constitution now states: ``No law, varying \nthe compensation for the services of the senators and representatives, \nshall take effect, until an election of representatives shall have \nintervened.''\n  I honor that limitation. Throughout my 6-year term, I accept only the \nrate of pay that Senators receive on the date on which I was sworn in \nas a Senator. And I return to the Treasury any additional income \nSenators get, whether from a cost-of-living adjustment or a pay raise \nwe vote for ourselves. I don't take a raise until my bosses, the people \nof Wisconsin, give me one at the ballot box. That is the spirit of the \n27th Amendment. At the very least, the stealth pay raises like the one \nthat Congress allowed for 2009 certainly violate the spirit of that \namendment.\n\n[[Page S835]]\n\n  This practice must end and this bill will end it. Senators and \nCongressmen should have to vote up-or-down to raise their pay, and my \nbill would require just that. We owe our constituents nothing less.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 317\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove access to health care under the Medicare program for \nbeneficiaries residing in rural areas; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Medicare \nRural Health Access Improvement Act of 2009.\n  The purpose of this legislation is to continue ongoing efforts to \nensure that Americans in rural areas have access to health care \nservices. Much has been done in the past to improve access to rural \nproviders such as hospitals and doctors. Much more still needs to be \ndone. And it is even more important in light of the economic challenges \nwe face.\n  I hold town meetings in each of the 99 counties in the great state of \nIowa every year. As many know, Iowa is largely a rural state, and a \nsignificant concern that I consistently hear during these meetings is \nthe difficulty my constituents experience in accessing health care \nservices. As the former Chairman and currently the Ranking Member of \nthe Finance Committee, it has therefore been a priority for me to \nimprove the availability of health care in rural areas.\n  In Iowa, as in many rural areas across the country, hospitals are \noften not only the sole provider of health care in rural areas, but \nalso employers and purchasers in the community. Moreover, the presence \nof a hospital is essential for purposes of economic development because \nbusinesses check to see if a hospital is in the community in which they \nmight set up shop. As you can see, it is vital that these institutions \nare able to keep their doors open.\n  In previous legislation, Congress has been able to improve the \nfinancial viability of rural hospitals. For instance, the creation and \nsubsequent improvements to the Critical Access Hospital designation \nhave greatly improved the financial health of certain small rural \nhospitals and ensured that community residents have access to health \ncare.\n  However, there are still a group of rural hospitals that need help. I \nam referring to what are known as ``tweener'' hospitals, which are too \nlarge to be Critical Access Hospitals, but too small to be financially \nviable under the Medicare hospital prospective payment systems. These \nfacilities are struggling to stay afloat despite their tireless \nefforts. Like in many communities in across the country, the staff of \ntweener hospitals and their community residents take great pride in the \nquality of care at these facilities. I have heard countless stories of \nthe exemplary work tweener hospitals in Iowa perform not only as \nproviders of essential health care, but also as responsible members of \ntheir communities. It is for this reason that many provisions in this \nbill are intended to improve the financial health of tweener hospitals \nand ensure that people have access to health care.\n  Most tweener hospitals are currently designated as Medicare Dependent \nHospitals and Sole Community Hospitals under the Medicare program. \nThere are provisions, both temporary and permanent, included in this \nbill that would improve Medicare payments for both types of hospitals. \nThis includes improvements to the payment methodologies so that \ninpatient payments to Medicare Dependent Hospitals would better reflect \nthe costs they incur in providing care. Improvements are also proposed \nin this bill to Medicare hospital outpatient payments for both Medicare \nDependent Hospitals and Sole Community Hospitals so they would both \nshare the benefit of hold harmless payments and add-on payments.\n  Also, a major driver of the financial difficulties that tweener \nhospitals face is the fact that many have relatively low volumes of \ninpatient admissions. This bill would improve the existing low-volume \nadd-on payment for hospitals so that more rural facilities with low \nvolumes would receive the assistance they desperately need.\n  Over the years, many have commented that it is simply unfair for many \nrural hospitals to receive only a limited amount of Medicare \nDisproportionate Share Hospital, or DSH, payments while many urban \nhospitals are not subject to such a cap. This bill would eliminate the \ncap for DSH payments for those rural hospitals for a two-year period.\n  There are also other provisions that would continue to help rural \nhospitals. The rural flexibility program would be extended for an \nadditional year. This essential program provides valuable resources for \nrural hospitals.\n  This legislation also seeks to improve incentives for physicians \nlocated in rural areas and increase beneficiaries' access to rural \nhealth care providers. It includes provisions designed to reduce \ninequitable disparities in physician payment resulting from the \nGeographic Practice Cost Indices, or adjusters, known as GPCIs. \nMedicare payment for physician services varies from one area to another \nbased on the geographic adjustments for a particular area. Geographic \nadjustments are intended to reflect cost differences in a given area \ncompared to a national average of 1.0 so that an area with costs above \nthe national average would have an index greater than 1.0, and an area \nbelow the national average would have an index less than 1.0. There are \ncurrently three geographic adjustments: for physician work, practice \nexpense, and malpractice expense.\n  Unfortunately, the existing geographic adjusters result in \nsignificant disparities in physician reimbursement which penalize, \nrather than equalize, physician payment in Iowa and other rural States. \nThese geographic disparities in payment lead to rural states \nexperiencing significant difficulties in recruiting and retaining \nphysicians and other health care professionals due to their \nsignificantly lower reimbursement rates.\n  These disparities have perverse effects when it comes to realigning \nMedicare payment to reward quality of care. Let me put that into \ncontext. Iowa is widely recognized as providing some of the highest \nquality health care in the country yet Iowa physicians receive some of \nthe lowest Medicare reimbursement due to these inequitable geographic \nadjustments. Medicare reimbursement for some procedures is at least 30 \npercent lower in Iowa than payment for those very procedures in other \nparts of the country. That is a significant disincentive for Iowa \nphysicians who are providing some of the best quality care in the \ncountry, and it is fundamentally unfair. Congress needs to reduce these \ndisparities in payment and focus on rewarding physicians who provide \nhigh quality care.\n  The inequitable geographic payment formulas have also exacerbated the \nproblems that rural areas face in terms of access to health care. Rural \nAmerica today has far fewer physicians per capita than urban areas. The \nGPCI formulas are a dismal failure in promoting an adequate supply of \nphysicians in states like Iowa, and more severe physician shortages in \nrural areas are predicted in the future.\n  The legislation I am introducing today makes changes in the GPCI \nformulas for work and practice expense to reverse this trend. It \nrecognizes the equality of physician work in all geographic areas and \nestablishes a national value of 1.0 for the physician work adjustment. \nIt establishes a practice expense floor of 1.0 floor and revises the \ncalculation of the practice expense formula to reduce payment \ndifferences and more accurately compensate physicians in rural areas \nfor\n\n[[Page S836]]\n\ntheir true practice costs. These changes are needed to help rural \nstates recruit and retain more physicians so that beneficiaries will \ncontinue to have access to needed health care.\n  Last year Congress enacted a number of other provisions to improve \nMedicare payment for health care professionals and providers in rural \nareas that will expire at the end of 2009. This bill extends the \nexisting payment arrangements which allow independent laboratories to \nbill Medicare directly for certain physician pathology services through \n2010. It extends and improves the rural ambulance payments enacted in \nthe Medicare Improvements for Providers and Patients Act of 2008 by \nincreasing payments from three to five percent and extending them an \nadditional year, through 2010. The bill also includes several new \nprovisions to improve beneficiary access to health care services. It \npermanently increases the payment limits for rural health clinics. It \nalso allows physician assistants to order post-hospital extended care \nservices and to serve hospice patients.\n  Finally, the bill would protect rural areas from being adversely \naffected by the new Medicare competitive bidding program for durable \nmedical equipment. It would ensure that home medical equipment \nsuppliers who provide equipment and services in rural areas and small \nmetropolitan statistical areas, MSAs, with a population of 600,000 or \nless can continue to serve the Medicare program by exempting these \nareas from competitive bidding. We must ensure that rural areas \ncontinue to have medical equipment suppliers available to serve \nbeneficiaries in these areas.\n  As you can see, we still have much to do when it comes to ensuring \naccess to health care in rural America. I look forward to working with \nmy colleagues on this important matter.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Durbin):\n  S. 319. A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide \ngrants to promote positive health behaviors in women and children; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, the legislation I am introducing today, \nentitled the Community Health Workers Act of 2009, will help improve \naccess to health education and outreach services to women and children \nin medically underserved areas, including the U.S. border region along \nNew Mexico.\n  Lack of access to adequate health care and health education is a \nsignificant problem on the southern New Mexico border. While the \nproblem of access is in part due to a lack of insurance, it is also \nattributable to non-financial barriers such as a shortage of \nphysicians, hospitals, and other health professionals; inadequate \ntransportation; a lack of bilingual health information and health \nproviders; and a culturally insensitive system of care.\n  This legislation would help overcome these impediments by providing \n$15 million in grants annually for a 3 year period to State, local, and \ntribal organizations, including community health centers and public \nhealth departments, for the purpose of hiring community health workers \nto provide health education, outreach, and referrals to women and \nfamilies who otherwise would have little or no contact with health care \nservices.\n  Factors such as poverty, language, and cultural differences impede \naccess to health care in medically underserved populations; hence, \ncommunity health workers are in a unique position to improve health \noutcomes and quality of care for groups that have traditionally lacked \naccess to adequate services. They often serve as ``community \nspecialists'' and are members of the communities in which they work. As \nsuch they can effectively serve hard-to-reach populations.\n  In a shining example of how community health workers serve their \ncommunities, a group of so-called ``Promotoras'', community health \nworkers, in Dona Ana County were quickly mobilized during a recent \nflood emergency in rural New Mexico. These community health workers \nassisted in the disaster recovery efforts by partnering with the \nFederal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA, to find, inform and register \nflood victims for Federal disaster assistance. Their personal networks \nand knowledge of the local culture, language, needs, assets, and \nbarriers greatly enhanced FEMA's community outreach efforts. The \nPromotoras of Dona Ana County demonstrate the important role community \nhealth workers could play in communities across the Nation, including \nincreasing the effectiveness of new initiatives in homeland security \nand emergency preparedness, and in implementing risk communication \nstrategies.\n  The positive benefits of the community health worker model also have \nbeen documented in research studies. Research has shown that community \nhealth workers have been effective in increasing the utilization of \nhealth preventive services such as cancer screenings and medical follow \nup for elevated blood pressure and improving enrollment in publicly \nfunded health insurance programs. In the case of uninsured children, a \nstudy by Dr. Glenn Flores, ``Community-Based Case Management in \nInsuring Uninsured Latino Children,'' published in the December 2005 \nissue of Pediatrics found that uninsured children who received \ncommunity-based case management were eight times more likely to obtain \nhealth insurance coverage than other children involved in the study \nbecause case workers were employed to address typical barriers to \naccess, including insufficient knowledge about application processes \nand eligibility criteria, language barriers and family mobility issues, \namong others. This study confirms that community health workers could \nbe highly effective in reducing the numbers of uninsured children, \nespecially those who are at greatest risk for being uninsured. \nPreliminary investigation of a community health workers project in New \nMexico similarly suggests that community health workers could be useful \nin improving enrollment in Medicaid and the State Children's Health \nInsurance Program.\n  According to a 2003 Institute of Medicine, IOM, report entitled, \n``Unequal Treatment: Confronting Racial and Ethnic Disparities in \nHealthcare,'' community health workers offer promise as a community-\nbased resource to increase racial and ethnic minorities' access to \nhealth care and to serve as a liaison between healthcare providers and \nthe communities they serve.\n  Although the community health worker model is valued in the New \nMexico border region as well as other parts of the country that \nencounter challenges of meeting the health care needs of medically \nunderserved populations, these programs often have difficulty securing \nadequate financial resources to maintain and expand upon their \nservices. As a result, many of these programs are significantly limited \nin their ability to meet the ongoing and emerging health demands of \ntheir communities.\n  The IOM report also noted that ``programs to support the use of \ncommunity health workers . . .  especially among medically underserved \nand racial and ethnic minority populations, should be expanded, \nevaluated, and replicated.''\n  I am introducing this legislation to increase resources for a model \nthat has shown significant promise for increasing access to quality \nhealth care and health education for families in medically underserved \ncommunities.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this statement and the \ntext of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 319\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Community Health Workers Act \n     of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Chronic diseases, defined as any condition that \n     requires regular medical attention or medication, are the \n     leading cause of death and disability for women in the United \n     States across racial and ethnic groups.\n       (2) According to the National Vital Statistics Report of \n     2001, the 5 leading causes of death among Hispanic, American \n     Indian, and African-American women are heart disease, cancer, \n     diabetes, cerebrovascular disease, and unintentional \n     injuries.\n       (3) Unhealthy behaviors alone lead to more than 50 percent \n     of premature deaths in the United States.\n       (4) Poor diet, physical inactivity, tobacco use, and \n     alcohol and drug abuse are the health risk behaviors that \n     most often lead to disease, premature death, and disability, \n     and\n\n[[Page S837]]\n\n     are particularly prevalent among many groups of minority \n     women.\n       (5) Over 60 percent of Hispanic and African-American women \n     are classified as overweight and over 30 percent are \n     classified as obese. Over 60 percent of American Indian women \n     are classified as obese.\n       (6) American Indian women have the highest mortality rates \n     related to alcohol and drug use of all women in the United \n     States.\n       (7) High poverty rates coupled with barriers to health \n     preventive services and medical care contribute to racial and \n     ethnic disparities in health factors, including premature \n     death, life expectancy, risk factors associated with major \n     diseases, and the extent and severity of illnesses.\n       (8) There is increasing evidence that early life \n     experiences are associated with adult chronic disease and \n     that prevention and intervention services provided within the \n     community and the home may lessen the impact of chronic \n     outcomes, while strengthening families and communities.\n       (9) Community health workers, who are primarily women, can \n     be a critical component in conducting health promotion and \n     disease prevention efforts in medically underserved \n     populations.\n       (10) Recognizing the difficult barriers confronting \n     medically underserved communities (poverty, geographic \n     isolation, language and cultural differences, lack of \n     transportation, low literacy, and lack of access to \n     services), community health workers are in a unique position \n     to reduce preventable morbidity and mortality, improve the \n     quality of life, and increase the utilization of available \n     preventive health services for community members.\n       (11) Research has shown that community health workers have \n     been effective in significantly increasing health insurance \n     coverage, screening and medical follow-up visits among \n     residents with limited access or underutilization of health \n     care services.\n       (12) States on the United States-Mexico border have high \n     percentages of impoverished and ethnic minority populations: \n     border States accommodate 60 percent of the total Hispanic \n     population and 23 percent of the total population below 200 \n     percent poverty in the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to require the Secretary of Homeland Security and the \nSecretary of State to accept passport cards at air ports of entry and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise today with Senators Tester and \nKlobuchar to introduce the Passport Card Travel Enhancement Act of 2009 \nin order to allow United States citizens to use passport cards for air \ntravel between the United States and Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and the \nCaribbean.\n  Over the past several years, the Departments of State, State, and \nHomeland Security, DHS, have worked hard to implement the Western \nHemisphere Travel Initiative, WHTI, as recommended by the National \nCommission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States. As part of \nthose efforts, State has developed the United States passport card as a \ncheaper, more portable alternative to a United States passport book. \nThe passport card is adjudicated to the exact same standards as the \npassport book and allows United States citizens to enter United States \nland and sea ports-of-entry from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean and \nBermuda, but the card does not allow for any air travel. In my mind, \nthis discrepancy makes no sense, and the passport card should allow for \nair travel between the United States and Canada, Mexico, Bermuda and \nthe Caribbean for several reasons.\n  First, prior to 2007, United States citizens rarely needed a passport \nto enter the United States by air from Canada, Mexico, Bermuda or the \nCaribbean. Rather, United States citizens were only required to satisfy \ninspecting officers of their identities and citizenship. This practice \nchanged in 2007, when WHTI went into effect for air travel. I think we \nall recall the events that occurred following WHTI air implementation, \nwhen State was deluged with passport applications, the time necessary \nto get a passport expanded from the typical four to six weeks to \nseveral months, and some Americans were forced to cancel trips. We need \nto avoid problems like that in the future by providing United States \ncitizens with more documents that comply with WHTI.\n  Further, State's ``Card Format Passport; Changes to Passport Fee \nSchedule'' final rule states that the passport card ``is not intended \nto be a globally interoperable travel document,'' and ``will not be \ndesigned to meet the International Civil Aviation Organization, ICAO, \nstandards and recommendations for globally interoperable passports,'' \nbut I do not believe that these facts mean that the passport card \ncannot be used for limited, western hemisphere air travel. In fact, I \nquestion whether globally interoperable passport standards and \nrecommendations need be met in order to use passport cards for the \nlimited flights allowed by the Passport Card Travel Enhancement Act of \n2009 because DHS's NEXUS card, which does not meet ICAO standards, is \ncurrently accepted as an alternative to a passport for some air travel \nbetween the United States and Canada.\n  Lastly, in today's current economic climate, I believe we must foster \nsecure, legitimate trade and tourism between the United States and our \nallies. Providing additional, less expensive ways for our constituents \nto comply with WHTI is good government and makes sense for our Nation's \nsecurity and economic prosperity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 321\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Passport Card Travel \n     Enhancement Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PASSPORT CARD DEFINED.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``passport card'' means the \n     document--\n       (1) known as a passport card that is issued to a national \n     of the United States on the same basis as a regular passport; \n     and\n       (2) that the Secretary of State began issuing during 2008.\n\n     SEC. 3. PASSPORT CARDS FOR AIR TRAVEL.\n\n       (a) Requirement to Accept Passport Cards for Air Travel.--\n     Notwithstanding any regulation issued by the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security or the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security and the Secretary of State shall permit a \n     passport card issued to a citizen of the United States to \n     serve as proof of identify and citizenship of such citizen if \n     such citizen is departing from or entering the United States \n     through an air port of entry for travel that terminates or \n     originates in--\n       (1) Bermuda;\n       (2) Canada;\n       (3) a foreign country located in the Caribbean; or\n       (4) Mexico.\n       (b) Fees for Passport Cards.--Neither the Secretary of \n     State or the Secretary of Homeland Security may increase, or \n     propose an increase to, the fee for issuance of a passport \n     card as a result of the requirements of subsection (a).\n       (c) Regulations.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State and the \n     Secretary of Homeland shall issue final regulations to \n     implement this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. McConnell (for himself, Mr. Kyl, Mr. Vitter, Mr. \n        Chambliss, Mr. Bunning, Mr. Gregg, Mr. Coburn, Mr. Burr, Mr. \n        Isakson, Mr. Graham, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Cornyn, Mr. Brownback, Mr. \n        Cochran, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Thune, Mr. DeMint, Mr. Bennett, and \n        Mr. Barrasso):\n  S. 326.

A bill to amend the Violence Against Women Act of 1994 and \nthe Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 to improve \nassistance to domestic and sexual violence victims and provide for \ntechnical corrections; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Improving \nAssistance to Domestic and Sexual Violence Victims Act of 2009 to make \nurgently needed improvements to the Violence Against Women Act, VAWA. \nThe bill makes corrections and improvements so that this law, a law \nthat has helped so many, can continue to serve as a powerful tool to \ncombat domestic violence and other crimes perpetrated against women and \nfamilies.\n  In introducing this measure, I recognize the leadership shown on \nthese issues by Senator Joe Biden who now serves as our Vice President. \nSince 1994, the Violence Against Women Act has been the centerpiece of \nthe Federal government's commitment to combating domestic violence and \nother violent crimes against women. Its passage and reauthorization \nmade a strong statement in support of the rights of women in America. \nThis landmark law filled a void in Federal law that had left too many \nvictims of domestic violence and sexual assault without the help they \nneeded.\n  Since the bill's passage, there has been a 27 to 51 percent increase \nin domestic violence reporting rates by women and a 37 percent increase \nin reporting rates by men. The number of individuals killed by an \nintimate partner has decreased by 24 percent for women and 48 percent \nfor men. I have been proud to work with then-Senator Biden on these \nmatters for the more than 15 years. I look forward to working with the \nObama-Biden administration to ensure that this law remains a vital \nresource for prosecutors, social workers, and all of those committed to \nending crimes against women and alleviating the terrible harms that \nresult from these crimes.\n  I crafted the legislation I introduce today with the assistance of \nadvocates and those in the field who work with the Violence Against \nWomen Act every day. It contains changes to VAWA that will improve the \nlaw's operation and implementation. I want to thank the National \nNetwork to End Domestic Violence, Legal Momentum, and the National \nCenter for Victims of Crime for their assistance with and support for \nthis legislation, and for their tireless work on behalf of women and \nfamilies in the United States. These groups and others across the \ncountry play a crucial role in fulfilling the promise that Congress \nmade with the enactment of the Violence Against Women Act.\n  Among several other fixes, the bill strengthens privacy protections \nfor victims of domestic violence. It contains provisions to ease the \nburden on victims of domestic violence to obtain public housing \nbenefits. It eliminates an existing loophole that often results in the \ninappropriate administration of polygraph examinations to victims of \nterrible crimes. The legislation also contains provisions to strengthen \nprotections in existing law for battered immigrant women. With these \nimportant changes to the Violence Against Women Act, Congress will \nensure that the law is as effective and strong as it was intended to be \nand that it can meet the needs of those it seeks to protect as we move \nforward. I hope all Senators will join in support of this effort.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nplaced in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 327\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Improving Assistance to \n     Domestic and Sexual Violence Victims Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of S. 328, introduced \nearlier today by Senator Rockefeller.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 328) to postpone the DTV transition date.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, on February 17, 2009--less than 1 \nmonth from today--our Nation is scheduled to make the transition to \ndigital television, or DTV. On this day, full-power television stations \nacross the country will stop broadcasting in analog and switch to \ndigital signals.\n  The way I see it, right now we have a choice. We can do the DTV \ntransition right or we can do it wrong. Doing it right would mean that \nas many as 21 million households across this country do not lose access \nto news, information and emergency alerts. Doing it right would mean \nthat every consumer who relies on over the-air television is aware of \nthe steps they need to take to ensure continued reception and receive \nthe assistance they need to prepare for the transition in their home. \nAnd doing it right means that no one across this land wakes up on \nFebruary 18 to find that their television set has gone dark.\n  But the shameful truth is that we are not poised to do this \ntransition right. We are only weeks away from doing it dreadfully \nwrong--and leaving consumers with the consequences. It is no secret \nthat the outgoing administration grossly mismanaged the digital \ntelevision transition. The coupon program that was designed to help \nconsumers defray the cost of converter boxes to ensure the continued \nfunctioning of their analog television sets has a waiting list of over \n2 million. This number will multiply to millions more in the weeks \nahead. Making a difficult situation even worse, we also face the \nfrightful specter of converter box shortages.\n  On top of this, consumers are aware of the transition, but confused \nabout its consequences. One study suggests that while recognition of \nthe transition is widespread, an alarming 63 percent have major \nmisconceptions about just what steps they need to take to prepare. \nCalling centers at the Department of Commerce and Federal \nCommunications Commission are ill-equipped to deal with the avalanche \nof calls that are expected on February 17 and in the days and weeks \nafter. Consumers will be on their own, forced to navigate through the \nmessy rubble of a botched transition.\n  I believe we can and should do better. Doing better means more than \ncobbling together the failed efforts of the last administration. Doing \nbetter requires more attention and more resources. But above all, it \nwill require more time--to get the DTV transition right.\n  This is why last week I introduced the DTV Delay Act. I asked the \nSenate to delay the date of the transition from February 17 to June 12, \n2009. This will give us the time we need to develop an approach that \nputs consumers first and provides them with the assistance they need.\n  In the interim, I have been working with the distinguished ranking \nmember of the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Committee, \nSenator Hutchison, to modify and improve\n\n[[Page S848]]\n\nthe language of my earlier bill in an effort to broaden support and \nspeed its passage.\n  I rise again today to introduce, now with my good friend Senator \nHutchison, an amended version of the DTV Delay Act. This version \nincorporates adjustments to help manage the transition in affected \ncommunities, including a provision that makes clear that despite this \ndate change the transition needs of broadcasters and public safety \nofficials will be respected.\n  Let me be clear. This legislation is not perfect. But it represents a \nturning point--a start. The record will reflect that I have spent years \nadvocating a different course. I voted against the Deficit Reduction \nAct of 2005, which set this hard date for the transition deep in the \nwinter. I voted against this bill in both the Commerce Committee and \nduring its consideration by the full Senate because it fell short of a \nreal plan for minimizing consumer disruption. I voted against this bill \nbecause it failed to spend any resources building a national \ninteroperable public safety communications network in the spectrum \nvacated by analog broadcasting. Voting no was by no means a popular \nthing to do. In fact, I was one of only three ``no'' votes in the \nCommerce Committee.\n  Last year, I introduced and the Congress passed the SAFER Act. This \nlegislation provided the Federal Communications Commission with \nauthority to extend analog television broadcasting so that essential \npublic safety announcements and DTV transition could be viewed in the \ndays following the February 17 transition. I now believe that this is \nnot enough. It is a meaningful bandage, but the situation we face \nrequires more intensive care.\n  The DTV Delay Act will not fix all of the problems associated with \nthe transition. More work needs to be done to ensure that consumers are \naware of the transition and get the help they need. But it gives us all \nthe time to do the transition right. Time to develop a new plan, time \nto implement a new set of ideas to manage the transition, and time to \nmake sure that in the switch to digital signals no American is left \nbehind. Senator Hutchison and I are committed to making sure every \nAmerican is able to manage the DTV transition without undue hardship. \nWe are working on initiatives to be included in the economic recovery \npackage. If we are able to make substantial progress on the \nadministration of the transition this should be the last delay we have \nto seek. Barring unforeseen emergencies, we should not have another \ndelay. I know the Obama administration shares our commitment to getting \nthis right so that we can avoid any further delays.\n  So we have a choice, we can proceed with the DTV Delay Act or weeks \nfrom today we can survey the wreckage of a failed effort to transition \nto digital broadcasting, complete with angry consumers, converter box \ntroubles, and calling centers overwhelmed with consumer complaints. \nWorse, should a tragedy strike, we face the prospect of millions of \nconsumers without access to television, without a lifeline for news and \ninformation that may be necessary to protect them from harm.\n  Again, we have a choice. And I know what I choose. I choose that we \ndelay this transition because I believe we owe the American people a \nsuccessful migration to digital television. Today will be the second \ntime that the majority leader has sought consent on the DTV Delay Act. \nWe simply can't keep coming back again and again to delay as time is \nrunning out. We must act now because we will not have the ability to \naddress consumer needs if we wait much longer.\n  I ask my colleagues to do the same. I warn those who would stand in \nthe way, who dismiss my sense of urgency, that should they force us to \nkeep to our current course, it is the American public who will bear the \nbrunt of their opposition. We owe our citizens so much more than this. \nSo I ask my colleagues to join me and support the DTV Delay Act.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I support the incoming chairman of the \nCommerce Committee as well as the President in the effort to delay the \ndigital television transition date because I believe that the Federal \nGovernment's first responsibility in administering this transition is \nto the consumers who stand to lose television reception in just 22 \ndays. On January 4, the National Telecommunications and Information \nAdministration, NTIA, announced that the program designated to \ndistribute coupons to consumers in need of digital converter boxes did \nnot have sufficient resources to meet program demand. Just over 2 weeks \nlater, more than 2.6 million requests for coupons, representing nearly \n1.5 million American households, have been placed on a waiting list. \nWithout an infusion of additional funds for this program, these coupons \nwill not be delivered.\n  Senator Rockefeller is advocating legislation to postpone the \nupcoming DTV transition date from February 17, 2009, until June 12, \n2009. I am a cosponsor of the Rockefeller bill. The legislation is a \nresponse to a January 8 letter sent by President Obama's transition \nteam co-chairman, John Podesta, which clearly stated the President's \nbelief that the DTV transition should be delayed.\n  A high percentage of Americans who rely on over the air broadcast \ntelevision are low-income or elderly and do not have the financial \nmeans to purchase a converter box without a coupon. If these households \ndo not have a converter box when the statutorily mandated switch to \ndigital television takes place, they will be left without access to \ncritical news, information and emergency broadcasts.\n  To ensure that every request for a coupon is met, Congress will need \nto appropriate additional funds for the coupon program. I support \nefforts to provide additional funding necessary to cover each and every \ncoupon request. I also support making additional funds available for \nthe outreach and education efforts that will be necessary to ensure as \nsmooth a transition as possible. In the coming weeks, the Senate will \nconsider economic stimulus legislation, and I hope this additional \nfunding will be included in this bill. Before we reach that point \nhowever, it is imperative that Congress delays the transition date so \nconsumers currently on the waiting list have sufficient time to receive \nand redeem their coupons.\n  There is no question that delaying the date will come with \nconsiderable cost to some parties. The Nation's broadcasters and cable \noperators have made considerable efforts to educate the public as to \nthe current date, and these efforts should be commended. A delayed \ntransition date will undoubtedly result in some increased cost to those \nresponsible for facilitating the transition. I am also aware that \nlicenses have been granted to operate in this spectrum after the \ntransition date. These licenses were issued to the winning bidders in \nlast year's 700 MHz spectrum auction, which resulted in nearly $20 \nbillion in Federal revenues. Additionally, public safety organizations \nacross the country have been issued licenses to operate in portions of \nthe spectrum following the February 17 statutory transition date. \nCongress, NTIA, and the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, should \nwork to mitigate economic injury wherever possible for all parties \ninvolved in the ongoing effort to execute a smooth transition.\n  I also agree with Ranking Member Hutchison's proposed changes to the \nchairman's legislation, which would permit the NTIA to reissue expired \ncoupons that go unused, extend the term of auctioned licenses by 116 \ndays, and clarify broadcasters' ability to transition to digital-only \ntransmission early, as well as the ability for public safety entities \nto have access to narrowband channels prior to the new deadline. These \nare important changes that will help to make the transition go \nsmoothly.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support the DTV Delay Act.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a \nRockefeller-Hutchison substitute amendment, which is at the desk, be \nagreed to; the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed; the \nmotions to reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening \naction or debate; and that any statements related to the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 38) was agreed to, as follows:\n\n             (Purpose: To postpone the DTV transition date)\n\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n[[Page S849]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

The clerk will report the resolution by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A resolution (S. Res. 21) to authorize testimony in the \n     United States of America v. Vincent J. Fumo, et al.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the \nresolution.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, this resolution concerns a subpoena for \ntestimony in a criminal case against former Pennsylvania State Senator \nVincent J. Fumo in the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Pennsylvania. In this case, Mr. Fumo and two others are \ncharged with multiple counts of conspiracy, fraud, obstruction of \njustice, and filing false tax returns. Among the charges is that Mr. \nFumo, as chairman of the Senate Democratic Appropriations Committee, \narranged for a friend, referred to as ``Senate Contractor No. 5'' in \nthe indictment, to obtain a contract under which he was paid $150,000 \nover 5 years, but performed little or no work. To rebut the allegation \nthat no work was performed under the contract, the defense has \nsubpoenaed Senator Specter's former chief of staff, David Urban, to \ntestify as a fact witness at trial as to contracts about and a meeting \nhe had with Senate Contractor No. 5 during that 5-year contract. During \nthat meeting, which was a typical meeting for a United States Senate \noffice, Senate Contractor No. 5 explored possible federal funding for a \nlow-income housing project in South Philadelphia. Neither the meeting \nnor the\n\n[[Page S850]]\n\nproject itself are the subject of the criminal complaint. Senator \nSpecter has no objection to allowing the testimony.\n  The enclosed resolution would authorize Mr. Urban to testify in this \nmatter.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nresolution be agreed to, the preamble be agreed to, the motions to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate, \nand any statements related to the resolution be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The resolution (S.
