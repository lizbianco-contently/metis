Mr. President, following leader remarks, there will be a \nperiod of morning business for 90 minutes, with Senators permitted to \nspeak for up to 10 minutes each. The majority will control the first 45 \nminutes and the Republicans will control the final 45 minutes.\n  Following morning business, the Senate will resume consideration of \nthe Interior Appropriations bill. Last night, I filed cloture on the \nbill and the substitute amendment. As a result, Senators must have \ntheir germane amendments filed at the desk prior to 1 p.m. today.\n  I also want to remind Senators there is a reception and buffet dinner \nin S. 211 tonight--that is the LBJ room--at 6 o'clock to celebrate \nHenry Clay in the Senate.\n  There is a wonderful story about a 150-year-old painting that was \ndiscovered. It is a magnificent painting, right outside these doors, \nand we will talk a little about that tonight. It is historic and a \ngreat way to recognize the success of this country over the years.\n  We will need to be out of session at 5:30 for the Senate reception \nroom to be swept by the security folks. This event is hosted by the \nSenate Commission on Art, and our spouses will be expecting us to be on \ntime.\n  I want to say also that 45 minutes of our time is going to be \ncontrolled by Democratic freshmen Senators. The American people are \ngoing to see here today the quality of the people who are new \nSenators--all successful prior to coming here, from many different \nwalks of life, men and women. As I have watched these past 9 months the \nbringing of these men and women into Senate business, I am so impressed \nand understand how they did so well before coming here. Today, they are \ngoing to talk about health care.\n  As an example of the quality of our Senators--and I am not going to \nrun through all the freshmen Senators--we have our Presiding Officer. \nThe Presiding officer had a long and successful career before coming to \nthe Senate as Attorney General of the State of New Mexico, as a long-\ntime Member of Congress, and now as a Member of this body.\n  I had one of the pleasures of my life a month or so ago in being able \nto go to New Mexico and spend about an hour with the Presiding \nOfficer's father--the historic Stewart Udall. What a wonderful visit we \nhad. We talked about his brother Morris Udall, whom I had the good \nfortune of being able to serve with in the House of Representatives. I \nam sure that Morris Udall is beaming up in Heaven that his son Mark is \nnow serving in the Senate.\n  What a quality group of people they are, and the American people are \ngoing to be seeing them in a few minutes as they talk about health \ncare. I don't know what they are going to talk about with regard to \nhealth care, but I can almost bet that one of the things all these fine \nSenators are going to say is that we do not have as an option in health \ncare to do nothing. The status quo will not work.\n\n[[Page S9694]]\n\n  Because of the monopolistic handle the insurance company has on \neverything that happens--all the profits being made by the insurance \nindustry, the pharmaceutical industry--the cost of health care is \nleaving 50 million American people uninsured, with many people losing \ntheir insurance. Today, 14,000 people will wake up in America with \nhealth insurance and go to bed without it. In the State of Nevada--\nsparsely populated, relatively speaking--220 people will wake up this \nmorning with health insurance and go to bed tonight losing it, 7 days a \nweek.\n  I admire and appreciate the freshmen Senators speaking out on the \nneed to do something about health care.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9694-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9694]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, yesterday afternoon I came to the floor \nto speak out against one of the tactics that supporters of the \nPresident's health care proposal have resorted to in recent days.\n  It appears that a particular Senator has encouraged the \nadministration to use its powers to clamp down on an opponent of the \nadministration's health care policy--to clamp down--to use the \nadministration to clamp down on an opponent of the President's health \ncare policy. What is more, the administration snapped to attention at \nthe Senator's request. It followed the Senator's advice and almost \nimmediately the government clamped down on a private health care \ncompany in my home State that had been sharing its concerns about the \nadministration's health care proposal with seniors on Medicare.\n  Yesterday, we saw how legitimate those concerns were when the \nDirector of the nonpartisan, independent Congressional Budget Office \nsaid the administration's proposed Medicare cuts would indeed lead to \nsignificant cuts in benefits to seniors.\n  Let me say that again. We had the Director of the Congressional \nBudget Office just yesterday confirm that what was said by this health \ninsurance company to its customers was true. Yesterday, we saw how \nlegitimate those concerns were when the Director of the nonpartisan, \nindependent Congressional Budget Office said that the administration's \nproposed Medicare cuts would indeed lead to significant cuts in \nbenefits to seniors. So a part of the administration is putting a gag \norder on a company for telling the truth to its customers.\n  First and foremost, this episode should be of serious concern to \nmillions of seniors on Medicare who deserve to know what the government \nhas in mind for their health care. But it should also frighten anyone--\nanyone--who cherishes their first amendment right to free speech, \nwhether in Louisville, Helena, MT, San Francisco, or anywhere else. It \nshould concern anyone who is already worried about a government \ntakeover of health care. Why? Because it seems that in order to advance \nits goals, the administration and its allies are now attacking citizens \ngroups and stifling free speech.\n  Let's review. At the instigation of the chairman of the Finance \nCommittee, the author of the health care legislation now working its \nway through Congress, the executive branch, through the Centers for \nMedicare and Medicaid Services, has launched an investigation--believe \nit or not, an investigation--into Humana for explaining to seniors how \nthis legislation would affect their coverage.\n  One more time: A private health care provider told its elderly \ncitizens how its health care legislation might affect their lives. Now \nthe Federal Government is putting its full weight into investigating \nthat company at the request of the Senator who wrote the legislation in \nquestion. Now we find out the concerns the company was raising to its \nclients were perfectly legitimate, according to the Director of CBO. \nSo, for telling the truth to your clients, you get investigated by the \ngovernment. This is so clearly an outrage it is hard to believe anyone \nthought it would go unnoticed. For explaining to seniors how \nlegislation might affect them, the Federal Government has now issued a \ngag order on that company and any other company that communicates with \nclients on the issue, telling them to shut up--shut up or else. This is \nprecisely the kind of thing Americans are worried about with this \nadministration's health care plan.\n  They are worried that handing government the reins over their health \ncare will lead to this kind of intimidation. They are worried that \ngovernment agencies, which were created to enforce violations \nevenhandedly, will, instead, be used against those who voice a \ndifferent point of view.\n  That is apparently what is happening here, and to many Americans it \nis a preview of what is in store for everyone under the \nadministration's health care plan. It is hard to imagine any \njustification for this. But if people behind this latest effort believe \nthey have some legal justification for shutting up a private company, \nthen they need to explain themselves to the American people. More \nspecifically, they need to explain to 11 million seniors on Medicare \nAdvantage why they should not be allowed to know how the cuts to this \nprogram will affect their coverage.\n  Yesterday, my office called CMS to ask for the legal authority that \nwould warrant them imposing an industrywide gag order on an issue of \npublic concern. We are still waiting for a response. So this morning I \nam asking the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to provide my \noffice with its justification for telling a company it cannot \ncommunicate with its seniors.\n  Over the past several months, we have seen a pattern of intimidation \nby supporters of the administration's health care proposals, including \nefforts to demonize serious-minded critics at townhall meetings across \nthe country. Now we are seeing something even worse, the full power of \nthe Federal Government being brought to bear on businesses by the very \npeople writing the legislation. This was troubling enough in itself. It \nis even more troubling now that we are told that Humana was exactly \nright--exactly right in what it was telling its clients. Americans are \nalready skeptical about the administration's plan. They should be even \nmore skeptical now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9694-5", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9694-S9700]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I rise with a group of my freshmen \ncolleagues to discuss an issue that is on all our minds and on the \nminds of many Americans and that is the issue of health care reform. \nThe subject most of us are going to address today is what happens if we \ndo nothing on this critically important issue because we, as recent \nadditions to this body, are united by a simple but important truth: the \nrising cost of health care is\n\n[[Page S9695]]\n\nhobbling American business, stressing family budgets and, if we do \nnothing and it is left unchecked, it will explode our national debt.\n  While many of my colleagues have raised important and valid questions \nabout some of the health care proposals, one of the things I hope all \nmy colleagues will realize is that doing nothing to reform our health \ncare system is a policy choice. It would be a misguided choice, an \nirresponsible choice, but it is a choice nonetheless.\n  Today, health care costs in America consume nearly 17 percent of our \nGDP. This is projected to grow to one-third of our GDP by 2040 if we do \nnothing. This chart shows this ever-escalating cost of health care and \nits percentage of our GDP. Here we see the cost in actual dollar \namounts, $2.4 to $2.5 trillion spent on health care in the past year.\n  Our per capita health care cost is double that of virtually every \nother developed nation in the world--nations we compete against every \nday. As we come out of this recession and American business has to \ncompete against these countries around the world, our economy is \nhobbled by costs that, on average, include $3,000 more per employee due \nto our higher health care costs than our competing nations.\n  If we look at an issue that is equally important and one that I know \nour colleagues, especially my freshmen colleagues, continue to raise--\nbut we hear concerns about from our friends on the other side of the \naisle--that is the concern about our Federal deficit. The primary cause \nof our Federal deficit and our overall debt is the increasing per-\nperson costs of Medicare and Medicaid. We pay more and more dollars in \nthe Federal budget each year to basically pay for the same level of \ncare. As this chart shows, increasing Medicare and Medicaid costs alone \nwill exceed all other Federal spending. Clearly, this situation is not \nsustainable.\n  In my home State of Virginia, since 2000, insurance premiums have \nincreased nearly 90 percent, while wages have only increased 27 \npercent. If we do nothing, and this was reaffirmed by the Business \nRoundtable report just last week, nationwide insurance premiums are \nprojected to double by 2016. This is of particular concern to small \nbusinesses. Today, small businesses are the only group that still pay \nretail for their health care services. Their size makes their \nbargaining power weak and makes them susceptible to enormous increases \nin health care premiums.\n  Once again, it is a policy choice. Doing nothing means exploding our \nFederal debt and deficit. Doing nothing means doubling health care \npremium costs for American families. Doing nothing means American \ncompanies will be less competitive in a global market and our small \nbusinesses will continue to pay retail for health care.\n  Mr. President, I think I speak for all my freshmen colleagues when I \nsay we were not elected to do nothing. We did not run for office \nbecause we were satisfied with the direction of our Nation. We were \nelected to work together with willing Republicans and Democrats to help \nturn this country around. I hope this will be the first of a series of \nstatements from the freshman class, who are not only here to point out \nthe challenges we face but to join Senators from both sides of the \naisle who are committed to getting things done.\n  I would now like to yield 5 minutes to my colleague, the \ndistinguished Senator from New Hampshire.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from New Hampshire is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. SHAHEEN. Mr. President, I wish to begin by recognizing and \nthanking Senator Warner for his efforts today to organize the freshmen \nto talk about why it is so critical that we get something done to \nreform health care in this country. He and I both belong to the former \nGovernors caucus, and I come to this debate with the work, years of \nwork that I did as Governor and the perspective we have to do something \nto improve the availability of health care for all Americans and \ncertainly for the families in New Hampshire.\n  Over the past several months, my office has responded to thousands of \nletters and phone calls about health care. I have traveled all across \nNew Hampshire, talking to small business owners and families who are \ndesperate for help. I have talked to health care providers who are \nfrustrated with the current system. Time and time again, what I have \nheard is that our health care system is not working. Costs are too high \nand access is too limited. The status quo is simply not sustainable. \nNow is the time to act.\n  Every day in New Hampshire and across our country, families are \nstruggling with the rising costs of health care. It threatens their \nfinancial stability and leaves them exposed to higher premiums and \ndeductibles and puts them at risk of losing their health insurance and, \nin too many cases, financial ruin. According to one study, 62 percent \nof bankruptcies in 2007 were caused by a medical condition. I have a \nchart that shows this very clearly. This is the 62 percent of those \nbankruptcies that were the result of the costs of medical care. What is \nprobably even more concerning is that of those 62 percent, 78 percent \nof them were insured. So most of the people in this country who are \ngoing bankrupt as the result of their health care costs actually have \nhealth insurance.\n  Health care costs are a threat to our economy, to our small \nbusinesses, and to our working families. The current health care system \nis simply unsustainable for our economy. As Senator Warner pointed out, \nit is estimated that in 2009 our Nation will spend $2.5 trillion or 18 \npercent of our gross domestic product on health care. That means health \ncare costs account for 18 percent of the value of all the goods and \nservices produced in this country. If we continue on this current path, \nhealth care will make up over a third of our economy by 2040.\n  Senator Warner showed that in a chart. This is a graph that shows the \nsame thing--what happens to health care costs if we do nothing, as a \nportion of the entire economy of this country.\n  In New Hampshire, our small businesses are feeling this burden \nfirsthand. From 2002 to 2006, there was a more than 40-percent increase \nin the cost of health insurance premiums for New Hampshire businesses. \nFor those of our smallest businesses, those with fewer than 10 \nemployees, that increase was almost double, to more than 70 percent--a \n70-percent increase in just 4 years for small businesses in New \nHampshire. That means that, although our small business owners want to \nprovide their employees with health insurance, many of them cannot \nafford it.\n  Ultimately, it is our hard-working families who suffer. Today, the \naverage family living in New Hampshire pays about $14,600 for their \ninsurance premium. In New Hampshire, we have the highest premiums in \nthe country for those people who have group rates.\n  I wish to say that one more time because in New Hampshire we are \npaying the highest premiums in the country for group health insurance. \nIf we continue on this current path, families will be paying almost \n$25,000 in the next 10 years, by 2019. Again, here is another graph \nthat shows what is going to happen to New Hampshire families--$25,000 \nin 10 years. This is not affordable.\n  The good news is that we know how to bring down costs. At the Center \nfor Informed Choice at Dartmouth, research shows that more spending \ndoes not translate into better outcomes. In fact, it shows that up to \n40 percent of the time, patients who are engaged in the decisions \nrelated to their care will choose the less invasive and less costly \nprocedures. These choices produce better outcomes with higher rates of \npatient satisfaction.\n  The health care industry can do better for less. We can find savings \nin our system. For example, experts have estimated that we can save \n$5,000 per Medicare beneficiary by reducing costly hospital \nreadmissions. I have introduced legislation with Senator Susan Collins \nfrom Maine called the Medicare Transitional Care Act. This bipartisan \nlegislation will reduce Medicare costs and offer better support and \ncoordination of care to Medicare patients. This will not only improve \nthe quality of health care for our seniors, but it will also save \ntaxpayers money.\n  I was very pleased to see that many of these provisions were in the \nmarkup that came out of the Finance Committee.\n  Although the numbers and statistics are compelling, it is really the \nstories I have heard from my constituents\n\n[[Page S9696]]\n\nwhich best illustrate why reform cannot wait. This is not just about \npolitics, this is about real people.\n  A few weeks ago I received a letter from a young woman named \nJennifer. Jennifer and her husband had recently decided they wanted to \nstart a family. They both work for small businesses that do not offer \nhealth insurance, so they shopped around for an individual insurance \nplan. The policy they could afford did not cover standard maternity \ncare, but they were told they would be covered in case of an emergency: \nif Jennifer needed a C-section or if she had other health problems \nduring the pregnancy.\n  Unfortunately, Jennifer suffered a rare complication, a molar \npregnancy, resulting in a loss of the pregnancy and requiring extensive \nfollowup. But the insurance company told them it would not cover \n``that'' emergency. So during their time of grieving, Jennifer and her \nhusband are not only facing piles of medical bills, they are wondering \nhow they will ever be able to afford a baby in the future.\n  No young family should have to go through this. We have the \nopportunity to stabilize health care costs and reform our health care \nsystem for people such as Jennifer and her husband. We know this is not \neasy. It is one of the greatest challenges of our time. But the time \nhas long passed for action. We need to act now to stabilize costs and \nprovide coverage for Americans.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to achieve this goal.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague, the Senator from New Hampshire, on \nher very excellent comments. We are running a little behind. I do want \nto come back, if we have time, to talk about the costs to State \nbudgets, something both she and I experienced.\n  I yield 5 minutes of our time to the distinguished Senator from \nDelaware.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I thank the Senator.\n  I join my freshmen colleagues this morning to discuss the Nation's \nhealth care system and urge Congress to pass reform legislation this \nyear. I think there are two major reasons we need to enact health \nreform this year, and they both require controlling health care costs.\n  First, we need to pass health care reform because failure to do so \ncould literally bankrupt the country. Just look at Medicare and \nMedicaid. One of the biggest driving forces behind our Federal deficit \nis the skyrocketing cost of Medicare as well as Medicaid. In 1966 \nMedicare and Medicaid accounted for only 1 percent; that is, 1 percent \nof all government expenditures. Today they account for 20 percent. If \nwe do nothing to start bending the cost curve down for Medicare and \nMedicaid, we will eventually spend more on these two programs than all \nother Federal programs combined.\n  Medicare spending is growing rapidly for the same reasons that \nprivate health care spending is growing rapidly: increases in the cost \nand utilization of medical care. Between 1970 and 2007, Medicare's \nspending for each enrollee rose by an average of 8.5 percent annually, \nwhile private health insurance increased by 9.7 percent per person per \nyear.\n  The Congressional Budget office estimates that Federal spending on \nMedicare and Medicaid was approximately 4 percent of the Nation's gross \ndomestic product in 2008. If we fail to act--and we cannot fail to \nact--Federal spending on Medicare and Medicaid will rise to 7 percent \nof GDP by 2025. We must bend these cost curves down and slow the level \nof growth in Medicare and Medicaid programs if we are ever to get our \nbudget situation under control.\n  The second major reason we have to act is because failure to do so \nwill drive more and more Americans into personal bankruptcy. Today \nbankruptcy involving medical bills accounts for more than 60 percent of \nU.S. personal bankruptcies, a rate 1.5 times that of just 6 years ago.\n  Keep in mind, more than 75 percent of families entering bankruptcy \nbecause of health care costs actually have health insurance. I think we \nhave a popular idea that the people going bankrupt are people who \ncannot manage their money, who do not have health insurance. These are \npeople who have health insurance. Again, two-thirds of all Americans \nfiling for bankruptcy because of medical bills already have insurance. \nThese are middle-class Americans who are well educated and own their \nown homes. They just cannot keep up with the alarming rise in costs \nassociated with medical care.\n  We have to act so that Americans no longer have to worry about how \nthey are going to afford their medical bills. We need to pass health \ncare reform and give Americans more stability in these rough economic \ntimes so they no longer have to choose between paying their medical \nbills or paying their home mortgages or their children's tuition \npayments. Controlling health care costs is a major reason we need to \npass health care reform today.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my colleague from Delaware for pointing out the \nenormous cost of inaction both to our Federal deficit and to families \nwho are struggling with these costs.\n  Now I yield 4 minutes of our time to the distinguished Senator from \nAlaska.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I am pleased to stand with my freshman \ncolleague this morning. We often share the back bench, but today we \nbring our message front and center. The time has come for action on \nhealth insurance reform. We represent the North and South. For me, \neveryone comes from the South. But today we see that no matter where \nyou live in this country or what you do for a living the cost of \ninaction is simply unacceptable. All of us can cite alarming statistics \nfrom our States.\n  In my State, there are now 133,000 uninsured Alaskans. The raw \nnumbers may not be much when compared to Virginia, Illinois, or \nColorado, but in Alaska that number represents 20 percent of the \npopulation.\n  To me, and I hope to my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, this \nis unacceptable. Average insurance premiums in Alaska have doubled in \nthe past decade to more than $12,000 annually. If we do not act, they \nwill double again about the time my 7-year-old son starts high school. \nFamilies cannot afford that.\n  Already, the average Alaskan family pays a hidden tax of $1,900 in \npremiums to cover the cost of uncompensated care provided to people \nwithout insurance, and it will only get worse as time moves forward. \nThe problem is especially tough for small businesses in my State \nbecause Alaska has a high proportion of small business owners: \nfishermen, float plane operators, construction contractors, independent \nrealtors, and the like.\n  Some 52 percent of all the jobs in Alaska are held by small business \nworkers or the self-employed. They know better than anyone that a \nbroken health care system leads to lost jobs, reduced productivity, \nless investment, and stalled business growth. Just this weekend I met \nwith a small business townhall and there was one clear message from \nthem to me, to Congress: Do something. Do it now. Each one cited their \nincreases ranging from 14 to 41 percent in health care costs this year \nalone. That is why one of the best ways we in the Senate can strengthen \nand grow Alaska's and American business is to pass meaningful health \ncare reform not sometime down the road but this year.\n  I joined the small business majority earlier this year as they \nreleased the compelling report on the need for reform. The bottom line, \neven with middle-of-the-road reform: American small business will spend \n$800 billion more than they need to over the next 10 years.\n  If they can save that, with just the middle-of-the-road reform, we \ncan save them money and put it to the best use. Considering that small \nbusiness is driving economic recovery in America, that is huge. Eight \nhundred billion dollars saved is available for infrastructure, \ninnovation, and providing stable jobs.\n  It is not just small business that needs reform. The Business \nRoundtable, which has been spoken about already this morning, which \nrepresents much bigger companies, released a report last week that said \nhealth care costs will triple over the next decade to nearly $29,000 \nper employee.\n  There is plenty to debate about health care reform in the weeks \nahead. I still have questions of my own. But there is one thing I hear \nfrom all across my State and across this country, from e-mails and \nmessages we receive: support for health care reform is truly support \nfor America's businesses.\n\n[[Page S9697]]\n\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my friend from Alaska for pointing out, \nparticularly, with small businesses, that in our current system they \nare the only people who pay retail for their health care expenses. \nReform must rectify that.\n  I yield 4 minutes to the Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, during 11 townhalls in Oregon this August \nI heard a lot of heartfelt anger and confusion from Oregonians about \nhealth care in our Nation. I am sure it echoed the confusion and \nfrustration from voices across our Nation.\n  A lot of Oregonians came out to tell me that they did not like one \nbit the description of the reform plan they were hearing on radio and \non television. If reform means they would have to give up their \ninsurance or give up their doctor, they did not want any of it.\n  If reform meant that government panels would deny care to seniors, \nthen they wanted me to know that was outrageous, that they would never \nsupport it. And I agree with them. If reform had those features, it \nsure would not get my vote. I do not think it would get a single vote \nin this Chamber.\n  But as most of America now knows, those claims were lies told to \nscare the bejeebers out of citizens by folks who profit from our \ncurrent health care system. It says a lot, does it not, that those who \nwant to block repairs to our broken health care system have to resort \nto creating myths in order to whip up opposition.\n  The opponents of reform have their own plan, which is continue to \nprofit from the current system, our current broken system. Their plan, \nsimply put, is a terrible plan for America. The opponents' status quo \nplan features shutting out folks with potential health care risks, \nthose who most need health care, from our health care system. Their \nplan features denying coverage for citizens with preexisting \nconditions. Their plan involves dumping citizens out of coverage who, \nafter years of paying their premiums, develop a health care problem and \nthen they lose their health care.\n  The opponents' status quo plan is to continue a broken system in \nwhich premiums double every 7 years, putting health care out of reach \nto America's working families and robbing workers of their pay raises \nthat could improve their standard of living.\n  The opponents' plan is to continue health care rationing by insurance \ncompany bureaucrats who make money denying the claims. The opponents' \nplan is to continue lifetime limits that pile massive debt on those \nunfortunate enough to get sick or injured.\n  The opponent's plan is to continue a system in which health care \ncosts drive more than half the bankruptcies in America, tearing the \nfinancial foundations out of our working families, setting them back \ndecades, if, in fact, they ever recover at all.\n  What I did hear from citizens back home is they do not like that \nstatus quo plan. They want to see those problems fixed. They want an \nindividual to be able to join a pool and get a much better deal. They \nas a small business want to know that they will be able to control \nhealth care costs and keep providing health insurance, and maybe even \nget a better deal, and not have to pay the transfer costs of all of the \nfolks who do not have health care and end up in the emergency room.\n  So for small businesses to thrive in our Nation, for American \nfamilies to thrive, for large businesses to compete internationally, we \nmust fix our broken health care system. The status quo plan put forward \nby opponents is simply wrong for America, wrong for families and wrong \nfor business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. I thank my friend from Oregon for pointing out, in vivid \nterms, the challenges the status quo presents to so many American \nfamilies. I yield 4 minutes to my friend, the distinguished Senator \nfrom Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I am here with my fellow \nfreshmen Senators because we are united in our determination to pass \nhealth insurance reform this year. Our late and giant colleague Senator \nTed Kennedy said it best when he called health reform ``the great \nunfinished business of society.''\n  We are presented this fall with a historic opportunity to finally \nsucceed, and, for me, failure is not an option. The cost of inaction is \ntoo great, both for American families and for our economy. We have a \nbloated $12 trillion Federal debt which is being fed every day by \ngrowing health care costs. Every day, small and large businesses are \nlaying off workers and slashing benefits to their employees. Those \nAmericans who have coverage still do not have the peace of mind that \ncomes from knowing insurance companies will keep their promises. \nPremiums are rising at three times the rate of wages. The number of \nuninsured is growing at a faster rate every day. In my State of \nColorado, nearly one in four is uninsured in some areas. The Treasury \nDepartment recently released a study showing that one out of every two \nAmericans will lose coverage at some point over the next 10 years. We \ncan't allow this to become America's future, but it will if we don't \nact now.\n  There are many reasons health care reform cannot wait, but there is \none that I know strikes a chord with many Coloradans; that is, the lack \nof freedom our current system provides. Workers across our country are \nafraid to leave their jobs for fear they won't be able to provide \nhealth care to their families.\n  That lack of freedom affects our economy because fostering the growth \nof small business is one of the keys to economic success. In our \ncurrent system, Americans are afraid to follow their dreams and start a \nsmall business or travel to go to work for a new company. Small \nbusinesses run on thinner margins than their big-company counterparts, \nand they are being hit hardest by the rise in health care costs. In \nColorado, we have a disproportionate share of small businesses. As a \nresult, we have more citizens who are uninsured. Those who do offer \nbenefits are finding themselves increasingly facing no-win decisions. \nThey are faced with either hiring fewer employees or slashing benefits \nor dropping coverage completely or, in some cases, going out of \nbusiness forever.\n  The proposals in front of us are tailor-made to help small \nbusinesses. The ideas in place would provide tax credits and create a \nsimplified, well-regulated, pooled marketplace to help small businesses \nfind cheaper and higher quality coverage. It is estimated that reform \nwill save small businesses more than $500 billion over 10 years or more \nthan $3,500 per worker. That is real money that can be reinvested in \nbusiness growth and adding additional jobs to fuel our economic \nrecovery.\n  The burden on individuals is only one of the culprits preventing \neconomic growth. Our deepening Federal deficit and long-term fiscal \noutlook are also closely linked to a broken system. As President Obama \nsaid in his address to Congress 2 weeks ago: Our Nation's health care \nproblem is our deficit problem. Just think, we spend $2 trillion on \nhealth care per year. That is more than $1 out of every $5 spent in the \neconomy, more than twice what any other industrialized nation spends. I \nthink we would all agree we are not twice as healthy for our money. If \nthis number continues to grow, there is no hope for reining in long-\nterm deficits.\n  Health insurance reform is a golden opportunity to begin to control \nour deficit. We can and we need to grab this opportunity and make \nhealth care the springboard from which we clean up our long-term fiscal \nmess. The President reminded us that the growth of health care costs, \nif slowed by one-tenth of 1 percent a year, would help bring down the \ndeficit by $4 trillion.\n  There are many excellent ideas on the table to help us get there--by \nensuring Medicare's solvency, reforming Medicare's payment structure to \nbring down cost growth in the long-term, and discouraging overgenerous \nhealth plans which encourage overutilization of the system.\n  As Senator Warner and others have pointed out, many of the proposals \nbeing discussed are politically difficult to support. But not facing \npolitically difficult decisions head-on is what has caused so much of \nthe inertia that has brought us to where we are today. We don't all \nagree on exactly the best way forward, but we do agree it is time for \nevery Member of Congress and every Member of the Senate to think about\n\n[[Page S9698]]\n\nhealth insurance reform for what it is: a huge and necessary step to \nputting our economy back on track and finally providing stability, \nsecurity, and freedom to the people. If we do this, I know we can find \ncommon ground. We must because the cost of inaction is too great.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Colorado.\n  We are hearing a common theme. These freshman Members all care about \ndriving down cost, and they see health care reform as stimulative to \nthe American economy and recognize that ensuring the growth of our \neconomy means we have to get the deficit under control. That means \ndriving health care costs down.\n  I yield 4 minutes to my colleague from New Mexico.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I am proud to join our class \ntoday to talk about the cost of inaction.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, health insurance reform is \none of the defining challenges of our time. Every person in our country \nhas a stake in what we do at this moment, in this place. And while \nthere are a lot of proposals out there, there is one thing we know for \nsure: Maintaining the status quo is not an option.\n  It is what has been done for years. It has been the easy choice. Kick \nthe can down the road a couple yards . . . a couple of years . . . but \nnever get at the root of the problem. Maintaining the status quo is the \none coward's way out. And one doesn't need an economics degree to see \nwhere that approach has gotten us.\n  Part of meeting the challenge of reforming health insurance is being \nhonest about the consequences we face if we don't. So I rise today to \ntalk about the high price of doing nothing.\n  It is a price we will all pay--a human price, an economic price, a \nsocietal price. All equally devastating if we don't muster the courage, \nif we don't have the political will to stand up and say: Not anymore. \nNot on our watch.\n  The human price is the price we feel most personally when we see our \nfamily, our friends, our neighbors struggling to obtain health care, to \nafford health care, or to hold on to the health care they already have.\n  If we do nothing--if we maintain the status quo--more Americans will \nbe uninsured or underinsured. More Americans will become sick. More \nwill die because of lack of care, and more families will experience \nfinancial ruin.\n  A new report that came out last week found that family premiums have \nalready increased by about 5 percent this year. Over the past 10 years, \npremiums have gone up 131 percent. It is a vicious cycle. America's \nfamilies, America's workers and businesses--especially small \nbusinesses--can't keep up.\n  In New Mexico, we have been paying the human price of the status quo \nfor years. In my State, nearly one in four residents lacks health \ninsurance. That makes us the second-highest uninsured State in the \nNation. And three-quarters of uninsured New Mexicans work or are from \nworking families. Added to that, 80 more New Mexicans lose their health \ncare coverage every day.\n  People like a woman I met in Raton, NM, last month. She and her \nhusband just got a renewal notice from their health care insurer. Their \npremium rose 24 percent this year alone. It is an increase they can't \nafford, and they don't know what to do. They are paying the human price \nfor the status quo.\n  Along with the human price, there is the economic price.\n  By now it is a familiar refrain. The health care system as we know it \nis unsustainable. It is unsustainable for taxpayers, who are picking up \nthe costs for those who can't afford or can't obtain insurance on their \nown. It is unsustainable for businesses which aren't able to afford \nskyrocketing costs to cover their employees. And it is unsustainable \nfor our government. As President Obama said recently:\n\n       Our health care problem is our deficit problem. Nothing \n     else even comes close.\n\n  Without health care reform, if we do nothing but maintain the status \nquo, the problems that seem insurmountable today will look like child's \nplay compared with the catastrophic news of tomorrow.\n  If we fail to act, the number of uninsured Americans will increase \nfrom more than 46 million last year to more than 53 million in 2019. \nAnd that is a best case scenario. The actual number could be as high as \nalmost 58 million. For New Mexico, failure to act would mean that \ninsured New Mexicans continue paying $2,300 in hidden subsidies for the \nuninsured.\n  If we fail to act, U.S. spending on health care will climb from \nalmost $2.4 trillion last year to almost $4.3 trillion in 2017. And \ninsurance companies will continue to profit at the expense of America's \nhealth and America's pocketbooks.\n  If we fail to act, businesses will continue to flounder under the \ncrushing costs of health care coverage. Fewer businesses will open \ntheir doors. More will call it quits for good. And, most chillingly, \nthe entrepreneurial spirit that is so uniquely American could be badly \ndamaged.\n  If we fail to act, government at all levels will suffer. Budgets will \ncontinue to shrink. Priorities like education, energy innovation and \njob creation will continue to be underfunded. Americans will continue \nto pay the economic price.\n  Finally, along with the human and economic costs, there is one more \nprice to consider if we don't step up to our responsibilities and \ndeliver on health care. That price is more figurative, but no less \npainful.\n  I am talking about the price we pay as a country for not living up to \nthe ideals on which America was founded.\n  America is heralded as the land of opportunity. But realizing that \nopportunity should not be dependent on whether you have enough money in \nyour bank account to afford health care.\n  America is a place where ``all men are created equal.'' But how can \nthat be true if access to something as fundamental as health care is \ndivided between the haves and have nots?\n  Harry Truman--who was the first President to attempt to provide every \nAmerican with health care--put it simply:\n\n       We are a rich nation and can afford many things. But ill-\n     health which can be prevented or cured is one thing we cannot \n     afford.\n\n  More than 60 years later, his words ring true:\n\n       We cannot afford ill-health which can be prevented or \n     cured.\n\n  We cannot afford to maintain the status quo.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I know our time allotment is drawing to a \nclose and we still have more Senators who wish to speak.\n  I yield 3 minutes to my distinguished colleague, the Senator from \nIllinois.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I am honored to be able to join my \nfreshman colleagues as we speak on this important issue of health care \nreform. On September 9, the President stood before the Congress and \nissued a resounding call for health care reform. It is time for us to \nanswer. We need to recognize, as our President does, that this is our \nmoment to stand for freedom and opportunity.\n  Health care reform is nothing less than a moral imperative. For \nyears, costs have been rising and the quality of care has been going \ndown. For the giant corporations that provide health insurance, rising \ncosts have meant rising profits. They rake in millions of dollars by \ndenying coverage to sick Americans. But for those of us who are not \nhealth care insurance executives, rising costs have become a terrible \nburden.\n  In the early 1990s, when President Clinton and the Democratic \nCongress tried to pass health care reform, insurance companies brought \ncosts under control. From 1993 to 1995, health care costs grew by an \naverage of only $38 billion. Insurance corporations must have been \nafraid that reform would hurt profits, so they self-regulated, keeping \ncosts under control until the threat of reform had passed. But when the \nRepublicans took back the Congress, health care reform was dropped and \ncosts skyrocketed, however. Between 1995 and 2006, costs increased by \nalmost $102 billion annually. These numbers are clear. We are spiraling \nout of control, and inaction is not an option. We cannot stand by as \nmillions of Americans all across the country are forced into bankruptcy \nby medical bills.\n  Some say we are moving too quickly, that we need to wait. I ask, wait \nfor\n\n[[Page S9699]]\n\nwhat, for more people to get sick and die because they don't have \naccess to health care? The American people have been waiting far too \nlong. We must not wait any longer. It is time to make sure everyone has \naccess to quality care and affordable health care. It is time to make \nsure no one can be dropped because of preexisting conditions and to \nprovide a public option to compete with the private insurers. It is our \nduty to stand up for what we know is right.\n  Mr. President, 45 years ago another Illinois Senator saw this same \nneed as Congress debated the Civil Rights Act. The bill was under fire. \nThere were some who could not accept reform. But Senator Everett \nDirksen knew equality was woven into the moral fabric of this Nation, \nand he knew America had waited long enough for change to happen. \nStanding on the floor of this Chamber, he echoed Victor Hugo, who said: \nStronger than all the enemies is the idea whose time has come. The time \nhas come. Let's vote in health care reform.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Illinois. I also \nthank my distinguished colleague from Tennessee for granting our group \n4 additional minutes.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I ask unanimous consent that each side be granted 4 \nadditional minutes in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. WARNER. I now yield 4 minutes to the Senator from North Carolina, \nmy friend.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, I rise with my colleagues to discuss the \nurgent need for comprehensive health care reform and why I believe the \ncost of inaction is simply too high for North Carolina and America's \nworking families.\n  As I traveled across the State during the August recess, it was clear \nthat North Carolinians are concerned about the rising cost of health \ncare. In the past 10 years in my State, the cost of health care \npremiums has increased 98 percent, whereas wages have increased only 18 \npercent. That is a startling statistic. Just last week, the chamber of \ncommerce from Dunn, NC, came to visit me in Washington. One man has a \ncompany that employs 600 employees. The cost of health care last year \nfor his company increased 28 percent--in 1 year. That is simply \nunsustainable for America's businesses.\n  The Treasury Department issued a stern warning just last week: If we \ndo nothing to tackle the skyrocketing cost of health care, nearly half \nof all Americans under the age of 65 will lose their health insurance \nin 10 years. Those are frightening numbers.\n\n  Right now, the average family's health insurance premium is $13,375. \nIf Congress does not send our President a reform bill, premiums are \nexpected to rise to a staggering $25,000 in 2016. Today, this average \npremium represents a little over a quarter of a family's income. But, \nby 2016, that average premium will represent almost half of a family's \nincome. How are people going to able to afford to pay for mortgages and \nsave for college tuition if they are paying half their monthly income \nfor insurance premiums?\n  This past year, North Carolina's unemployment rate rose to 11 \npercent. Many of the thousands of North Carolinians who have lost their \njobs in this recession have also lost their health care, and many more \nfamilies are facing this frightening reality: One medical emergency \ncould send them into bankruptcy.\n  In 2005, nearly half of all Americans who filed for bankruptcy cited \nmajor medical expenses as the reason for their financial decline. \nBetween 2001 and 2008, the number of uninsured in North Carolina \nincreased from 1.1 million to 1.4 million people. Without action, this \nnumber is going to continue to grow.\n  The Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee crafted a \nbill that ensures that people who like their insurance and their \ndoctors keep them. It also expands access to health insurance for those \nwithout it, and slows down the skyrocketing cost of health care--the \nthree critical components President Obama called for in his speech to \nCongress 2 weeks ago.\n  The President has been adamant that health care reform must not add \none dime to our Federal deficit now or in the future, which has been a \nrequirement of mine all along. The exploding cost of health care has \nput our Nation's economic security at risk. We simply cannot afford \ninaction any longer.\n  In 1960, health care spending was 4.7 percent of GDP. Today, it is 18 \npercent. On the current trajectory, by 2030, health care costs will \naccount for 28 percent of GDP.\n  We need health care reform to get our deficit under control. We need \na reform package that ensures a preexisting condition, such as diabetes \nor cancer, no longer prevents anyone from obtaining health insurance. \nWe need health care reform to ensure America's families do not have to \nfear bankruptcy when a loved one gets sick.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from North Carolina \nand all these freshmen Senators who have talked today about the very \nreal costs of inaction.\n  I would like to now call on our final colleague, my friend, the \njunior Senator from Colorado.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Virginia and the \nrest of my colleagues.\n  I have a few slides I wish to go through. But the basic point is, no \nmatter what one thinks about the various health care bills that are out \nthere and the various prescriptions that have been suggested, the \nstatus quo is not an option.\n  For me, this starts with fiscal responsibility. We have seen an \nunbelievable explosion in debt in our country, from $5 trillion, from \nthe beginning of the previous administration, to $12 trillion today. If \nyou look at what is causing it: As you can see from this slide, this is \nour revenue line. The biggest drivers of our deficit are the interest \npayments we have on this debt--that we are managing to pass on to our \nkids and our grandkids because we are unwilling to make the tough \nchoices that need to be made--and rising Medicare and Medicaid costs, \nwhich is the red line right here. So one cost of inaction is we will \ncontinue to drive these insane deficits we are facing as a country.\n  In my State of Colorado--and the senior Senator from Colorado is in \nthe Chamber as well--our working families and small businesses are \nsuffering mightily because the economy is not working for them. Over \nthe last decade, median family income in the State of Colorado has \nactually declined by $800 in real dollars, and that has happened all \nacross the United States of America, where we see median family income \ndown by $300.\n  At the same time, health care premiums have risen by 97 percent. The \ncost of higher education, by the way, has gone up 50 percent. Our \nworking families are being asked to do more with less just for the \nbasic necessities that are required to move your family ahead. These \nare not ``nice to haves.'' These are essential, if working families and \nthe middle class are going to be able to move ahead.\n  The second reason we need reform is, as the Senator from Virginia \nsaid at the beginning of his comments, we are spending almost a fifth \nof our GDP on health care. That is more than twice a much as what any \nother industrialized country in the word is spending on their health \ncare system.\n  As I have said in townhall meetings all across our State, this is no \ndifferent than if you have two small businesses across the street from \none another, with one spending a fifth of their revenue on their light \nbill and the other spending less than half that on their light bill. \nYou do not need an MBA to know which of those two companies is going to \nbe able to invest in their business plan and grow their business.\n  We have a lot to do to make sure this economy can compete in the 21st \ncentury. I would say one of the things we ought to do is not to devote \na fifth of our economy to health care if we expect to compete.\n  This slide shows the rate of insurance premium increase in our State \nversus the rate of the increase in wages. These are absolutely related \nto each other. If\n\n[[Page S9700]]\n\nyou talk to small businesses in any State--I am sure this is true in \nVirginia, as well as it is true in Colorado--small business owners are \ndesperately trying to keep their employees insured, but the choice they \nare making is to pay them less in wages. This wage compression is \nrelated directly to the rate of the insurance premium.\n  The other chart of this slide simply shows if we change nothing there \nare going to be families all across this country who, by 2016, are \ngoing to be spending 40 percent of their income on health care--that is \nbefore you get to higher ed; that is before you get to rent or food--40 \npercent of every dollar on health care. It is absurd.\n  We see that health care is bankrupting middle-class Americans all \nover this country. We know 62 percent of bankruptcies are health care \nrelated. What is staggering to me is, 78 percent of those bankruptcies \nare happening to people who had insurance. The entire reason people buy \ninsurance is so they have stability when their child gets sick or their \nspouse gets sick or they get sick. Seventy-eight percent of these \nbankruptcies have happened to people who had insurance.\n  Then, finally, no one is burdened more by the current system than \nsmall business and the employees who work for small businesses. In our \nState, small business pays 18 percent more for health insurance just \nbecause they are small. When I say that, sometimes people say: Well, \nMichael, don't you understand that is because the pool is smaller and \nit is harder to spread the risk. I say: I understand that. But from a \nbusiness point of view--and the Senator from Virginia and I both have \nspent a lot of time in our careers working in the private sector--from \na business point of view, that is absurd because these small \nbusinesses, if they are investing 18 percent more, ought to be \nexpecting to be 18 percent more productive or, at a minimum, ought to \nhave 18 percent better health care, and that is absolutely not the \ncase.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent for 1 additional minute.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BENNET. My final point, Mr. President, is we have been having a \nhealthy debate about how we should do this reform, and there are a lot \nof people who are concerned about things such as a public option, \nthings such as government control over health care. I would argue that \nthe status quo is what is producing that because fewer and fewer of our \nworking families are covered at work--which is what this slide shows--\nand for every one of those people who then goes on uncompensated care, \nit is paid for by the American people.\n  So I join my colleagues today in saying, we absolutely cannot \nmaintain this status quo. It is absolutely unsustainable. I look \nforward to a thoughtful, commonsense reform that works for working \nfamilies and small businesses in my State.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WARNER. Mr. President, I thank our colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle for the additional time.\n  I appreciate the opportunity we have had to make our statements.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The time is expired.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, how much time is available for the \nRepublican side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Forty-nine minutes.\n  The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Thank you very much, Mr. President.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9700-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9700-S9705]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I commend my friends on the Democratic \nside for their interest in health care reform and their coming here to \nexpress their views. I can say to them very clearly there is 100 \npercent agreement on the Republican side that we do not want the status \nquo, and there is 100 percent agreement on the Republican side that \nthere would be one thing worse than the status quo and that would be \nhigher premium costs, more debt for the government, and higher taxes.\n  I am afraid that is what my friends are arguing for because they are \ncontinuing to say they want to insure at least 30 million more people, \nthey want to improve the benefits for people already on insurance, and \nthey want to reduce costs. That does not add up. So I think it is time \nwe get down to some reality in this discussion about: How can we best \nachieve health care reform in this country?\n  We, on the Republican side, want health care reform, but we do not \nwant more debt, more taxes, and higher premium costs for people who \ncannot afford their insurance policies now. Yet the proposals we have \nseen on that side of the aisle do that.\n  Our focus should be about one thing. Health care reform should be \nabout one thing: reducing costs, reducing costs to individuals and \nsmall businesses who are paying for health care, and reducing the cost \nto our government, which is the responsibility of every single one of \nus taxpayers in this country.\n  We have had several proposals from the Democratic side that increase \nthe debt and increase the cost, and the President himself, in effect, \nrejected them in his address to Congress the other day because he said \nthere cannot be one dime of deficit, not one dime. So the bill that \ncame out of the HELP Committee in the Senate--it is out of here. The \nbill that is coming out of the House of Representatives that has been \nthrough several committees--it cannot be considered under the \nPresident's own standard that it cannot increase the deficit one dime.\n  I am glad he is saying that. I am glad he is saying that because he \nis already proposing we increase our national debt by $9 trillion over \nthe next 10 years--doubling our national debt, tripling it over 10 \nyears, spending more over the next 10 years, three times as much as we \nspent in World War II--amounts that have most people in this country \nalarmed about the debt of this government. So this should be a \nstraightforward discussion about costs, reducing the cost of health \ncare to you, if you are buying health care, and reducing the cost of \nhealth care to your government, which you are responsible for.\n  So the President has done us a favor. He said do not worry about the \nSenate bill that came out of the HELP Committee because--in effect, he \nsaid this--it adds to the deficit, so it has to go. For the bills \ncoming out of the House of Representatives, the Congressional Budget \nOffice has told us it adds to the deficit in the first 10 years, and it \nadds to the deficit even more in the next 10 years, so it has to go.\n  So now we have a new bill, and it is already a 250-page--I misspoke. \nIt is not a bill yet. It is 250 pages of concepts. It is important for \nthe American people to understand this. I think one of the things we \nhave all heard, as much as anything, when we have gone home is: Did you \nread the bill? That is a pretty good question. It is a pretty big job \nbecause we have gotten in the habit around here of coming up with \n1,000-page bills that Senators and Congressmen do not read. So the \nAmerican people are saying to us: At least read the bill. They are \nsaying to us, second: At least know what it costs. So that is a bare \nminimum of what we should insist on as we are going forward.\n  The bill introduced by the distinguished Senator who is the chairman \nof the Finance Committee is 250 pages of concepts. So everyone \nunderstands where we are in the process, the Finance Committee is \nmeeting. They will be meeting all week. My guess is they will be \nmeeting next week. They are trying to agree on what those concepts will \nfinally be. The chairman has recommended what he thinks they ought to \nbe, and now the committee is going to say what they think they should \nbe.\n  Then, as I understand it, the Democratic leader is going to try to \nfit this bill that came out of the HELP Committee--that the President, \nin effect, has rejected because he says no deficit--well, it has a \ndeficit--and he is going to try to put that bill that raises costs with \nthe Baucus bill and turn it into one bill. The bill that came out of \nthe HELP Committee is already nearly 1,000 pages. I do not know yet \nwhat will be coming out of the Finance Committee.\n  So in a week or two, we are going to be having another big bill we \nwill have to read. Then the Congressional Budget Office, which is our \nofficial nonpartisan outfit that tells us what things cost--appointed \nby the majority\n\n[[Page S9701]]\n\nbut still nonpartisan--told Senator Baucus yesterday it would take \nabout 2 weeks for them to tell us how much it will cost.\n  So the way I am adding up the weeks, I am saying a week or two for \nthe Finance Committee to come up with a bill--maybe a week to write the \nbill--and the Congressional Budget Office says after the bill is \nwritten, it takes 2 weeks to know the formal cost. Then we ought to \nhave several weeks to debate the bill. That is what we did with the \nEnergy bill for 4 or 5 weeks and, of course, we should do just that. So \nwe need the time to do it, and we need to be able to say to people when \nwe go home: I read the bill and I know exactly what it costs and here \nis what I think about it.\n\n  What about the Baucus concepts--not the Baucus bill; they don't have \nthe bill yet--but the concepts. The Congressional Budget Office \nreleased an analysis of the impact of the Baucus budget plan on \ninsurance. It shows that the premiums for those in the individual \nmarket under the Baucus bill don't go down, they go up. This is \nsupposed to be about reducing the cost of premiums that Americans have \nfor their health care, and under the Baucus bill so far, on its first \nday of consideration by the full Finance Committee, the premiums go up \nand taxes on insurers, drugs, and devices would be passed on to \nconsumers in the form of higher premiums. This is not fearmongers \nsaying that; this is not Republicans saying that; it is not the doctors \nsaying that; it is the Congressional Budget Office appointed by the \nmajority, the Democratic majority. Premiums go up under the Baucus \nbill. That means Americans will pay more, not less, for their health \ninsurance under the bill as it is today.\n  Here is what the Congressional Budget Office said:\n\n       Under current law, premiums on employment-based plans would \n     not include the effect of the annual fees imposed under the \n     proposal on manufacturers and importers of brand-name drugs \n     and medical devices, on health insurance providers, and on \n     clinical laboratories.\n\n  These are new taxes.\n\n       Premiums for exchange plans----\n\n  These would be plans in the exchange that you might choose if you \nwere an individual--\n\n       Premiums for exchange plans would include the effect of \n     those fees, which would increase premiums by roughly 1 \n     percent.\n\n  That is the Congressional Budget Office about the Baucus concepts.\n  CBO, the Congressional Budget Office, went on to say:\n\n       At the same time, premiums in the new insurance exchanges--\n     --\n\n  These are the marketplaces where under this plan you would go to buy \nyour insurance----\n\n     would tend to be higher than the average premiums in the \n     current-law individual market.\n\n  So the premiums under the new bill and the new exchange would be \nhigher than you are paying today. CBO says:\n\n       Again, with other factors held equal, because the new \n     policies would have to cover preexisting medical conditions \n     and could not deny coverage to people with high expected \n     costs for health care.\n\n  CBO goes on to say:\n\n       People with low expected costs for health care, however, \n     would generally pay higher premiums.\n\n  So if you make a promise to improve the benefits, somebody else is \ngoing to pay for them. That is mathematics. That is the way the world \nworks. Fortunately, we have the Congressional Budget Office to say \nunder this plan premiums would go up. It continues:\n\n       For families, premiums plus cost-sharing payments would \n     range from about $2,900 for those with incomes of $30,000, to \n     nearly $20,000 annually for premiums for those with incomes \n     above $96,000.\n\n  So costs go up to individuals under the Baucus concepts. \nAdditionally, we should consider the cost to our government. Most \nAmericans are very much aware--I think that is why they have been \nturning out in record numbers in town meetings--that the government is \nnot some remote, abstract thing; we own it, and we own the debt too. \nAccording to the Budget Committee staff, the real 10-year cost of the \nBaucus concept when fully implemented will be $1.67 trillion because \nthe main spending provisions won't go into effect until 2013.\n  In other words, when we talk about 10-year costs around here, the \nnext 10 years aren't an accurate picture because the bill isn't fully \nimplemented until you get on down the road 3 or 4 years to 2013. So if \nyou take a full 10 years--a full implementation of the bill--the Budget \nCommittee says it is about $1.67 trillion in new costs. However, there \nare new taxes and fees to pay for that: $838 billion over 10 full years \nof implementation, and those new taxes and fees go into effect \nimmediately.\n  The long-term deficit reductions predicted in the bill depend on \nCongress--that is us--approving cuts year after year to Medicare \nproviders. Medicare providers are doctors, hospitals, hospices, and \nhome health agencies. In other words, to make this bill balance the \nbudget and not add to the deficit, we are going to have to have cuts \nyear after year to Medicare, cuts to doctors, cuts to hospitals, cuts \nto hospices, and cuts to home health agencies.\n  I thought I heard the President say in his speech the other night \nthere will be no cuts to Medicare. He did say that. It turns out not to \nbe true in the Baucus proposal. It could be true if Congress were \nwilling to support cuts year after year to Medicare, hospitals, \ndoctors, home health agencies, and hospices, but we have never done \nthat. In fact, a few years ago we Republicans tried to restrict the \ngrowth of Medicare by $10 billion a year--I think it was from 43 \npercent to 41 percent over 5 years--and we had to bring the Vice \nPresident back from overseas to cast the deciding vote because \neverybody on the Democratic side wouldn't even vote for $10 billion in \nreduced savings to Medicare. Yet what we are proposing here assumes \nthat suddenly we have all changed and we are going to allow cuts year \nafter year to people who provide services to Medicare.\n  CBO found that its projections ``assume that the proposals are \nenacted and remain unchanged throughout the next two decades, which is \noften not the case,'' it wisely said.\n  CBO goes on: ``For example, the sustainable growth rate''--we call \nthat the ``doc fix'' around here when we come in once a year and \nautomatically--doctors' payments under Medicare, which is already only \n80 percent--doctors earn only about 80 percent under Medicare compared \nto what they earn when they see private patients--so we automatically \ncut their pay by 20 percent and we always come in and raise it back up \nto about what it was the year before.\n  So CBO is telling us that the sustainable growth rate--the ``doc \nfix'' ``governing Medicare to physicians--has frequently been \nmodified.'' That is an understatement. It has been modified almost \nevery year ``to avoid reductions in those payments'' and that ``the \nlong-term budgetary impact could be quite different if those provisions \nwere ultimately changed or not fully implemented.''\n  So unless we have massive cuts in Medicare, we are not going to be \nable to balance the budget with this bill.\n  We don't know how much this bill will cost State governments. The \ndistinguished Senator from Nebraska is on the floor. He was a Governor. \nI was a Governor. We have all struggled with Medicaid. I think our view \nis that dumping another 15 million low-income Americans into Medicaid \nis not health care reform. Doctors and providers are only reimbursed \nabout 61 or 62 percent of their costs for providing services to \nMedicaid patients, so 40 percent of doctors won't see Medicaid \npatients. Dumping a low-income American into the Medicaid program is \nlike giving them a bus ticket to a bus line that only runs 60 percent \nof the time. It is not health care reform. Even so, this will cost \nState governments, and all the Governors--Democrats and Republicans--\nare opposed to the concept in this bill that transfers some of the cost \nof increased Medicaid to the States. Their view is--and I think they \nare right on this--if the Federal Government wants to expand Medicaid, \nthe Federal Government should pay for it. I haven't been able to even \nget an estimate of how much this will cost Tennessee. We are trying to \nfigure that out. Senator Cornyn said his estimate is about $2 billion a \nyear for Texas.\n  Additionally, the proposal cuts nearly $500 billion from Medicare to \nfund this new government program even though Medicare will start going \nbankrupt in 2017. Yesterday I heard the president of the Mayo Clinic on \nNational Public Radio say that any public\n\n[[Page S9702]]\n\noption that looked like Medicare would bankrupt the country overnight, \nsince trustees have said that Medicare is likely to go broke in 2015 to \n2017.\n  I am afraid we need to start over. I admire Senator Baucus's effort, \nbut we don't do comprehensive very well here. A 1,000-page bill is not \nlikely to solve the problem. It is time to bring an end to the era of \nthese 1,000-page bills that are so complicated no one can understand \nthem or have time to read them. Instead, I believe we should move step \nby step to lower health care costs and re-earn the trust of the \nAmerican people.\n  I see the Senator from Nebraska and I will soon defer to him, or to \nthe Senator from South Dakota, whichever one is next. But in \nconclusion, these are the things we can start doing today to move step \nby step in the right direction to lower costs: allow small businesses \nto pool to reduce health care costs; reform medical malpractice laws; \nallow individual Americans the ability to purchase health insurance \nacross State lines; ensure that Americans who currently qualify for \nexisting programs such as Medicaid and SCHIP who are not enrolled to be \nsigned up; create health insurance exchanges so you can find coverage; \nand incentivize health reform technology. We can agree on those things. \nWe can take those steps and we can reduce the costs of health care to \neach American family and to our government.\n  I thank the President and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I wish to thank the Senator from Tennessee \nfor very effectively making the arguments that many Americans want to \nhear voiced in this debate about health care and a whole range of other \nissues. The Senator from Tennessee has pointed out as a former \nGovernor--and we have another former Governor, the Senator from \nNebraska, here today as well--the impact that many of these proposals \nwould have on State budgets. The former Governor of Tennessee has \ndescribed it as ``the mother of all unfunded mandates.'' I think that \nis a view that is shared by many other Governors across this country, \nabout the impact some of these expansions would have, not just on \nFederal budgets but on State budgets.\n  I have had numerous discussions with the Governor of South Dakota \nabout this and he last suggested that the minimum amount, the \nconservative amount of additional funding that would be required each \nyear to meet some of these expansions of Medicaid that are called for \nin these various health care reform bills would be about $45 million a \nyear. Around here that doesn't sound like a lot of money, but in the \nState of South Dakota that is real money. That is a real impact and it \nwould require higher taxes or significant cuts in their budget in my \nState of South Dakota. So that is one aspect of this argument.\n  I might say that like some of my colleagues who over the month of \nAugust were out in their individual States listening to their \nconstituents, I was doing the same thing. I conducted a series of \ntownhall meetings in my State and I heard from people all across my \nState in every geographic region. Of course, as is typical in the \nMidwest, people were very respectful and it was a very civil \ndiscussion. But one could not miss the intensity people felt on not \nonly the health care issue, because that happened to be the main \nsubject of debate, but a range of other issues. I think it comes down \nto two fundamental issues. I think at least in my State of South Dakota \nthis seems to be the case--as it was in some of the other meetings \naround the country in other States--that people were concerned about \ntwo issues. One was the issue of control and the other was the issue of \ncost.\n  With the issue of control, it is a question of who has the power when \nit comes to the debate about health care and when it comes to the \ndebate about higher energy costs. Is all this sort of consolidation and \nexpansion of the Federal Government here in Washington, DC going to \nmean people in this country have less control when it comes to their \nown health care? Is the government going to be stepping in and \nintervening more and making a lot of these decisions and dictating out \nof some bureaucracy in Washington, DC what happens in the world of \nhealth care, which for most people is very personal to them? That is \nwhy I think there was such a visceral reaction across the country to \nsome of these proposals.\n  I think the other issue is cost. People have a sense that things are \nsort of spinning out of control. I think there are a couple of sort of \nbasic principles that are fairly pervasive in the mindset of most \npeople where I come from in the upper Midwest and that is, No. 1, you \ncan't spend money you don't have; and No. 2, when you borrow money, you \ndo have to pay it back. They see this incredible borrowing spree and \nthis incredible spending spree here in Washington, DC and they are \nwondering, How is this all going to end? What does it mean not only for \nme and for my family but for future generations? Are we borrowing at \nlevels that are not sustainable into the future? I think that has \nreally gripped people across this country as they have looked at not \nonly the health care debate but also the question of all of these \ngovernment takeovers of financial services and insurance companies and \nauto manufacturers, and the list sort of goes on and on.\n  The most recent example of that would be student loans where, again, \nwe see the Federal Government trying to pull the reins in and move all \nof the guaranteed loan programs that currently operate in this country \nthrough the financial services industry and commercial banks into the \nFederal Government. The Federal Government would be the entity that \nmakes all of these loans directly. Well, that ends up adding several \nhundred billion dollars to the Federal debt which we are already \ntalking about raising here in the middle of next month. In the middle \nof October the debt limit is going to have to be raised. So we have all \nof that student loan exposure now, liability coming on to folks from \nthe Federal Government. We have TARP which is said to expire at the end \nof this year, on December 31, unless Secretary Geithner certifies to \nCongress that he is going to extend it.\n  I wrote a letter--and last week 39 of my colleagues signed it--asking \nthe Secretary of the Treasury when TARP expires on December 31 not to \nextend it because, there again, there are unobligated balances in TARP \nfunding that could be used that would reduce the overall amount of the \ndebt, the overall amount of the deficit.\n  And the truth be known, I don't think any American wants to see the \nTARP funds becoming a slush fund to fund other types of endeavors the \nFederal Government might undertake. They want to see this program that \nwas temporary and was designed to prevent imminent financial collapse \nand provide stability to the financial services industry expire. Now \nthat that purpose has been served, we should not continue to have \nhundreds of billions of dollars of taxpayer dollars out there that \ncould be recycled or put into some other industry the government \ndecides to select.\n  I hope the Secretary will heed the suggestion made by myself and 39 \ncolleagues in our letter and let the TARP program expire. I say that \nbecause this paints a broader picture, a narrative, that I believe is \nof great concern to the American people, which is the reason we saw so \nmuch intensity at many townhall meetings over the break.\n  The health care debate is occurring right now in real time. We have \nhad four of the five committees record bills that have jurisdiction \nover health care in the Congress--three in the House and one in the \nSenate. The Senate Finance Committee is marking up their bill this \nweek. We expect that will be completed and that this could be put on \nthe floor sometime in the next few weeks. That seems to be a very fast \nschedule considering the consequence of what we are doing. We are \ntalking about one-sixth of the American economy, about reorganizing \none-sixth of the American economy. Mr. President, $2.5 trillion \nannually is spent on health care in this country. I think we better \nmake sure we do it right. All we have seen so far in the Finance \nCommittee is a 220-page summary, which we assume, when translated into \nlegislative language, is going to be more than 1,000 pages. That is \nsomething many of us will want to have time to digest, and we would \nlike our constituents to look at it to see whether it makes sense to \nthem.\n\n[[Page S9703]]\n\n  I think probably the biggest reaction I saw during the August break \nin the discussions I had with constituents in South Dakota was a \nnegative reaction in opposition to the notion of a government plan, \nthat the government would create this public plan option--essentially a \ngovernment plan. A lot of people who derive health care coverage in the \nprivate marketplace today would by default be pushed into that \ngovernment plan, and you would have the government involved at a much \nhigher level in driving a lot of the health care decisions in this \ncountry. There was a real reaction to that.\n  The point I made earlier as to what I think people were reacting to \nis the issue of control, power. Who has the power? Is the Federal \nGovernment trying to buy this expansion, create more power in \nWashington, and take away some of the power and decisionmaking that \nshould occur between patients and their doctors? That was the one \nissue. The Finance Committee plan, to their credit, has done away with \nthat--at least for the time being. They decided to proceed in a \ndifferent direction.\n  That being said, the issue remains that people were responding to \nduring August; that is, the issue of cost. According to the \nCongressional Budget Office, the overall cost of this, for the \nimmediate 10 years, is a little under $1 trillion. When fully \nimplemented, the cost of the plan is still $1.7 trillion, which has to \nbe paid for somehow. They said they are not going to add to the \ndeficit. The proposal is to reduce Medicare by $500 billion. The \nbalance will be raised in the form of tax increases, revenue raisers.\n  People are looking at this and saying: OK, a $1.7 trillion expansion; \nwhat do we get in exchange for that? People will be covered who are not \ncurrently covered, but a lot of people who don't have insurance still \nwon't be covered under the proposal the Finance Committee is currently \nconsidering. But it is still going to cost $1.7 trillion.\n  If you are a taxpayer saying: OK, what is this going to cost and how \nmay it impact my insurance premiums if I already have health insurance \ncoverage, I think the answer was given by CBO Director Doug Elmendorf \nin response to a question. Senator Cornyn posed the question, and it \nhad to do with: Will this lead to higher premiums? If you read from the \nletter, it says:\n\n       Senator, our judgment is that that piece of the legislation \n     would raise insurance premiums by roughly the amount of the \n     money collected.\n\n  Whatever is collected in the higher taxes that are going to be put on \nsomebody else--that is always the assumption--is going to be put, in \nthis case, on the insurance companies. But does anybody believe for a \nminute that will not be passed on to the American consumer? It is going \nto be.\n  So what does this legislation actually do to drive costs down? My \nwhole argument in this health care reform debate has been that anything \nwe do ought to bend the cost curve down, not raise it. Almost every \nproposal we have seen increases or raises the cost curve. This is \nanother example, according to the CBO, of a plan that, in the end, is \ngoing to raise insurance premiums for most Americans.\n  The other thing I think is important to note here--and the same \nresponse was given by the chief of staff of the Joint Tax Committee. He \nanswered the question the same way: We analyzed this largely falling on \nthe consumer, and that would happen in a couple of different ways. This \nis going to be eventually little paid by the consumer. It is a tax \nincrease.\n  The other point is that the assumption is that the portion that is \nnot raised through revenue increases, tax increases, will be paid for \nin the form of Medicare reductions. Do we really believe $500 billion \nin Medicare reductions will be achieved by the Congress? And we know \nhow difficult it is around here to talk about reducing Medicare. My \nview is, if we are talking about making Medicare more sustainable, we \nought to look at how we can reform it and find savings. But this is \ngoing to take a new entitlement program and put it on top of a program \nthat we are told will be bankrupt by 2017.\n  I still think we can do health care reform here that does bend the \ncost curve down, lowers costs for most Americans, and provides access \nto more Americans as well. We have not seen a proposal yet that doesn't \ninclude a significant increase in the amount of Federal Government \ncontrol, of power in Washington, DC, an expansion of the Federal \nGovernment. We have not seen a proposal that actually does anything to \nget costs under control for most consumers. For most consumers, that is \nthe issue; it is a cost issue. Furthermore, we are looking at \nproposals, from a taxpayer's standpoint, that will increase spending \nand borrowing and it will pass more and more of that debt on to future \ngenerations.\n  So we need to proceed slowly and get this right. We need to focus on \nideas that actually reduce costs, such as allowing people to buy \ninsurance across State lines or to join small business health plans, \nwhich is something we have tried to get through for a long period of \ntime, unsuccessfully, or dealing with medical malpractice reform, so \npeople can get insurance in the private marketplace.\n  This level of government expansion, this level of spending and \nborrowing is unacceptable to the American people. That is why they are \nreacting so negatively. It comes down to control and who has the power. \nIs it the Federal Government or the American people? It comes down to \ncosts. What are we doing to future generations with the amount of \nspending and borrowing we are doing?\n  I hope we will take it slower and get it right and focus on \ninitiatives and ideas that will get costs under control and that before \nCongress adopts health care reform, that will be the focus, not \nexpansion of government in Washington, DC, at trillions of dollars in \nadditional costs to the American taxpayer and no savings to the \nratepayer out there trying to get their insurance premiums under \ncontrol.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska is recognized.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I wish to start out this morning by \ncomplimenting the distinguished Senator from Tennessee and the Senator \nfrom South Dakota. They have raised some excellent points. As I have \nlistened to them, I have to tell you, I think they have offered a lot \nto move the debate forward.\n  I rise today to shine the light on what I consider budgetary gimmicks \nand omissions in the Finance Committee health care proposal.\n  Both Republicans and Democrats should be able to agree that one of \nthe things we need to do in accomplishing true health care reform is to \ndo it in a fiscally responsible way. We all went back home in August, \nand I heard the message very loud and clear from Nebraskans. They want \nhonesty and full transparency as we attempt to achieve health care \nreform.\n  Americans believed the President when he said he wanted an open and \ntransparent process. We all agree on that. Unfortunately, what we have \nis not transparent, and I argue that it is based on false assumptions. \nHonestly, an American family would have to hire a whole team of \naccountants to understand all that is hidden in the Finance Committee \ndraft.\n  While the CBO has scored the bill as $774 billion, the real cost of \nthe bill--and that cost is moving up every day--is closer to $1.7 \ntrillion over 10 years, as the previous two Senators have pointed out. \nWhat its supporters neglect to tell you is that the main spending \nprovisions in this proposal don't go into effect until 2013. That is \nright, the American public will have to wait 4 years before most of the \nnew initiatives even get off the ground. So none of us should be \nsurprised when the American people really laugh at an arbitrary \ndeadline of the end of the week or the first of next week for \nfinalizing committee action. They don't understand the need to hurry. \nThe proponents claim it is such a crisis that we should rush through. \nYet their fixes don't take effect for 4 years.\n  You can understand the American public's frustration and skepticism. \nThey must watch the evening news--whatever their flavor of news is--and \nlook at the Capitol dome and ask the question: What is going on? What \nis happening out there? They have to be scratching their heads in \namazement. If they ran their business or household this way, they would \nbe in bankruptcy.\n  If that weren't enough to fill an entire gymnasium full of townhall \nparticipants, there is, unfortunately,\n\n[[Page S9704]]\n\nmuch more. The proposal requires new taxes on everything from medical \ndevice manufacturers, health insurance premiums, and pharmaceutical \nmanufacturers, topped off with additional Medicare cuts of about $500 \nbillion and, of course, unfunded mandates on the States in the form of \nthe expansion of Medicaid, which I am all too familiar with as a former \nGovernor.\n  Let me translate this. Higher taxes will be passed on to the American \npeople. All these taxes, these fees, and these mandates will only \nincrease the cost of health care. They don't decrease it when all this \nis passed on to the American consumers.\n  While the promised benefits don't kick in until year 4, the taxes and \nfees, interestingly enough, start right away, almost on day one.\n  In effect, the bill is structured to impose 10 years and $848 billion \nworth of new taxes and fees, and you get in return 6 years of \nadditional benefits under this bill. The creative accounting, \nunfortunately, only appears to get cheers inside the beltway. Yet the \naverage American thinks we don't have a clue.\n  Another hidden cost is the new mandate on States through an expansion \nof Medicaid. I wish to spend a moment on that.\n  Partial costs to expand the Medicaid Program up to 133 percent of the \npoverty limit will be put on the States. This unfunded mandate will \ncost States--and estimates will vary--about $42 billion. Of course, \nthat is not built into the cost estimate, not because the American \npeople don't pay for it, because they will, but because it doesn't fall \non the Federal budget. Who gets to pay the costs here? Well, obviously, \nonce again, it will fall on the American people.\n  I come from a State that is fiscally responsible. We have only two \nways to deal with this kind of issue because our constitution prohibits \nus from borrowing money. What a unique concept; Nebraska doesn't borrow \nmoney. We have only two choices: we can cut programs or we can raise \ntaxes. If we cut programs, things such as education, senior \ninitiatives, infrastructure projects, prisons to keep the bad guys out \nof society, and other very valuable programs could find their budgets \ndestroyed.\n  In these times of tight budgets, States have already slashed their \nbudgets. They are down to the bone, and they are trying to figure out \nhow they will balance next year's budget. I suggest the Federal \nGovernment giving them another layer of spending is not the answer.\n  The other alternative is to raise taxes, hit the consumer again. But \nthat is not the right way to go either. But it seems that what we are \ndoing with this mother of all unfunded mandates is making this choice \ninevitable.\n  Folks in Nebraska and across the country are going to resent seeing \ntheir State paying higher taxes because the Federal Government put them \nin this fiscal straitjacket. In addition, one of the main pay-fors in \nthis legislation is $400 billion, $500 billion in Medicare cuts. \nDespite the fact that the Medicare trustees report projects that \nMedicare will be bankrupt by 2017, none of the $400 billion goes toward \nshoring up our already pending fiscal crisis.\n  The false promise being made is that we can both fund this new \nentitlement with Medicare money and keep our commitment to senior \ncitizens. I am not naive enough to buy that bag of goods and neither \nare our seniors. We are asking them to choose the prize behind the \ncurtain when the prize is a goat.\n  I am deeply concerned that we are compounding the problem by not \nreinvesting these dollars back into Medicare. That is why I hope the \nFinance Committee will see the light today and adopt important \namendments by the junior Senators from Kansas and Nevada.\n  Even the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office Director admitted \nyesterday that these cuts to Medicare will decrease current insurance \nbenefits that our seniors now enjoy.\n  Finally, this Finance Committee proposal is built on false \nassumptions when it comes to cost containment. The bill is based on the \nfantasyland assumption that scheduled sometimes double-digit payment \ncuts to medical professionals will be allowed to take place. The \nhistory is very much the opposite. We do the doctor fix on an annual \nbasis.\n  Any Senator who votes for this Finance Committee proposal should be \nrequired to publicly state their support for a 25-percent cut in \nphysician reimbursement rates beginning in 2 years.\n  Their proposals credit themselves free money by assuming savings in \nthis area. Yet they know Congress waives the Budget Act, waives pay-go, \nand suspends these cuts year in and year out with a lot of support, I \nmight add.\n  In fact, the Congressional Budget Office states:\n\n       These projections assume that the proposals are enacted and \n     remained unchanged throughout the next two decades, which is \n     often not the case for major legislation.\n       For example, the sustainable growth rate, SGR, mechanism \n     governing Medicare's payments to physicians has frequently \n     been modified to avoid reductions in those payments.\n\n  Therefore, I am not going to count on Congress acting any differently \nin the near future, and any cost estimate that assumes otherwise, I \nsay, is not based on reality. We all know what they say about good \nintentions, but I still believe you do not spend money until you know \nfrom where the money is coming.\n  The American public simply deserves a very transparent discussion \nabout our current and future actions, what they are going to cost, and \nwhat they will lead to in terms of our health care system instead of a \nhouse of cards. The American people have asked us to be transparent. \nThey know we have to make tough decisions. They just want to understand \nthe ramifications of what we are deciding. That means they want us to \nread the bill. They want us to do that before we vote. They want us to \nhave a full picture of how this will affect budget deficits and the \nfiscal outlook. And they want us to communicate that to them.\n  The American people want to know how this proposal will impact them \nand what it will do to the current health care system and their costs. \nBasically, they want us to know all the details before we rush into a \nvote. That means we need the time to look at this bill. This is going \nto be a 1,000-page bill, a Senate Finance Committee with no legislative \nlanguage that is working now, a plan to consider almost 500 amendments, \nand yet they want to get it done this week. Mr. President, it is time \nto call a timeout and get this right.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, as I listen to all of the discussion \nabout health care, I have come to several conclusions. No. 1, there is \na 100-percent bipartisan agreement that something has to be done. But \nNo. 2, there is a growing strong bipartisan agreement that this bill is \nnot the something that should be done.\n  From the New York Times:\n\n       The first big fight over the Senate Finance Committee's \n     health care legislation erupted Tuesday night: a rollicking \n     brawl over a deal that the Obama administration cut with the \n     pharmaceutical industry to achieve $80 billion in saving on \n     drug costs over 10 years, money that would help pay for the \n     legislation. Top House Democrats have hated the deal from the \n     get-go. Senate Democrats are now bitterly divided. . . .\n\n  This resonates with the comment that the Republican leader made where \nhe says the only truly bipartisan thing about this bill is the \nopposition to it. I think this demonstrates that we need to slow down, \nstart over, and do it right.\n  We have heard many speeches saying we can't wait. We see people \ncarrying signs: ``Health Care Reform Now.'' We have just heard from the \nSenator from Nebraska that this bill will give us health care reform \nnot now--4 years from now. Four years is a long time to wait. We can do \nit faster than 4 years, but we can do it faster only if we slow down, \nstart over, and do it right. We can do it in this Congress if we slow \ndown, start over, and do it right.\n  What are the things on which we need to start over? The looming \nchallenge in this whole debate is cost. The numbers that are being \nthrown around are astronomical, and we still don't know exactly what \nthey are. These are still estimates. The Senate Finance Committee has \nnot reduced their proposal to legislative language. The CBO says: We \ncan't give it a score until we get legislative language, and by the \ntime we get the language, it is at least\n\n[[Page S9705]]\n\n2 weeks before we can produce a score. Yet we are being told we must \npass this bill next week? Slow down, start over, and do it right.\n  We are going to pay for it, we are being told, by taking $500 billion \nout of Medicare. And every study of Medicare says at least $500 billion \nis being wasted, so that is easy. Let's take $500 billion out, and we \nwill solve the problem.\n  We can take $500 billion out of Medicare with a meat cleaver, and \nthat means we are cutting the programs that are good in Medicare, the \nthings about Medicare that work as well as the things that do not work. \nMaybe we should slow down, start over, and do it right by taking the \n$500 billion out of Medicare with a surgeon's scalpel rather than a \nmeat cleaver and spend the time to find out where the money is being \nwasted, how it could be changed, where the incentives need to be \naltered so that the $500 billion comes out of the right part of \nMedicare instead of with a slash with a meat cleaver.\n  Medicare is not the only one where more careful examination could \nproduce significant savings. We are told that Medicaid in 2007 spent \n$30 billion improperly. If we extrapolate that over the 10-year period \nthat we use to make these projections, that is $300 billion that could \ncome from Medicaid. Are we going to take a meat cleaver to Medicaid and \nsay we are going to arbitrarily cut $300 billion out of Medicaid in the \nnext 10 years because there is a study that says that much is being \nwasted or are we going to listen to the Governors, bipartisan, Democrat \nas well as Republican, who are telling us: What you are doing in this \nbill on Medicaid is going to bankrupt the States because they simply \ncannot sustain the kinds of increases that are built into it and \nnothing will be done about the $30 billion of waste and abuse that is \nthere.\n  How are we going to get at it? How are we going to discover what that \n$30 billion is? How are we going to deal with it in a way that does not \nbankrupt the States? To answer that question, we need to slow down, \nstart over, and get it right.\n  If I can be provincial and parochial for just a moment, my home State \nof Utah has done a great amount of work on health care. They have been \nvery entrepreneurial and innovative. They have come up with ideas to \ndeal with health care, ideas from which we at the Federal level could \nlearn a great deal, but we cannot learn anything from the \nexperimentation that is going on in the States if we continue this rush \nto an arbitrary deadline, to get this thing done within a couple of \nweeks.\n  The States have great experience with this. There is much the States \ncan teach us. There is much the Governors need to tell us before we \nrush to spend this much money, which means we should slow down, start \nover, and do it right.\n  As I talk with the businesses, as I talk with my constituents in \nUtah, I come back to the same thing I said at the beginning. There is a \n100-percent bipartisan agreement that something has to be done. Our \nlong-term challenges with health care are absolutely unsustainable, to \nuse a Washington word. That is another word for disastrous.\n  We have to deal with this, and we have to deal with it in an \nintelligent way. The numbers are very large, and we have to recognize \nthe stakes are very high. But that is, again, the message that comes \nfrom those who will be most affected by what we do, either in their \nbusinesses or their personal lives or their tax returns. It is very \nimportant that we get it right; and if we are going to get it right, we \nhave to start over. If we are going to start over, we have to slow \ndown.\n  That is the wisdom this body should adopt as it deals with this \nchallenge so that we can change the reality of where the bipartisan \nagreement is. Instead of the bipartisan agreement growing in opposition \nto the bill, we need a circumstance where a bipartisan agreement will \ngrow in support of a bill that will solve our problem. The bill before \nthe Finance Committee is not that bill, and a large number of Members \nof this body of both parties are increasingly coming to that \nconclusion.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman).

Res. 253\n\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) condemns the August 20, 2009, release from prison in \n     Scotland of Abdel Baset al-Megrahi, the lone person convicted \n     in connection with the 1988 bombing of a Pan Am flight over \n     Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people, including 189 \n     Americans;\n       (2) condemns the lavish welcome home ceremony held in \n     Tripoli, Libya, to celebrate the release of Mr. al-Megrahi; \n     and\n       (3) calls on the Government of Libya to apologize for the \n     public celebration of Mr. al-Megrahi's release.\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I have a brief statement I would like to \nmake about the resolution.\n  I rise today in support of S. Res. 253, a resolution condemning the \nrelease and vile welcome home celebration held for Libyan terrorist and \nconvicted Lockerbie bomber, Abdel Baset al-Megrahi. I also express my \nsincere thanks and appreciation to my colleagues, Senators Lautenberg, \nGillibrand, Webb, Voinovich, Cardin, Casey, McCaskill, Menendez, and \nMikulski for agreeing to cosponsor this resolution.\n  Mr. President, it is upsetting that Libyan leader COL Muammar Qaddafi \nis in New York City at this very moment and will be given an \nopportunity to speak before the United Nations General Assembly. I am \ndisappointed because I sympathize enormously with the families and \nvictims of the deadly Pan Am terrorist attack who will be reminded of \nthat deadly day in December almost 21 years ago when they see Qaddafi \ngrandstanding at the U.N.\n  On December 21, 1998, Pan Am Flight 103, en route from London's \nHeathrow Airport to New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, \nsuddenly exploded over the town of Lockerbie, Scotland, killing all 259 \non board and 11 people on the ground. Many New Yorkers and New Jersey \nresidents were among the 189 Americans killed in the bombing. A young \nman from my neighborhood, whose family was active in a neighboring \nparish--Our Lady Help of Christians--was killed in the bloom of his \nearly life. That story could be repeated over and over because there \nwere many students who were coming back from a program affiliated with \nSyracuse University. We know people all over New York State were lost, \nand many young college students.\n  In 2001, at least the families of the victims found some solace when \njustice appeared to have been delivered as Abdel Baset al-Megrahi was \nconvicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. But to the shock \nof many people on both sides of the Atlantic, on August 20 of this \nyear, the Scottish Government released al-Megrahi, who is currently \nsuffering from prostate cancer and is predicted to have about 3 months \nto live. The Scottish Government claimed the release was a \ncompassionate gesture given his failing health.\n  Upon his return, thousands of young men, who had been transported by \nthe Libyan Government, gathered at the airport in Tripoli to greet the \nterrorist. They waved banners, threw flower petals after al-Megrahi was \nescorted from prison by Seif al-Islam el-Qaddafi, the son of COL \nMuammar Qaddafi. The hero's welcome Libya gave to this terrorist truly \nshocks the conscience and deserves a formal rebuke.\n\n[[Page S9706]]\n\n  It is outrageous that the Libyan Government would so blatantly \ndisregard the suffering the families have endured for more than two \ndecades. S. Res. 253 demands the Government of Libya apologize for the \ngross homecoming celebration of al-Megrahi.\n  This resolution does three important things: First, it condemns the \nAugust 20, 2009, release from prison in Scotland of Abdel Baset al-\nMegrahi, the lone person convicted in connection with the 1988 bombing \nof a Pan Am flight over Lockerbie, Scotland, that killed 270 people; \nsecond, it condemns the lavish welcome home ceremony held in Tripoli to \ncelebrate the release of al-Megrahi; and third, it calls on the \nGovernment of Libya to apologize for the public celebration of al-\nMegrahi's release.\n  Al-Megrahi only served 8 years in jail. He committed one of the most \ndastardly terrorist attacks that has been known in the last 100 years. \nEight years later, the families haven't recuperated. They live with \ntheir losses every day, every minute. There is a hole in their hearts \nthat will never heal. To release al-Megrahi is terrible; to celebrate \nthe release of this awful terrorist is even worse. And for the world to \nremain silent, the U.N. not to condemn but to greet Qaddafi--strike \nthree. It is an awful situation.\n  I call on the Senate to support S. Res. 253 condemning the release \nand the vile welcome home celebration. I hope all Senators will join us \nin cosponsoring the resolution. Murder and terrorism are not forgivable \noffenses, and refuge should never be offered to those determined to \nterrorize and murder the innocent. If we do so, we are encouraging \nfuture terrorists to repeat these awful crimes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was deeply saddened by the recent \nannouncement of the distinguished Senator from Florida, Mel Martinez, \nthat he had decided to resign from the Senate. Although he had served \nin the Senate for a relatively short period of time--since January 4, \n2005--he had become a very important influence in this body.\n  As the first Cuban American to serve in the Senate, he shared with us \nhis personal experiences and insights into his early life in Cuba, \nincluding his separation from his parents at a young age as he traveled \nto Florida to embark upon a very successful new life of learning and \nleadership in the United States. He earned undergraduate and law \ndegrees from Florida State University. He served as a member of the \nOrlando Utilities Commission and was elected Mayor of Orange County. \nPresident George W. Bush selected him to serve as a member of his \nCabinet, as Secretary of Housing and Urban Development. He was elected \na United States Senator in 2004 and quickly established himself as an \neffective advocate for his State in the Senate.\n  Mel Martinez quickly became an active and influential member of the \nArmed Services Committee as well as the Banking, Housing and Urban \nAffairs Committee, and the Commerce, Science and Transportation \nCommittee. His constituents benefitted in particular from his service \nas ranking member of the Senate's Special Committee on Aging.\n  Mr. President I congratulate my friend from Florida on his very \nsuccessful service and important contributions through his dedicated \npublic service in Florida and in our Nation's Capital. I have enjoyed \nserving with him, and I wish him all the best in the years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9706-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9706]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, with great respect to the President of \nthe United States, I am still shaking my head a little bit in disbelief \nat his speech yesterday on climate change at the Climate Change Summit \nin New York. Here we had 100 leaders from around the world in our \ncountry to talk about climate change and the President said what he has \nsaid before, which is that we need to stop putting so much carbon in \nthe air because carbon is the principal greenhouse gas that contributes \nto climate change, in the opinion of most scientists.\n  But in saying that, the President did not mention the one way we have \nto create a lot of low-cost electricity without putting any carbon in \nthe air, and that is nuclear power--a process that the United States \ninvented; a process that the United States operates more efficiently \nthan any other country in the world. It produces 19 percent of our \nelectricity, and our plants operate 90 percent of the time. Even \nFrance, which gets 80 percent of its electricity from nuclear power, \nonly operates its plants 80 percent of the time. He failed to mention \nnuclear power even though it produces 70 percent of our carbon-free \nelectricity, and even though every one of the other top five carbon \nemitting nations in the world are committed to a full-scale \nconstruction program for nuclear power.\n  This is what the President said:\n\n       The developed nations that caused much of the damage to the \n     climate over the last century have the responsibility to \n     lead--and that includes the United States.\n\n  Well, according to the Wall Street Journal on Monday, September 21, \nin its news pages, we know who produces the carbon: China is No. 1--6 \nmillion metric tons; the United States is No. 2--nearly 6 million \nmetric tons. So we produce about the same. Russia is next--1.7 million; \nIndia is next; Japan is next. Those are the top five carbo emitting \nnations.\n\n[[Page S9707]]\n\n  President Obama lectured other countries when he said:\n\n       But those rapidly developing nations--\n\n  And here he means China and India--\n\n     that will produce nearly all the growth in global carbon \n     emissions in the decade ahead must do their part as well.\n\n  He is right about that. The President went on to say:\n\n       We cannot meet these challenges unless all the largest \n     emitters of greenhouse gas pollution act together. There's no \n     other way.\n\n  He is right about that. But then, to my great astonishment--and I am \nsure to others--he stopped there and he basically was saying to China \nand to Russia and to India, as well as Japan: You must do something \nabout carbon. We are going to take the lead. Yet they all are building \nnuclear power plants that emit zero carbon and we haven't started one \nnew reactor in 30 years, even though we invented it. How can the \nPresident of the United States lecture other countries about the carbon \nthey produce--the principal greenhouse gas--when they are expanding the \none technology that could do the most to solve the problem?\n  Let's be very elementary here. Coal and natural gas plants produce \nnearly 40 percent of the carbon when they produce electricity. The \nPresident did boast of how the United States is committed to building \nwindmills and solar panels. In fact, his administration wants to build \n20 percent of our electricity from wind turbines. These aren't \ngrandma's windmills, these are the giant 50-story wind turbines that \nthey want to string along the Appalachian Mountain tops, from the \nSmokey Mountains to the White Mountains, along the coastlines, and run \n19,000 miles of transmission lines to get the power to our homes and \nbusinesses. That is the plan. And to a point, that plan can help. I \nmean, renewable energy--solar panels, wind turbines--is a supplement to \nthe electricity we need. But today, wind turbines and solar panels \nproduce about 3 to 4 percent of America's carbon-free electricity. \nNuclear power produces 70 percent of our carbon-free electricity. So \nwhy not expand nuclear power? Yet we haven't built a new nuclear \npowerplant in 30 years.\n  What is happening around the world? Well, they are not slowing down. \nThey are taking full advantage, as the world often has, of American \ningenuity. We invented nuclear power here. And after we invented the \natom bomb, President Eisenhower and other scientists in the 1950s said: \nLet's have an atoms for peace program.\n  So we went off on two tracks. We used nuclear reactors to operate our \nNavy, which we have done successfully, without incident ever since the \n1950s. Admiral Rickover pioneered that. So today we have about 80 Navy \nvessels operated by reactors and, during the 1970s and 1980s, we built \n104 nuclear reactors. This was the Atoms for Peace Program. We took \nwhat probably was the greatest scientific invention of the last \ncentury, the reactor, and used it to produce a lot of low-cost, \nreliable energy--which is the dream of the world, to have a lot of low-\ncost, reliable energy for everyone in the world. That is the one of the \nsingle best steps toward reducing poverty and increasing prosperity.\n  So here we are in the United States, using our 104 nuclear reactors--\nnot having built a new one in the last 30 years--to produce 19 percent \nof our electricity and 70 percent of our carbon-free electricity. But \nwhat is happening around the world? There are 44 new nuclear \npowerplants under construction in the world. China has four under \nconstruction. This was the first country the President would be \nlecturing: Do something about carbon-free electricity. So China is \nplanning 132 nuclear powerplants and we are constructing zero. We have \nnot constructed one in 30 years. How can we lecture China about carbon \nif they are building 132 nuclear powerplants, which would be enough to \nproduce one-fourth of all the electricity the United States uses? That \nis more than we produce today through nuclear power.\n  Russia is building two a year. One reason Russia is doing it is \nbecause they want to sell their natural gas to Europe at a lot more \nexpensive price, so they are taking advantage of nuclear power to raise \ntheir standard of living. Japan is 36 percent nuclear power today. \nJapan, as everyone knows, suffered under the two atom bombs that were \ndropped. But they have come to terms with the safe use of atoms for \npeace, nuclear-power-produced electricity--36 percent of their \nelectricity is nuclear. They are building two more plants. The United \nStates has not built a plant in 30 years.\n  South Korea, one of the most successful emerging countries--in \nAmerica, one of those countries that the President might be saying you \nneed to do something about climate change--they are. Forty percent of \ntheir electricity is carbon-free nuclear power and they are building \neight more nuclear plants by 2015 and we have not built one in 30 \nyears.\n  India, the largest democracy--we point our finger at them and say we \ndon't have to do anything about climate change until you do. They are. \nThey are considering a thorium reactor. They are committed to nuclear \npower, partly because of the agreement between the United States and \nthe Bush administration and India, and we are helping them build \nnuclear powerplants. We are helping China as well. But we have not \nbuilt one in 30 years.\n  The President even said Iran has the right to build a nuclear \npowerplant; not a nuclear bomb but a nuclear powerplant. We have not \nbuilt one in 30 years.\n  France--we don't usually like to say the French are ahead of us. We \nhave a little love-hate relationship with France, but look what they \nhave done. They have taken our nuclear reactor invention and 80 percent \nof the electricity in France comes from nuclear power. They have among \nthe lowest rates of carbon emissions in the entire European Union. They \nhave among the lowest electricity prices in the European Union. They \nare selling electricity to Germany, which is the only one of the \nEuropean countries that has said they don't want any nuclear power. So \nthey are buying nuclear power from France.\n  There are many other countries in the world that are using nuclear \npower. But as the Wall Street Journal said: China, the United States, \nRussia, India, and Japan produce most of the carbon. Scientists believe \ncarbon produces 40 percent of the greenhouse gases that cause global \nwarming and the United States is the only one of those five countries \nthat is not committed to the construction of new nuclear powerplants.\n  The President's plan instead is an energy tax and renewable mandates \nthat would force us to build more giant wind turbines. Wind turbines \nwork some places. They don't work in my part of the country. The wind \ndoesn't blow enough, and we don't want to see them on our mountaintops. \nI am a sponsor of Senator Cardin's mountaintop removal bill. We don't \nwant people blowing up our mountaintops and dumping the tops of the \nmountains in our streams. We don't want them putting 50-story wind \nturbines that don't turn more than 19 percent of the time up there \neither. So there is a growing recognition that in addition to the \nunreliability of renewable energy, the energy sprawl on our landscape \nis something we should think about.\n  One thing we should think about is think about where to put renewable \nenergy installations, to make sure they are in appropriate places. The \nother thing to think about is are there any alternatives to renewable \nenergy. The answer, of course, is, yes, there are alternatives to \nrenewable energy. The principal one is nuclear power.\n  Let me be specific. In order to make 20 percent of our electricity in \nthe United States from carbon-free sources, we could either build about \n186,000 wind turbines--these are 50 stories tall--that would cover an \narea about the size of West Virginia. Or we could build 100 new nuclear \nreactors. We have 104 today. Remember, China is building 132. Today, \nnuclear produces about 20 percent of all our electricity; wind provides \nabout 1.3 percent.\n  Nuclear power is baseload power because it operates 90 percent of the \ntime. That means we could have it on almost all the time. Wind power is \nintermittent. It only works when and where the wind blows and there is \nno way today to commercially store large amounts of that electricity.\n  Nuclear, as I mentioned earlier, operates 90 percent of the time. \nWind operates about 33 percent of the time.\n  When you read that you have 1,000 megawatts of electricity from \nnuclear,\n\n[[Page S9708]]\n\nthat means you have 900 megawatts because it operates 90 percent of the \ntime. When you read you have 1,000 megawatts of wind, that means you \nprobably have 300 or 350 megawatts because it only operates a third of \nthe time and, as they found in Denmark and other places, the wind often \nblows at night when we don't need it. We have lots of unused \nelectricity at night.\n  As far as additional infrastructure, building 100 new nuclear \nreactors would take very little new infrastructure because you could \nlocate them mostly on the existing sites where we now have the 104 \nnuclear reactors we have today. Wind turbines, on the other hand, as I \nsaid, would take an area the size of West Virginia, plus 19,000 miles \nof new transmission lines that would go from unpopulated areas, through \nsuburban areas, to populated areas where people need the electricity.\n  What about the Federal subsidy? Sometimes people say these big new \nnuclear plants must have a big federal subsidy, but the fact is they do \nnot. To produce the first 100 plants that we have, they were built \nwithout much federal subsidy. To build 100 more, the estimates are for \n$17.5 billion over 10 years, including a capped nuclear production tax \ncredit--that would build the 100 nuclear plants. To build 186,000 wind \nturbines the taxpayer would shell out about $170 billion.\n  We hear a lot of about green jobs, let's have renewable electricity \nbecause that produces green jobs. Green jobs are good jobs. We have two \nbig new plants in Tennessee that the Governor recruited and they make \npolysilicone, which is for the purpose of making solar panels. We hope \nsolar energy works and we believe it will. Today it costs four to five \ntimes in our area what other electricity costs, but we hope the price \ncomes down and we are all for that. But the estimate for nuclear's \ngreen jobs to build 100 reactors would be about 250,000 construction \njobs. To build 180,000 1.5 megawatt wind turbines would be about a \nthird of that, 73,000 construction jobs, and then 70,000 permanent jobs \nfor nuclear and 77,000 permanent jobs for the wind turbines. They would \nbe about the same.\n  The lifetime of a nuclear plant is about 60 to 80 years. The lifetime \nof the wind turbines is about 20 to 25 years. At a recent hearing which \nwas chaired by the Senator from California, we talked with the Interior \nSecretary about the possibility of bonds for the developers who are \nputting up these 186,000 turbines. What if they wear out after 15 or 20 \nyears, which is what they are expected to do? Or what if policies \nchange? Or what if subsidies disappear? Or what if we decide we prefer \nother forms of energy? Who is going to take them down? We need to think \nabout that, just as we did not think about abandoned mines all over the \ncountry--47,000 alone in California.\n\n  Then there is the visual impact I mentioned. If you build 100 big \nnuclear powerplants, 100 reactors, they have tall cooling towers. There \nis a visual impact there. But you do it mostly on the sites where the \n104 are today, where they are well accepted by the people in those \ncommunities and it is only 100 of them and it only takes about 100 \nsquare miles. Mr. President, 186,000 wind turbines would cover 25,000 \nsquare miles, which is an area the size of West Virginia.\n  I hope as we proceed, after health care, to our debate on energy and \nclimate change, that we will take a more realistic attitude. I am one \nof those Senators who believe climate change is a problem. I believe \nhumans are contributing to it. I think it is time for us to stop \nemitting so much carbon into the air. But I would like for us to do \nthat in a low-cost, sensible way that permits us to keep our jobs in \nthis country and not in a high-cost way that causes us to drive jobs \noverseas, looking for cheap energy. Every single Republican Senator has \nendorsed an energy plan that is, No. 1, 100 new nuclear powerplants in \n20 years; No. 2, electrify half our cars and trucks in 20 years; No. 3, \noffshore exploration for natural gas, which is low carbon and oil--we \nshould use our own while we use it; and, No. 4, doubling research and \ndevelopment for alternative energy. How can we make solar cost-\ncompetitive? How can we find a way to recapture carbon from coal \nplants? How can we have advanced biofuels? How can we find the fourth \ngeneration of nuclear energy that recycles used nuclear fuel in a way \nthat doesn't produce any plutonium?\n  It is not just the 40 Republican Senators who are interested in that. \nI have had a number of Democratic Senators talk with me about that. \nMany were far out in front of the issue before I began to speak so much \nabout it.\n  My hope would be that, as we look more seriously at the issue of \nclimate change and energy, that we adopt a low-cost energy strategy. We \ndon't need an energy tax that raises everybody's electric bill. We \ndon't need a renewable energy mandate that requires us to put up wind \nturbines in the Southeast, where the wind doesn't blow, anymore than we \nneed a nuclear energy mandate that requires people to put up nuclear \nplants where people don't want them or a hydroelectric mandate that \nrequires States to put up dams where there is no river. We need a low-\ncost, clean energy policy. Almost every other major country in the \nworld is deciding that nuclear power is the key to the future.\n  Wind is a supplement. One day solar may be widely used as supplement. \nBut for baseload power for a prosperous country there is no choice, in \nmy view. So climate change may be the inconvenient problem, as my \nfriend and fellow Tennessean, Al Gore, says. But nuclear power, I am \nafraid, is the inconvenient solution, and I hope we will move to the \nday when the President of the United States will go to a summit on \nclimate and say: Yes, we are building wind turbines in appropriate \nplaces; yes, we are having solar thermal panels in appropriate places; \nyes, we have doubled and tripled our investment in research and \ndevelopment for alternative energy. But as the country that invented \nlow-cost, reliable, clean, carbon-free nuclear energy, I, the President \nof the United States, have set as a goal that we will double the amount \nof electricity we will produce from nuclear power.\n  If the President went to Copenhagen and said we were committed to \nbuild 100 new nuclear powerplants in 20 years and to electrify half our \ncars and trucks in 20 years, just implementing those two goals would \nget us close to the Kyoto Protocol standards in 2030; just implementing \nthose two goals--100 new nuclear plants and electrifying half our cars \nand trucks--and we can do both. We already did both. Between 1970 and \n1990 we built 104 reactors, not to mention the 81 U.S. Navy vessels \npowered by nuclear reactors, so we have done that. Most experts, \nincluding many in the Obama administration, agree we can electrify half \nour cars and trucks, and probably without building one new powerplant \nbecause we have so much unused electricity at night. We can plug them \nin at night. We will be reducing imported oil, keeping the price of \nfuel low, we will be cleaning the air, and we will be dealing with \nglobal warming.\n  So why are we engaged in a 1,000-page energy tax, a cap-and-trade \nsystem that doesn't effectively deal with fuel, that adds to taxes, and \nit runs jobs overseas, when we have before us the technology we \ninvented that would lead us into the next century?\n  So I hope those issues evolve. I have seen that sometimes we do not \nhave the votes on this side of the aisle, but we have the right \nmessage. Sometimes we find if we work with our colleagues on the other \nside, we can have the same message.\n  So I believe there are many Democrats and all of the Republicans who \nwill join in setting a new national goal of 100 new nuclear plants in \nthe next 20 years. I believe we already have consensus on electrifying \nhalf of our cars and trucks. So if that will help us reach the climate \nchange goals, why don't we do that instead of a national goal that \nraises the price of energy, increases poverty, runs jobs overseas, and \ncauses all sorts of unanticipated problems?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, one of my delights has been to work \nwith the distinguished ranking member. I think anyone who was listening \nto this does see his erudition and knowledge on this particular \nsubject. So I would like to thank him and commend him for his remarks. \nSenator Alexander is correct. If we are going to address global \nwarming, all of the options have to\n\n[[Page S9709]]\n\nbe on the table and we have to rethink and relook at nuclear power as \nbeing a viable alternative as a clean fuel.\n  What has surprised me today is that so many people do not believe we \nface an emergency. So I have spent quite a bit of time trying to go \nback and look at global warming, look at books written by scientists, \ntalk with people who have knowledge, who have expertise. And I have \ncome to the conclusion that, unfortunately, it is real, that it is \nhappening, and that it is substantially impacting our Earth. So since \nthere is no one on the floor of the Senate wishing to offer an \namendment--and I would be very happy to cease and desist should there \nbe someone on the floor wishing to offer an amendment--I would like to \nsay a few words about what I see happening kind of as, not a \ncontretemps to what the Senator said but as a supporter of what he has \nsaid.\n  I think the science, as I said, is overwhelming. Our climate is \nchanging. The Earth's climate has, in fact, warmed by 1.1 to 1.6 \ndegrees Fahrenheit since the industrial revolution. People look at this \nand say: Oh, that is not very much. In fact, it is very much, and it \nchanges the dynamic. It impacts species. It kills some. It diminishes \nthe carbon sink of the ocean. It does a number of things. But let me \nread to you something that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate \nChange warned in 2007.\n\n       Warming of the climate system is unequivocal. Observational \n     evidence from all continents and most oceans show that many \n     natural systems are being affected by regional climate \n     change.\n\n  So I just pulled a few charts, and I would like to put them up and \nshow them to you, which is the evidence of the change in our climate.\n  This is the Greenland Ice Sheet. The year is 1979. Since 1979, 30 \npercent of the ice sheet has melted. Here is Greenland in 1979, both \nthe rust color as well as the interior. Here it is in 2007.\n  The source is the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. So \nthis is an actual rendering. It is pretty clear how much has melted. \nHere is the Arctic at the end of the 2007 ice melt. The sea ice cover \nwas 23 percent smaller than it was in 2005 and 39 percent below the \nlong-term average from 1979 to the year 2000.\n  So here is the whole Arctic ice sheet. We now know the Northwest \nPassage is open and is open for the first time in history all during \nthe year. You can see in 2005 the Arctic went all of the way out. 2007, \nhere it is. The source of this is the National Aeronautics and Space \nAdministration.\n  These are a couple of satellite photos from intelligence. We have \nlarge satellites in the air. They have photographed, as part of a \nproject, some of the melt. This happens to be the Beaufort Sea, both in \nAugust of 2001 and 2007.\n  This site near the edge of the ice pack in summer as shown here has \nponds of melted water forming on the surface. These dark pools absorb \nmore of the summertime solar radiation than does the surrounding ice, \nenhancing melting.\n  So observations of sea ice conditions reveal considerable year-to-\nyear variability. But these images display the variability with regard \nto the amount of melting and are an example of the long-term sequential \nrecord needed to support and understand this dynamic system. So pond \ncoverage, monitored over time, contributes to the estimate. But this is \nthe Beaufort Sea in 2001, and here it is in 2007. The dark is all open \nwater. I think it is pretty clear.\n  This other satellite photo is of Barrow, AK. Here we see the Chukchi \nSea in 2006, and it is pretty clear. Here it is in July of 2007, as \nphotographed by a U.S. satellite. What they say is sea ice forms along \nthe coast in the winter and generally melts or is breaking away by mid-\nJuly. Observation of sea ice reveals considerable year-to-year \nvariability.\n  This is similar to the other one, but I think this really shows the \ndifference in satellite photographs, and there is a project to continue \nfrom the atmosphere to prove the change in the ice map and the breakup \nof ice masses. So we know Greenland is melting at an extraordinary \npace.\n  This week NOAA's National Climatic Data Center announced that the \nworld's ocean surface temperature this summer was the warmest ever \nrecorded. These records date back to 1880.\n\n       In the Arctic, researchers have found that the widely \n     documented summer shrinking which I have just showed you \n     again resulted in the first ever opening of the Northwest \n     Passage.\n\n  In 2007, the winter thickness of that sea ice diminished by a record \n19 percent in one winter, and scientists fear if the glaciers of \nAntarctica and Greenland melt at the same time, sea levels could rise \nby 20 feet. People say: Oh, that cannot possibly happen. I tell my \nconstituents when they come: If you live near a beach in California, \nimagine what happens if the worldwide sea levels move up by 20 feet? In \nfact, some of this movement is already being felt in some of the \nSouthern Pacific Islands, with people even making arrangements to move \nfrom those islands.\n  In California we have seen a dramatic increase in catastrophic \nwildfires. I have spoken about that on the Senate floor. I have spoken \nabout it to my ranking member. We have spoken about it in committee. We \nbelieve this bill meets the challenge because for the first time it \nfunds the fire suppression needs of the Forest Service.\n  But in the last 5 years, wildfires have burned more than 10,000 homes \nin California alone. Scientists now are predicting a 70- to 90-percent \ndiminution of the Sierra snow pack. This is important because the \nSierra Nevada Mountains provide the water for most of California. As a \nmatter of fact, it provides the water for two-thirds of the State. That \nwater could be lost due to climate change. At the same time annual \nrainfalls are decreasing, and the State's forests are burning up like \nnever before. Here is the point: Can this warming be stopped? I have \nread a lot about it. I have talked to many people. I have talked to \nscientists I respect very much. What they tell me is it cannot be \ndiminished, but it might be able to be controlled.\n  The reason for this is that carbon released into the atmosphere does \nnot dissipate. It has remained in the atmosphere since the beginning of \nthe industrial revolution. So as carbon begins to pile up in the \natmosphere, it creates the warming, and it also creates the potential \ncatastrophe.\n  So what do we do? We need to begin by reducing emissions of carbon, \nand that is pretty clear now. I have seen no serious science that \ndiminishes this at this point in time. Instead, what they tell me is \nthat we need to reduce emissions by 65 to 80 percent below 1990 levels, \nand all by the middle of this century.\n  That translates to a goal of 450 parts per million of carbon dioxide \nin the atmosphere. So I think, as Senator Alexander alluded to, there \nis no single policy we can implement to curb our Nation's emissions, no \nsilver bullet. Rather, we need all the tools available, and this \nincludes laws designed to protect the public from dangerous air \npollution like the Clean Air Act.\n  Global warming is real. It is happening today. It is being charted by \nour satellites. It is being charted by our scientists. It is being \ncharted by those of us in this body, and I think the real key is if we \nare ready to admit that fact and take the action to make the necessary \nconversion.\n  The Senator from Tennessee just spoke, I think eloquently, about the \nmerits of nuclear power. I am one who believed originally that the \nhuman element and the waste element was such that it was not a viable \nalternative source. I no longer believe that. I think it is a viable \nalternative source, if we can fix the permit process that enables \nstate-of-the-art nuclear technology to be built in a relatively short \nperiod of time.\n  The yield from a nuclear plant, as we know, of clean energy is very \nlarge indeed. So that is a positive thing. We are debating now the \nplacement of solar facilities: where they should go, how big they \nshould be, and this is cutting edge for us. We have talked about it. I \nhave indicated my concern about projects that are too big, like 20 \nsquare miles in pristine areas of the California desert that we have \nbeen trying to protect with public funds over time.\n  We have learned that the largest solar facilities are perhaps 250 \nmegawatts. So if you have them way up to 800, 1,000, this is without \nprecedent. So we need to discuss if this is wise. If so, where should \nthey be? What is the upside? What is the downside? Do they require new \ntransmission corridors or are our existing transmission corridors \nadequate?\n  So I think these are the kinds of discussions that are most fruitful, \nhow we\n\n[[Page S9710]]\n\ndeal with the present circumstances. I hope that more Members of this \nbody recognize it is only a question of time.\n  I remember the days when there was never a funnel cloud off the coast \nof California. Now people report that they see funnel clouds off the \ncoast of California. Of course, one of the results of global warming is \nvolatility increases of weather patterns. Raindrops are bigger, more \nvolatile. Hurricanes, tornadoes are more volatile. We have to begin to \ndeal with that.\n  There are people who believe the Earth is immutable, that the Earth \nwill not change. Again, as I go back and read the literature and go \nback 255 million years, what is posited is that there was effectively \none land mass on Earth and, geologically, that can be shown today. Yet \nvarious events have broken up the land masses. Volcanic activity that \nproduces some of the greatest mountain ranges in the world also is \nbelieved to be responsible for the separation of the continents \nmillions of years ago. I don't know, but this is much of what we see as \nwe read some of the scientific material.\n  I do not believe the Earth is immutable. That is what has been so \ninteresting about foraging into Mars to try to see if Mars ever, in \nfact, had water on it. Time is infinite. Therefore, one never knows \nwhen the planet Earth was born, what it was like when it was born, how \nit has changed over the millennia. One thing we know in the instant of \nthis millennia we share, we have a problem, and we have to solve it.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for bringing to the debate what is \na valuable alternative source of energy that should be continued, just \nas wind, just as solar, just as biofuels, and just as moving away from \nthe internal combustion engine into hydrogen, electricity, those things \nwhich can guarantee our future.\n  The one thing that is frightening about all this is we will not do it \nfast enough and we will not do it in a way that is able to stop the \nclimate change which is now taking place, halt it. We can't reverse it \nbut halt it. The time has come for the United States to take a \nleadership role. We have a big conference at the end of the year, which \nwe have briefly discussed, where nations will come together and where \nthey will look at the United States and say: You are the wealthiest \ncountry on Earth. You have 5 percent of the population, but you use 25 \npercent of the energy. Therefore, you have an obligation to lead. \nCertainly, the Chinese will believe this, although, as the Senator has \npointed out, the Chinese have rapidly overtaken the United States in \ntheir release of global warming gases. But certainly India looks to us \nas well. So China, India, the big developing countries that so impact \nthe release of global warming gases, it is very important that our \nPresident stand tall, that the United States stands tall and that we \nare willing to offer real leadership to the world.\n  Whether this happens remains a cipher, but I very much hope and pray \nit does.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his remarks. I am happy to \nmake this small addition.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I congratulate the Senator from California. She is \ncharacteristically balanced in her approach and passionate about it \nwhich becomes a former mayor who is accustomed to making practical \ndecisions. We have all had to change our minds about some things as we \ngo along. There is in this body an entire range of views about climate \nchange. Some are about ready to jump off the cliff. Others believe it \nis a complete hoax. That is probably the way it is in the country today \namong a variety of views.\n  My own view is that if I had this much information about my house \nprobably catching on fire, I would buy some fire insurance. What we \nneed to do in the Senate is say: Yes, it is a problem, and we are \nhelping to cause it. What makes the most practical sense for dealing \nwith it in a rapid way without running our jobs overseas where they are \nlooking for cheap energy?\n  There are a variety of ways to do that. I totally agree that \nrenewable energies are an important new source, but we need to be smart \nabout it. One way to be smart is intensive research. We may find a way \nto make solar power a fourth the cost of what it is today. Then we have \nrooftops instead of thousands of square miles of thermal powerplants we \ncan use. We may find cost effective ways to recapture carbon from coal \nplants. That would be a blessing not only for us but for the world \nbecause it would mean low-cost energy without polluting the world. It \nis important to recognize that the Obama administration's chief \nscientist, Dr. Chu, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist, says \nunequivocally that nuclear power is safe and used nuclear fuel can be \nsafely stored onsite for 40 to 60 years, while we have a mini Manhattan \nproject to find the best way to recycle that used nuclear fuel, most \nlikely in a way that doesn't produce highly enriched uranium of the \nkind that causes proliferation concerns.\n  So the two questions often raised regarding nuclear power--what to do \nwith the waste and is it safe. The chief scientist in this \nadministration says those concerns aren't a problem. If that is the \ncase, then nuclear power has to be a big part of the solution.\n  I am delighted I had a chance to hear the Senator speak on climate \nchange. I hope, as we talk more about this over the next several \nmonths, we can agree on a consensus and permit the President to go to \ninternational summits and show the United States is actually leading.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Once again, Mr. President, I thank my colleague, the \nranking member, the distinguished Senator from Tennessee, for his \ncomments. I agree with him.\n  The floor is open. We are going back and forth using the time, but I \ndon't want Members to believe that if they come to the floor to offer \nan amendment, we will not promptly hear their amendment. The floor is \nopen. So, please, if you have an amendment, come to the floor. The \nfiling deadline is in 36 minutes. Hopefully, we will know what we are \nfacing in about 36 minutes. We would like to move this bill and move on \nto Defense appropriations.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Recognizing Angel Flight and Mack Secord\n\n  Mr. CHAMBLISS. Madam President, I rise today to recognize the great \nwork that is done by the Angel Flight organization and, in particular, \none of its Georgia members, Mack Secord. In the world of nonprofits, \nAngel Flight stands out for its determination to bring those in need \nlifesaving medical care. In a world of dedicated volunteers, Mack \nSecord stands out for coupling his passion for flying with his passion \nto help his fellow man.\n  Angel Flight's creed is that the cost of travel should never stand in \nthe way of patients receiving necessary medical care. Through a network \nof volunteer pilots, Angel Flight specializes in flying those in need \nto medical facilities at distant locations.\n  In Georgia, we are proud that the DeKalb Peachtree Airport in metro \nAtlanta is home to Angel Flight, the original volunteer pilot \norganization serving those who live in or traveling to or through \nGeorgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, and the Carolinas.\n  Since the year 2000, Angel Flight's missions of hope have increased \nmore than 760 percent. Last year, these generous volunteer pilots flew \n2,266 missions, serving patients with 167 different medical conditions \nwho ranged in age from newborn to 100 years old.\n  In some of our Nation's most trying hours, the pilots and \ncoordinators of Angel Flight were there. In the aftermath of 9/11, they \ntransported relief workers, firefighters, Red Cross personnel, and FBI \nagents to New York and Washington when commercial air traffic was \ngrounded. They served as first responders during Hurricanes Katrina and \nRita, flying 450 relief missions that carried supplies, medical \nequipment, and volunteers into disaster areas, and reunited families \nseparated by the storms.\n\n[[Page S9711]]\n\n  In recognition of the service of its volunteers, Angel Flight \nreceived awards from the Red Cross and the National Aeronautic \nAssociation.\n  One of Angel Flight's dedicated volunteers is Mack Secord of Atlanta. \nSimply put, Mack's life has always been about service. He is one of the \noriginal 15 pilots of Angel Flight of Georgia. But before he found his \ncalling transporting adults and children to hospitals, burn centers, \nand cancer treatment facilities, Mack had another calling: his country. \nMack spent 42 years as a pilot in the U.S. Air Force. For 5 of those \nyears, he served as the Air Force's senior spokesman at the Pentagon.\n  Flying and helping others have always been Mack's twin passions. In \n1964, while in the Air Force, he participated in a daring humanitarian \nairlift in the Congo that saved more than 2,000 people who had been \ntaken hostage. For his efforts, Mack and his colleagues received the \nprestigious Mackay Trophy awarded by the Air Force for the most \nmeritorious flight of the year.\n  Since 1985, Mack has donated his time, his Cessna 180, and the cost \nof his fuel to Angel Flight. On his first mission, he picked up a \nlittle boy in Columbus, GA, who had terrible burns on his face and body \nfrom pulling a frying pan off a stove. Mack says he didn't know burn \npatients require continuing treatment. He said:\n\n       I realized during the first flight that this was an \n     important service and that I could make a difference.\n\n  Mack is a one-man cheering section for Angel Flight. He spreads the \nword to the Lions Clubs, Kiwanis Clubs, Rotary Clubs, pilots \nassociations, schools, churches, and anyone who will listen. He jokes \nthat he will give his 20-minute PowerPoint presentation to any group of \npeople who will sit still. This remarkable man also volunteers at the \nHartsfield-Jackson Airport USO, works at the Atlanta Community Food \nBank, and participates in a program to read to the blind. But his first \nlove is flying.\n  Last August, Mack received the Wright Brothers Master Pilot Award \nfrom the FAA to commemorate 50 years of flying without accidents, \nincidents, or violations. In October, Mack was given the first-ever \nLifetime Achievement Award from Angel Flight, marking his 23 years of \nservice. Fittingly, it will be renamed the ``Mack Secord Award.'' Just \nthis month, Mack was honored with the National Aeronautical \nAssociation's Public Benefit Flying Award for decades of going above \nand beyond as a volunteer pilot, bringing lifesaving medical care to \nfamilies in need. This recognition couldn't come to a more deserving \norganization than Angel Flight, nor to a more deserving individual than \nMack Secord.\n  On behalf of those who need help, thanks to Angel Flight, and to Mack \nSecord, for letting your passion for service take flight and for making \nhope soar.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I wish to share a few thoughts about \nthe process we are going through and the impact it is having on \nspending by the U.S. Government. We are at a rate that everyone agrees \nis unsustainable.\n  Worse than that, I think it is irresponsible, and we do not need to \nbe doing the things we are doing now. I object. The ramp-up in \ndiscretionary spending for the appropriations in fiscal year 2010 is \nunprecedented. We know we have the biggest deficits we have ever had in \nthe history of the Republic. Now we are passing more appropriations \nbills that will take effect next year that will have unprecedented \nspending levels. For example, the agriculture bill; I have always tried \nto support Agriculture Appropriations in the Senate. I have not always \nbeen able to do so. It had an increase of 14.5 percent. At that rate, \nspending on agriculture will double in 5 years. The average increase in \nagricultural spending, compounded over the past 7 years, from 2003 \nthrough 2009, was just 2.1 percent. So we have 14 percent.\n  Now we have the Interior and EPA funding and their increases this \nyear in the bill before us today, which is 16.6 percent. What is \ninflation? Two percent or less. That is a 16-percent spending increase \nin 1 year. At that rate, spending for Interior and EPA would double \nevery 4 to 5 years. Within this bill, the increase for the EPA is 33 \npercent. I guess that would double in 2 to 3 years. Since EPA was added \nto the Interior financing in 2006, it is difficult to compare--at least \nprior to that. However, we have added EPA funding to the Interior \nfunding to get a comparison over previous years. The average annual \nincrease in Interior-EPA Appropriations, from 2001 to 2009, is 1 \npercent but this year 16.6 percent. And we have the largest deficit in \nthe history of the Republic this year.\n  When we pass a stimulus bill that is huge, in terms of additional \nspending, that is not being counted in what I am making reference to \ntoday.\n  We also passed the Transportation HUD bill, commonly called the THUD \nbill. Looking at its configuration for the past 3 years, we are able to \nconclude how that developed. From 1995 to 2009, we have seen a 5.2-\npercent average increase in discretionary spending--5.2 over the last 8 \nyears. This year, what do you think it is? It is 23 percent. At a 23-\npercent rate, spending for highways in America would double in 3 to 4 \nyears.\n  Why is this important? Let me back up one more time and mention the \nstimulus package. We passed, this year--the President insisted on it, \nand he was able to force it through--an $800 billion stimulus package. \nIt was supposed to be to fix our crumbling infrastructure, our highways \nand bridges. Did you know only 4 percent or less of that $800 billion \nwent to highways and bridges? That was a flimflam. The number I am \ntalking about in the basic highway budget we passed, I guess, a few \nweeks ago, that bill has a 23-percent increase, in addition to the \nmoney they got out of the stimulus package.\n  To show you how large that $800 billion is--the stimulus package--\nspending only 4 percent on highways increased the Federal highway \nfunding by about 40 percent. It may be more. You can say: Well, Jeff, \nthe economy isn't doing well, so we need to spend more money. I submit \nthat we are spending money to a degree that it is putting a cloud over \nthe future of our Nation, and people who are involved in finance and \ninvestment and business are worried not about what is going to happen \nin the next year but about what is going to happen in the next 5 to 10 \nyears. How can we sustain something that is unsustainable? The \nadministration said this cannot be sustained and Democratic Senators \nhave said it. Certainly, I say it.\n  In 2008, the entire national debt from the beginning of the founding \nof our Nation through 2008 was $5.8 trillion. According to our \nCongressional Budget Office, which I believe is a fair and impartial \ngroup, they calculated the President's budget and what it would mean to \nthe deficit. They concluded that in 5 years--and the President \nsubmitted a 10-year budget--that would double to $11.8 trillion. That \nwhich we took over 200 years to accumulate--$5.8 billion--would be \ndoubled in 5 years. By 2019, 10 years from now, it would triple to \n$17.3 trillion in debt.\n  The road we are on today will triple the national debt. I am not \nmaking up these numbers. These are the Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers. It is stunning. In fact, it is based on the assumption that \nunemployment would top out at about 8 percent. What are we moving to \nnow? About 10 percent. It also assumed a vigorous bounce-back in \neconomic growth next year, which it doesn't look like we are going to \nget. So the results of those numbers can be worse than it appears here \nbecause the economy isn't coming back as rapidly as we would like it \nto.\n  It is hard to figure this. Some might say: I am unable to understand \nthis, Sessions. How much money is this? A trillion dollars doesn't mean \nmuch to me.\n  Well, we spend less than $100 billion a year on education now. We \nspend about $40 billion on highways. Do you know how much we spend on \ninterest on the debt? People think you can just print the money, and \nthat is not what happens. We borrow. We sell Treasury bills and notes; \npeople buy them and we have to pay them interest. Right now, interest \nrates are pretty low. It is expected those interest rates are going to \nincrease from the financial sector on Wall Street, and the CBO, which \ncalculates these numbers--everybody assumes the interest rates will go \nup some. How much, we don't know. They took a moderate increase in \ninterest rates.\n\n[[Page S9712]]\n\n  In 2009, this year, the interest on our debt is expected to be $170 \nbillion. That is going to go up every year. Why? Because the deficit \nthis year is going to be about $1.8 trillion. We have never had such a \ndeficit in the history of the Republic. Last year, we had a $450 \nbillion deficit, the largest deficit in the history of the Republic. \nThis year, it will be $1.8 trillion. What does that mean? We have to \nborrow that money.\n  Over the 10-year budget window, as assumed by the CBO, the deficits \nwill never fall below $600 billion. In fact, it will average over $900 \nbillion--almost $1 trillion a year. That is how you get to $17 trillion \nafter 10 years. So we have to borrow that money in the world \nmarketplace. Countries such as China bought huge amounts of our \nTreasury. We pay them interest on that money. What does this mean over \nthe 10 years? I think this can help the American people understand how \nsizable this debt is.\n  As I noted, we spend $100 billion on education federally and $40 \nbillion on transportation. This year, 2009, we spent $170 billion on \ninterest. In 2009, under the red line here on the chart, it will be \n$799 billion--$800 billion--money that we used to be in a position to \ndo things with, such as build roads and do other things the Nation \nneeds. That is now going to have to be spent every year--$800 billion--\nto pay interest. That is why Alan Greenspan, Wall Street experts, Ben \nBernanke, and others have said this is unsustainable; we cannot \ncontinue this course.\n  What do we get from the Appropriations Committee and the Senate \nleadership? We get an Interior bill that increases funding 16.6 \npercent. That is not acceptable. That is simply too much spending. As I \nindicated, a lot of money is being pumped into Interior and \nenvironmental appropriations from this $800 billion stimulus. I am not \ncounting that. This is baseline spending. So next year, if somebody in \nthis Congress were to have an epiphany and become frugal, and we cut \nthe budget and don't increase it a bit, what will be the average \nincrease over 2 years? It would be 8 percent. That is totally \nunacceptable.\n  In the last 3 years, spending for interior and the environment, 2007 \nhad a 5.6-percent increase; in 2008, a 3.7-percent increase; last year, \nminus 2.9. So you are averaging far less than that. This is a \nthunderous increase in spending in this Appropriations bill. I cannot \nsupport it. There are a lot of good things in this legislation, and I \nwould like to support it. But I will not vote for a bill that increases \ndiscretionary spending by 16 percent.\n  Has anybody been in a townhall lately and talked to their \nconstituents? How concerned are they? They think we have lost our minds \nup here. Have we not? Is the message not getting through? Look at this \nhighway bill--a 23-percent increase in HUD and highway spending. It is \n23 percent, and that doesn't include the stimulus money, which amounts \nto a 40-percent increase on top of that. This is baseline spending. \nWhen you put it in the baseline and do not make it an emergency, \nstimulus spending, you have created momentum for continuing increases \nin the future. How many people think we are going to cut spending for \nnext year? How many people think we will have spending for HUD and \ntransportation that will be below or equal to the inflation rate?\n  Unless the American people get heard soon, we will have another \nbudget with a big increase. We have never seen 23 percent and those \nkinds of baseline expenditures before. I don't want to go on anymore at \nlength. I don't want to vote against these bills. I would like to vote \nfor the good things in them. But we have to simply recognize what we \nare doing is unacceptable. The American people are furious with us. \nThey are rightly furious with us. We need to get our act together. When \nwe had a shortage, one of the most significant votes I recall we took--\nit was so irresponsible--was when Senator Vitter, from Louisiana, \noffered an amendment that said the shortage in gas tax revenue that we \nfind with the highway bill, that should be made up by taking money from \nthe stimulus package. That had been unspent--$800 billion. If it only \ntakes $20 billion or something such as that, that is what the bill was \nsupposed to be for--crumbling infrastructure. He proposed that and it \nwas voted down. Why? Because they did not want to take a dime out of \nthe $800 billion stimulus bill, even if it was not spent, and they \nwanted to fill that gap with more debt. Since we are already in \ndeficit, to find another $20 billion or so to complete the highway bill \nover the next year or two, we just have to increase the debt. That is \nwhat we have been doing. It is an unsustainable course.\n\n  I urge my colleagues to begin to say no. Let's vote no on this \nlegislation. Let's start sending the American people a message that we \nhear their concerns, we know their concerns are legitimate and right, \nand it is time for us to be responsible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, I understand I cannot call up an \namendment right now because of the rules that are currently in place, \nbut I wish to speak about an amendment I will be offering at a later \ntime when the rules permit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Madam President, the amendment I will be offering \nspeaks to what I see as a very fundamentally flawed process in our \nappropriations in Congress. I am not in the majority in this body as it \nrelates to the subject of earmarks. I realize I am one of very few in \nmy party and a few more but not a whole lot on the other side of the \naisle who do not participate in the earmarking process.\n  I hope my amendment is calling attention to how this process is \nflawed and why we need to change the process. There are many problems \nwith the process, but two of them I am going to speak briefly about \ntoday.\n  One, the process is fundamentally unfair. It is rather mysterious how \nmuch money gets set aside for earmarks and who does it and where it \nhappens. It is even more mysterious as to how the decision is made as \nto how the earmarks are distributed among the Members.\n  I point out that in looking at the appropriations bills that we have \nhandled so far, it is very clear that the process is heavily weighted \ntoward the Members who serve as appropriators. I get that. That is part \nof the culture that has grown up around earmarking; that is, if you are \nan appropriator, you are entitled to get more. I am not sure that is a \ngood way to spend public money, but I think it is important to point \nout that is the process.\n  Fifty percent of all the earmarks in this bill are going to the \nmembers of the committee. Last week, it was even more egregious. I \ndon't think most Members realized when we voted on the T-HUD bill, the \nTransportation, Housing and Urban Development bill last week, that in \nthe Transportation part of the bill, there was $1.6 billion in \nearmarks. Over 50 percent of that money went to four Members, four \nStates. So out of 50 States, four States got more than half of all the \nmoney. Well, when I tell that to people in Missouri, they say: Huh? How \ndoes that happen? How can that happen? And I frankly don't have a very \ngood answer for them.\n\n  The other problem I wish to call to the attention of my colleagues \ntoday is not just the process as it relates to how earmarks are \ndistributed but where these earmarks come from. This money is not \ngrowing on a secret tree somewhere that we are harvesting. It is coming \nout of programs. It is coming out of budgets. One of the things I found \nmost troubling is that many of these earmarks are coming out of \ncompetitive grant programs or formula grant programs.\n  Formula is a formula because there is a way that is predictable about \nhow the money is distributed--based on the size of the State, based on \npopulation; depending on the program, based on geography. It is a \nformula everybody understands. Taking money out of a formula to fund \nearmarks takes it from a predictable process based on merit to a very \nunpredictable process based on who you are.\n  The same thing with competitive grant programs. Competitive grant \nprograms are ones where merit is supposed to rule the day based on \ncriteria\n\n[[Page S9713]]\n\nset forth. The amendment I will offer basically wipes out the earmarks \nin one of these competitive grant programs. The program I am referring \nto is a great program--it is called Save America's Treasures. It was \ncreated by executive order in 1998. It is a public-private partnership, \nand there are specific criteria as to what a project has to have in \norder to qualify for this money--$20 million.\n  This is a small example. I admit this is not going to change \nanything, as we keep talking about bending the cost curve, but it is a \ngreat example of what I am talking about. It began as a competitive \nprogram and it has begun to morph into something more than a \ncompetitive program because now half of the money this year will be \nearmarked, leaving only $10 million for a competitive program.\n  So if your State doesn't get an earmark, either in the House or the \nSenate, in the bill, then the chances of your State getting any money \nout of this program have been cut in half. It is only $10 million for \nthe entire country for these grants which are to restore America's \nhistoric treasures across the country. That is a problem.\n  Is this an isolated problem? No. No. In fairness to this \nsubcommittee, this is a little problem compared to some of the other \ncompetitive grant programs that have been raided for earmarking. The \nhijacking of public money for earmarking from the competitive grant bus \nis going on everywhere, and let me give another couple of examples.\n  Last week, when we did the Transportation, Housing and Urban \nDevelopment Appropriations bill, there were two good examples. They are \nprograms that began to provide competition to valued programs across \nthe country. The first one is the Neighborhood Initiatives at HUD, the \nHousing and Urban Development Department. In 1998, Congress created \nthis program. The interesting thing is it was created to help people \nwho were doing welfare-to-work projects. Great intentions; great \nprogram.\n  Ironically, HUD began granting these awards to people based on the \ncompetitive criterion that Congress had given them. Congress passes the \nprogram, funds the program, and tells HUD these are the competitive \nbases on which you should make these grants. There were no earmarks in \nthe program at all in 1999--none--after Congress created the program. \nBeginning in 2001, however, every dime in this program under the \nNeighborhood Initiatives Program has gone to earmarks. Once again, a \ncompetitive merit process morphs over into a completely earmarked \nprocess.\n  How about another example of a program--the Economic Development \nInitiative, also in HUD. Congress introduced the program in 1994; once \nagain, a congressional program. Funds were to be awarded competitively, \nand for the first couple of years they were. EDI funds were awarded \ncompetitively. Congress started earmarking the account beginning in \n1998. By 2001, the entire account was earmarked. So Congress began it \nas a good idea, and said do it competitively. By 2001, competition was \ngone.\n  Ironically, the statute that sets out the criteria for competitive \nEDI is still on the books. It is still in the law, but we no longer \nfollow it because there has been a decision to morph that competitive \nprogram into an earmark program. I think that competition is a good \nthing, and this isn't about a bureaucrat somewhere sprinkling fairy \ndust and supplementing their judgment for the judgment of Congress.\n  In fact, the examples I have given are programs that were designed to \nbe competitive, and in two or three instances they were designed to be \ncompetitive by Congress itself and then somehow they have morphed over \ninto a pecking order of priorities based on someone's seniority or the \ncommittee they serve on, or even if they are in some political trouble. \nIt seems to me a goofy way to spend money, especially the public's \nmoney.\n  I ask my colleagues to consider this amendment. All it does is \nrestore the program to a competitive basis and allow every State to \ncompete on the same basis for the money in that competitive program. \nWhen the time is right, I will call up the amendment, once the rules \nallow me to do so.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I have consulted with the manager and \nthe ranking member, and I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness for 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, there is now underway--beginning \nyesterday in the Finance Committee--a discussion about health care \nreform. It is complicated, controversial, difficult, but important. I \nknow they are working hard to try to figure out what they might do to \nsee if they can put some downward pressure on health care costs and \nalso to extend coverage to those who don't have health coverage.\n  There has been a lot of generous discussion on the floor of the \nSenate. We have had a so-called Gang of 6, now there is a gang--a \nlarger number--of the Finance Committee members, and soon there will be \na gang of 100 Senators who are trying to consider what to do about \nhealth care issues. We have had people come to the floor of the Senate \nto say there is a proposal for a government takeover of health care. I \ndon't support that. I don't believe anybody has proposed that but, \nnonetheless, we have had people come to the floor of the Senate saying \nthat is what is being proposed. I don't support a health care reform \nplan that lifts the ban on using Federal funding for abortion services. \nI don't support government rationing of health care. I don't believe \nthat has been proposed, although it has been alleged it has been \nproposed. I don't support providing health care benefits to those who \nhave come to this country illegally. And I don't support doing anything \nthat undermines Medicare for the elderly or in any way diminishes or \nundermines VA health care.\n  All of these have been discussed by people who have trotted over to \nthe floor of the Senate to make allegations about thing one or another. \nAt some point we will consider and vote on the floor of the Senate on \nlegislation that I think meets the interests of this country, meets the \ntest of being in the public interest, and does not represent a \ngovernment takeover of health care. But having said that, let me make a \npoint that one of the things that has not been adequately discussed, \nbut will be, is the issue of price increases for health care--cost \nincreases--and especially that portion that relates to prescription \ndrugs.\n  Let me be quick to say with respect to prescription drugs that the \npharmaceutical industry plays a very important role in this country. \nThe development of prescription drugs some with private investment \nfunding in research and development by the pharmaceutical industry, \nsome is a result of what we spend in public funding through the \nNational Institutes of Health and then make what we have learned \navailable to these companies--all of these in my judgment benefit this \ncountry and reflect the public interest.\n  The relentless march of increased costs of health care in virtually \nall areas includes the increased cost of prescription drugs, and the \nquestion is: What do we do about that? There is very little discussion \nabout it, but I want to talk about it for a couple of minutes today.\n  I have introduced--for some number of sessions of the Congress now, \nalong with my colleague on the other side of the aisle, Senator Snowe--\na piece of legislation that has had broad bipartisan support. It \nincludes the late Senator Ted Kennedy as a cosponsor during this \nsession of the Congress. It includes Senator Barack Obama as a \ncosponsor in the last Congress. It includes Senator John McCain, \nSenator John Thune, and Senator Grassley. It is bipartisan and has had \nvery broad support. Yet we have not been able to get it through the \nCongress because it is controversial. Let me describe what it is. It is \nlegislation that tries to put some downward pressure on the escalating \nprices of prescription drugs.\n\n[[Page S9714]]\n\n  I understand it is legislation that causes great concern to the \npharmaceutical industry. I understand that because they price \nprescription drugs in this country the way they want to price them, and \nthe way they want to price them is for brand-name prescription drugs we \npay the highest prices in the world by far, not even close.\n  I have a pretty good description of that in my desk. These are empty \nbottles. Let me ask unanimous consent I be able to show them on the \nfloor of the Senate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DORGAN. These are bottles in which Lipitor is deposited. It is \nmade in Ireland. The company which makes Lipitor, which is the highest \nselling prescription drug for the control of cholesterol of any drug in \nthe world, I think--it is very popular.\n  As we can see this drug is made in a factory in Ireland and then sent \naround the world. This is actually the same bottle--one is blue and one \nis red. But this was sent to Canada and this was sent to the United \nStates. The only difference is that in the United States, if we buy a \ntablet of Lipitor in this order, we pay $4.48, and the Canadian \nconsumer pays $1.83.\n  It is not just the U.S. versus Canada. It is the U.S. price versus \nprices almost anywhere. Again, the same drug put in the same bottle in \na plant sends medicine around the world to Germany, Italy, Spain, \nFrance, England and, yes, Canada and the United States, and what is the \ndifference? There is no difference. It is the same pill put in the same \nbottle. The difference is price. We get to pay double what most other \npeople in the world pay for Lipitor. Fair? Not as far as I am \nconcerned. It does not make much sense to me.\n  How do we make that stick? We make that stick by saying to the \nAmerican people: You can't purchase that same FDA-approved drug when it \nis sold in other parts of the world. You can't purchase that for half \nthe price because we will not allow you to bring it back into this \ncountry because we are worried, the pharmaceutical industry says, that \ncounterfeit drugs would come into the country.\n  Let me talk just a bit about that. When I say this, I don't want \nanybody to believe our drug supply is unsafe, but I do want to say \nthis: 40 percent of the active ingredients in U.S. prescription drugs \ncurrently come from India and China. I am going to talk about that just \nfor a minute. I am saying this because the pharmaceutical industry \ncontinues--including yesterday as a result of stories about this--\ncontinues to say if we pass the legislation that a broad bipartisan \ngroup of us want to pass, that gives the American people freedom--yes, \nfreedom; the freedom to purchase the identical FDA-approved drug from \nwherever they choose to purchase it--they say if we do that we \nundermine the safety of prescription drugs, there are counterfeits, and \nso on--safety.\n  Forty percent of the active ingredients in prescription drugs come \nfrom India and China. Last year the Wall Street Journal did a very \nlarge story and did some first rate journalism, I might say.\n\n       More than half the world's heparin, the main ingredient in \n     a widely used anti-clotting medicine, gets its start in \n     China's poorly regulated supply chain.\n\n  So ingredients go into medicine that comes into this country, heparin \nin this case. Let me describe the photographs in the Wall Street \nJournal. They went to find out where the heparin came from.\n  Here is an example of a man using a tree branch to stir a caldron of \nmaterial coming from pig intestines that becomes heparin, from which \nthe ingredient for heparin is extracted. You can see the kind of \nfacility this is; uninspected, by the way. Never inspected. Pig \nintestines coming out of this machine. These are Wall Street Journal \nphotographs, not mine, that describe heparin, the active ingredient, \nheparin, originating in this sort of unregulated area in rural China.\n  The industry is saying to me if we pass legislation that requires \nbatch lots and pedigrees and controls, manufacturing controls on \nanything that comes in, and chain of custody, somehow we would injure \nthe safety of the drug supply? Come on, that is not the case at all.\n  In fact, what we will do with the legislation that we have created is \ndramatically improve the safety of all of our drug supply because of \nwhat we provide for the FDA and what we require to be done to assure \nthe safety of the chain of custody for the drug supply.\n  Dr. David Kessler, former head of the FDA, says this about our \nproposal. The Dorgan-Snowe bill ``provides a sound framework for \nassuring that imported drugs are safe and effective. Most notably, it \nprovides additional resources to the agency to run such a program, \noversight by the FDA of the chain of custody of imported drugs back to \nthe FDA-inspected plants, a mechanism to review imported drugs to \nensure that they meet FDA's approval standards, and the registration \nand oversight of importers and exporters to assure that imported drugs \nmeet these standards and are not counterfeit.''\n  The question is this: It is not whether the pharmaceutical industry \nis a good industry--it is. It is not whether it does good things for \nour country--it does. I have supported the pharmaceutical industry in \nmany ways. I support the research and development tax credit from which \nthey benefit. I have always supported that. I am very interested in \ndriving more research, so I support that. I have written that I would \neven support an increase in the patent period in cases where it takes \nthem longer than it should take to get their product to market. They do \nhave a point about that. I am not interested in injuring anybody, \nespecially this industry.\n  I do think, however, if we are going to talk about how to deal with \nthe relentless march of increased health care costs, we cannot ignore \nthe increased costs of prescription drugs.\n  The pharmaceutical industry and the White House had announced a deal \nby which the pharmaceutical industry would contribute $80 billion over \n10 years to help pay for what they had described. Basically, it is \nproviding a benefit to help partially fill the so-called doughnut \nhole--I know this is Washington jargon--for senior citizens in \nMedicare; to partially fill that it provides rebates for purchases of \nbrand-named drugs.\n  I think that is fine. But that is not a proxy for trying to restrain \nthe relentless increase in the cost of prescription drugs in this \ncountry.\n  In 2008, the average price increase for the most widely used brand-\nname prescription drugs was 8.7 percent, more than twice the rate of \ngeneral inflation. The fact is, if we go back we see what has happened \nto the cost of these prescription drugs in our country. It is up, up, \nand way up, and too many people are having to determine whether they \npurchase their medicine or buy their groceries, or purchase their \nmedicine or pay their rent. I think there are ways for us to address \nit.\n  My colleagues and I are offering legislation when a health care bill \ncomes to the floor of the Senate. We are going to offer legislation \nthat will be the Dorgan-Snowe bill with, I think, somewhere around 30 \ncosponsors or so, that is very simple. It simply provides the freedom \nfor the American consumer to purchase the FDA-approved drug where they \nchoose to purchase the drug, and we outline the countries in which \nthere is a nearly identical chain of custody to the chain of custody we \nhave in our country for prescription drugs, then provide the resources \nfor the FDA to monitor and to deal with that.\n  Second and most important, we provide requirements for pedigrees and \nbatch numbers and lot numbers to be able to trace back prescription \ndrugs.\n  One of the things we discovered with the heparin issue is we couldn't \ntrace it back to find out where it came from. That does not make any \nsense to me. We do need legislation, in my judgment.\n  I received a letter from a woman in North Dakota a while back. She is \nsuffering from fibromyalgia. She had the disease 20 years and tried \nmany different treatments. The disease impairs her cognitive skills and \ncauses her fatigue every day, and she is trying a new drug that she \nsays helps with the fatigue and her concentration. She said:\n\n       I have taken my first pill now and noticed improvement \n     immediately, but the drug costs $348 a month, $11.60 a pill, \n     so I am going to have to try to find a way to work despite \n     the fact I really can't work in order to pay this drug bill.\n\n  She says:\n\n       Byron, I am beat up but I ain't used up. This pill could be \n     the difference between\n\n[[Page S9715]]\n\n     working and filing for Social Security disability. Is there \n     some way that people can afford this drug which doesn't yet \n     have a generic version? Is there some way to put some \n     downward pressure on prices?\n\n  The answer is yes, there is; legislation we introduced in the Senate. \nThe Congressional Budget Office says this saves $50 billion, I believe \nit is, in 10 years, a $50 billion saving, and $10.6 billion of that is \nsavings to the National Government. The National Federation of \nIndependent Business--and I will ask unanimous consent to have this \nprinted in the Record--the NFIB has just written, September 21, 2009, \nsaying:\n\n       On behalf of the NFIB I would like to express our support \n     for S. 1232, the Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety \n     Act of 2009. . . .\n\n  It is signed by Susan Eckerly, the senior vice president of public \npolicy.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that a copy of the NFIB \nletter dated September 21, 2009, be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               National Federation\n\n\n                                      of Independent Business,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 21, 2009.\n     Hon. Byron Dorgan,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Olympia Snowe,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: On behalf of the National Federation of \n     Independent Business (NFIB), I would like to express our \n     support for S. 1232, the ``Pharmaceutical Market Access and \n     Drug Safety Act of 2009.'' This bill would allow for the \n     importation of prescription drugs while ensuring that \n     appropriate safeguards are in place to protect the integrity \n     of imported medications. Importation offers a means of \n     reducing one of the most rapidly rising healthcare costs \n     facing consumers today: spending on prescription drugs.\n       This much-needed bipartisan legislation comes at a critical \n     time for men and women in the small business community \n     struggling with the ever-increasing cost of healthcare. Small \n     firms pay an average of 18 percent more than their larger \n     counterparts for the same healthcare benefits and are \n     continually seeking out ways to lower their healthcare costs. \n     With U.S. prescription drug spending expected to increase \n     over the next decade, it is clear that the small business \n     community must pursue viable opportunities to improve \n     affordability and access to healthcare goods and services. \n     The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that this \n     legislation could result in a direct savings of $50 billion. \n     Those savings could provide some much-needed and long overdue \n     relief to small business.\n       The ``Pharmaceutical Market Access and Drug Safety Act of \n     2009'' secures a framework for the safe and legal importation \n     of prescription drugs. NFIB is pleased that your legislation \n     includes specific requirements to ensure that every imported \n     drug must meet U.S. safety standards. The benefits for small \n     business are also achieved by allowing licensed pharmacies \n     and drug wholesalers to import Food and Drug Administration-\n     approved medicines for commercial purposes.\n       Providing access for the importation of prescription drugs \n     enjoys broad support. Seventy-eight percent of NFIB members \n     favor allowing individuals to purchase drugs from other \n     countries--support that is affirmed by other public opinion \n     research including a Wall St. Journal poll indicating that \n     eighty percent of Americans support importation.\n       Thank you for your continued efforts to increase access to \n     affordable healthcare for the small business community. We \n     look forward to working with you on this important piece of \n     legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                Susan Eckerly,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n                                                    Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Many other organizations have supported this legislation. \nThe reason I wanted to visit about it today briefly is to say that \nwhatever is considered in the Finance Committee and then developed as \nbetween the Finance and the HELP Committees and brought to the Senate \nfloor for debate when health care is debated on the Senate floor, I \nwill intend to be here with my colleagues. I know Senator McCain, \nSenator Stabenow, Senator Snowe--many others will want to be here to \noffer this amendment at the front end of a discussion and debate on \nhealth care on the floor of the Senate.\n  This has been a long, tortured trail--too long, in my judgment--to \nget this done. I understand, as will have been the case in the past and \nlikely will be the case this year, we will have people stand up on the \nSenate floor and oppose us, saying it is going to undermine or somehow \ncompromise the safety of the drug supply. It is simply not true. All of \nthe experts who have looked at this have said we have created something \nthat will actually improve the safety of the drug supply coming into \nthis country.\n  Let me describe it in the easiest and best way I know, and that is \nwith a very popular prescription drug. Somebody once said so many \npeople take this they ought to put it in the water supply. I guess I \ndon't support that, but Lipitor is the most popular drug, medicine for \nlowering cholesterol, by far. There are others as well. I should not \nfail to name them, but I believe this is the biggest selling \ncholesterol-lowering drug. The American people get to pay twice as much \nfor the same pill put in the same bottle as virtually everybody else in \nthe world. I think that is not fair. I think it is not fair that the \nAmerican people pay the highest prices in the world. It wouldn't happen \nif the American people had a little bit of freedom, and that is the \nfreedom to purchase this prescription drug from a FDA-approved plant \nwith pedigreed lot numbers in a supply stream or chain of supply that \nis judged safe by our FDA.\n  We will have this amendment, have debate, have a vote. My fervent \nhope is that this is the time. There is a time and place for \neverything. My hope is that at long last this is the time Congress will \npass this kind of legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                         Federal Student Loans\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, the pending business is the Interior \nappropriations bill. I know several Senators have amendments. If they \nwould like to come and speak on those amendments, this is a good time \nto do that. Then, working with the Senator from California, who is \nchairman of the committee, we will try to move those amendments to a \nvote as quickly as possible. If Senators do come to speak on \namendments, I will stop talking and give them the floor. But for the \ntime being, I would like to say a few words about Federal student \nloans.\n  President Obama said the other day, in what I thought was a very \nperceptive comment, that he understood the health care debate and all \nits intensity is a proxy for a larger debate, and that is about the \nrole of government in our society. What I and many Republicans believe \nand, I think, many Independents and Democrats, as well, in the State of \nTennessee, and I suspect across the country--is that we have suddenly \nseen too many taxes, too much spending, too much debt, and too many \nWashington takeovers. The President says, and he is correct to an \nextent with this, that some of these Washington takeovers were not his \nfault, were not his doing. I suppose he would say that about some of \nthe bank takeovers and the insurance company takeovers. I am not so \nsure about the takeover of the automobile companies or the takeover of \nthe farm bonds or the proposal to take over health care. But here is a \nvoluntary takeover that is absolutely unnecessary, is unwise, and the \nAmerican people should pay attention to this.\n  This goes to the center of what the President said. If health care is \na proxy for a debate about the extent to which the American Government \nought to be involved in our society, then the proposal by the President \nto take over the entire student loan program and move it from the \nprivate sector into the government is a perfect example of what we \nought not to be doing.\n  Let me speak first to the dimensions of this program. The United \nStates has the best system of higher education in the world. One of the \ngreatest aspects of it, one of the greatest contributors to its \nquality, is that we have a generous amount of Federal dollars which \npermit about half or more of our students to either get a Federal \ngrant, which we usually call Pell grants, or a Federal student loan \nwhich follows them to the institution of their choice. So unlike our \nelementary and secondary schools, your Pell grant--your grant going all \nof the way back to the GI bill in 1944--can follow you wherever you go. \nThat choice and that competition and that money have helped to create \nnot just some of the best colleges and universities in the world but \nvirtually all of them. Most observers agree on that.\n  The higher education system today is 6,000 institutions. These are \nthe universities of North Carolina and Tennessee. That is what we might \nthink of first, but there are also community colleges,\n\n[[Page S9716]]\n\nthe 2-year schools. There are also nonprofit colleges. There are also \nthe religious institutions--Notre Dame and Brigham Young and many \nothers. So there are 6,000 institutions.\n  Last year, 4,400 of those 6,000 institutions used the regular student \nloan program. That is the one where you go to the bank, usually your \ncommunity bank or local bank, and you get a student loan. And 1,600 \nschools, or about one-fourth, used the direct loan program, which was \nput in at the time I was Secretary of Education about 20 years ago, and \nyou just go to the U.S. Department of Education and get your money. On \nthe private side of it, which is what 3 out of 4 students choose, there \nare 2,000 lenders that participate in the program. This year, there are \nnearly 18 million loans to students and parents--18 million--and 14 \nmillion of them are in the regular student loan program, 4.5 million \nthrough the government. There was $86 billion of loans made. So the \nregular student loan volume through the private lenders was about $64 \nbillion; the direct loan volume was $22 billion.\n  So all in all outstanding, $617 billion of volume for both programs, \nand the President has said we are going to take all of that and put it \nin the U.S. Department of Education. So what his proposal is, if you \nare one of the 14 million students today who are getting their student \nloans from their local banks, starting in January you are out of luck. \nYou better line up outside the U.S. Department of Education with the \nother 19 million people who want a student loan and hope they can \nprovide you with the same sort of service your community bank or \nlending institution or nonprofit organization in your area provides you \ntoday.\n  There is a lack of evidence to show that the U.S. Department of \nEducation can do a better job of making loans than banks can. I used to \nwork at the U.S. Department of Education. I was the Secretary. It is \none of the smaller departments in government. The people there know a \nlot about education, but none of them really is running for banker of \nthe year.\n  Arne Duncan is President Obama's Education Secretary. He is one of \nhis best appointments. I would much prefer seeing him in Memphis \nworking on charter schools or in Denver trying to find ways to pay \noutstanding teachers more or trying to help create a better system of \ncolleges and universities or community colleges instead of trying to \nmanage the problem of, how do I grant $100 billion in new loans to 19 \nmillion people every single year? How do I replace 2,000 private \nlenders?\n  Let me give you an example of what a private lender might do. In \nTennessee, we have EdSouth. This is a nonprofit provider. Here is what \nthey do. They had five regional outreach counselors to canvass \nTennessee to provide college and career planning, financial aid \ntraining, college admissions assistance, and financial aid literacy. \nThey made 443 presentations at Tennessee schools through college fairs, \nguidance visits, and presentations. They worked with 12,000 Tennessee \nstudents to improve their understanding of the college admissions and \nfinancial aid process. They provided training to over 1,000 school \ncounselors so those counselors could work better with their students. \nThey distributed almost 1.5 million financial aid brochures to \nTennessee students and families. Will the U.S. Department of Education \nstart providing those services, or will the 19 million students who \nwant student loans simply line up outside the U.S. Department of \nEducation or one of its offices somewhere and apply for a loan? I think \nI know the answer to that question.\n  According to the Department of Education, it costs them about $700 \nmillion a year to administer the loans they make today. That is for \none-quarter of all the students. They estimate they can make those same \nloans to 19 million students at about the same amount of money. I doubt \nif that is true, which brings me to the point of the savings--the \nalleged savings of this program.\n  Senator Gregg and I--the Senator from New Hampshire, who is the \nformer chairman of the Budget Committee, ranking member now--talked \nabout the alleged savings in moving all of these loans from the lending \ninstitutions that make them to 19 million students today, to the U.S. \nDepartment of Education.\n  Senator Gregg received a letter from the Congressional Budget Office \non July 27. I ask unanimous consent to have that letter printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    U.S. Congress,\n\n\n                                  Congressional Budget Office,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 27, 2009.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washignton, DC.\n       Dear Senator: This letter responds to your request for an \n     estimate of the change in federal costs, adjusted for the \n     cost of market risk, that might result from enactment of the \n     President's proposal to prohibit new federal guarantees of \n     student loans and to replace those guarantees with direct \n     loans made by the Department of Education The Federal Family \n     Education Loan Program (FFELP) provides federal guarantees \n     for loans made to students by private lenders and is the \n     predominant source of loans for higher education; the \n     Congressional Budget Office (CBO) projects that, under \n     current law, guaranteed loans will account for 70 percent of \n     all new direct and guaranteed student loans made over the \n     next 10 years. Under the President's proposal, the Department \n     of Education, through the William D. Ford Direct Loan \n     Program, would provide federal support for student loans only \n     by lending money directly to students.\n       In its July 24, 2009, cost estimate for H.R. 3221 (the \n     Student Aid and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2009, as \n     approved by the House Committee on Education and Labor), \n     which would incorporate the President's proposal, CBO \n     estimated that replacing new guarantees of student loans with \n     direct lending would yield gross savings in federal direct \n     (or mandatory) spending of about $87 billion over the 2010-\n     2019 period. (Mandatory spending is governed by existing \n     provisions of law and does not require future \n     appropriations.) About $7 billion of those savings would \n     represent a reduction in the administrative costs of the \n     guaranteed loan program, which are recorded in the budget as \n     mandatory spending. In contrast, most of the administrative \n     costs for the direct loan program are funded in appropriation \n     bills and recorded as discretionary spending. Thus, of the \n     $87 billion reduction in direct spending, roughly $7 billion \n     would be offset by an increase in future appropriations for \n     administrative costs, for an estimated net reduction in \n     federal costs from the President's proposal of about $80 \n     billion over the 2010-2019 period.\n       Those estimates follow the standard loan-valuation \n     procedure called for in the Federal Credit Reform Act of 1990 \n     (FCRA) The law specifies that the cost of federal loans and \n     loan guarantees be estimated as the net present value of the \n     federal government's cash flows, using the Treasury's \n     borrowing rates to discount those flows; that calculation \n     does not include administrative costs, which are recorded in \n     the budget year by year on a cash basis (that is, \n     undiscounted). The FCRA methodology, however, does not \n     include the cost to the government stemming from the risk \n     that the cash flows may be less than the amount projected \n     (that is, that defaults could be higher than projected). CBO \n     found that after accounting for the cost of such risk, as \n     discussed below, the proposal to replace new guaranteed loans \n     with direct loans would lead to estimated savings of about \n     $47 billion over the 2010-2019 period--about $33 billion less \n     than CBO's estimate under the standard credit reform \n     treatment.\n\n\n        estimating subsidy costs using credit reform procedures\n\n       To determine whether a proposal to change the federal \n     student loan programs would lead to budgetary savings \n     requires comparing the federal government's costs for the \n     subsidies that the two programs provide. Those subsidy costs \n     depend on the various cash flows of the direct loan and \n     guaranteed loan programs, the interest rates used to discount \n     those cash flows, and the programs' administrative costs.\n       FCRA calls for using a present-value subsidy concept--in \n     what is otherwise a largely cash budget--to better compare \n     the strikingly different patterns of federal cash flows under \n     the two programs. In the direct student loan program, the \n     federal government makes a large, one-time outlay for the \n     amount of the loan (net of various fees) and then receives a \n     stream of principal and interest payments over time. In the \n     guaranteed student loan program, the federal government faces \n     a more complicated set of payments. It does not disburse a \n     principal amount (loans are disbursed by private lenders) but \n     instead receives some up-front fees, makes a stream of \n     subsidy payments (known as special-allowance payments) to \n     lenders, partially compensates lenders for loans that go into \n     default, and pays certain borrower benefits, in addition to \n     various other receipts and payments.\n       FCRA facilitates the comparison of the budgetary effects of \n     direct loans and loan guarantees by converting the net \n     outlays for each program into a single lump-sum estimate of \n     net costs (that is, the discounted present value of all cash \n     flows). Those cash flows are discounted using the \n     government's costs of borrowing--that is, the interest rates \n     it pays on Treasury securities of comparable maturities. The \n     resulting subsidy estimate is recorded in the federal budget \n     in\n\n[[Page S9717]]\n\n     the year of a loan's disbursement. Subsidies computed under \n     FCRA do not include the government's costs for administering \n     the loans; those administrative costs are recorded \n     separately, on a cash basis.\n       Under the FCRA accounting rules, the guaranteed loan and \n     direct loan programs have very different subsidy rates, and \n     thus different budgetary costs, even though the programs \n     result in very similar loans to borrowers. CBO estimates that \n     over the 2010-2019 period, the subsidy cost for each dollar \n     of a guaranteed loan will exceed the subsidy cost for each \n     dollar of a direct loan by between 10 cents and 20 cents. \n     Generally, in CBO's estimation, the direct loan program will \n     have a negative subsidy rate (that is, the net receipts to \n     the government on a present-value basis are projected to be \n     greater than its disbursements), whereas the guaranteed loan \n     program will have a positive subsidy rate (that is, a net \n     cost on a present-value basis). The difference in subsidy \n     rates under FCRA for direct and guaranteed loans occurs \n     primarily because of certain payments made for the latter--in \n     particular, interest payments made on behalf of borrowers for \n     subsidized loans and special-allowance payments to lenders. \n     The latter are made by the government to lenders in the \n     guaranteed loan program to ensure that they receive a \n     specified interest rate on their student lending. The \n     difference in the programs' subsidy rates led to CBO's \n     estimate that under the procedures specified in FCRA, \n     enactment of the President's proposal (as included in H.R. \n     3221) would yield net budgetary savings of approximately $80 \n     billion (representing $87 billion in mandatory savings and $7 \n     billion in discretionary costs) over the 2010-2019 period.\n\n\n                           adjusting for risk\n\n       The full value of the subsidy provided by the government's \n     student loan programs depends on what students would have to \n     pay to obtain loans in the private market without federal \n     support. That cost depends on the riskiness of the loans. \n     Estimates of subsidies that are made using the techniques \n     specified by FCRA do not provide a comprehensive picture of \n     the costs of loan programs, mainly because they do not fully \n     account for the riskiness of the loans. That methodology, \n     which uses yields on Treasury securities as discount rates, \n     tends to understate the subsidy provided under each program; \n     but it generally understates the subsidy costs of the direct \n     loan program to a greater degree than it does those of the \n     guaranteed loan program. Alternative estimates of the value \n     of the programs' subsidies that might better reflect the \n     costs they represent for the government would incorporate the \n     estimated cost of the market risk that taxpayers bear through \n     such lending--a cost analogous to the higher returns that \n     private investors expect for making risky investments.\n       When conditions in the financial markets are relatively \n     benign, as CBO assumes will be the case after the first few \n     years of the 2010-2019 projection period, the private \n     sector's pricing of student loans that do not carry a federal \n     guarantee suggests that the cost of raising capital for such \n     loans will be 2 to 3 percentage points more per year than the \n     interest that the government pays on Treasury securities with \n     comparable maturities. That difference reflects the risk \n     involved in extending long-term, unsecured credit to an \n     individual consumer; participants in private-sector loan \n     markets generally demand a higher rate of return for bearing \n     that risk. (Put differently, the cost of capital for the \n     firms that make such loans will be higher than the rates on \n     Treasury securities.) A private entity that issued or insured \n     student loans would recognize that higher cost of capital by \n     discounting its expected cash flows from the loans at that \n     higher rate. (A private entity would also approach \n     administrative costs somewhat differently, but administrative \n     costs account for little of the difference between the costs \n     of the direct and guaranteed loan programs.)\n       Applying a set of risk-adjusted discount rates to the cash \n     flows from the government's student loans would raise the \n     subsidy rates for both student loan programs, but the rate \n     for the direct loan program would increase by more than the \n     rate for the guaranteed loan program because of differences \n     in the timing and riskiness of the estimated cash flows. CBO \n     estimates that if projected savings for the President's \n     proposal were calculated using risk-adjusted discount rates, \n     those savings would be $47 billion over the 2010-2019 \n     period--a difference of $33 billion relative to CBO's cost \n     estimate for H.R. 3221 issued on July 24.\n       Although the use of subsidy rates that have been adjusted \n     for the cost of risk generally improves the ability to \n     compare the costs of financial programs, the approach does \n     raise some concerns. As the recent financial turmoil has \n     shown, risky assets, including student loans, can fluctuate \n     wildly in value. Those fluctuations can lead to large changes \n     in market-based estimates of subsidy rates for student loans \n     from one year to the next. Quite similar assets may trade at \n     widely divergent values for reasons that are difficult to \n     establish. Nevertheless, CBO believes that risk-adjusted \n     subsidy rates provide useful information about the cost of \n     federal programs in terms of the value of the economic \n     resources that are devoted to those programs. The Congress \n     adopted the approach of incorporating the cost of market risk \n     into budget estimates for the 2009 enactment of the Troubled \n     Asset Relief Program (TARP). That approach requires that the \n     costs of assets purchased under the program be estimated \n     using a present-value approach that, except for its \n     requirement of an adjustment for the cost of market risk, is \n     similar to the way loans and loan guarantees are evaluated \n     under the Federal Credit Reform Act.\n       I hope this information is helpful. If you have further \n     questions, we would be happy to address them. The CBO staff \n     contact for this analysis is Sam Papenfuss.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Douglas W. Elmendorf,\n                                                         Director.\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Senator Gregg basically asked: Is it true that if we \nstop making loans through private and nonprofit lenders whereby the \nFederal Government guarantees the loans and pays a regulated subsidy to \nthe lender--if we stop that and start making all of them through the \ngovernment directly, will we save $87 billion? And the short answer--if \nyou want the long answer, the letter is available--the short answer is \nno, you do not save $87 billion; you are likely to realize $47 billion \nin savings over the next 10 years.\n  Then, in addition to that, we have to deduct for the--I see the \nSenator from Oklahoma. Is he ready to speak on his amendments?\n  Mr. COBURN. In a moment after we are set up.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I will be through in about 4 or 5 minutes. I welcome \nhim and look forward to his comments.\n  Instead of saving $87 billion, we save $47 billion. Then we have to \ndeduct the administrative costs. Remember, instead of making some of \nthe loans, the Department of Education is going to make 19 million \nloans. The Department estimates it might cost it $7 billion over the 10 \nyears to do that. Others think it might cost $30 billion. So the real \nsavings--the real savings are either $47 billion or more like $20 \nbillion or $23 billion in savings over 10 years.\n  In order to do that, of course, we are going to have to raise the \nFederal debt. We are going to have to borrow $1 billion a year for the \nnext 5 years. So at a time when we are concerned that we are adding $9 \ntrillion to the debt over the next 10 years, we are going to add \nanother half trillion over 5 years so we can make student loans instead \nof doing it through private institutions.\n  Here is the real clincher. When you press and say: In order to make \nthese loans, what is the real reason you think you can do this if the \nsavings aren't really $87 billion but they are more like $47 billion or \nmore like $23 billion over 10 years?\n  They say: Well, the real reason is the government can borrow money \ncheaper than the private banks can.\n  That is true. The government can borrow money at a quarter of a \npercentage point, and then it loans it to the students at 6.8 \npercentage points.\n  Well, my first point would be that I don't think the government ought \nto be making a profit by overcharging students for their student loans \nand then turn around and take credit for starting new programs. What \nthe government is actually going to be doing is charging a student who \nhas a job and is trying to get a student loan--is going to say: OK, we \nare going to borrow the money at one-quarter of 1 percent and loan it \nto you at 6.8, and then we are going to take that money and pay for \nyour Pell grant or pay for someone else's Pell grant.\n  In other words, they are going to overcharge the student to make the \nCongressman look good. That is what we are doing. We are going out and \nannouncing all of these programs. So we are spending $87 billion, when \nit is really between $23 and $47 billion--that is the amount we really \nhave--and we make that money by overcharging the students.\n  At the very least, if we are going to take all of these loans into \nthe government, we ought to reduce the interest rate so we don't \novercharge the students.\n  I see the Senator from Oklahoma. I am going to defer to him and \nwelcome him to the floor. But I hope, as we think about the issue the \nPresident so accurately described--he said: The health care debate is \nreally a proxy for the role of government in our society. He is exactly \nright about that. And while some of the Washington takeovers may not \nhave been avoidable at the beginning of the year, there is no reason in \nthe world why Washington should take over 19 million student loans, \neliminate 2,000 lenders, stop students on 6,000 campuses from having a \nchoice in competition, and say: The\n\n[[Page S9718]]\n\ngovernment is the best banker in America; line up outside the \nDepartment of Education, all 19 million of you, in January and get your \nstudent loan.\n  So I am thinking of introducing an amendment that is called a truth-\nin-lending amendment if this legislation were to pass, and it would say \nto every one of the 19 million students: Truth in lending--beware. Your \ngovernment is overcharging you so your Congressman and your Senator can \ntake credit for starting a new program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wanted to spend a few minutes--I guess I \nwould inquire of the chairman and ranking member, we are not allowing \namendments to be brought up at this time; is that correct?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct, through the Chair. There is a \ndisagreement with the Senator from Louisiana and there is a hold on \nanything coming before this body.\n  Mr. COBURN. I have germane amendments, most of which will be germane \npostcloture.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. The Senator can certainly talk about his amendments.\n  Mr. COBURN. We cannot call them up and make them pending.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. That is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  I wanted to spend a little time talking about the appropriations \nprocess before I speak on the amendments. I have seven amendments, \nmaybe eight. All are commonsense amendments. Most people in America \nwould agree with them.\n  But this first chart I am showing shows that what we are doing this \nyear is, out of every dollar the Federal Government spends, we are \nborrowing 43 cents against our kids, against our grandkids. That is \neven true in this bill. This bill we have before us--a large portion of \nthe money to pay for this Interior appropriations bill is going to come \nfrom our children.\n  So one of the things you say is, well, what is the inflation out \nthere in terms of what are the costs that are actually increasing and \nhow do we compare to what everyone else is facing in terms of spending \nbased on increased costs? And in 2008, 2009, during that fiscal year, \nwe actually had a minus three-tenths of 1 percent inflation. That is \ncalled deflation. And so far this year, we have had 1.6 percent, and it \nis probably going to go lower than that when we see the end of the \nfiscal year. So let's say 1.6 percent is the cost we are seeing in \nterms of inflation this year.\n  Well, one of the first bills we passed was the Legislative Branch \nappropriations bill, and when we had a minus three-tenths of 1 percent \nincrease, we increased our expenses in the Congress by 10.88 percent. \nThis year, we have already passed the bill, and we increased it three \ntimes what the rate of inflation is. So just even in our own budget, \nrunning our own offices, running the Congress, we are increasing what \nwe spend three times faster than the rate of inflation.\n  If we look at the Homeland Security appropriations--all these \nnumbers, by the way, don't include the billions of dollars each of \nthese agencies received with the stimulus package--from 2008 to 2009, \nHomeland Security was increased 9.97 percent. That is a number of \ninfinity in terms of inflation because we had no inflation. So a 9.97-\npercent increase, almost 10 percent, as compared to no inflation, we \ngrew the government in this area. This year what we have passed already \nis another 7.22 percent growth, despite tens of billions of dollars \ngoing to the Department of Homeland Security with the stimulus package.\n  Then we had the Agriculture appropriations bill. For the 2008-2009 \nfiscal year, we increased it 13 percent. This year we are increasing it \n12.68 percent. At this rate, we will double the size of Homeland \nSecurity and the Agriculture Department in 4.75 years, if we take the \nmultiple of this, if we continue at this rate. The Transportation-HUD \nappropriations, which we passed last week, 13.31 percent in the 2008-\n2009 fiscal year. This year we have 22 percent we have increased it, \nfully 15 times more than inflation. And in transportation, the costs \nhave actually gone down in terms of what it costs to build a road or to \nrepair a bridge because of the economy.\n  Then we have this bill. Last year we increased Interior 4.13 percent. \nNow we are increasing it again 16.28 percent. Does anybody out there \nhave anything on which they are seeing those kinds of increases in \nincome in America? Remember, 43 percent of this is borrowed from our \nchildren's futures.\n  To sum up, look at what we have done so far. Legislative branch, \nincreased 4.75 percent; Homeland Security, 7.2; Energy and Water, \n1.41--we actually did one that is at inflation--Agriculture, 12.68; \nTransportation and HUD, 22.54; Interior, 16.28--all the time when we \nhave an inflation rate of 1.6 percent. What is going on? The American \npeople ought to be highly concerned with the appropriations bills \nflowing through here. It is all borrowed money. All the increases are \nborrowed against our children and grandchildren.\n  Here is what we have done so far in the Senate. There is no question \nthe Interior bill will pass. The appropriators will make sure of that. \nThey have their earmarks in it. Whether they claim to be a fiscal \nconservative or not doesn't matter. They will vote for the bill to \nprotect their earmarks. We can see what kind of growth we are \nexperiencing in the last 2 years in this country in expanding the size \nof the Federal Government. These aren't small increases. They are \ngigantic. Nothing in the 8 years preceding this came anywhere close to \nit. We have this ballooning Federal Government that at the rate we are \ngoing this year will double in less than 5 years. The size of the \nFederal Government, if we continue this trend, will double in the next \n5 years.\n  That doesn't count a health care bill that will add another 150,000 \nFederal employees and another $1 trillion of expenditure. We ought to \nbe worried about our future. We ought to be paying attention to what \nthe Chinese are saying, the biggest purchaser of our bonds and bills: \nYou are spending too much money.\n  They are right. They are absolutely right.\n  How is it, in a time of economic decline and almost nonexistent \ninflation, we can justify rates of increase that will double the size \nof the Federal Government in 5 years? I don't understand that. I don't \nbelieve 80 or 90 percent of the American people understand that, unless \nthey are not paying any taxes and don't care. But their grandchildren \nwill care.\n  Let me translate what will happen. What is going to happen with this \nkind of explosive government growth, with an almost $12 trillion debt \nwe have now that will double in the next 5 years and triple in the next \n10 years, according to the budget plan passed by those on the other \nside of the aisle, is that our children and grandchildren will see a \nstandard of living 30 percent below what we have today. That is the \nconsequence of borrowing 43 percent of everything we do. Interest rates \nare not always going to be as low as they are. In 2013, this government \nis going to pay over $1 trillion in interest costs per year. That is $1 \ntrillion we are taking from the American people that is not going to \nhelp anybody. It is just going to offset this terrible precedent we are \nsetting on spending. We can't afford it. If we want the dollar to sink \nand we want inflation to come roaring back, all we have to do is keep \ndoing what we are doing.\n  Then the value of our homes, the value of retirements, although \nalready hit by the decline, will erode even further. We cannot create \nwealth by trying to borrow our way out of trouble.\n  What I see, as I look at my five grandchildren, is we are acting \ntotally irresponsibly. There is no other thing we could do to describe \nwhat we are going to do. Yet tomorrow, when we get into cloture on this \nbill and we finally pass the bill, what are we going to do? We are \ngoing to mortgage the future of this country.\n  Let me explain. That means stealing hope, the propensity to think \nabout tomorrow being better, when, in fact, we, the Members of \nCongress, have ensured it will not be. We are taking away the hard-\nearned assets, not only through taxes but through inflation, of the \nAmerican worker. We have a real problem in front of us. We have an \nirresponsible Appropriations Committee that continues to send bills out \nthat are growing the government at a rate that is absolutely \nunsustainable.\n  What is the answer? The answer is to ask Congress to start making \nhard\n\n[[Page S9719]]\n\nchoices. Just like every other family is doing out there today, make \nthe hard choice of prioritizing. What is most important? What is next \nmost important? What is superfluous? What is not absolutely necessary \nnow that we want to steal from our grandchildren to be able to have \ntoday? The heritage of this country, the thing that created American \nexceptionalism, the thing that built the most powerful, most successful \neconomic model in the history of the world was a heritage of one \ngeneration saying: We will sacrifice to create opportunity for the next \ngeneration. These bills and this one, in particular, abandon that \nheritage. What we are saying is: We want for us now, and we don't care \nabout our children and grandchildren. These are indisputable numbers. \nThese are CBO numbers. At a minimum, this is what we are going to do. \nAt a maximum, it is going to be much worse.\n  Next year we are going to borrow more than 43 percent. We are going \nto approach 50 percent of everything we spend based on the budget plan. \nWe are going to have another $1.6 trillion deficit. That is Washington \naccounting, Enron accounting. The real deficit, when we take all the \nmoney stolen from all the trust funds, will put it closer to $1.9 \ntrillion. Do the math: 300 million people into $1.9 trillion; we are \nspending $6,000 more for every man, woman, and child than we are taking \nin.\n  I carry with me, based on last year's numbers, what the Federal \nGovernment does per family, per household. The year that ends this \nmonth, we will spend $34,000 of your money--not counting the States, \nnot counting municipalities--$34,000 per household through Federal \nGovernment programs; 43 percent of which, which comes out to about \n$15,000 per household, is borrowed. We will spend $9,000 on Medicare \nand Social Security; $5,800 on defense; antipoverty programs, almost \n$5,000; this year per family $1,210; in 3 years, $850 per family. \nFederal employee retirement benefits per family, you are paying $1,000 \nper family for Federal employees' generous retirement benefits. We are \npaying $800 for veterans benefits. For regulation and research, we are \npaying $700 per family. For highways, we are paying $500 per family; \nfor justice administration, $452; and for unemployment benefits, $900 \nper family.\n  If we total all that--all the others count $1,361 per family--we come \nup with $33,800 per family. That is going to be $40,000 next year per \nfamily that comes through the Federal Government, of which almost 50 \npercent will be borrowed.\n  We can't continue to do what this bill purports to do. It is not only \nunconscionable that we would not make the tough choices, and the reason \nwe don't make the tough choices is politicians don't want to offend \nanybody. It is not only unconscionable that we will not make the tough \nchoices; what we are doing is immoral. We are stealing opportunity. We \nare stealing the potential American dream of our children and \ngrandchildren because we are going to shackle them with a debt they \ncannot get out of.\n  I delivered babies for a living before I came up here. I have \ndelivered thousands of babies. When I deliver a baby now, it is a mixed \nblessing. It is a wonderful thing to see that new life come into the \nworld, to look at the parents' faces, to see the glow and to think \nabout all their hopes and dreams for that young child. But the downside \nis, if you are born today, you have the responsibility to pay off the \ninterest of over $480,000 of expenditures that are coming that we \nhaven't provided the revenues for.\n  Now, think about your grandchildren and your children. Do you really \nwant to load them down with that kind of number? Just paying the \ninterest--if interest is 5 percent--you are talking about they have to \nmake up $20,000, at least, before they are even just carrying the debt \nservice on that kind of load.\n  We are destroying this country through the lack of discipline and the \ncowardice of not making the hard choices that need to be made right \nnow--not tomorrow, not next week, right now.\n  For us to bring a bill to the Senate floor that increases the \nInterior spending by 16 percent, in a time when we have 1.6 percent \ninflation, and to not make the hard choices about priorities and \ngetting it to where we do not spend any more right now so we start \ncreating that hope of opportunity for our next generations, I do not \nunderstand.\n  I walk off this floor and beat my head against the wall because I do \nnot think the Senate gets it. They do not understand what the average \nfamily is doing today in terms of making these hard choices. They are \nmaking the hard choices at home, only to see us not make the hard \nchoices, and to offset the tremendous difficulties you have in making \nthose hard choices by making sure your kids are going to have to make \neven tougher ones.\n  Even when the economy turns around, this does not go away. America is \nthe longest surviving Republic in the history of the world. If we look \nat the history of the republics--all of them that have ever been \ncreated--what happened to them? They all collapsed. Do you know why \nthey collapsed? Some of them were defeated externally, but the reason \nthey were defeated externally is because they became a fiscal mess, \nmuch like we are, and they all ultimately collapsed over the lack of \nfiscal discipline and limiting the size of the government's take in \nterms of the size of the economy.\n  It is projected that in America, in 10 years--if things keep going \nthe way they are--the Federal Government will consume 40 percent of our \nGDP. When it gets to 50 percent, we are over, we are gone. What we have \ntoday is a situation that is not irreversible. But all prophetic \nindications would say, if we keep doing this, it is going to be \nirreversible.\n  I know those are tough things, but let me tell you how Senators \nthink. Senators think in the short term because it seems too often the \nmost important thing is getting to the next election. So we do the \nshort-term, expedient things that make us look good to a group of \npeople in one State by sacrificing the greater good of the country.\n  What is needed today in America is people with long-term visionary \nthought, combined with the courage to lose an election to do what is \nbest for the American public in the long run. What is best is for us to \nget back to the roots and our oath that is outlined in the Constitution \nof the United States.\n  This bill strays a long way from that, and my amendments will show \nsome of that. We no longer have a limited Federal Government. We have \nan overly expansive Federal Government. It is not going to be long when \nwe will not need States because the Federal Government is going to be \ninvolved in everything and telling the States what to do on everything \nanyway--and there comes the collapse of our Republic.\n  These are just little warning symptoms that say we do not have our \neye on the ball, that we have our eye on the wrong ball, that we do not \nbelieve in the oath we took to honor the Constitution and its \nprescribed method of maintaining a limited Federal Government, with \neverything else, as depicted in the 10th amendment, left and reserved \nfor the States and the people of this country.\n  When we are growing the Department of Interior by 16 percent, what we \nare doing is abandoning that. There is no justification. If you read \nthis appropriations bill and the report that goes along with it--if the \nAmerican people were to read it, they would throw up. They would throw \nup at the lack of priorities. They would throw up at the tremendous \nparochialism that says we put our State ahead of our country. They \nwould throw up at the waste, and they would throw up at the earmarks. \nThey would be literally sick.\n  So we find ourselves with multiple appropriations bills that are \ninexcusable, given the situation we find ourselves in, and, more \nimportantly, the sacrifices that American families are having to make \nnow in their own budgets. But, more importantly, it is inexcusable to \nsteal the hope and future from the next two generations, and this bill \ndoes that, and so do the rest of them.\n  We are stealing. We are selfish. We are saying: I would rather be \nreelected to the Senate than do what is best for America. I would \nrather protect my parochial interests than do what is better for \nAmerica. I would rather not have to make the hard choices of \neliminating some things that are not a priority rather than do what is \nin the best long-term vision for this country.\n\n[[Page S9720]]\n\n  It is discouraging. It is disappointing. The only way it changes is \nif the American people demand that it start changing. There should not \nbe 10 votes for this bill, but it will get 60 or 70 because there is no \nbackbone. There is no backbone to do the right, best thing for the \ncountry, even if it costs us. Serving your country means sacrificing. \nService without sacrifice is not service at all. If it is not costing \nyou something, you are not doing anything, and we shun the \nresponsibility of doing the best and the right thing for America.\n  Let me talk for a minute, if I may, about the amendments I have. I \nwill preview those amendments and will not spend a lot more of the \nchairman's and ranking member's time. I have a total of seven \namendments--actually eight. Let me talk about them since I cannot call \nthem up.\n  One amendment is on transparency. My friend, President Obama, wants \nus to be a transparent government. Throughout this bill are tons of \nreports that you, as American citizens, will never get to see. As a \nmatter of fact, I will not even get to see them because they are \ndirected only to the Appropriations Committee. What is that all about? \nAs a Member of the Senate I cannot see reports that are committed by \nthis bill in terms of reporting back from agencies. Yet only the \nAppropriations Committee can see them? More importantly, you cannot see \nthem to be able to hold us accountable to see whether we are doing our \njob? So one of the amendments just says, if there are reports required, \nand they do not compromise national security interests, everybody in \nAmerica ought to get to see them.\n  In the last appropriations bill that amendment was accepted. But I \nwill tell you what will happen to it. They will take it out in \nconference. They will say: Oh, it did not make it through conference. \nThe American people cannot see this. They will not come out and say it. \nI will have to publicize it. But they will deny the ability for you to \nsee the very reports they are asking for in this bill.\n  There is an earmark in this bill for a building less than two blocks \nfrom here called the Sewall-Belmont House. That house is used for a \nmultitude of things. They have $4 million cash in the bank right now, \nand we are going to give them another $1 million. They have money in \nthe bank, but we are going to give it to them anyway. Mostly what \nhappens over there is fundraisers for Members of Congress, for which \nthey charge $5,000 to use. They make money. Yet we have decided we are \ngoing to give them $1 million. Tell me that is a priority right now in \nthis country.\n  So what we do is we take that $1 million and send that $1 million to \nthe National Park Service because right now we have an $11 billion \nbacklog in our national parks, and they are falling down. But we refuse \nto fund them because we are doing things like this.\n  There is another amendment I have. We now have a conflict between \nagencies where the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Department of \nInterior will not allow Homeland Security to protect our southern \nborder because they are afraid it will mess up the environment. So what \nwe have done is we have said protecting wilderness areas is more \nimportant than protecting our border.\n  This amendment says none of the funds in this bill can be used to \nprohibit or impede the Department of Homeland Security from protecting \nus on the southern border. Yet it is happening every day. We have \ntestimony. We have internal documents that show the Department of \nInterior is limiting the ability of Homeland Security to protect our \nsouthern border. It makes sense that we should not do that. We should \nprotect the environment, but we will not have that environment if we do \nnot protect our southern border.\n  What we do know is, those areas where our Border Patrol cannot get to \nare where all the infiltration is coming today. It is where the drug \ntrafficking is coming today. It is where multiple, multiple people are \nbeing raped by the people who are transporting illegal aliens through \nthose wilderness and fish and wildlife areas.\n  So what this amendment says is, you cannot use money in the \nDepartment of Interior to preclude Homeland Security and the Border \nPatrol from doing their job, which is to protect us from the illegal \ntransport of people and drugs and weapons into this country.\n  I have another amendment. We want to try to become more energy \nindependent. We have all the renewable we are trying to do--whether it \nis wind or solar--yet the Department of the Interior is blocking the \nability to create the transmission lines from where we have renewable \nsources. They will not allow the transmission lines to go across those \nareas. We want to get off foreign oil. We want to decrease our carbon \nuse. Now we have started to develop alternative, renewable sources, and \nwe have an agency that is blocking the ability to get that power to us. \nIt makes no sense.\n  We can do that in an environmentally friendly way. So we cannot allow \nthe Department of the Interior to block that and the ultra-\nenvironmentalists, who say they want us to have renewable energy but, \nby the way, they do not want us to be able to use it. So we will \ndevelop it and not have a way to use it.\n  There is several hundred million dollars in this bill to be used for \nthe Federal Government to acquire more land. The Federal Government \nowns about 35 percent of all the land in the country today, but we \ncannot take care of the land we have. I mentioned earlier the backlog \nat the national parks. The National Mall has a backlog. The Statue of \nLiberty has a $600 million backlog. Some of our biggest and best \nparks--the Grand Canyon, Mount Rushmore, several others--have hundreds \nof millions of dollars in backlog.\n  All the national park backlog grew $400 million last year. In other \nwords, we are letting what we have crumble as we go and spend almost \n$360 million more on buying more land. This amendment says: Do not buy \nthe land. Put the money in fixing our national parks, bringing them up. \nThey are falling down. We actually have testimony where we are putting \nvisitors at risk because our maintenance backlog is so great.\n  Third from the last is an amendment to require a report so we know \nwhat we actually own. We don't know what we own. The last time we had \nany estimate it was of 658 million acres and that was 2005. Nobody has \ndone anything to know what we own, prioritize what we own, or say what \nis important. What do we need to protect the most? What do we need to \nget the backlogs straight on? How do we manage what we own? You can't \nmanage what you own if you don't know what you own. All it does is \nrequire a report on the total land owned by the Federal Government and \nthe cost to maintain the land so we can make coherent judgments about \nhow to make priorities of what is important and what is not. This \nappropriations bill shoots from the hip, because they don't have the \nfacts with which to make the decisions on how to prioritize.\n  Finally, we have this idea of national heritage areas. We now have \nfour times more than was ever authorized in the original bill. What \nhappens is we create a national heritage area and pretty soon you are \nout there on your farm or in your neighborhood and because it is a \nnational heritage declaration, we fund special interest groups that \ncome in to lobby to make sure what happens to your land is what they \nwant to happen, not what you want to happen with your land. So what we \nsay with this amendment is if we are going to create a national \nheritage area, all the landowners ought to be notified. If they want to \nbe included in that, allow them to opt in. Allow them to choose to be \nin the national heritage area. But if they don't want to be, their \nproperty rights ought to be secure. So what we say is allow them to \ndecide whether they want in or out and they have to opt in if they want \nin.\n  Our Bill of Rights guarantees our right to our property, an \nunfettered right. The national heritage areas destroy that and allow \ngroups with an interest that is funded by the Federal Government--you \ndidn't get any of the money--to come in and have the power and the \nmoney to lobby to change the restrictions and land codes against your \nwill. Most people who have found themselves in a heritage area don't \nknow it until they get ready to do something with their own land and \nfind out that: Oh, my goodness, the Federal Government has caused \nsomebody to change my ability to do what I want to do with my land. I \nam not talking crazy; I am talking responsible action by a landowner. \nSo what we are doing\n\n[[Page S9721]]\n\nis denying a fundamental right guaranteed under the Bill of Rights as \nwe create all of these heritage areas.\n  It is fine if you want to be in one, but if you don't want to be in \none, you ought to have the ability to not be in it and it shouldn't be \nassumed you are in it because we in Washington say you should. You \nought to be able to say you should and you ought to have the knowledge \nwith which to make that decision. That is called real transparency. \nThat is called protecting freedom. That is called letting people be \nresponsible for their property rather than us mandating from Washington \nwhat will and won't happen with our property.\n  Then, finally, an amendment I offer on every appropriations bill. It \ncomes from what President Obama said he wanted to do, and that is to \nmandate competitive bidding on everything we buy--no more well-\nconnected, well-heeled inside deals but competitively bid so that the \nAmerican taxpayers truly get value for the dollars they are sending \nhere and, even more importantly, the 43 percent our kids are going to \nbe paying for, that they get value. Since we are borrowing their money, \nwe are borrowing their future, at least when we borrow it, we ought \nto--and we are going to do misguided priorities and we are going to \noverspend and we are going to grow the government and double it in the \nnext 5 years--the least we could do is to get real value when we go to \nspend your money and your kids' money.\n  As my colleagues can see, I am not a very big fan of this bill. As a \nmatter of fact, I am not a big fan of any of the appropriations bills, \nbecause the whole premise under which they operate is: Here is what we \nhad last year and we are going to start from there, without ever \nlooking at: Here are how many billions we are spending and is it being \nspent properly? Is there great oversight? No, there is not. There is \nterrible oversight. Is there duplication? We don't even care; we don't \neven look. We don't make the hard choices that the next two generations \nneed us to make.\n  The most powerful committee in the Senate and the most powerful \ncommittee in the House is the Appropriations Committee, and $400 \nbillion of your money will be appropriated this year that is not even \nauthorized. The appropriators don't even pay attention to the \nauthorizing language because they are going to appropriate $400 billion \nof things that aren't authorized. So then we have this parliamentary \nrule that says you can't legislate on an appropriations bill. Yet they \nlegislate all the time by funding things that have never been \nauthorized or have expired authorizations for spending. So we can \neliminate $400 billion tomorrow by following the rules of the Senate \nand the rules of the Constitution, but we play the game and people come \nto kiss the rings, to get what they want at home, to look good at home. \nConsequently, we are extorted to pay with a vote for a bill that is \nlike this one--this big 16.28 percent increase--so we can look good at \nhome.\n  I want to tell my colleagues the American people are waking up. There \nis a rumble out there like I have never seen. It is a rumble I have \nbeen praying for. This country needs to be taken back by the people. \nThis country needs to hold the Members of this body absolutely \naccountable. The only way that happens is if the citizens stay \ninformed.\n  I will end with this. There was a President named Ronald Reagan. My \nlittle 3-year-old daughter at the time called him President Raisin \nbecause she couldn't say Reagan. He said one of the most profound \nthings I have ever heard said. He said: Freedom is a precious thing. It \nis not ours by inheritance. It is never guaranteed to us. It has to be \nfought for and defended by each and every generation.\n  I am telling you in the last 20 years, our generations haven't come \nup to defend it. He wasn't talking about our military; he was talking \nabout us being well informed citizens, holding us accountable, creating \nthe pressure for us to be transparent so that you can, in fact, know \nand count on us doing the right, best thing every time and that we put \nourselves second and the country first. That is what he was talking \nabout.\n  The rumble that is occurring in this country can't come soon enough \nor big enough to change both the Senate and the Congress. It is not \npartisan. It is sick on both sides of the aisle. What we need is a real \nrevolt against the status quo and an engagement and an enlistment by \nthe average American to speak out, to come out and hold us accountable \nto do what is best for the generations that follow and cause us to \nreembrace what built this country, which is a heritage of sacrifice \ntoday to create opportunity for the future.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The Senate is on H.R. 2996.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak in \nmorning business for up to 18 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Financial Market Innovation\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, Wall Street has undergone a radical \ntransformation in recent years. We saw the rise of high-frequency \ntrading where buy and sell orders move in milliseconds. We saw the \nemergence of so-called dark pools which permit confidential trading in \ngrowing volumes to take place away from the public eye. We now see some \ntrading firms' computer servers enjoying the advantage of onsite \nlocation, a practice known as colocation. We have seen the creation of \nflash orders which allow certain traders to see orders before anyone \nelse. There have been new developments in payments for order flow, a \npractice that permits market centers to pay a broker to route a trade \nits way. These and myriad other practices, almost too complicated to \ndescribe, have fundamentally changed how our markets operate. We now \nhave a high-tech, profit-driven arms race, which continues to escalate \nevery day, that has transformed the ways and the places and the speeds \nin which stocks and other securities are traded.\n  There are at least two questions that must be posed--questions we \nmust look to the markets' regulators to answer. First, have these \nopaque, complex, increasingly sophisticated trading mechanisms been \nbeneficial for retail investors, helping them to buy at the lowest \npossible price and sell at the highest price with the lowest possible \ntransaction costs or have they left them as second-class investors, \npushed aside by powerful trading companies able to take advantage of \nsmall but statistically and financially significant advantages? And \nsecond, do these high-tech practices and their ballooning daily volumes \npose a systemic risk? To take just one example, is anyone examining the \nleverage these traders use in committing their capital in such huge \ndaily volumes? What do we really know about the cumulative effect of \nall these changes on the stability of our capital markets?\n  The proponents of these technological developments tell us this \ntransformation has benefited all investors. But how can we know--truly, \nhow can we know that--when so much of the market is opaque to the \npublic and to the regulators? How can we be confident when the \nmeasurement and enforcement techniques used by regulators for ensuring \nbest execution seem stuck in the past and when so many trade in \nmilliseconds across fragmented markets to take advantage of so-called \nmarket latencies? And why should we assume it all operates in the \npublic interest when these changes have not been fully analyzed, \nindividually or collectively, to determine and protect the interests of \nlong-term investors?\n  That is why, on August 21, I wrote to SEC Chairman Mary Schapiro \ncalling for ``a comprehensive, independent, `zero-based regulatory \nreview' of a broad range of market structure issues, analyzing the \ncurrent market structure from the ground up before piecemeal changes \nbuilt on the current structure increase the potential for execution \nunfairness.'' I told her then that ``we need a thorough review . . .\n\n[[Page S9722]]\n\nso that our laws and regulations can keep pace with market \ndevelopments.'' In a written response to me on September 10, Chairman \nSchapiro announced that not only was the SEC reviewing dark pools and \nflash orders, studies it had begun earlier this year, but that it would \nbroaden its review to include regulation ATS threshold levels, direct \nmarket access, high-frequency trading, and colocation, which I \nexplained earlier.\n  Adding action to these words, last week the SEC unanimously approved \na proposal to ban the use of flash orders in our financial markets. \nFlash orders undermine the credibility of our markets by giving a \nselect group of market participants a sneak peek at stock quotes. As \nChairman Schapiro noted, ``Flash orders provide a momentary head start \nin the trading arena that can produce inequities in the market.'' I \napplaud the SEC for this action. The proposal must be put out for \npublic comment which the SEC will review before making a final \ndecision.\n  I am hopeful that last week's action was a true beginning. Banning \nflash orders is only a small, though significant--very significant--\nstep in the review of recent market developments.\n  Accordingly, I was also very pleased last week to hear Chairman \nSchapiro, the Commissioners, and the SEC staff voice their support not \njust for a flash order ban but also for the need for a comprehensive, \nground-up review at the Commission of current market structure issues.\n  Chairman Schapiro asserted last Thursday that ``other market \npractices may have . . . opaque features'' and that she expects the \nCommission to ``consider initiatives in the near future'' that address \n``forms of dark trading that lack market transparency.''\n  James Brigagliano, Co-Acting Director, Division of Trading and \nMarkets, added:\n\n       I want to emphasize that today's recommended proposal is a \n     first step in an ongoing review of market structure issues. \n     The securities markets have experienced extraordinary changes \n     over the last few years in trading technology and practices. \n     Some of these changes have led to serious concerns about \n     whether the regulatory structure remains up to date. The \n     division is examining a wide range of market structure \n     issues, including certain practices with respect to \n     undisplayed or ``dark trading interests'' in addition to \n     flash orders that are the subject of today's proposal. We \n     anticipate making additional recommendations to the \n     Commission in the coming months for proposals to address \n     discreet issues, such as flash orders, that warrant prompt \n     attention. There is also a spectrum of broader market issues \n     and practices that affect the interests of investors and need \n     to be examined closely.\n\n  I cannot tell you how pleased I am to hear that the Commission is \ntaking the review seriously. I say bravo to the SEC. The agency tasked \nwith upholding the integrity of our markets should actively review the \nrapid technological developments of the past few years and analyze \ntheir costs and benefits to long-term investors.\n  Eugene Ludwig, former Comptroller of the Currency, recently reminded \nus that each of the financial crises of the past 25 years--the collapse \nof the savings and loan industry, the Internet stock bust a decade \nlater, and last year's credit market meltdown--was the result of \ninadequate regulation.\n  Another former regulator, Brooksley Born, a former Chairman of the \nCFTC, warned us of the opaqueness of the derivatives markets at a time \nwhen they were becoming big enough to cause trouble. Earlier this year, \nshe recalled her warnings:\n\n       I was very concerned about the dark nature of these \n     markets.\n\n  And further:\n\n       I didn't think we knew enough about them. I was concerned \n     about the lack of transparency and the lack of any tools for \n     enforcement and the lack of prohibitions against fraud and \n     manipulation.\n\n  Unfortunately, history proved Brooksley Born right--unchecked, \nunexamined innovation severely weakened our markets and, as we all \nknow, ultimately led to our financial disaster. Sometimes small, \napparently technical innovations in our vast and complicated financial \nsystem can generate great benefits for all, and other times they can \ngenerate disastrous unintended consequences.\n  It is also fair to say that well-intentioned regulation in a complex \nmarket can also have unintended consequences. That is why we need \nregulators on the job, undertaking a thoughtful and reasoned analysis \nso we can have a clear view of where innovations may be taking us and \nwhether wise regulations can help curb abuses. Regulators must keep \npace with the latest market developments, and we in Congress must give \nregulators the tools they need to observe and stay abreast of the \nsophisticated financial players they are charged with regulating. I say \nthat again. We in the Congress must give regulators the tools they need \nto observe and stay abreast of the sophisticated financial players they \nare charged with regulating.\n  Three examples from the current debate are especially illustrative of \nthis need: colocation of servers at the exchanges, flash orders, and \ndirect market access.\n  When the exchanges first began to permit traders to place computers \nonsite, giving these traders a few microseconds' advantage, the SEC did \nnot insist on regulatory approval. The Commission simply let it occur. \nThere was no active consideration then, as I have called for now, of \nthe means by which fair access can be preserved.\n  The same is true for flash orders. In May, the SEC permitted the \nNASDAQ and BATS exchanges to introduce flash-order offerings even \nthough both admitted that the practice was of dubious value and that \nthey simply were being driven to adopt it by the loss of market share \nto competitors. Both exchanges later reversed those decisions \nvoluntarily, which is commendable, but let's not forget that this was a \ntelling example of rote, piecemeal review by the SEC staff applying \noutdated floor-based precedents to electronic-age developments.\n  Direct market access is another practice that deserves closer \nexamination. Such agreements allow high-frequency traders to use their \nbroker's market participant identification to interact directly with \nmarket centers. In order to maximize speed of execution, many sponsored \naccess participants may neglect important pretrade credit and \ncompliance checks that ensure faulty algorithms cannot send out \nerroneous trades.\n  According to John Jacobs, chief operations officer at Lime Brokerage, \nthis risk is quite significant. He says:\n\n       At 1,000 shares per order and an average price of $20 per \n     share, $2.4 billion of improper trades could be executed in \n     this short timeframe . . . The next long term capital \n     meltdown would happen in a five-minute time period.\n\n  When did direct access begin, and has the SEC ever considered its \nramifications from a comprehensive standpoint?\n  Some are now saying that colocation and flash orders are very old-\nfashioned concepts and perhaps colocation, for its part, will \nultimately be practiced better in the automated environment than it has \nbeen on the floors. I am sure some old hands can tell hair-raising \nstories about the old days and floor space out of the Chicago pits.\n  But that is the point: Colocation and flash are two of many \ntransformational changes this decade that have been considered \npiecemeal and only in the context of existing policies. Like direct \naccess, these changes may have been found equal or even superior to \ntheir floor-based antecedents, but in an automated age these changes \nneed to be subjected to a holistic analysis of their collective impact \non the markets and our regulatory infrastructure.\n  The same is true for high-frequency trading, dark pools, payment for \norder flow, liquidity rebates, and other market structure issues.\n  The rapid rise of high-frequency trading and dark execution venues \nhas quite simply left our regulatory agencies playing catch-up. High-\nfrequency traders can execute over 1,000 trades in a single second. Let \nme say that again--1,000 trades in a single second. According to the \nTAB Group, these traders are now responsible for over 70 percent of all \ndaily U.S. equity trades--70 percent; that is 7-0 percent.\n  We are learning more about high-frequency trading every day. \nAccording to one industry expert:\n\n       Most high-frequency shops have huge volumes but few \n     transactions. About 95 to 97 percent of trades are orders \n     sent and canceled.\n\n  What does all this mean for the long-term investor? Trading is not \nonly faster, it is also quickly becoming less transparent. Twelve \npercent of trades are now conducted in dark pools, compared to less \nthan 1 percent 6 years\n\n[[Page S9723]]\n\nago, and substantial percentages of trades are internalized at broker-\ndealers, never reaching a public exchange.\n  Maybe in the old days there were block trades happening in the dark \ntoo. I don't doubt it. But many commentators have raised concerns about \nwhether the darkening trends today truly threaten to undermine public \nprice discovery. The strength of a free market is in its public display \nof price quotes to all market participates.\n  These recent developments quite simply need to be better understood.\n  Yet still, after all the disasters, the billions of dollars lost, the \nhomes foreclosed, the jobs lost--after all the pain that has been \ncaused across this country--some on Wall Street reject even the notion \nof regulatory scrutiny.\n  They become defensive about the politicization of the process when \nCongress asks basic questions. They say Congress and the media can \nnever understand high-frequency trading. They point to the benefits of \nhigh-frequency trading--narrowed spreads, added liquidity, and faster \nexecutions--and ask everyone to trust there will be no side effects, no \nunintended consequences. Some still argue that the market operates best \nwithout any regulation; that changes in market structure are the \nnatural consequence of the innovative and competition and there is \nnothing good to be gained from regulators or Congress studying possible \nsources of inequity.\n  To their credit, not everyone on Wall Street has reacted this way. \nOthers have said that now is the right time for a comprehensive review \nof market structure developments. These Wall Street leaders--true \nleaders--acknowledge there are indeed many valid questions being raised \nabout dark pools, payment for order flow, other market innovations, and \nenforcement of best execution.\n  Indeed, some high-frequency traders have said they welcome a \nregulatory examination of high-frequency trading because they are \nconfident high-frequency trading will pass the test with flying colors. \nThat is the correct attitude. We need a regulatory review with Wall \nStreet's cooperation.\n  It is in the nature of our financial markets to push the envelope, to \ntake on more and more risk, and to exploit any crack in the wall when \nthere are profits to be won. There is nothing wrong with this. But to \nhave a full accounting, we also need to add up the costs to the long-\nterm investor, to financial stability, to innocent bystanders of each \nnew generation of innovation.\n  In years past, without a sufficient regulatory presence, an aura of \ninvincibility developed at many financial institutions. We failed to \nask questions, we failed to ensure regulators were on the field with \nthe tools they need to do their jobs, and the results are clear: \nMillions of Americans have lost their jobs, their homes, and their \nsavings. We must not repeat that mistake. We must be sure that when \nfinancial markets push the envelope, take on more and more risk, and \nexploit any crack in the wall, they are monitored and regulated to \nassure it is in the public good.\n  It is time for Congress and the regulators to ask questions and for \nWall Street to step forward responsibly and answer them with the data \nto back up those answers. We cannot simply react to problems after they \nhave occurred. We need the information and resources to identify \nproblems before they arise and stop them in their tracks.\n  Our goal is not to stop high-frequency trading. We don't want to slow \nit down. Liquidity, innovation, and competition are critical components \nof our financial markets. But at the same time, we cannot allow \nliquidity to trump fairness, and we cannot permit the need for speed to \nblind us to the potentially devastating risks inherent in effectively \nunregulated transactions.\n  We cannot forget that fair and transparent markets are the \ncornerstones of our American system. As I have said before, fairness in \nthe financial markets may be an elusive and ever-evolving concept, but \nit must be defined and then vigorously defended by our regulators. The \ncredibility of the markets and investor confidence simply demand that \nregulators be ever watchful, sophisticated, and tough against those who \nwould breach the rules.\n  I am not demanding an immediate, wide-ranging regulatory overhaul. I \nwill not place symbolic action over prudent investigation. That would \nbe impulsive and irresponsible. But it is only prudent, given the risks \nof the past, that I will not allow potentially risky market practices \nto go on unexamined. I will ask questions and strive to improve my \nunderstanding of these opaque market practices and, if necessary, push \nappropriate reforms. I am very pleased the SEC has agreed to do the \nsame.\n  If we fail to learn from past mistakes, we can be sure history will \nrepeat itself.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the amendment \nproposed by the distinguished Senator from Missouri, Mrs. McCaskill. \nThis amendment would eliminate 16 congressionally directed spending \nitems in the National Park Service's Save America's Treasures Program. \nI would like to say what these are: in Alabama, Swayne Hall, Talladega; \nin California, Mission Santa Barbara, Santa Barbara; in Florida, \nFreedom Tower, Miami; Iowa, Des Moines Art Center, Des Moines; Kansas, \nColonial Fox Theater, Pittsburgh; Michigan, Big Sable Lighthouse, \nLuddington; Madison County Courthouse, Mississippi; Mississippi, Medgar \nEvers site, Jackson; Nevada, the Lincoln County Courthouse, Pioche; New \nYork, the Strand Theater, Plattsburgh; New York, the Richard Olmstead \nComplex, Buffalo; Oregon,\n\n[[Page S9724]]\n\nthe Wallowa County Courthouse, Enterprise; Rhode Island, the Warwick \nCity Hall, Warwick; the State Theater, Sioux Falls, SD; the Blount \nMansion, Knoxville, TN, and the Capitol Theater, Wheeling, WV.\n  Those are the 16 that would be eliminated.\n  The underlying argument is that this bill continues business as usual \nwhen it comes to earmarking funds, and this is hardly the case. The \nSenate leadership and the chairman and ranking member of the \nAppropriations Committee have built on the reforms established by the \nlast Congress when it comes to congressionally directed spending. To \noffer more opportunity for public scrutiny of Member requests, Members \nare now required to post detailed information concerning their earmark \nrequests on their official Web sites at the time the request is made. \nEach Senator must explain the purpose of the earmark and why it is a \nvaluable use of taxpayer funds.\n  A list of every congressionally directed spending item in this bill \nhas been on the Internet for public scrutiny since June 17, 2009, when \nit was first marked up by the Interior Subcommittee. For every \ncongressionally directed spending item contained in this bill, the \nSenator has certified that he or she or his or her immediate family has \nno financial interest in the item requested. These letters of \ncertification are available to the public on the Internet.\n  These reforms are not the status quo. They represent significant \nimprovements in the transparency and accountability for the spending \ndecisions contained in the various appropriations measures being \nbrought before this body.\n  Let me now explain the process used to evaluate these specific Save \nAmerica's Treasures earmarks. As Senator Alexander and I have reviewed \neach of the 128 funding requests the Interior Subcommittee has \nreceived, we applied the same criteria that has been applied for the \npast 10 years and that has been codified in the program's \nauthorization. When we did that, only 16 projects passed muster.\n  For example, if the project received funding in the past it was \nineligible for a grant this year. If the project was a building and the \nbuilding was not listed on the National Register of Historic Places, \nthen it was ineligible for a grant this year. If the local authorities \ndid not have the required one-to-one matching funding in hand, then it \nwas ineligible for a grant this year.\n  Then, even if the project cleared those hurdles, we still set aside \nthose requests that were not considered the highest priority by the \nrequesting Members.\n  When that process was complete, what we ended up with were the 16 \nvery good and credible projects that I have just read. So I urge a \n``no'' vote on the McCaskill amendment.\n  Mr. President, I move to table the amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The motion will be in order at \nthe appropriate time.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I believe there is a time agreement so \nI cannot move to table at this time. I withdraw my motion to table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum and \nask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum call be equally \ndivided.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n               Motion to Recommit with Amendment No. 2508\n\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, it is my understanding that there is 2 \nminutes equally divided on the Vitter motion to recommit. I ask \nunanimous consent to speak for 1\\1/2\\ minutes on the amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. Reserving the right to object, I ask unanimous consent to \nhave equal time on the amendment.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. I have no objection to equal time.\n  Mr. VITTER. I have no objection to the modified request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I oppose this motion to recommit \nbecause it would prevent the Obama administration from presenting its \noil and gas development plan in favor of a draft plan issued by the \nBush administration on its last business day in office. The amendment \nwould overturn Interior Secretary Salazar's decision to extend the \npublic comment period over a 5-year plan for oil and gas development on \nthe Outer Continental Shelf by 180 days. The amendment would make the \nlast-minute Bush draft binding. The Bush plan only allowed for a 60-day \ndeadline for public comment. That is not enough time. The Interior \nDepartment received 350,000 public comments during the extended comment \nperiod. The Department should not be prevented from studying these \ncomments and proposing the best plan it can.\n  In addition, there is currently insufficient data on available \nresources for the Atlantic seaboard where the Bush plan would extend \ndrilling.\n  We should not make decisions to sell off taxpayer resources based on \nold information.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, of course, nothing in my amendment \nprevents the Interior Department from reading all those comments, from \ndigesting them. My amendment is simple and straightforward. It says: \nRemember last summer where almost all of America said this is \nridiculous, drill here, drill now, let's use our own resources and not \nbe held captive to foreign interests. Remember that. My amendment is \nabout whether we listen to that or whether we will ignore it. Right now \nthis administration and this Interior Department have pledged to ignore \nthat and have pledged to forestall and put off the OCS development plan \npreviously developed that is on the books and about to move forward. \nThis question is simple: Did we listen to the American people when they \nspoke so loudly, so clearly, or is Congress going to ignore the clear \nwill of the American people yet again?\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, I move to table the motion to recommit \nand ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion to table the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Byrd) \nis necessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 56, nays 42, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 293 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--56\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Conrad\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Franken\n     Gillibrand\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     McCaskill\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Specter\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                                NAYS--42\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Begich\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Gregg\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Johanns\n     Kyl\n     LeMieux\n     Lugar\n     McCain\n     McConnell\n     Murkowski\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Sessions\n     Shelby\n     Snowe\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                             NOT VOTING--1\n\n       \n     Byrd\n       \n  The motion to table was agreed to.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.

There will be 2 minutes of debate equally \ndivided between each side to discuss the McCaskill amendment No. 2514.\n  Who yields time? The Senator from Missouri.\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, this amendment is a very small step. \nIt restores a competitive grant program--a small competitive grant \nprogram. Over the last decade, competitive and formula grant programs \nhave been decimated by earmarking. Earmarks have become more \ntransparent under reforms that have been made, and that is great. Is \nthe process still fair? No, probably not. The lion's share of the \nearmarks in this bill, in this program, and in all of the \nappropriations bills go to the very few Members who serve on one \ncommittee. This will allow us to put this money back into a competitive \nprocess so all the States in the Nation have an equal opportunity to \nparticipate.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  The Senator from California is recognized.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN. Mr. President, regrettably, I wish to speak against \nthe amendment. There has been a rigorous vetting process of these \nprojects. We looked at 128 requests. Only 16 of those passed muster. \nEarlier, I outlined the criteria which were strictly observed in \nselecting these projects. I outlined what the projects are. We applied \nthe same criteria that is in the law. These are all excellent projects. \nI urge my colleagues to support the committee bill and oppose this \namendment.\n  I move to table the McCaskill amendment, and I ask for the yeas and \nnays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, it is my understanding that we have to \nvacate the Chamber at 5:30 p.m. so the room can be swept for the \nceremony. I know Senator Ensign wishes to speak. I have stated to him \nthat he could speak, so I would like to have the floor open to him to \nspeak for the remaining time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nevada.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, tomorrow, from what I understand, I will \nhave a motion to recommit this bill with instructions that hopefully \nwill be part of the unanimous consent agreement. Let me describe \nexactly what my motion to recommit says.\n  Last week, I did a similar motion to recommit on the T-HUD \nappropriations bill because that bill was dramatically increased. And \nthis week's appropriations bill on Interior has yet another huge \nincrease. In 2008 to 2009, the increase was 4 percent. This year, the \nincrease is 16.28 percent.\n  Every local government, State government, probably almost everyone in \nthe United States is cutting their budgets. Almost every business is \ncutting its budget. Most households in America are cutting their \nbudgets because of these difficult economic times. But what do we do in \nWashington, DC? We print money and we dramatically increase spending.\n  The National Taxpayers Union has agreed with me, and they are asking \nthe Senate to vote ``YES'' on my motion to recommit, which I will be \noffering tomorrow. They are saying we need to have fiscal discipline at \nthis time. And we just cannot keep running up spending around here. \nThat is what we are doing.\n  If we look at each one of the appropriations bills so far this year, \nLegislative Branch, last year was an 11-percent increase, this year it \nis about a 5-percent increase; Homeland Security, almost 10-percent \nlast year, and it is going up by 7 percent this year; Energy and Water \nhad the smallest increase; Agriculture had about a 13-percent increase \nlast year and about the same percentage increase this year; T-HUD, \nTransportation and Housing and Urban Development appropriations, had a \n13-percent increase last year and almost a 23-percent increase this \nyear; and, of course, the bill we have before us now, which is \nInterior, a 4-percent increase last year, and over a 16-percent \nincrease this year.\n  By the way, here is the inflation rate. Last year was negative \ninflation. This year, there is almost no inflation. Yet around here we \nkeep running up our deficits.\n  So far this year we have $1.56 trillion in deficits. This says it \npretty well: 43 percent of every dollar we are spending this year is \ndeficit spending. We are borrowing from future generations so we can \ngive us what we want, so we can get reelected, so we can go back home \nand pass out the goodies. That is what a lot of these appropriations \nbills are--they are passing out the goodies, they are increasing \nspending on the backs of future generations.\n  When are we going to get serious in this body about fiscal restraint? \nThe other side of the aisle criticized us during the last 7-8 years for \nspending too much money. In some regards, they were right. But compared \nto what they are doing right now, we were fiscal conservatives by a \nlarge degree. What they are doing is dramatically raising Federal \nspending.\n  The problem with this increase we have before us today in this \nspending bill, over 16 percent, is if we keep these kinds of spending \nincreases up, it will double the spending within 5 to 6 years. What \nhappens this year is we spend more money. That gets put in the baseline \nbudget for next year, so any increase next year is on top of the \nincrease this year. And so each year is increased and increased and \nthen increased some more. We never seem to go backward or reduce \nspending in this body. We only go higher and higher as far as spending \nlevels are concerned. It seems there is no limit to our appetite for \nspending around here.\n  The American people have woken up. And I am actually the most \nencouraged I have been, I think, in my entire political career, \nwatching people getting involved, hearing from them from all over my \nState of Nevada, and seeing them all over the country getting involved, \nsaying: It is time that we think about the greater good in America; \nthat we do not think about pet projects or pet programs or any of these \nmassive spending increases. It is time we show fiscal responsibility \nand we start getting back to what the Framers of our Constitution \nenvisioned when they saw a limited Federal Government, not this \nexpansive Federal Government.\n  Tomorrow, when we vote, I urge hope this Chamber will say: Now is the \ntime\n\n[[Page S9726]]\n\nthat we are going to start showing some fiscal restraint. We are going \nto say: Yes, we will tighten our belts. We will snug it up a little \nbit. We will make some of the tougher votes. We will say NO to some of \nthe special interest groups around the country that come to our offices \nevery year for more and more money. Let's make priorities. Let's look \nat things that are working and some that are not. Let's take the money \naway from the ones that are not and reduce the deficit. That is what we \nneed to be thinking about in this body.\n  I hope my words do not fall on deaf ears. I hope people in this body \nwill actually start thinking about future generations instead of just \nthinking about their favorite projects that they want to fund and their \nspecial interest groups to whom they want to pay attention.\n  Mr. President, I have concluded my remarks. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. BEGICH. Mr. President, I rise to speak about 3 amendments. The \nfirst provides funding of an environmental impact statement important \nto the future of residents of my State.\n  On March 30, 2009, the President signed the Omnibus Public Lands Act, \nPublic Law 111-11. That bill enacted many important conservation \nprovisions including the first major new wilderness areas in many \nyears.\n  That bill also provides a path for a major land exchange in Alaska \nwhich would lead to the designation of the first new wilderness in \nAlaska in a generation. A part of the act directs the Secretary of \nInterior, through the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, to perform an \nenvironmental analysis and then for the Secretary to determine if the \nland exchange tentatively approved in the Omnibus Public Lands Act \nshould be executed.\n  My amendment provides necessary funding, in the amount of $1 million, \nfor the EIS which this Congress has ordered. Because the bill was only \nenacted in March, there was no time for the regular budget process to \ntake into account the requirements of this important study.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service is also seeking funding in the fiscal \nyear 2010 budget process, but Alaskans have waited long enough for \nresolution on this issue. Not only is the land exchange critical to \nprovide key new wilderness and refuge additions, it is the path for a \ngroup of my Alaska Native constituents, 800 residents of the village of \nKing Cove, to get safe access to the Cold Bay Airport.\n  Because this issue was debated in the Halls of Congress for a number \nof years, I will not go into great detail here. In short, however you \nfeel about this land exchange, whether you favor the interests of the \nindigenous people with roots in the area going back 4,000 years or more \nor if you do not approve of the land exchange and the road corridor it \nfacilitates, the people of King Cove deserve the answer that the \ngovernment has promised them.\n  They suffer from some of the worst weather on the planet. Anytime of \nthe year, residents with emergency medical needs can risk their lives \neither flying over or crossing Cold Bay to get to Alaska's third \nlargest airport at Cold Bay, AK. Over the last 20 years, a number of my \nconstituents have been killed trying to make this trip. The only safe \nalternative is a road.\n  The land exchange to be studied is of monumental importance. It \nprovides 61,723 acres of new wilderness and refuge lands for a mere 206 \nacres to be used as a road corridor.\n  Ultimately, the decision on whether this exchange is to be executed \nrests with Secretary Salazar after completion of the EIS. All my \namendment does is fund that EIS and keep the Congress's promise to the \nAleut residents of King Cove that this process will move forward \nexpeditiously.\n  Mr. President, I have drafted this amendment so it will have no \nbudget impact. It will not add new spending. Instead, it provides that \nfunding should come from the overall bill. This should not be subject \nto any budget point of order.\n  The next amendment would allow the Chugach National Forest, in the \nAlaska region of the U.S. Forest Service, to retain receipts from a \nproposed sale of gravel and other minerals further development of a \npopular hiking and tourism enhancement program.\n  It has become a tired cliche to say that we should run government \nlike a business. But in the best sense of the phrase we imply that, \nlike the private sector, we should reward individual management \ndecisions that creatively solve problems and make good use of limited \nresources. The amendment in front of you does just that.\n  The National Forest System is based on a theory of managing for \nmultiple uses. The gravel resource at Spencer Mountain is sought after \ncommodity for building projects around Southcentral Alaska and can be \neasily developed and sent to market via the Alaska Railroad. This \namendment proposes to allow the Chugach National Forest System to \nretain the revenue from that gravel operation to enhance the wildly \npopular Chugach Whistle Stop Project, a joint initiative of the Forest \nService and the Alaska Railroad.\n  The Whistle Stop Partnership uses efficient self-propelled railcars \ncalled DMUs--diesel multiple unit--to transport smaller groups of \npassengers to track side destinations developed by the Chugach National \nForest. These destinations include hiking trails, picnic grounds, \nrental cabins and no-fee campgrounds, and guided rafting and canoeing \noperations run by private outfitters.\n  Begun in 2007, the program has proved overwhelming popular and \nprovides unique and appropriate access to backcountry destinations, \nallowing residents and tourist alike to enjoy remote parts of the \nChugach National Forest. When complete, the experience will allow hut-\nto-hut hiking and other personalized recreational opportunities. The \nestimated remaining cost to complete the project is $13 million. This \nincludes an additional self-propelled rail car, 4 additional Whistle \nStop locations, 30 miles of trail with associated bridges, 6 public-use \ncabins, and 24 backcountry campsites.\n  Despite the combination of mineral resource development and tourism \npromotion into one project, the Whistle Stop Project and this budget \nrequest have no significant opposition. At a time when the tourism \nindustry in Alaska is suffering a 25-percent drop in visitors, this \nproject would immediately provide an important, if targeted, shot in \nthe arm.\n  Mr. President, I ask for your assistance in rewarding good \nmanagement, allowing residents and visitors to enjoy the Alaska \nbackcountry, and promoting an important industry in Alaska.\n  The third amendment provides full and adequate funding for the \nsubsistence management budget for the Alaska region of the U.S. Forest \nService.\n  The United States settled its lands claims agreement with the Native \npeople of Alaska with the passing of the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act, ANCSA, by Congress in 1971. Through ANCSA, Congress \npromised Alaska Natives that they would retain their right to \nsubsistence harvest of the fish and game in Alaska. Congress made good \non that promise through title VIII of the 1980 Alaska National Interest \nLands Conservation Act, ANILCA. Title VIII provides rural Alaskan \nresidents a subsistence priority to harvest fish and wildlife on \nFederal lands over sport and commercial uses.\n  That Federal statute is now in direct conflict with the Alaska State \nConstitution, which does not allow a priority based on residency. As a \nresult, the Federal Government assumed responsibility for subsistence \nmanagement on Federal public lands in 1990 and expanded its \nresponsibility to federally reserved navigable waters in 1999. Federal \nsubsistence is a joint effort of the Departments of the Interior and \nAgriculture, with management on National Forest System lands the \nresponsibility of the Forest Service.\n  Three main aspects of the Federal program are regulatory, law \nenforcement and education, and information gathering. The regulatory \nprogram includes establishing the basic rules for fish and wildlife \nharvest and seasonal and in-season adjustments to address immediate \nconservation issues. Information gathering includes the fish and \nwildlife monitoring necessary for regulatory purposes. This generally \nconsists of stock assessments that are often contracted out to local \ngroups, primarily Alaska tribal organizations. The final general \ncategory is law enforcement and education to make subsistence hunters \nand fishers aware of the regulations and enforce them.\n\n[[Page S9727]]\n\n  In fiscal year 2009, the Alaska Region Forest Service funding level \nfor subsistence management activities in the two largest forests in the \nNational Forest System--the 17 million acre Tongass National Forest--an \narea roughly the size of West Virginia--and the 5.6 million acre \nChugach National Forest--totaled $5 million. The current bill before \nyou would only fund half this amount, $2,582,000.\n  The need has not suddenly changed, and I hope Congress has not \nsuddenly forgotten its obligation to the Alaska Native people. I can \nonly hope that the fiscal year 2010 amount resulted from the innocent \nignorance of an incoming administration about the obligation the \nFederal Government has to the Alaska Native people.\n  Subsistence hunting, fishing, and gathering is about more than simple \neconomics. It is about the survival of a way of life and identity of \nAlaska's Native peoples. However, its economic importance is central to \nrural Alaska life and cannot be overstated.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor a good friend, Vivia \nMotsinger, on the recent celebration of her 90th birthday. A longtime \nresident of Washington, DC, Vivia's 90 years may best be characterized \nby her incredible work ethic, as well as her undying devotion to public \nservice.\n  Vivia Motsinger was born the daughter of a shipbuilder in Portsmouth, \nVA, on September 20, 1919. Years later, Vivia's father moved the family \nto our Nation's Capital in order to work in the construction of \ngovernment buildings. She went to school at Roosevelt High, where she \ngraduated in 1935 at the age of 16. Tragically, 2 years later her \nfather died, making teenaged Vivia the only breadwinner in her family. \nGrateful to have the aid of Social Security to supplement her meager \nearning power, Vivia started out her career working hard to assist her \nmother and younger sister.\n  Vivia's professional career saw her begin as a clerk at a naval gun \nfactory during WWII. Later, she found employment as a stenographer and \nan administrative assistant at the U.S. Department of State. Mrs. \nMotsinger's final position, before she retired, was that of a Foreign \nService worker. She is very proud of the accomplishments that she has \nmade and grateful for her years of service to the Federal Government.\n  Vivia has been blessed with a loving family. She married a remarkable \nhusband, who worked as an officer for the Central Intelligence Agency, \nand raised a son who is now employed by NASA. She loves her church, the \nChurch of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and is proud to have \nbecome a member some 34 years ago. She has spent her years of \nretirement studying her heritage, a hobby which has driven her to \nbecome avidly involved with genealogy and research.\n  With her optimism and strong work ethic, Vivia represents the spirit \nof America. Despite challenging circumstances, she has achieved great \nthings. I congratulate Vivia Motsinger on this her 90th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9727-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9727]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         GOLD STAR MOTHER'S DAY\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, this Sunday marks Gold Star Mother's Day, \na day for us to honor the mothers of servicemembers lost while serving \nin our Armed Forces.\n  This Sunday, the last Sunday in September, is a day that is part of a \nlarger Gold Star tradition, one that brings together all family members \nwho have lost a son or daughter in uniform.\n  The gold star has its roots in World War I, when families would \ndisplay in the windows of their homes a blue star for every family \nmember who was serving and a gold star for every family member who had \ndied in the war. In 1936, Congress established the last Sunday in \nSeptember as Gold Star Mother's Day.\n  America has been home to hundreds of thousands of Gold Star Mothers, \neach of whom has lost a child. They often choose to become part of an \norganization of other Gold Star Mothers, one that--in the words of one \nmother--``none of us ever wanted to become eligible to join but we are \ngrateful to have.'' It is a testament to their strength that so many \ncontinue to volunteer and to remember, long after they learn of their \nown loss.\n  On Sunday, the American people are encouraged to display our flag and \nalso to hold meetings to publicly express the love, sorrow, and \nreverence we have for Gold Star Mothers.\n  Gold Star Mothers from across the country will visit our Nation's \ncapital, to remember. They will visit the Vietnam Veterans Memorial \nWall, a short distance from this place, where many will lay wreaths for \ntheir sons or daughters. They will travel to Arlington National \nCemetery and view the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.\n  In Illinois, Gold Star Mothers will be recognized in ways big and \nsmall, from the Governor's annual ceremony in Chicago, to a barbeque \nheld in their honor at the Middle East Conflicts Wall Memorial in \nMarseilles, Il, to commemorations in townhalls and on radio shows.\n  Gold Star Mothers affect every community in this country. Their \npresence is another reminder that in the Senate, the vote for war is \namong the most significant votes a Senator will ever take.\n  I hope all Americans will take a moment out of their day this Sunday \nto honor Gold Star Mothers, their families, and their children who died \nwhile serving our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9727-4", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9727-S9728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PUBLIC OPTION LITE\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, a September 17, 2009, editorial in the Wall \nStreet Journal, ``Public Option Lite,'' clearly and concisely describes \nhow the Finance Committee chairman's health care plan would result in a \nnear total government takeover of the health care industry.\n  Because it does not include the public option, the chairman's plan \nhas been touted as a more moderate proposal than other bills before \nCongress. But, as the Journal writes, the absence of the public option \n``is a political offering without much policy difference. His plan \nremains a public option by other means.''\n  Near total government control would be achieved through the bill's \ntwo main mechanisms: an individual mandate for all Americans to \npurchase government-approved insurance and the regulatory insurance \n``exchange.'' The inevitable outcomes of these mechanisms would be \n``vast new insurance regulation'' and ``a vast increase in the \ngovernment's share of U.S. health spending, forcing doctors, hospitals, \ninsurance companies, and other health providers to serve politics, as \nwell as, or even over and above patients.'' Thus, power would be \ncentralized with politicians and bureaucrats, rather than patients and \ndoctors.\n  Along the way, as the editorial points out, the bill would increase \nthe\n\n[[Page S9728]]\n\ncost of insurance through new taxes and mandates, reduce consumer \nchoice, and ultimately ration health care in an attempt to keep costs \nunder control.\n  The editorial also explains that most of the Medicare cuts used to \nhelp pay for this plan ``come from supposedly automatic cuts that a \nfuture Congress is unlikely to ever approve, that is, until this \nentitlement spending swamps the entire federal budget.'' Then, ``The \ngovernment will have no choice but to raise taxes to European welfare-\nstate levels or impose drastic restrictions on patient care. Or likely, \nboth.''\n  The article concludes that this plan is ``a recipe to ruin \nhealthcare'' and ``bankrupt the country.''\n  I ask unanimous consent to have this article printed in the Record \nand urge my colleagues to consider the facts and arguments contained in \nthis editorial.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [The Wall Street Journal, Sept. 17, 2009]\n\n                           Public Option Lite\n\n       Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus finally unveiled his \n     health-care plan yesterday to a chorus of bipartisan jeers. \n     The reaction is surprising given that President Obama all but \n     endorsed the outlines of the Baucus plan last week But the \n     hoots are only going to grow louder as more people read what \n     he's actually proposing.\n       The headline is that Mr. Baucus has dropped the unpopular \n     ``public option,'' but this is a political offering without \n     much policy difference. His plan remains a public option by \n     other means, imposing vast new national insurance regulation, \n     huge new subsidies to pay for the higher insurance costs this \n     regulation will require and all financed by new taxes and \n     penalties on businesses, individuals and health-care \n     providers. Other than that, Hippocrates, the plan does no \n     harm.\n       The centerpiece of the Obama-Baucus plan is a decree that \n     everyone purchase heavily regulated insurance policies or \n     else pay a penalty. This government mandate would require \n     huge subsidies as well as brute force to get anywhere near \n     the goal of universal coverage. The inevitable result would \n     be a vast increase in the government's share of U.S. health \n     spending, forcing doctors, hospitals, insurance companies and \n     other health providers to serve politics as well as or even \n     over and above patients.\n       The plan essentially rewrites all insurance contracts, \n     including those offered by businesses to their workers. \n     Benefits and premiums must be tailored to federal \n     specifications. First-dollar coverage would be mandated for \n     many services, and cost-sharing between businesses and \n     employees would be sharply reduced, though this is one policy \n     that might reduce health spending by giving consumers more \n     skin in the game. Nor would insurance be allowed to bear any \n     relation to risk. Inevitably, costs would continue to climb.\n       Everyone would be forced to buy these government-approved \n     policies, whether or not they suit their needs or budget. \n     Families would face tax penalties as high as $3,800 a year \n     for not complying, singles $950. As one resident of \n     Massachusetts where Mitt Romney imposed an individual mandate \n     in 2006 put it in a Journal story yesterday, this is like \n     taxing the homeless for not buying a mansion.\n       The political irony here is rich. If liberal health-care \n     reform is going to make people better off, why does it \n     require ``a very harsh, stiff penalty'' to make everyone buy \n     it? That's what Senator Obama called it in his Presidential \n     campaign when he opposed the individual mandate supported by \n     Hillary Clinton. He correctly argued then that many people \n     were uninsured not because they didn't want coverage but \n     because it was too expensive. The nearby mailer to Ohio \n     primary voters gives the flavor of Mr. Obama's attacks.\n       And the Baucus-Obama plan will only make insurance even \n     more expensive. Employers will be required to offer \n     ``qualified coverage'' to their workers (or pay another \n     ``free rider'' penalty) and workers will be required to \n     accept it, paying for it in lower wages. The vast majority of \n     households already confront the same tradeoff today, except \n     Congress will now declare that there's only one right answer.\n       The subsidies in the Baucus plan go to people without a \n     job-based plan and who earn under three times the federal \n     poverty level, or about $66,000 for a family of four. Yet \n     according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis we've \n     seen, the plan isn't much of an improvement over the current \n     market.\n       Take a family of four making $42,000 in 2016. While \n     government would subsidize 80% of their premium and pay \n     $1,500 to offset cost-sharing, they'd still pay $6,000 a year \n     or 14.3% of their total income. A family making $54,000 could \n     still pay 18.1% of their income, while an individual earning \n     $26,500 would be on the hook for 15.5%, and one earning \n     $32,400 for 17.3%. So lower-income workers would still be \n     forced to devote huge portions of their salaries to expensive \n     policies that they may not want or be able to afford.\n       Other Democrats want to make the subsidies even bigger, but \n     Mr. Baucus told reporters on Monday that, ``We're doing our \n     very best to make an insurance requirement as affordable as \n     we possibly can, recognizing that we're trying to get this \n     bill under $900 billion total.'' Another way of putting this \n     is that he is hiding the real cost of his bill by pinching \n     pennies to meet a less politically toxic overall spending \n     number. In that sense, the House health bill which clocked in \n     at $1.042 trillion because it was more generous upfront was \n     more honest, though not by much.\n       Like the House bill, Mr. Baucus uses 10 years of taxes to \n     fund about seven years of spending. Some $215 billion is \n     scrounged up by imposing a 35% excise tax on insurance \n     companies for plans valued at more than $21,000 for families \n     and $8,000 for individuals. This levy would merely be added \n     to the insurers' ``administrative load'' and passed down to \n     all consumers in higher prices. Ditto for the $59 billion \n     that Mr. Baucus would raise by taxing the likes of clinical \n     laboratories and drug and device makers.\n       Mr. Baucus also wants to cut $409 billion from Medicare, \n     according to CBO, though the only money that is certain to \n     see the budget ax is $123 billion from the Medicare Advantage \n     program. Liberal Democrats hate Advantage because it gives \n     10.2 million seniors private options. The other ``savings'' \n     come from supposedly automatic cuts that a future Congress is \n     unlikely to ever approve that is, until this entitlement \n     spending swamps the federal budget. Then the government will \n     have no choice but to raise taxes to European welfare-state \n     levels or impose drastic restrictions on patient care. Or, \n     most likely, both.\n       To sum up, the Baucus-Obama plan would increase the cost of \n     insurance and then force people to buy it, requiring \n     subsidies. Those subsidies would be paid for by taxes that \n     make health care and thus insurance even more expensive, \n     requiring even more subsidies and still higher taxes. It's a \n     recipe to ruin health care and bankrupt the country, and \n     that's even before liberal Democrats see Mr. Baucus and raise \n     him, and then attempt to ram it all through the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9728-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9728-S9729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                         Sergeant William Cahir\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I rise to honor the exceptional life \nand service of SGT William Cahir of Alexandria, VA, who died last month \nwhile serving with the Fourth Civil Affairs Group in Afghanistan's \nHelmand Province. Sergeant Cahir was a patriot, wholly committed to the \nvalues and principles of the United States. We will remember Bill Cahir \nfor his courage, his generosity of spirit, and his commitment to the \nvery best ideals of this country.\n  In the last 8 years since 9/11, our homeland has not been attacked. \nFor this, we owe deep gratitude to brave men and women like Sergeant \nBill Cahir who made the heroic commitment to defend our liberty and \nsecurity. In the aftermath of the horrific attacks of September 11, \n2001, Sgt. Cahir left his job as a journalist and enlisted in the U.S. \nMarine Corps Reserves. At 34 years old, he was certainly not the \nyoungest reserve officer, but he ranked among the most skilled and \neffective. I would like to include in the record a tribute to Sergeant \nCahir written by Dan Gerstein who worked with me here in the Senate for \nyears; Dan's piece eloquently captures the tremendous service, \ncharacter, and spirit of Bill Cahir.\n  By all accounts, Sergeant Bill Cahir was a talented and loyal member \nof the Marine Corps. His fellow marines remember him as a man who would \nhave risked his life for anyone on their team and did on countless \noccasions. His positive attitude and commitment to the challenging job \nat hand inspired his colleagues, even in the most difficult of \ncircumstances. Bill Cahir was, without question, a force for good in \nthe country that he loved.\n  Sergeant Cahir served two tours in Iraq during some of the most \nchallenging periods of the war for U.S. forces. He was one among those \nbrave men and women who took part in the ``surge'' strategy in Anbar \nProvince in 2007. It was the courage and skill of marines like Sergeant \nCahir that helped transform the security situation in Iraq and put the \nU.S. mission there on the track toward success.\n  Each day, countless Americans offer their service so that we might \nenjoy freedom and security. It is our duty to remain dedicated to the \ncauses for which men and women like Sergeant Cahir have given their \nlast full measure of devotion--the cause of freedom, the cause of \nsecurity, and the cause of victory in our necessary war against terror.\n  We have lost a true patriot and a great American, but his life and \nservice will never fade from our memory. My condolences and prayers are \nwith Sergeant Cahir's wife, Rene Browne, and the entire Cahir family.\n\n[[Page S9729]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9729-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9729]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                           A REAL PATRIOT ACT\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \narticle titled ``A Real Patriot Act'' by Dan Gerstein be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From Forbes.com, Aug. 19, 2009]\n\n                 Dangerous Thoughts--A Real Patriot Act\n\n                           (By Dan Gerstein)\n\n       In this hothouse season of health care hollering, the most \n     popular rallying cry seems to be ``Read the bill!'' But I \n     would suggest that every politician--and, really, every \n     American--would be better off taking a break from the \n     accusations and acrimony of the moment to read about Bill. \n     That would be Marine Corps Sgt. Bill Cahir, who was killed in \n     action in Afghanistan last week, and whose immense sense of \n     service stands out as a one-man antidote to the cynicism and \n     selfishness that pervades our politics.\n       You almost have to read Bill's story to believe it. The son \n     of two civic-minded parents from outside State College, Pa., \n     Bill went to Washington right out of college to work on \n     Capitol Hill (where I met him about a dozen years ago). When \n     the partisanship and shallowness became too much to bear, he \n     opted for another form of public service, taking a job as a \n     reporter covering his home region of Pennsylvania from D.C. \n     But after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, something \n     gnawed at him. He did not feel right sitting on the \n     sidelines. His country had been attacked, as one friend told \n     me, and he felt the overriding need to do something about it.\n       So after a long internal struggle over how to heed this \n     calling, and fairly soon after meeting the woman he would \n     marry, Bill Cahir, at age 34, joined the Marine Corps \n     Reserves.\n       ``We all thought he was crazy,'' said another friend. So \n     did the Corps commanders. They were so incredulous that a 34-\n     year-old reporter would give up his cushy life for a sure \n     ticket to Iraq that they made him take a psychological test \n     to prove he was of sound mind. His drill instructors at \n     Parris Island were equally suspicious. They thought he was \n     there to write an expose, or that he might have a hero \n     complex. So they punished him with special fervor, trying to \n     break him. But they misjudged Bill.\n       ``People kept asking him, `You know what you're doing, \n     right?' '' one of the friends I interviewed said. ``But he \n     knew exactly what he was doing. He knew he was going to Iraq. \n     He not only knew it, he embraced it.''\n       And the Marines who served with Bill on his two tours in \n     Iraq, including a highly dangerous stretch in Fallujah and \n     the Anbar province as part of the ``surge'' strategy, \n     embraced him in return. None of them questioned his motives \n     (or that he once worked for Ted Kennedy).\n       ``All I know [is] that he loved his Marines and we loved \n     him,'' said Jason Brezler, Bill's team commander in Fallujah \n     in 2006 and 2007. ``I'm sure you've heard the whole notion \n     that it isn't necessarily the U.S. flag that calls Marines to \n     duty, but the love for their fellow Marines. I know that he \n     would have risked life and limb for any of us on the team, \n     because I watched him do it on countless occasions. And I \n     know that the relationship was reciprocated by us in \n     return.''\n       ``What amazed me about Bill was his consistent positive \n     attitude,'' said Maj. Dan Whisnant, a former company \n     commander in the 24th Marines. ``Bill and I spent hours \n     talking to Sheiks, children and the locals, and his sense of \n     service to these people was infectious. He personally was \n     going to create a better life for these folks. I remember him \n     playing with one of the Sheiks' young sons, and you could \n     sense that the two had connected. Bill's sense of service, \n     attitude and example to the younger Marines was something to \n     behold.''\n       Brezler noted that Bill's maturity was also a tremendous \n     asset to their unit's mission. ``Bill was a smart and \n     compassionate warrior. There were instances where he could \n     have employed his weapon against a group of kids who had \n     attacked our convoy with grenades, but he exercised \n     tremendous discipline and did not engage them, because he \n     knew that the second- and third-order effects outweighed the \n     immediate results.'' Brezler says he often tells this story \n     when explaining effective counterinsurgency. ``Many \n     Americans--and even some in uniform--just don't get it,'' he \n     said.\n       That was vintage Bill. He always did things the right way. \n     A colleague of his at the Lehigh Valley Express-Times, Tony \n     Rhodin, wrote that his favorite memory of Bill was from \n     election night 2000, when Bill came down from Washington to \n     help cover the campaigns on the ground. While everyone was \n     riveted by the unresolved presidential race, Bill was still \n     working the phones at 5 a.m., trying to get the latest \n     results of an equally close congressional contest in the \n     area. ``He was here. There was news. It was the right thing \n     to do.''\n       So was running for Congress. When Bill returned from his \n     second tour in 2007, he could have easily returned to \n     journalism and settled down with his wife, Rene, to start a \n     family. But he still burned to serve. He decided to go back \n     to his hometown region and compete for the Democratic \n     nomination in the Fifth District. His heroism in Iraq and his \n     family's deep roots in the community were well-known to \n     voters. But Bill was still concerned about being labeled a \n     carpetbagger. To show his commitment to the community, he \n     bought a home there. ``This is important,'' he said to \n     friends.\n       So too was going to Afghanistan in March with his unit, the \n     Fourth Civil Affairs Group. After losing the congressional \n     primary last fall, Bill went to work as a consultant. When he \n     got called up again by the Marines, he could have avoided \n     going to a hot spot. Instead, he sought it out. ``This is \n     what I signed up to do,'' he explained in an e-mail he sent \n     out to his disbelieving friends.\n       I read about Bill last Friday, the day after he was killed \n     by enemy fire in the Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold \n     and the site of some of the heaviest fighting in Afghanistan, \n     less than a week before the country's national election. It \n     hit me in a deeply personal, visceral way. Bill was one of \n     the most decent, genuine people I had ever known in \n     Washington, and I remember speaking with him last summer \n     about his campaign. I was crushed to hear that his wife was \n     pregnant with twin girls, and that they would never get to \n     know their honor-defining father.\n       But more than that, it made me truly realize, in a way that \n     only the death of a friend and peer can, just how much we in \n     politics take for granted the men and women who fight our \n     wars for us. Not all of us, and certainly not all the time. \n     But unless you have lost someone close to you, our recent \n     military actions--especially the ``forgotten war'' in \n     Afghanistan that took Bill's life--rarely and barely touch \n     us. They are at best debate subjects, and at worst political \n     footballs.\n       It also made me think about how the word ``patriotism'' has \n     been demeaned and cheapened by blind partisans on both sides \n     questioning their opponents' ``American-ness.'' Perhaps if \n     our leaders read about Bill, and learned more about what love \n     of country really means from his example, they would think \n     twice before casually hurling these hurtful accusations \n     again.\n       Fortunately, word about Bill's remarkable story is \n     spreading--he was the subject of a moving segment on Hardball \n     Monday. And his family and friends have paid tribute to his \n     memory by setting up a memorial fund to help assist his wife \n     and their twins.\n       I heard from many of Bill's loved ones (some of them mutual \n     friends, some of whom I had never met) in preparing this \n     tribute, and none of them could fully explain where his \n     overwhelming commitment to service came from. Bill was not \n     one to toot his own horn. ``He would probably be embarrassed \n     by all this attention and being called a hero,'' one friend \n     told me.\n       But while they may not have understood its source, they \n     more than appreciated his impact, the lives he saved and the \n     lives he touched. Perhaps the most fitting elegy came from \n     Bill's brother Bart. ``I won't offer any anecdotes,'' he \n     said, ``but rather a quote that I think summarized his life \n     from Ben Franklin: `If you would not be forgotten as soon as \n     you are gone, either write things worth reading or do things \n     worth writing.' My view is that my brother did both.'' Semper \n     fi, indeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9729-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9729-S9730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              25TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE AAO--CODE OF ETHICS\n\n  Mr. KOHL. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate the American \nAcademy of Ophthalmology as this year marks the 25th anniversary of \ntheir groundbreaking ethics code. One of the first of its kind in the \nmedical world, the Academy Code of Ethics represents a milestone. This \nself-initiated code of ethics paved the way and set the standard for \nnumerous other codes of conduct within professional medical \norganizations. Since the code's inception in 1983, the academy's Ethics \nCommittee has reviewed over 3,500 inquiries about ethical behavior and \nconcerns about member conduct.\n  The American Academy of Ophthalmology is the largest national \nmembership association of ophthalmologists, with 430 in Wisconsin \nalone. Its members are committed to advancing the highest standards of \ncomprehensive eye care and are dedicated to enhancing the quality of \nlife for every patient they serve. The academy uses its code of ethics, \na consensus of the members' views on the ethical issues encountered in \nophthalmology, to do just that.\n  I would also like to note the AAO's commitment to educating its \nmembers about unintended influence from the drug industry that can \nresult from the acceptance of excessive gifts and payments. Since 1991, \nits Ethics Committee has encouraged its members to disclose potential \nconflicts to patients, the public, and colleagues. AAO's internal \npolicies on this matter, which have been continually updated through \nthe years, are very much in line with the Physician Payments Sunshine \nAct, S. 301, of which I am a lead sponsor.\n  Because so many complex ethical dilemmas affect nearly every facet of \nour\n\n[[Page S9730]]\n\nhealth system, the fact that the academy was one of the very first \norganizations in professional health care to develop an ethical code is \ntruly commendable. Therefore, I once again express my congratulations \nto the American Academy of Ophthalmology on the 25th anniversary of \ntheir code of ethics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9730-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9730]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                       REMEMBERING IRVING KRISTOL\n\n Mr. LIEBERMAN. Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to the \nexceptional life, character, and work of Irving Kristol. Irving was an \ninventive entrepreneur of ideas who was boundless in his wit, \ncreativity, and insight. Though we have lost an intellectual giant, we \nwill continue to cherish and learn from Irving Kristol's rich legacy \nfor years to come.\n  Irving understood that ideas have consequences--and his immense \ninfluence was the result of his unique ability to shape the American \npolitical landscape with the power of creative thought. He harnessed \nthis power most impressively in his writing, editing, and publishing. \nBeginning in 1942 when he cofounded his first magazine--Enquiry: A \nJournal of Independent Radical Thought--this began a tradition of \nlaunching small magazines with immense influence. He became \ninstrumental in opinion journals like Commentary, Encounter, the New \nLeader, the National Interest, and, of course, the Public Interest, \nwhich he founded with Daniel Bell. Though these publications did not \nenjoy large numbers of subscriptions, Irving Kristol valued the quality \nof his readership over the quantity and maintained that he could change \nthe world with a circulation of a few hundred. And he did.\n  He lived the life of the creative mind and inspired many aspiring \nthinkers and writers to join him in this pursuit. One among them, the \nnoted scholar James Q. Wilson, wrote that ``Irving Kristol not only \nhelped changed the country, he changed lives. He certainly changed \nmine.'' Irving inspired in many Americans a desire for honest inquiry \nand a healthy dose of skepticism that humbled and better prepared us to \naccept the immense difficulty of making useful changes in public \npolicy.\n  Though he was a force in intellectual circles around the world, \nIrving was also a champion for the well-being of ordinary Americans. \nHis mission as a neoconservative, he once said, was to ``explain to the \nAmerican people why they are right, and to the intellectuals why they \nare wrong.'' Irving was a genuine patriot who served bravely in the \nSecond World War and eloquently and forcefully defended America's \nvalues and principles. It came as no surprise to me that President \nGeorge W. Bush awarded Irving Kristol the nation's highest civilian \nhonor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 2002.\n  Hadassah and I offer our condolences and prayers to Irving's wife \nGertrude, his children, Bill and Elizabeth, and the entire Kristol \nfamily.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9730-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9730-S9731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO FRANK M. MCDONOUGH\n\n Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize a man \nfrom New Jersey who, through his leadership and commitment to service, \nhas given much back to the country and to his community. This month \nFrank McDonough is retiring as president of the New York Shipping \nAssociation where his leadership will be sorely missed. Frank still \nspeaks with a native, no-nonsense Boston accent, but he is--through and \nthrough--a New Jerseyan at heart and in spirit. He has had three \naccomplished careers. His first was with the U.S. Marines where he \nspent 21 proud and glorious years. He enlisted in 1957 and rose to the \nrank of major in 1976. Major McDonough served in Vietnam in combat and \ncombat service support units. In 1968, during the siege at Khe Sanh, he \nwas communications officer of the 1st Battalion, 13th Marines. He was \nappointed acting battery commander for Headquarters Battery until the \nheadquarters was lost to enemy rocket fire.\n  He served as communications officer for the 2nd Battalion 26th \nMarines and for the 1st Reconnaissance Battalion. He was company \ncommander of Echo Company, 2/26 and completed his tour as battalion \noperations officer under Marine legends COL ``Wild Bill'' Drumwright \nand LTC Bill Leftwich. In October, 1970, he was assigned to the United \nStates Army Signal Center and School at Fort Monmouth where he \ngraduated with honors and became the officer-in-charge of the Marine \ndetachment and a distinguished instructor in the officer school. Major \nMcDonough retired in 1978.\n  Frank McDonough's second career was in law. He completed his \nundergraduate degree magna cum laude at Boston University and then \nearned a juris doctorate in 1983. He returned to the Garden State and \njoined the Monmouth County Prosecutor's Office. Before long he became \ndirector of the Environmental Crimes Task Force. Then, as now, Frank \nMcDonough had a strong sense of environmental responsibility. Frank's \nparticular interest has been New Jersey's coastal environment.\n  In 1986 he entered private practice. He was a member of the bar in \nNew Jersey and the District of Columbia and was admitted to practice \nbefore the Third Circuit Court of Appeals and the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Frank McDonough's third career got its start courtesy of Governor \nChristine Todd Whitman. Governor Whitman knew that Frank was the right \nperson to help the State through a developing crisis that threatened \nthe larger bistate region served by the Port of New York/New Jersey. \nThe Governor appointed him to the dredged materials management team \nthat was formed to resolve the ``mudlock,'' as the New York Times \ndescribed the unprecedented dredging crisis. Early in my service as a \nMember of Congress I also focused efforts to find dredged material \nmanagement solutions that would enable navigation dredging to resume.\n  In 1995 Governor Whitman appointed Frank McDonough the State's first \nexecutive director of maritime resources. He worked with me and others \nto help arrive at workable solutions. Resolution was achieved by 1996 \nwith the help of the Clinton White House and the active involvement of \nVice President Al Gore.\n  Frank McDonough must have liked the challenges of the port world \nbecause that is where he made his third career. In 2000, he retired \nfrom the State and was appointed executive director of the advocacy \norganization, Nation'sPort, and served as a visiting professor and \nadvisory board member of the Center for Maritime Systems at Stevens \nInstitute of Technology.\n  In 2001, Frank was elected president of the New York Shipping \nAssociation, the position from which he is now retiring. He has been \nthe principal advocate for the marine terminal operators and steamship \nlines that call on the Port of New York/New Jersey, the third largest \nin the country. He has been responsible for negotiating and managing \nthe labor contracts, comanaging the various welfare and pension \nprograms, and hiring, training and dispatching the workers.\n  Frank McDonough's watch at the port has been a dynamic and \nchallenging period. Cargo experienced double digit growth for much of \nthat time until last year when the trade market fell as the global \neconomy went into recession. During this period the port has been at \nthe forefront of port security initiatives in response to a more \ndangerous world and new Federal mandates developed to combat it. \nFrank's role has included serving as vice chairman of the New York \nHarbor Area Maritime Security Committee.\n  Throughout this tumultuous time, Frank McDonough has been a steady \nfigure on the business side of the port. He led his member companies to \nundertake important initiatives to reduce the port's environmental \nimprint even as cargo flow increased. He worked to reduce the port's \ndependency on trucking and increase the use of congestion-relieving \nrail and marine transportation for moving cargo between points in the \nU.S.\n  Frank McDonough's contributions to his community and State's natural \nresources are a matter of record, including serving as president of the \nNew Jersey Jaycees, president of the Monmouth-Ocean Development \nCouncil, founding president of the Friends of the Monmouth County \nParks, and trustee of the New Jersey Marine Sciences Consortium. He \nalso has been chairman of the New Jersey Tidelands Resource Council \nwhere he has served for 14 years under five Governors.\n  Frank and his wife Rita have lived in Monmouth County, NJ. They have \nfour\n\n[[Page S9731]]\n\nsons and six grandchildren. I extend my sincere congratulations and \nthanks to Frank McDonough for making his State of New Jersey a better \nplace to live and work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9731-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    REMEMBERING RONALD EUGENE RAIKES\n\n Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to \na good friend who touched the lives of many Nebraskans. Ronald Eugene \nRaikes of Lincoln passed away tragically at the age of 66 after a \nfarming accident on September 5, 2009, at his farm in Saunders County, \nNE.\n  As Nebraska's Governor, I had the honor of appointing Ron to my home \nState's unique one-house legislature in 1997 to finish the term of the \nlate Senator Jerome Warner. I chose Ron for this legislative seat \nbecause he was a brilliant and dedicated individual, and because he \nshared many other of the wonderful qualities of Senator Warner who was \na storied lawmaker in his own right. The choice turned out to be \ninspired, as Ron quickly won the respect of his fellow state senators.\n  Ron served in the Nebraska Unicameral as the representative from \nDistrict 25 in southeast Lincoln. He was elected to two 4-year terms \nbefore retiring in 2008 due to term limits. As chair of the \nLegislature's Education Committee, he was a tireless advocate for \nchildren and helped develop a number of major initiatives aimed at \naddressing the needs of minority and underprivileged youth.\n  The life of Ronald Eugene Raikes, both in public and private, was one \nfilled with quiet dignity and integrity. He always said that our aim, \nwhether as elected officials or individuals, should be to make a \ncontribution. Ron succeeded in that endeavor and, as such, is sorely \nmissed by his fellow Nebraskans. Our hearts go out to his wife Helen; \nhis children Heather, Abbie and Justin; his brother Jeff; and his \nsisters Ann, Susan and Mary Jo, as well as all those who knew and \nworked with him. The life of Senator Ron Raikes leaves behind a legacy \nin Nebraska for many generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9731-2", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO THE HEATWOLE FAMILY\n\n Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I am a proud member of the \nCongressional Coalition on Adoption Institute, and each year I \nparticipate in the Angel of Adoption program to recognize a family, \ncaseworker, or judge who works in my State to promote adoptions and \npermanency for vulnerable children.\n  Throughout my career in the U.S. Senate, I have worked hard on \nFederal legislation to promote adoptions and permanency, and to invest \nin the child welfare system to improve our care and services. I am \ntruly motivated by the families and dedicated professionals I meet \nthanks to the Angels in Adoption event.\n  This year, I was proud to accept the nomination of the West Virginia \nChildren's Home Society of the family of Dawn and Dave Heatwole as the \n2009 West Virginia Angel in Adoption.\n  This award is used to recognize those who reach out to vulnerable \nchildren and provide them with a safe and loving home. David and Dawn \nhave an amazing story that has touched the lives of so many needy \nchildren, and I would like to share their story with you now.\n  Dawn and David had been married several years when they were told \nthat it was unlikely they would be able to have children. Rather than \nbecoming discouraged, the couple decided that they would like to adopt \na young boy from Russia who they had found out about through their \nchurch. While waiting for the lengthy international adoption process to \ngo through, Dawn and David decided to become foster parents.\n  In April 2005 the Heatwoles undertook the challenge of caring for a \n7- month-old boy with serious medical problems. Less than a year later \nthe child was placed on a donor list because he required a liver \ntransplant. As his condition continued to worsen, Dawn's sister \nvolunteered to be tested and proved to be an appropriate donor match. \nThe surgery was successful and their adopted son, Adam, is now a \nhealthy 4 year old.\n  Shortly after bringing Adam into their home, David and Dawn took in \nanother infant foster child, Ethan. Nine months later they welcomed \nEthan's brother Asa into their growing family. In January of 2007, the \nHeatwoles were able to adopt Pasha from Russia, and they did not stop \nthere. In May of 2008, they also accepted Adam's sister as another \nprecious child in their home.\n  Over the past 5 years, the Heatwoles have provided a safe and loving \nenvironment for nine children. They have opened their home to children \nin need, and have fought to ensure that children are the top priority \nin the foster care system. Dawn and David have endured the challenges \nthat accompany ailing and drug dependent infants, as well as the \nchallenge of helping a non-English speaking child adapt to a new \nculture.\n  Mr. President, I have been delighted to share the Heatwole family's \ntouching story with you. It is my firm belief that the people of West \nVirginia possess a great compassion to help those in need. The \nHeatwoles are an inspiration to us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9731-3", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9731]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:53 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House has \npassed the following bills, in which it requests the concurrence of the \nSenate:\n\n       H.R. 860.

A bill to require that household cleaning products and \nsimilar products bear labels that state completely and accurately all \nof the ingredients of such products, and for other purposes, to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, today I am introducing my second bill, \nthe Household Product Labeling Act. This legislation will enable \nconsumers to determine whether potentially harmful chemicals are \npresent in the household cleaning products they use every day. I want \nto first thank my colleague in the House, Representative Israel of New \nYork's 2nd District, for his leadership on this issue and for the \ntremendous work he put into helping to craft this bill.\n  In many households across the country, the entire family pitches in \non household cleaning chores. The effort is obviously intended to keep \neveryone healthy by cutting down on germs, bacteria, and mold. But \nunfortunately, many of the ingredients in commonly used cleaning \nproducts may be dangerous themselves. Current law requires that product \nlabels list immediately hazardous ingredients, but there is no labeling \nrequirement for ingredients that may cause harm over time.\n  Many chemicals contained in household products have been shown to \nproduce harmful health effects. Consumers have a right to know which of \nthese potentially harmful chemicals might be present in their kitchen \nand bathroom cupboards. This information is particularly important to \nfamilies with small children, who as we all know have more direct \ncontact with floors and household surfaces. This legislation simply \nmakes that information readily available to consumers, giving them the \nopportunity to make an informed choice about the chemicals they bring \ninto their homes.\n  How many times have you heard on the news or read in the paper about \na new drug or chemical that has been recently linked to health or \nenvironmental hazards? It happens all the time. An ingredient that a \ncompany claims is ``perfectly safe'' today could be reclassified as \n``dangerous'' tomorrow. And an ingredient that is safe for most people \ncould be a major irritant for a child with asthma. Eventually, I hope \nthat manufacturers will take pre-emptive action and eliminate \npotentially harmful chemicals from their products. In the meantime, \nthis legislation is a common sense step in the right direction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the ``Household Product Labeling \nAct'' and give consumers the right to shield their families from \npotentially harmful household products.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was orderd to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1697\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide grants to the States to improve high \nschools and raise graduation rates while ensuring rigorous standards, \nto develop and implement effective school models for struggling \nstudents and dropouts, and to improve State policies to raise \ngraduation rates, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today, along with Senators Reid, \nDodd, Murray, Reed, Brown, Casey, Merkley, and Franken, to introduce \nthe Graduation Promise Act of 2009, or GPA. This bill would create \nFederal-State-local partnerships to improve this nation's graduation \nrates, and to help transform our lowest-performing high schools.\n  Twenty years ago, the Nation's governors met with the first President \nBush in Charlottesville, Virginia, for a groundbreaking education \nsummit. They agreed to set high expectations for education for the \ncoming decade, including an increase in the national high school \ngraduation rate to 90 percent by the year 2000. Today, we are not even \nclose to achieving that goal.\n  Indeed, the Nation's high school graduation rate has stagnated at \naround 70 percent. Graduation rates for students of color are even \nlower. In my own home state of New Mexico, the graduation rate is only \n54 percent. Yet Federal education policy and funding have focused \nprimarily upon elementary and postsecondary education. Only about 8 \npercent of all Title I dollars go to high schools.\n  The economic cost of the high school dropout crisis is significant. \nAccording to the Alliance for Excellent Education, if the students who \ndropped out of the Class of 2009 had graduated, the nation's economy \nwould have benefited from nearly $335 billion in additional income over \nthe course of these students' lifetimes. Failing to address the \nnation's dropout crisis fails our students and our country because too \nfew young Americans are prepared to enter the workforce, which harms \nour economy and our standing in the world. If we don't improve our \ngraduation rates, we will lose our competitive edge.\n  But low graduation rates are only one broad indicator of the crisis \naffecting our Nation's high schools. Even if a student makes it to \ngraduation, only a third of all students who enter the 9th grade will \ngraduate with the skills and knowledge necessary to succeed in college \nor the modern workplace. They are not receiving the kind of quality \neducation that permits a seamless transition to a job or postsecondary \neducation.\n\n[[Page S9736]]\n\n  Fortunately, research is available to help us better understand the \nfactors behind low graduation rates and poor student performance in \nhigh school. We can use research-based tools to identify the high \nschools that are producing the majority of dropouts across the country. \nThese high schools, roughly 2,000 in all, or 15 percent of all high \nschools, have persistently low rates of grade promotion and graduation. \nIf you look at the typical senior class at one of these high schools, \nit will have decreased in size by at least 40 percent since these \nstudents entered the school 4 years earlier.\n  Research has also shed light on the specific risk factors that \npredict who will drop out of high school. We can identify future \ndropouts with a high degree of certainty by looking at such predictors \nas course failure, poor attendance, behavior problems, and retention in \nearlier grades. Students who enter high school significantly lagging \nbehind in their academics and who show clear signs of disengagement are \nlikely to drop out unless additional supports are put in place.\n  Research-based solutions, with solid evidence of success, are \ntransforming high schools with low graduation rates. Restructuring \nschools into smaller, more personalized learning environments ensures \nthat students become engaged from the time they enter 9th grade. \nSustained efforts to boost attendance ensure that they don't fall \nfurther behind. Partnerships with community-based and education \norganizations help facilitate successful school transformations.\n\n  Schools that have combined these efforts with high-quality curriculum \nand instructional improvements have been successful in improving \nstudent achievement and increasing graduation rates: transitional math \nand English to 9th graders helps them catch up; challenging curricula \nand tangible, contextual applications of learning rekindle their \ninterest; and teaching teams and professional development targeted to \nthe needs of the school bolster teachers' effectiveness in identifying, \nmanaging, and engaging students at risk of dropping out. In \ncombination, these interventions are proven to improve student \nachievement and increase graduation rates.\n  In essence, we know which schools have the highest dropout rates; we \nknow the risk factors that predict to a high degree of certainty which \nstudents will drop out; and we know which sets of interventions work to \nturn around failing schools and failing students. The task before us is \nto partner with states and local school districts to enhance and expand \nthese efforts. By appropriately extending its education focus to \ninclude the needs of students in middle and high schools, the Federal \nGovernment can move the nation from ``no child left behind'' to ``every \nstudent a graduate.''\n  To meet this critical goal, I am introducing, along with my \ncolleagues Senators Reid, Dodd, Murray, Reed, Brown, Casey, Merkley, \nand Franken, the Graduation Promise Act of 2009.\n  The Graduation Promise Act will help build state and local capacity \nfor secondary school improvement by providing states and local school \ndistricts with resources to identify and target high schools with the \ngreatest needs. GPA recognizes that high school reform needs to start \nwith experts on the ground--in the states and local districts where \nstruggling high schools exist.\n  It also recognizes that reform efforts must be targeted to address \nthe unique challenges each school faces in raising achievement and \ngraduation levels. As such, GPA would provide resources to states to \nestablish differentiated high school improvement systems and ensure \nthat locally-driven school improvement actions are based upon the \namount and type of supports necessary to turn such schools around.\n  In order to be eligible to receive funds to implement these school \nimprovement plans, local school districts would work with the school \nimprovement teams to assess the capacity of the high school to \nimplement the plan, as well as identify the existing resources \navailable to the district and the school. These assessments would be \nused to determine the amount of resources and technical assistance \nneeded to successfully implement the high school improvement plan.\n  GPA also emphasizes transparency and accountability. Both state \napplications and local school improvement plans would be subject to a \nrigorous peer-review process. Schools needing targeted interventions, \nwhole school reform, or replacement would be required to meet \nmeasurable and meaningful benchmarks of improvement.\n  The cost of raising student performance and graduation rates at our \nchronically underperforming high schools is considerable, yet it is a \nnecessary investment in our Nation's future economic strength. The \nGraduation Promise Act authorizes $2.5 billion per year to meet this \nchallenge, with the bulk of funding directed to states and local school \ndistricts to help turn around the high schools with the lowest student \nachievement and lowest graduation rates.\n  I submit that we cannot afford to let struggling high schools \ncontinue to push students off the path to prosperity. We must ensure \nthe continued prosperity of our country by promising each high school \nstudent a chance to gain the skills and knowledge necessary to pursue \ntheir dreams and succeed.\n  I want to thank my Senate cosponsors for their commitment to \nimproving high schools and increasing graduation rates in this country, \nand I am pleased to be working with them and other Senate colleagues on \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1698\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS.\n\n       The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) About a third of our Nation's high school students fail \n     to graduate in 4 years, and another third graduate without \n     the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in college or the \n     workplace. The outcomes for minority students are even worse: \n     only 50 percent of American Indian, 51 percent of Black, and \n     about 55 percent of Hispanic students graduate on time, \n     compared to 76 percent of white students.\n       (2) Approximately half of the Nation's dropouts attend a \n     school where 40 percent or more of the freshman class has \n     dropped out by the time the students reach their senior year. \n     These schools, which are located in nearly every State, \n     disproportionately serve minority and poor students, and have \n     fewer resources and less qualified teachers than schools in \n     more affluent neighborhoods. Almost half of African American \n     students and nearly 40 percent of Latino students--compared \n     to only 11 percent of white students--attend high schools in \n     which graduation is not the norm.\n       (3) A high school diploma is increasingly important for \n     success in the 21st century economy. In fact, nearly 90 \n     percent of the fastest-growing, highest-paying jobs require \n     some sort of education beyond high school.\n       (4) For decades, Federal funding has largely been spent on \n     prekindergarten through grade 6 education and higher \n     education, with dramatically less given the middle and high \n     school grades. While children in their early years must build \n     a strong foundation for learning, research also clearly \n     demonstrates the need to continue the investment at each \n     stage of the education process or risk losing much of the \n     benefit of the early effort.\n       (5) High schools receive only 10 percent of funds under \n     title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 \n     (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.), leaving millions of title I \n     eligible, high school students in low-performing schools \n     without the focused support, external assistance, and \n     resources for improvement that title I was created to \n     provide. Because title I funds serve as the trigger for \n     school improvement requirements in the Elementary and \n     Secondary Education Act of 1965, this also means that most \n     low-income, low-performing high schools are not required to \n     (or supported to) implement school improvement activities.\n       (6) While the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of \n     1965 (20 U.S.C. 6301 et seq.) includes a strong focus on \n     identifying low-performing schools, America still needs a \n     comprehensive strategy to support and improve chronically \n     low-performing schools and local educational agencies. School \n     improvement strategies should be tailored based on a variety \n     of indicators and data, so that educators can create and \n     implement successful school improvement strategies to address \n     the needs of the individual schools.\n       (7) Most local educational agencies and State educational \n     agencies do not necessarily have the capacity or \n     infrastructure to guide, support, and fund school improvement \n     strategies where they are needed, but good models for turning \n     around low-performing high schools do exist. Federal support \n     should be used to build this capacity based on evidence from \n     successful high schools.\n       (8) If the Nation is to maintain and increase its \n     competitiveness in the global economy, it must invest in a \n     systemic approach to improving its high schools so that every \n     child graduates from high school prepared for success.\n\n     SEC. 102.

AUTHORIZATION OF APPROPRIATIONS.\n\n       There is authorized to be appropriated to carry out this \n     title $60,000,000 for fiscal year 2011 and each of the 4 \n     succeeding fiscal years.\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today with my friend Senator \nBingaman, a longtime champion on the issue of dropout prevention and \nimproving graduation rates, to introduce the Graduation Promise Act--\ncomprehensive legislation to help improve graduation rates in this \ncountry and transform some of our lowest performing high schools. I am \nso pleased to be joined by Senators Dodd, Murray, Reed, Brown, Casey, \nMerkley, and Franken in introducing this legislation.\n  During the August recess, I was honored to welcome the Education \nSecretary, Arne Duncan, to Nevada. We held a meeting with education \nleaders, teachers, students, parents, and other stakeholders from \nacross Nevada to discuss the issue of dropout prevention and turning \naround low performing schools.\n  In his remarks, Secretary Duncan said something that really put the \nissue of high school dropouts in perspective. Four years ago, he said, \nthere were 36,000 ninth graders in Nevada. Last year, that same class \nof students, was down to 22,000 twelfth graders. Where, Secretary \nDuncan asked, did those other 14,000 students go?\n  Keeping those 14,000 Nevada students in school and on track to \ngraduate from high school is why I have joined Senator Bingaman and my \ncolleagues in this effort.\n  Of course this issue is not just a problem in Nevada; it is a \nnationwide crisis. Nearly one in three high school students in the U.S. \nfail to graduate. For African-American and Latino students, less than \n50 percent complete high school on time. In total, approximately 1.3 \nmillion students drop out each year--that is more than 7,000 a day. For \nthose that do graduate, fewer than half are fully prepared for college \nor the workforce.\n  These statistics confirm that millions of young Americans are being \nrobbed of their best chances to succeed.\n  The social and economic implications of the dropout crisis are severe \nand lasting. Let me illustrate with data from Nevada's class of 2008--\nthe 14,000 Nevada students that Secretary Duncan referred to--those who \nstarted school with the class of 2008 but did not graduate with their \npeers.\n  These students will cost the State's economy an estimated $5 billion \nin lost wages over the course of their lifetimes. They will earn an \naverage of almost $10,000 less each year compared to their classmates \nwho finished high school. They are also more likely to become parents \nbefore they are ready, become incarcerated, or need public assistance.\n  This fate is particularly true of students concentrated in those high \nschools where 60 percent or fewer of the entering freshmen actually \ngraduate as seniors 4 years later. Research shows that there are \ncurrently about 2,000 high schools across the Nation that collectively \nproduce almost half of America's dropouts. Year after year, students in \nthese schools fall further and further behind.\n  Where the United States once ranked at or near the top among \nindustrial democracies in high school graduation rates, today we are \n19th. In today's global economy, a high school diploma is the minimum \nqualification needed for jobs in the fastest-growing sectors. This \nsituation is not only economically untenable, it is morally \nunacceptable.\n  Tackling the dropout crisis requires a comprehensive solution. As \nthis is a nationwide problem, it requires a more robust role for the \nfederal government. Since the No Child Left Behind Act, federal support \nfor education has increased significantly. Yet despite these additional \nresources, less than 10 percent of federal education funding goes to \nour nation's high schools.\n  The legislation we introduce today would provide that needed support \nto struggling high schools across the country. The Graduation Promise \nAct would authorize $2.4 billion to create a ``High School Improvement \nand Dropout Reduction Fund'' in order to turn\n\n[[Page S9745]]\n\naround America's lowest performing high schools and ensure students \ngraduate from high school ready for college or a career. The fund would \nsupport states and school districts as they develop comprehensive high \nschool improvement systems.\n  In order to help those students who are most at risk of dropping out \nof school, federal resources would be directed to the lowest-performing \nschools. These resources would support proven school improvement \nactivities and strategies based on each school's needs.\n  Schools across Nevada are already implementing proven strategies in \nthe schools that need them the most--strategies like extending the \nschool day or year; dividing large urban schools into smaller, more \npersonal learning academies; expanding summer learning opportunities; \nor partnering schools with colleges and universities to allow high \nschool students to take and receive credit for college-level courses.\n  At Valley High School in Las Vegas, the school that recently hosted \nSecretary Duncan, strategies like extended learning time, weekend and \nafter-school enrichment, smaller learning communities, and magnet \nprograms, turned the school around and will most certainly help more \nstudents graduate on time and ready for college or the workforce.\n  In the Clark County Schools District in southern Nevada, some of the \nmost cutting-edge career and technical academies in the country have \nrecently opened. These programs--in engineering and design, medical \noccupations and media communications--have been recognized for helping \nto increase graduation rates.\n  In northern Nevada, the Washoe County School District has teamed up \nwith one of the local community colleges. The Truckee Meadows Community \nCollege High School now allows students to take a combination of \ncollege and high school courses, and they get credit on both levels. \nNot only do these students complete more challenging, college-level \ncoursework, but they are laying the groundwork for success in college \nand the workforce.\n  The bottom line is that all of these strategies keep students engaged \nand help prevent them from dropping out. The Graduation Promise Act \nwill allow schools to replicate these strategies so that all students \ncan achieve their full potential. I hope my colleagues will join me in \nsupporting this important bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Durbin, Mr. \n        Schumer, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. Brown, Mr. Casey, Mr. Whitehouse, \n        and Mr. Burris):\n  S. 1699.

A bill to require certain issuers to disclose payments to \nforeign governments for the commercial development of oil, natural gas, \nand minerals, to express the sense of Congress\n\n[[Page S9746]]\n\nthat the President should disclose any payment relating to the \ncommercial development of oil, natural gas, and minerals on Federal \nland, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs.\n  Mr. LUGAR. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Energy Security \nThrough Transparency Act of 2009 on behalf of myself, Senator Cardin, \nSenator Schumer, Senator Wicker, and Senator Feingold. The Energy \nSecurity Through Transparency, ESTT, bill takes important steps towards \nreversing the resource curse by revealing payments made here and abroad \nto governments for oil, gas and minerals.\n  The Energy Security Through Transparency Act builds on the findings \nof a Senate Foreign Relations Committee staff report entitled the \n``Petroleum and Poverty Paradox: Assessing U.S. and International \nCommunity Efforts to Fight the Resource Curse'' which noted that many \nresource-rich countries that should be well-off are, in fact, terribly \npoor. History shows that oil, gas reserves and minerals frequently can \nbe a bane, not a blessing, for poor countries, leading to corruption, \nwasteful spending, military adventurism, and instability. Too often, \noil money intended for a nation's poor lines the pockets of the rich, \nor is squandered on showcase projects instead of productive \ninvestments.\n  A classic case is Nigeria, the eighth-largest oil exporter. Despite \nhalf a trillion dollars in revenues since the 1960s, poverty has \nincreased, corruption is rife, and violence roils the oil-rich Niger \nDelta.\n  The ``resource curse'' affects us as well as producing countries. It \nexacerbates global poverty which can be a seedbed for terrorism, it \nempowers autocrats and dictators, and it can crimp world petroleum \nsupplies by breeding instability.\n  ESTT expresses the Sense of Congress that the administration should \nundertake to become an `implementing' country of the Extractive \nIndustry Transparency Initiative, EITI. EITI is a major international \ntransparency effort which sets a global framework for companies to \npublish what they pay and for governments to disclose what they \nreceive. EITI's revenue data is intended to provide citizens with basic \nbut crucial information necessary to effectively monitor government \nstewardship of natural resource revenues; hold decision-makers \naccountable for the use of public funds; and signal investors that a \ngiven country offers a transparent, rule of law-based business \nenvironment. The Bush administration supported the EITI through its \nparticipation on the board through the initiative's critical first \nseveral years.\n  As an implementing country, the U.S. would commit to disclosing \npayments from companies for oil, gas and minerals extracted from \nfederal lands. Norway has recently signed up to become an implementing \ncountry, along with thirty developing countries. The U.S. commitment to \nimplementing EITI would add to our current commitment to EITI as a \nsupporting country. This bill would ensure that not only was the U.S. \npromoting EITI with other countries, but that we were benefitting from \nthe structured transparency here at home.\n  This bill commits the Department of Interior to disclosing extractive \npayments received for resources derived from federal lands. In a letter \nI received from Secretary Salazar on June 19, 2009, he wrote that ``the \nDepartment of the Interior is in agreement with the goals set forth in \nthe EITI especially concerning transparency in the management of \nextraction of minerals from Federal Lands.'' He went on to add that \n``the DOI is committed to an ongoing effort to improve the quality of \nour services by taking accountability for our actions and fulfilling \nour commitments to the public and all our customers in an open, \ntransparent manner.''\n  ESTT requires companies listed on U.S. stock exchanges to disclose in \ntheir regular SEC filings their extractive payments to foreign \ngovernments for oil, gas and mining which builds on the EITI \nrequirement that all extractive companies operating in an EITI \nimplementing country must report their payments to the government. This \nwould allow investors to better evaluate the potential country risk \nfaced by companies. It would also allow people to have information \nabout the funds sent to their governments in non-EITI implementing \ncountries.\n  An issue has been raised over whether this would impose a burdensome \nreporting requirement on the companies and whether the payments made by \ncompanies to extractive countries are relevant to investors looking \ninto finances of those companies. This bill would not require the \ncompanies to collect any new information, but to report publically \nfinancial figures they already maintain. Many oil companies who work in \nEITI countries already file this information in the form required by \nEITI. It is expected that the SEC will follow the reporting \nrequirements established under EITI, which were developed in \nconjunction with the oil industry. The legislation also gives the SEC \nsome discretion, which should ensure ease of compliance. Regarding \nmateriality, many analysts say that among the root causes of the \ncurrent financial crisis were a failure by investors to have access to \nsufficient information about their investments, and an excessive \nreliance on the judgments of the ratings agencies, which proved to be \nhighly faulty. That experience argues strongly for more disclosure and \ninformation. Considering the well-established link between oil payments \nand the business climate, many investors might be interested in this \ninformation--particularly socially responsible investors.\n  This legislation also encourages the President to work with members \nof the G-8, G-20, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and \nDevelopment and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation to promote \nsimilar disclosure through their exchanges and jurisdictions. As \nSecretary Clinton noted in her questions for the record on January 12, \n2009, ``President-Elect Obama has put a high priority on promoting \ntransparency in government more broadly. I look forward to working with \nthe President-Elect and the Treasury Department to promote greater \ntransparency at the G-8 and now G-20 as well.''\n  In developing this legislation, my staff consulted with the Security \nand Exchange Commission, the Treasury Department, the Interior \nDepartment, energy companies, mining companies, the industry \nrepresentatives, and non-governmental organizations.\n  When financial markets see stable economic growth and political \norganization in resource rich countries, supplies are more reliable and \nrisk premiums factored into process at the gas pump are diminished. \nInformation is critical to maintaining healthy economies and of healthy \npolitical systems. I ask for your support on passage of this bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1700\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Energy Security Through \n     Transparency Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) It is in the interest of the United States to promote \n     good governance in the extractive industries sector because \n     good governance strengthens the national security and foreign \n     policy of the United States, contributes to a better \n     investment climate for businesses in the United States, \n     increases the reliability of commodity supplies upon which \n     businesses and people in the United States rely, and promotes \n     greater energy security.\n       (2) Developing countries that derive a significant portion \n     of revenues from natural resource extraction tend to have \n     higher poverty rates, weaker governance, higher rates of \n     conflict, and poorer development records than countries that \n     do not rely on resource revenues. The consequences of what is \n     known as the ``resource curse'' including the erosion of \n     civil society, a rise in internal conflicts and regional \n     violence, and the proliferation of terrorism are likely to \n     pose a long-term threat to the national security, foreign \n     policy, and economic interests of the United States.\n       (3) Transparency in revenue payments to governments enables \n     citizens to hold their leaders more accountable.\n       (4) There is a growing consensus among oil, gas, and mining \n     companies that transparency in revenue payments is good for \n     business, since it improves the business climate in which \n     they work and fosters good governance and accountability.\n       (5) Transparency in revenue payments benefits shareholders \n     of corporations that make\n\n[[Page S9747]]\n\n     such payments because such shareholders have a desire to know \n     the amount of such payments in order to assess financial \n     risk, compare payments from country to country, and assess \n     whether such payments help to create a more stable investment \n     climate. Undisclosed payments may be perceived as corrupt and \n     as decreasing the value of the corporation.\n\n     SEC. 3. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO TRANSPARENCY FOR \n                   EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the President should work with foreign governments, \n     including members of the Group of 8 and the Group of 20, to \n     establish domestic requirements that companies under the \n     jurisdiction of each government publicly disclose any \n     payments made to a government relating to the commercial \n     development of oil, natural gas, and minerals; and\n       (2) the United States Government should commit to global \n     leadership of transparency in extractive industries by \n     supporting--\n       (A) multilateral pro-transparency efforts, such as the \n     Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, in revenue \n     collection, budgeting, expenditure, and wealth management;\n       (B) bilateral efforts to promote good governance in the \n     extractive industries through United States missions and \n     activities abroad;\n       (C) the implementation of extractive industries reporting \n     requirements for companies under the jurisdiction of the \n     United States similar to the requirements established under \n     section 6 of this Act; and\n       (D) efforts to persuade other members of the Organization \n     for Economic Cooperation and Development and Asia-Pacific \n     Economic Cooperation to adopt uniform legislation to ensure a \n     coordinated regulatory approach.\n\n     SEC. 4. SENSE OF CONGRESS RELATING TO THE EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY \n                   TRANSPARENCY INITIATIVE.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the President should \n     commit the United States to become a Candidate Country of the \n     Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative.\n\n     SEC. 5. DISCLOSURE OF PAYMENTS TO THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       The Secretary of the Interior shall disclose to the public \n     any payment (as that term is defined in section 13(m) of the \n     Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78m(m)), as added \n     by section 6 of this Act) relating to the commercial \n     development of oil, natural gas, and minerals on Federal land \n     made by any person to the Federal Government.\n\n     SEC. 6. DISCLOSURE OF PAYMENTS BY RESOURCE EXTRACTION \n                   ISSUERS.\n\n       Section 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 \n     U.S.C. 78m) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(m) Disclosure of Payment by Resource Extraction \n     Issuers.--\n       ``(1) Definitions.--In this subsection--\n       ``(A) the term `commercial development of oil, natural gas, \n     or minerals' includes the acquisition of a license, \n     exploration, extraction, processing, export, and other \n     significant actions relating to oil, natural gas, or \n     minerals, as determined by the Commission;\n       ``(B) the term `foreign government' means a foreign \n     government, an officer or employee of a foreign government, \n     an agent of a foreign government, a company owned by a \n     foreign government, or a person who will provide a personal \n     benefit to an officer of a government if that person receives \n     a payment, as determined by the Commission;\n       ``(C) the term `payment'--\n       ``(i) means a payment that is--\n\n       ``(I) made to further the commercial development of oil, \n     natural gas, or minerals; and\n       ``(II) not de minimis; and\n\n       ``(ii) includes taxes, royalties, fees, licenses, \n     production entitlements, bonuses, and other material \n     benefits, as determined by the Commission; and\n       ``(D) the term `resource extraction issuer' means an issuer \n     that--\n       ``(i) is required to file an annual report with the \n     Commission; and\n       ``(ii) engages in the commercial development of oil, \n     natural gas, or minerals.\n       ``(2) Disclosure.--\n       ``(A) Information required.--Not later than 270 days after \n     the date of enactment of the Energy Security Through \n     Transparency Act of 2009, the Commission shall issue final \n     rules that require each resource extraction issuer to include \n     in the annual report of the resource extraction issuer \n     information relating to any payment made by the resource \n     extraction issuer, a subsidiary or partner of the resource \n     extraction issuer, or an entity under the control of the \n     resource extraction issuer to a foreign government for the \n     purpose of the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or \n     minerals, including--\n       ``(i) the type and total amount of such payments made for \n     each project of the resource extraction issuer relating to \n     the commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals; \n     and\n       ``(ii) the type and total amount of such payments made to \n     each foreign government.\n       ``(B) International transparency efforts.--To the extent \n     practicable, the rules issued under subparagraph (A) shall \n     support the commitment of the United States Government to \n     international transparency promotion efforts relating to the \n     commercial development of oil, natural gas, or minerals.\n       ``(C) Effective date.--With respect to each resource \n     extraction issuer, the final rules issued under subparagraph \n     (A) shall take effect on the date on which the resource \n     extraction issuer is required to submit an annual report \n     relating to the fiscal year of the resource extraction issuer \n     that ends not earlier than 1 year after the date on which the \n     Commission issues final rules under subparagraph (A).\n       ``(3) Public availability of information.--\n       ``(A) In general.--To the extent practicable, the \n     Commission shall make available online, to the public, a \n     compilation of the information required to be submitted under \n     the rules issued under paragraph (2)(A).\n       ``(B) Other information.--Nothing in this paragraph shall \n     require the Commission to make available online information \n     other than the information required to be submitted under the \n     rules issued under paragraph (2)(A).\n       ``(4) Authorization of appropriations.--There are \n     authorized to be appropriated to the Commission such sums as \n     may be necessary to carry out this subsection.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL of Colorado (for himself and Mr. Risch):\n  S. 1702. A bill to amend the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration \nAct to facilitate the establishment of additional or expanded public \ntarget ranges in certain states; to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing the \nTarget Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act. I am introducing \nthis bill with the support of Senator Risch, and I thank my colleague \nfor joining me in this bipartisan effort.\n  This bill would provide funding flexibility to the States to help \nconstruct and maintain needed shooting ranges--safe and designated \nareas where people can sharpen their marksmanship and enjoy \nrecreational shooting.\n  For a variety of reasons, the number of places where people can \nsafely engage in recreational shooting and target practicing has \nsteadily dwindled. This includes areas on our national public lands. In \nan effort to establish, maintain and promote safe and established areas \nfor such activities, this legislation would allow States to allocate a \ngreater proportion of their Federal wildlife funds for these purposes.\n  Currently, states are allocated funds for a variety of wildlife \npurposes under the Pittman-Robertson Act. This Act, which established a \n10 percent excise tax on sporting equipment and ammunition, distributes \nthese funds to States for specific purposes. One of these purposes \nincludes hunter safety programs and the development and maintenance of \nshooting ranges. However, the Act currently contains certain \nlimitations on the use of these funds for the purpose of shooting \nranges.\n  The Target Practice and Marksmanship Training Support Act would amend \nthe Pittman-Robertson Act by adjusting the funding limitations so that \nStates have more funds available for the creation and maintenance of \nshooting ranges. Specifically, the bill would do a number of things.\n  First, it would authorize States to charge up to 90 percent instead \nof the current 75 percent of the costs for acquiring land for, \nexpanding, or constructing a public target range on Federal or non-\nfederal land to its allotted Pittman-Robertson allocations, and \ntherefore States would only need to find 10 percent match, as opposed \nto 25 percent.\n  Second, it would allow the Pittman-Robertson funds allotted to a \nState to remain available for 5 fiscal years, instead of the current 1 \nfiscal year, for use in acquiring land for, expanding, or constructing \na public target range on Federal or non-federal land.\n  Third, it would limit the liability exposure to the Federal land \nagencies, the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management, \nregarding the use of Federal land for target practice or marksmanship \ntraining.\n  Fourth, it would encourage the Federal land agencies, the Forest \nService and the Bureau of Land Management, to cooperate with State and \nlocal authorities to maintain target ranges on Federal land so as to \nencourage their continued use.\n  To be clear, the bill would not allocate any new funding to the \nconstruction of shooting ranges, it would not raise any fees or taxes, \nnor would it require States to apply their allocated Pittman-Robertson \nfunds to shooting ranges. Instead, by reducing the State matching \nrequirements--and allowing States to ``bank'' these funds for 5 years, \nthe bill allows States to use their Pittman-Robertson funds as they \nthink best while also allowing them to\n\n[[Page S9748]]\n\nextend their existing license fee revenue and other State generated \nfunds on other important programs, such as wildlife habitat.\n  I would like to thank the following groups who have expressed support \nfor this legislation: the National Rifle Association, the National \nGoverning Body for the Olympic Shooting Sports, the Colorado Firearms \nCoalition, the Colorado Wildlife Federation, the Colorado Backcountry \nHunters and Anglers, and the Rocky Mountain Bighorn Society.\n  I believe that hunting and recreational shooting are legitimate \nactivities--activities that also are appropriate where not prohibited \non our public lands. This bill is designed to maintain these activities \nin a save and convenient manner. It is my hope that the public lands \nagencies continue to work with the States, sportsmen and hunters, the \nrecreational shooting interests, nearby communities, and others so that \nthese opportunities are safe and available.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1702\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Target Practice and \n     Marksmanship Training Support Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS; PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1) the use of firearms for target practice and \n     marksmanship training activities on Federal land is allowed, \n     except to the extent specific portions of that land have been \n     closed to those activities;\n       (2) in recent years preceding the date of enactment of this \n     Act, portions of Federal land have been closed to target \n     practice and marksmanship training for many reasons;\n       (3) the availability of public target ranges on non-Federal \n     land has been declining for a variety of reasons, including \n     continued population growth and development near former \n     ranges;\n       (4) providing opportunities for target practice and \n     marksmanship training at public target ranges on Federal and \n     non-Federal land can help--\n       (A) to promote enjoyment of shooting, recreational, and \n     hunting activities; and\n       (B) to ensure safe and convenient locations for those \n     activities;\n       (5) Federal law in effect on the date of enactment of this \n     Act, including the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife Restoration Act \n     (16 U.S.C. 669 et seq.), provides Federal support for \n     construction and expansion of public target ranges by making \n     available to States funds that can be used for construction, \n     operation, and maintenance of public target ranges; and\n       (6) it is in the public interest to provide increased \n     Federal support to facilitate the construction or expansion \n     of public target ranges.\n       (b) Purpose.--The purpose of this Act is to facilitate the \n     construction and expansion of public target ranges, including \n     ranges on Federal land managed by the Forest Service and the \n     Bureau of Land Management.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITION OF PUBLIC TARGET RANGE.\n\n       In this Act, the term ``public target range'' means a \n     specific location that--\n       (1) is identified by a governmental agency for recreational \n     shooting;\n       (2) is open to the public;\n       (3) may be supervised; and\n       (4) may accommodate rifle, pistol, or shotgun shooting.\n\n     SEC. 4. AMENDMENTS TO PITTMAN-ROBERTSON WILDLIFE RESTORATION \n                   ACT.\n\n       (a) Definitions.--Section 2 of the Pittman-Robertson \n     Wildlife Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669a) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (2) through (8) as \n     paragraphs (3) through (9), respectively; and\n       (2) by inserting after paragraph (1) the following:\n       ``(2) the term `public target range' means a specific \n     location that--\n       ``(A) is identified by a governmental agency for \n     recreational shooting;\n       ``(B) is open to the public;\n       ``(C) may be supervised; and\n       ``(D) may accommodate rifle, pistol, or shotgun \n     shooting;''.\n       (b) Expenditures for Management of Wildlife Areas and \n     Resources.--Section 8(b) of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife \n     Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669g(b)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``(b) Each State'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(b) Expenditures for Management of Wildlife Areas and \n     Resources.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided in paragraph (2), \n     each State'';\n       (2) in paragraph (1) (as so designated), by striking \n     ``construction, operation,'' and inserting ``operation'';\n       (3) in the second sentence, by striking ``The non-Federal \n     share'' and inserting the following:\n       ``(3) Non-federal share.--The non-Federal share'';\n       (4) in the third sentence, by striking ``The Secretary'' \n     and inserting the following:\n       ``(4) Regulations.--The Secretary''; and\n       (5) by inserting after paragraph (1) (as designated by \n     paragraph (1) of this subsection) the following:\n       ``(2) Exception.--Notwithstanding the limitation described \n     in paragraph (1), a State may pay up to 90 percent of the \n     cost of acquiring land for, expanding, or constructing a \n     public target range.''.\n       (c) Firearm and Bow Hunter Education and Safety Program \n     Grants.--Section 10 of the Pittman-Robertson Wildlife \n     Restoration Act (16 U.S.C. 669h-1) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a), by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Allocation of additional funds.--Of the amount \n     apportioned to a State for any fiscal year under section \n     4(b), the State may elect to allocate not more than 10 \n     percent, to be combined with the amount apportioned to the \n     State under paragraph (1) for that fiscal year, for acquiring \n     land for, expanding, or constructing a public target \n     range.'';\n       (2) by striking subsection (b) and inserting the following:\n       ``(b) Cost Sharing.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Except as provided by paragraph (2), the \n     Federal share of the cost of any activity carried out using a \n     grant under this section shall not exceed 75 percent of the \n     total cost of the activity.\n       ``(2) Public target range construction or expansion.--The \n     Federal share of the cost of acquiring land for, expanding, \n     or constructing a public target range in a State on Federal \n     or non-Federal land pursuant to this section or section 8(c) \n     shall not exceed 90 percent of the cost of the activity.''; \n     and\n       (3) in subsection (c)(1)--\n       (A) by striking ``Amounts made'' and inserting the \n     following:\n       ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), \n     amounts made''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(B) Exception.--Amounts provided for acquiring land for, \n     constructing, or expanding a public target range shall remain \n     available for expenditure and obligation during the 5-fiscal-\n     year period beginning on October 1 of the first fiscal year \n     for which the amounts are made available.''.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Mr. President, I have sought recognition today to submit \na resolution supporting the goals and ideals of a National Campus \nSafety Awareness Month. Educational institutions should be safe havens \nwhere we send our children to learn and grow without fear for their \nprotection and wellbeing, but unfortunately this is not always the \ncase. On April 5, 1986, in the early morning hours, Jeanne Clery, a 19-\nyear-old Lehigh University student was brutally raped and murdered in \nher dormitory room. This heinous crime in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania \nopened the nation's eyes to the true extent of crime on college and \nuniversity campuses.\n  When I was District Attorney of Philadelphia, I dealt with many \nincidents of campus crime and I learned firsthand of its severity. \nHowever, I believe that many would be surprised by the extent of the \nproblem. Colleges and universities have reported that from 2005 to \n2007, 117 murders, 10,563 forcible-sex offenses, 16,632 aggravated \nassaults, and 3,226 cases of arson have occurred on or around college \nand university campuses. Criminal experts estimate that between 20 and \n25 percent of female undergraduate students become victims of rape or \nattempted rape. And each year 13 percent of female students enrolled in \nan undergraduate program at a college or university are victims of \nstalking. Additionally, approximately 1,825 college and university \nstudents between the ages of 18 and 24 die each year from \nunintentional, alcohol-related injuries, including motor vehicle \naccidents.\n  Since their daughter's death, Connie Clery and her late husband \nHoward worked tirelessly in their daughter's memory to protect the \nlives of college students by warning them of these aforementioned \ndangers. They founded Security On Campus, Inc., a national nonprofit \nbased in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, which is dedicated to promoting \nsafety and security on college and university campuses. Security On \nCampus, Inc. has found that the beginning of each new school year can \nbe a dangerous time for students, especially for first-year students \nwho are in a new environment and on their own for the first time. For \nthis reason, Security On Campus, Inc. has designated September as \nNational Campus Safety Awareness Month.\n  Each September since 2005, Security On Campus, Inc. has partnered \nwith colleges and universities across the United States to offer \neducational programming on critical campus safety issues. In 2008, \nSecurity On Campus, Inc. partnered with more than 350 institutions \nacross the country, including 29 from Pennsylvania, to participate in \nNational Campus Safety Awareness Month during September. Campuses \noffered a wide array of safety programming throughout the month \ncovering everything from the most serious issues of sexual assault and \nthe risks of alcohol abuse to how to protect personal property from \nburglary. Additionally, Security On Campus, Inc. offers educational \nvideos on sexual assault, alcohol abuse, hazing and stalking that are \noften integrated into NCSAM programming. Other programming includes \nsafety carnivals set up in high pedestrian traffic areas like student \ncenters or cafeterias, door hangers with safety tips in residence \nhalls, residence hall floor programs, fire safety presentations, Fatal \nVision goggles for DUI's, and the Rape, Abuse & Incest National \nNetwork's Get Carded Day.\n  When the Clerys approached me shortly after their daughter's murder, \nI worked with them to develop the Crime Awareness and Campus Security \nAct of 1989, which became law in 1990. This Act was modified and \nincluded in the Higher Education Act of 1998, as the Jeanne Clery \nDisclosure of Campus Security Policy and Campus Crime Statistics Act. \nSince this legislation was enacted, the issue of campus crime has \nbecome a routine part of the college selection process, and crime \nstatistics are readily available on the internet so families can \ncompare colleges. It is clear that this legislation has had a positive \nimpact on college and university campus safety. In fact, the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice reported that between 1994 and 2004 there was a 9 \npercent drop in violent crime on campus and a 30 percent drop in \nproperty crime. However, it is important to remember that while the law \nhas significantly changed the landscape of campus security for the \nbetter, it is evident that more work remains to be done. That is why I \ncontinue to advocate for the goals of the National Campus Safety \nAwareness Month.\n  Throughout the past several years, I have worked together with the \nClerys, Security On Campus, Inc., and crime prevention professionals on \ncampus across the country to help raise much needed awareness about \nthese dangers. Thus, I urge my colleagues to join me in this effort by \nsupporting the goals and ideals of a National Campus Safety Awareness \nMonth.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/09/23/senate-section/article/S9749-1", "month": "09", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S9749]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 282--REMEMBERING THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF HURRICANE \n HUGO, WHICH STRUCK CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA ON SEPTEMBER 21 THROUGH \n                           SEPTEMBER 22, 1989\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM (for himself and Mr. DeMint) submitted the following \nresolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, the importance of the senior caregiving \ncommunity cannot be overstated. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, in \nthe United States, 35.9 million people are 65 years of age or older, \nwhich is 12.4 percent of the population. The U.S. Census Bureau also \nstates that with over 8,000 Americans turning 60 years old every day, \nthe number of people over the age of 65 is expected to more than double \nin the next 50 years to 86.7 million. Furthermore, the U.S. Census \nBureau estimates that the 85 and older population is projected to reach \n9.6 million in 2030 and double again to 20.9 million in 2050.\n  A report by Evercare, entitled Study of Caregivers in Decline: A \nClose-up Look at the Health Risk of Caring for a Loved One, explains \nthat in order to address the surging population of seniors who have \nsignificant needs for in-home care, the field of senior caregiving will \ncontinue to grow. Thus, while senior caregivers are playing an \nimportant role now, this profession will be even more important in the \nfuture.\n  The Dilenschneider Group, Inc., estimates that 25 percent of all \nseniors need some level of assistance to complete their daily \nactivities. Senior companions provide a wide range of services, such as \nmedication reminders, housekeeping, meal preparation, travel \nassistance, and general companionship. If we can keep seniors in their \nhomes, we accomplish a number of goals. We preserve the independence \nand dignity of our seniors. That alone is significant. But, it also \nsaves money in a health care system facing skyrocketing costs and soon-\nto-be insolvent programs. The longer a senior is able to provide for \nhis or her own care at home, the better.\n  Adequate in-home care has become even more vital with the increase of \ndementia in our elderly population. The Alzheimer's Association \nestimates that 4.5 million people in the U.S. have Alzheimer's today \nand that this number will increase to between 11.3 and 16 million by \n2050. The Alzheimer's Association further explains that 70 percent of \npeople with Alzheimer's and other dementias live at home. These \nindividuals can utilize in-home care provided by senior caregivers for \nassistance with their daily activities.\n  Senior caregiver services are a much preferred alternative for \nseniors who desire to maintain their independence.\n\n[[Page S9758]]\n\nThey also offer families peace of mind, knowing their loved one is \nbeing taken care of in a safe and affordable manner.\n  I am very pleased with the passage of my resolution to honor senior \ncaregivers and the private home care industry. According to The \nDilenschneider Group, Inc., an estimated 44 million adults in this \ncountry provide care to adult relatives or friends, and an estimated \n725,000 non-family, privately paid individuals are senior caregivers. \nThe Department of Labor estimates that in 2006, paid caregivers worked \na total of 835 million hours. I salute those who provide quality care \nfor so many Americans. I also salute the cooperative effort of both \nunpaid family caregivers and paid caregivers to serve the needs of \nseniors living in their own homes.\n  We need to examine Federal policy alternatives to make caregiving for \nseniors more accessible and more affordable for families. This \nresolution encourages the Secretary of Health and Human Services to \ncontinue working to educate aging Americans about the assistance \noptions available for seniors.\n  I thank the senior caregivers for their service to Americans \nthroughout this Nation, and I am pleased my colleagues agreed to \nsupport this resolution.\n  Mrs. FEINSTEIN.
