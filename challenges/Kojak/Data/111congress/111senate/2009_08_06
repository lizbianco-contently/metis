Under an \nagreement reached last night, seven amendments are in order prior to a \nvote on passage of the bill. Each amendment has up to 30 minutes of \ndebate prior to a vote.

We worked through some difficult \nthings yesterday to get to the point where we are today. I especially \nwish to express my appreciation to the Republican leader, Senator \nMcConnell, who had to work through some difficult issues on his side, \nas I did on mine. We spoke and met yesterday many times. Of\n\n[[Page S8892]]\n\ncourse, our most helpful staff was with us every step of the way--on \nour side, Lula Davis, and on McConnell's side, Dave Schiappa--and we \nappreciate very much their expertise in this area.\n\n\n                         Franken Maiden Speech\n\n  Finally, I wish to say briefly that our newest Senator, Al Franken, \ngave his maiden speech last night.

Here is a man who is a Harvard graduate, \nbest-selling author, and entertainer. Now he is a U.S. Senator, and the \npeople of Minnesota are so fortunate. If things work out as I think \nthey will, he will be presiding over the Senate when the historic vote \nis called today on the new Supreme Court Justice.\n\n\n                     Historian Retirement Reception\n\n  Madam President, Senate Historian Dick Baker will be retiring.

Madam President, this morning a funeral service will be \nheld in Sioux City, IA, for a 44-year-old woman who began working for \nthe people of Iowa in my office in January of 1988. Mary Jo Hoffman was \na loyal and trusted adviser to me and a beloved friend to my wife, \nBarbara, our family, and many of my Senate staff who served with her \nmore than a decade ago and still, in a sense, are serving with her \ntoday.\n  Always filled with purpose, Mary Jo spent the last 2 years 4 months \nfighting cancer with the tenacity, strength, and determination we all \nknew and loved about her. When Mary Jo set her mind to something, she \ndidn't let much get in her way. She was that way when I met her when \nshe was a bright young college student at the University of Northern \nIowa, my alma mater, and she was that way when she worked effectively \nto serve constituents, first as a legislative correspondent, then as \nscheduler and as a top aide in my Senate office, and later on when she \nworked for my political campaigns. I valued her judgment and \nappreciated her hard work and commitment to quality in every position \nshe held. Mary Jo also taught at night as a volunteer and earned a \nmaster's degree while working on Capitol Hill.\n  She reached out and gave to others in so many ways through her \nchurch, in her community, and even on the U.S. Air Force base in Greece \nwhere she lived for a short period of time with her husband while he \nwas serving. Someone in need had a friend in Mary Jo. She always got a \nlot done, and she did it in a way that was generous, spirited, and \ncommitted to ideals.\n  Mary Jo was a person of great faith. She provided leadership wherever \nshe went through worship and fellowship and with the example she set \nwith her own life. Mary Jo was a faithful witness for Christ and never \nmore so than the darkest hours and days of her last 2 years. She will \ncontinue to inspire those of us who were lucky enough to have her in \nour lives.\n  We all mourn Mary Jo's departure, and our heart goes out to her \nfamily, including her devoted husband, Brent, and mother, Karen. I know \nMary Jo's beautiful young children, Silas and Lydia, will miss her \nevery day. I pray that they find comfort in the honorable life lived by \ntheir mother and my dear friend Mary Jo. She served the people of Iowa \nand the Lord with distinction and humility. She left this world for the \nnext with courage and grace.\n  I wish to read one sentence from the Sioux City Journal which I think \nsums up her life: ``Her words were like thunder because her life was \nlike lightning.''\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the full text \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From Sioux City Journal, Aug. 4, 2009]\n\n                            Mary Jo Hoffman\n\n       Sioux City.--Mary Jo Hoffman, 44, passed on to heaven on \n     July 31, 2009, having lived life well and faithfully. She \n     leaves a timeless legacy of faith and love for family and \n     friends. Her words were like thunder because her life was \n     like lightning.\n       Memorial services will be 11 a.m. Thursday at Heartland \n     Community Baptist Church, 3601 Country Club Blvd., Sioux \n     City, with the Rev. Gene Stockton officiating. A luncheon \n     will follow the memorial service. Burial will be at a later \n     date in Arlington National Cemetery, Washington, D.C. \n     Visitation with the family will be 5 to 7 p.m. Wednesday at \n     Meyer Brothers Colonial Chapel. Condolences may be sent \n     online to www.meyerbroschapels.com.\n       Born in Centerville, Iowa, on April 5, 1965, Mary Jo was a \n     precocious student and musician, graduating as class \n     salutatorian from Chariton (Iowa) High School in 1983. She \n     adored her family and friends.\n       She received her bachelor of arts degree from the \n     University of Northern Iowa in 1987, graduating with high \n     honors. During a distinguished career, she put her faith in \n     action through teaching and public service. She worked on \n     Capitol Hill for many years, serving proudly on the staff of \n     Senator Chuck Grassley. She also earned a master of arts \n     degree from George Mason University in Arlington, Va.\n       While living in Virginia and attending First Baptist Church \n     of Alexandria, Mary Jo (Archibold) met and married Brent \n     Hoffman. She joined Brent on military assignments in Greece \n     and at the Pentagon. Their children, Silas and Lydia were \n     born in 2000 and 2002, and she promptly set all career plans \n     and ambitions aside. In 2004, they returned to their native \n     Iowa and Sioux City. Though she maintained interests in \n     fundraising and community service, she was a mother who put \n     her family's needs first and foremost. She enjoyed reading, \n     music, cooking, politics, knitting and most of all, visiting \n     with friends and family.\n       Though admired for her extraordinary achievements, she was \n     beloved for her faith and kindness. She accepted Christ as \n     her Savior and her faith in God was the driving purpose in \n     her life. Friends describe Mary Jo as a bright shining light \n     who lived a life pleasing to God. Her influence will not be \n     forgotten.\n       Survivors include her children, Silas and Lydia; her \n     husband, Brent; her parents, Ron and Karen Stein of Mason \n     City, Iowa; a sister, Malinda Hilzer of Des Moines; and many \n     other relatives, all of whom she loved and are left to \n     cherish her memory.\n       She was preceded in death by her father, D.W. Archibold; \n     and her grandparents.\n       A memorial has been established in the name of Mary Jo \n     Hoffman at Heartland Community Baptist Church.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8892-4", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ORDER OF PROCEDURE\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.

Madam President, the White House, the Congress, and the \nAmerican people are engaged in a stark debate over our Nation's health \ncare insurance system. A lot is at stake. We will make a choice in \n2009, and that choice will determine the health care system we have in \nour Nation for a long time to come.\n  Fifteen years have passed since we last attempted to pass health care \nreform. What we do now will be consequential for decades to come. It \nwill be a long time before the people of this country and their leaders \nwill return to this complex and contentious issue.\n  So let us carefully review the potential plans. We have a plan being \ndeveloped by the House of Representatives, we have a plan from the \nSenate HELP Committee, and a plan from the Finance Committee, we have \nthe bipartisan Wyden-Bennett plan, and then we have a plan I am going \nto spend a lot of time talking about, and that is the PHS plan.\n  In listening to my colleagues speak on the floor of the Senate, on \ntelevision, talk radio, in newspapers, and in private meetings, one \nthing is clear:\n\n[[Page S8893]]\n\nThey think the plan we end up with will be the PHS plan. They think a \ncombination of those who want no health care reform and those who like \nnone of the proposed plans will combine to kill all other plans. So \nwhat is the PHS plan? Our present health care system.\n  Let's look at what will happen to average Americans if we keep our \npresent health care system.\n  First, Americans' health care insurance costs will explode--and that \nis not an overstatement--explode. The average family in America can \nlook forward to premium costs for their health insurance of more than \n$24,000 a year by 2016. That is an 83-percent increase over the cost in \n2008. In my home State of Delaware, the costs will be even higher, with \nthe average premium for family coverage approaching $29,000. At that \namount, more than half of Delaware families would each have to spend \nhalf of their income on health insurance. This means families will be \nforced to either go without insurance or to buy less coverage and put \ntheir life savings at risk.\n  Second, personal bankruptcies for medical costs will soar. Today, \nbankruptcies involving medical bills account for more than 60 percent \nof U.S. personal bankruptcies, a rate 1\\1/2\\ times that of just 6 years \nago. Going forward under PHS, we can expect more families in \nbankruptcy.\n  Third, insured Americans will keep paying a hidden tax to help pay \nfor care for the uninsured. Under the PHS plan, doctors and hospitals \nwill charge insurers even greater amounts to recoup the costs to \nprovide services to the uninsured. Today, this hidden tax is estimated \nto be $1,100 per family per year. Under the PHS plan, it will most \nassuredly go up, raising the cost of health care for all Americans.\n  Fourth, Americans will continue to be denied coverage if they have \npreexisting conditions. Several weeks ago, I talked about four \nDelawareans who, because of preexisting conditions, could not find \ninsurance coverage. Others who could get coverage have to pay \nexorbitant premiums to cover conditions such as high cholesterol, \nhypertension, diabetes, and cancer. Unfortunately, those who get sick \nmay have their coverage dropped altogether. These problems, which \nthreaten the security of all families, will continue under the PHS \nplan.\n  Fifth, for too many workers, health insurance portability will still \nbe beyond reach. Too many Americans lose their insurance when they lose \ntheir jobs. Some can't afford their COBRA coverage, and others can't \nget another policy due to preexisting conditions. Even when they can \nfind a new policy, they often discover they can no longer see the same \ndoctor or use the same hospital.\n  As a result, too many Americans are stuck in their jobs, forgoing \ncareer advancement, just to keep their existing health plans.\n  Now let's look at what will happen to the American economy if we keep \nour present health care system.\n  First, our present health care system is bankrupting the Federal \nGovernment.\n  The biggest driving force behind our Federal deficit is the \nskyrocketing cost of Medicare and Medicaid. In 2008, government \nspending on Medicare and Medicaid took up more than one dollar out of \nevery five in our Federal budget.\n  The more we spend on health care, the less we have for other \ninvestments--for education, for our veterans, and for job-creating \ntechnologies, to name a few.\n  To pay those higher Federal health care bills, we will have to pay \nmore taxes or borrow more from China and other nations.\n  Controlling health care costs is the key to controlling our financial \nfuture. But under the PHS, health care costs continue to spiral out of \ncontrol.\n  Second, health care spending will crowd out our national savings and \nlower our standard of living.\n  Health care cost as a percent of gross domestic product will grow \nfrom 18 percent today to 28 percent in the year 2030--and even 34 \npercent in 2040.\n  Those dollars out of every family's budget going to health care \ncannot go for housing, food, or transportation. American consumers, \nover two-thirds of our economy, will have fewer dollars left for any \nother priorities.\n  That means less spending at the mall, at our car dealers, and at the \ngrocery store. Controlling health care costs will put money back in \nfamilies' budgets and therefore back into the rest of our economy.\n  Third, the present health care system is killing U.S. economic \ncompetitiveness.\n  Today, U.S. manufacturing firms pay almost $5,000 per worker per year \nin health costs.\n  That's more than twice the average cost for firms located in our \nmajor trading partners such as Europe and Japan, where a firm pays less \nthan $2,000 per worker each year.\n  In a global economy, our workers and corporations face competitors \nwho can beat them on price every time, just because of our broken \nhealth care system. Controlling health care costs will help to level \nthat playing field. In a fair fight, our workers and our businesses can \nwin.\n  Finally, more firms will stop offering health insurance for their \nemployees.\n  The PHS will continue the slow erosion of employer-sponsored \ninsurance. This is especially true for small businesses.\n  In the 2008 Employer Health Benefits Survey conducted by the Kaiser \nFamily Foundation, only 63 percent of companies of all sizes offered \nhealth insurance to their employees, down from 69 percent in 2000.\n  But these numbers are even lower when looking just at small \nbusinesses, with the National Small Business Association reporting that \nthat only 38 percent of small businesses provided coverage last year, \ncompared to 61 percent in 1993.\n  Under the PHS plan, this decline in coverage will continue, with an \nestimated 10 percent of small businesses eliminating coverage in the \nnext year and nearly 20 percent in the next 3 to 5 years.\n  Under the PHS plan, that would mean an additional 13 million added to \nthe rolls of the uninsured in the next 5 years.\n  So that is what America will get if we decide to choose the PHS plan. \nAgain, that is the present health care system.\n  If we choose the PHS plan, consumers will pay higher and higher \npremiums, including the hidden tax to help pay for all of our fellow \nAmericans without insurance.\n  We will continue to see a rise in personal bankruptcies due to high \nmedical costs. Americans will continue to face insurance coverage \nrejections based on preexisting conditions or have insurers drop their \npolicies once they do get sick. And they won't have portable insurance \nthat they can take from job to job.\n  If we choose the PHS plan, health care spending will continue to \nthreaten the bottom line of our Federal budget, eating away higher \npercentages of our GDP.\n  Our businesses will face more competitive disadvantages to their \nforeign competitors, paying more for health care insurance for their \nemployees, or dropping it altogether.\n  The present health care system mistreats Americans as individuals and \nserves the country badly as a whole. We cannot continue in the present \nhealth care system.\n  I hope my colleagues will return in September committed to replacing \nour present health care system. I hope they will spend August searching \nfor the best of the alternative plans that they want to support.\n  I hope we will turn our backs on the bankrupt present health care \nsystem and instead give the American people a health care system they \ncan all be proud of--a health care system that will sustain them into \nthe future.\n  We can do no less. They deserve no less.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee see is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER.

Madam President, we are concerned about the health \ncare reform legislation that we have seen in the House and here in the \nSenate. It is headed in the wrong direction. The\n\n[[Page S8894]]\n\nMayo Clinic has told us so. The Democratic Governors have told us so. \nThe CBO has told us so.\n  We are hearing already from people around the country who fear that \nmillions of people may lose their employer-based health insurance and \nmay find themselves in a government-run plan, with new State taxes to \npay for Medicaid.\n  My purpose is to point out that as we go back to our States in \nAugust, there is plenty of opportunity to go in a new direction. I hope \nwhen we come back, we will start over in that direction.\n  As an example yesterday, 12 Senators--7 Democrats and 5 Republicans--\nwrote an op-ed in the Washington Post about the Healthy Americans Act, \nthe bill that is sponsored by Senator Wyden, a Democrat, and Senator \nBennett, a Republican. I am a cosponsor among the 5 Republicans on that \nbill.\n  There are a number of things I agree with in the bill and some things \nwith which I don't agree. I agree it is the right framework upon which \nwe can build a bipartisan discussion. For example, the things I like \nabout the bill and the reason I endorse the effort is that it has been \nscored as budget neutral. In other words, it doesn't add to the \ndeficit, according to the CBO. It doesn't create a government-run plan \nto compete with private insurance plans. People would have choices \namong private plans just like most people have today. It replaces \nMedicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program with private \ninsurance plans. It doesn't replace all of Medicaid, but about 40 \nmillion of the people who are on Medicaid today, which is the largest \ngovernment-run program we have, would have a choice to buy plans like \nthe rest of us.\n  I think one of the worse things about the bills we are seeing is that \nit dumps low-income Americans into a government-run program that is \nfailing--Medicaid--that 40 percent of the doctors will not see, and \nthat none of us would want to join if we were forced to do so. This \nproposal takes away that problem. The Healthy Americans Act makes a \nfairer distribution of the government subsidies we already spend \nsubsidizing health care by giving more Americans a chance to benefit \nfrom that.\n  It would give more Americans a chance to purchase the same kind of \nhealth insurance policy Federal employees and Members of Congress have. \nIt provides a tax deduction for all American individuals and families \nto address the unfairness of our tax system. It includes an individual \nmandate. In other words, no free ride. We are all in this together. \nStates that implement some sort of reforms against junk runaway \nlawsuits against doctors, which drive up the cost of malpractice \ninsurance, will receive bonus payments.\n  It also includes some of the insurance market reforms about which we \nare hearing so much from our Democratic friends. What they don't tell \nyou is we are all for those changes. These are the insurance reforms \nthat say you will have a right to purchase insurance without a physical \nexamination, and if you have a problem when you go in to get the \ninsurance, you cannot be denied insurance for that reason. These are \ninsurance reforms that virtually all Republican plans I have seen, and \nall the Democratic plans, have already in there. Those aren't the \nissue.\n  It provides a full subsidy to people living under 100 percent of the \nFederal poverty level to buy insurance, a private plan. This would mean \nroughly $5,000 for an individual and $12,000 for families to buy a \nplan. Americans earning between 100 to 400 percent of the Federal \npoverty level will receive subsidies on a sliding scale. After that, \nyou pay for it yourself.\n  There are some points I don't like about the bill, but I endorse the \nframework, as well. I will mention those. I don't like the employer \nresponsibility provisions. During negotiations, if this were the bill \nwe were discussing, I would urge to change that. I don't like the fact \nthat plans are required to be at the higher benefit level of the \nFederal employee plans. That is a level higher than most Federal \nemployees have, and we can save dollars if we use the basic plan and \nuse that money to provide higher subsidies to middle-income Americans \nto buy health insurance. I don't believe the subsidies in this bill are \nenough for many middle-income families. I have suggested a place to get \nsome of that money.\n  We phase out the tax deduction at $62,500 a year, which may not be \nhigh enough to make this a fair proposal. I am concerned about the \nabortion provisions in the bill, although it doesn't provide government \nsubsidies for abortion.\n  The point is, there is a framework that is headed in a different \ndirection, and it has the support of 12 Senators.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the op-ed from the Washington Post be \nprinted in the Record following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, I also ask unanimous consent that an \narticle by Art Laffer in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal, which \nprovides yet another reasonable option for providing health care \nopportunities for Americans without adding to the deficit, be printed \nin the Record following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, there is a way to do this if we want \nto head in a different direction.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Aug. 5, 2009]\n\n              How We Can Achieve Bipartisan Health Reform\n\n                  (By Ron Wyden and Robert F. Bennett)\n\n       We refuse to let partisanship kill health reform--and we \n     are proof that it doesn't have to.\n       As 12 U.S. senators from both sides of the aisle who have \n     widely varying philosophies, we offer a concrete \n     demonstration that it is possible to find common ground and \n     pass real health reform this year. The process has been \n     rocky, and slower than many had hoped. But the reports of the \n     death of bipartisan health reform have been greatly \n     exaggerated. Now is the time to resuscitate it, before the \n     best opportunity in years is wasted.\n       Democratic activists have long campaigned for universal \n     coverage and quality benefits. Republican activists zero in \n     on empowering individuals and bringing market forces to the \n     health-care system. Our approach does both. In our \n     discussions on the Healthy Americans Act, each side gave a \n     bit on some of its visions of perfect health reform to \n     achieve bipartisanship.\n       The Democrats among us accepted an end to the tax-free \n     treatment of employer-sponsored health insurance; instead, \n     everyone--not just those who currently get insurance through \n     their employer--would get a generous standard deduction that \n     they would use to buy insurance--and keep the excess if they \n     buy a less expensive policy.\n       The Republicans agreed to require all individuals to have \n     coverage and to provide subsidies where necessary to ensure \n     that everyone can afford it. Most have agreed to require \n     employers to contribute to the system and to pay workers \n     wages equal to the amount the employer now contributes for \n     health care. The Congressional Budget Office has reported \n     that this framework is the only one thus far that bends the \n     health-care cost curve down and makes it possible for the new \n     system to pay for itself. It does this by creating a \n     competitive market for health insurance in which individuals \n     are empowered to choose the best values for their money and \n     by cutting administrative costs and spreading risk across \n     large groups of Americans.\n       First, we allow all Americans to have the same kind of \n     choices available to us as members of Congress. Today, more \n     than half of American workers who are lucky enough to have \n     employer-provided insurance have no choice of coverage. \n     Members of Congress who enroll their families in the Federal \n     Employees Health Benefits Program often have more than 10 \n     options. This means that if members of Congress aren't happy \n     with their family's insurance plan in 2009 or insurers raise \n     their rates, they can pick a better plan in 2010. Our plan \n     would give the consumer the same leverage in the health-care \n     marketplace by creating state-run insurance exchanges through \n     which they can select plans, including their existing \n     employer-sponsored plan.\n       Beyond giving Americans choices, our approach also ensures \n     that all Americans will be able to keep that choice. We \n     believe that at a time when millions of Americans are losing \n     their jobs, members of Congress must be able to promise their \n     constituents that ``when you leave your job or your job \n     leaves you, you can take your health care with you.'' Our \n     approach ensures seamless portability.\n       Our point is not that our framework is the only way to \n     reform the system or to reach consensus. But our effort has \n     shown that it is possible to put politics aside and reach \n     agreement on reforms that would improve the lives of all \n     Americans. Insisting on any\n\n[[Page S8895]]\n\n     particular fix is the enemy of good legislating. A package \n     that will entirely please neither side, but on which both can \n     agree, stands not only the strongest chance of passage but \n     also the best chance of gaining acceptance from the American \n     people.\n       We didn't undertake this effort because we thought it would \n     be easy; in fact, we started working together because we knew \n     it would be hard. Passing health reform is going to require \n     that we take a stand against the status quo and be willing to \n     challenge every interest group that is jealously guarding the \n     advantages it has under the current system, because health \n     reform isn't about protecting the current system or \n     preserving the advantages of a few. We can't forget that we \n     are working on life-and-death issues facing our constituents, \n     our families, our friends and our neighbors.\n       It's time to stop trying to figure out what pollsters say \n     the country wants to hear from us and focus on what the \n     country needs from us. The American people can't afford for \n     Congress to fail again.\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Aug. 5, 2009]\n\n                  How To Fix the Health-Care ``Wedge''\n\n                         (By Arthur B. Laffer)\n\n       President Barack Obama is correct when he says that \n     ``soaring health-care costs make our current course \n     unsustainable.'' Many Americans agree: 55% of respondents to \n     a recent CNN poll think the U.S. health-care system needs a \n     great deal of reform. Yet 70% of Americans are satisfied with \n     their current health-care arrangements, and for good reason--\n     they work.\n       Consumers are receiving quality medical care at little \n     direct cost to themselves. This creates runaway costs that \n     have to be addressed. But ill-advised reforms can make things \n     much worse.\n       An effective cure begins with an accurate diagnosis, which \n     is sorely lacking in most policy circles. The proposals \n     currently on offer fail to address the fundamental driver of \n     health-care costs: the health-care wedge.\n       The health-care wedge is an economic term that reflects the \n     difference between what health-care costs the specific \n     provider and what the patient actually pays. When health care \n     is subsidized, no one should be surprised that people demand \n     more of it and that the costs to produce it increase. Mr. \n     Obama's health-care plan does nothing to address the gap \n     between the price paid and the price received. Instead, it's \n     like a negative tax: Costs rise and people demand more than \n     they need.\n       To pay for the subsidy that the administration and Congress \n     propose, revenues have to come from somewhere. The Obama team \n     has come to the conclusion that we should tax small \n     businesses, large employers and the rich. That won't work \n     because the health-care recipients will lose their jobs as \n     businesses can no longer afford their employees and the \n     wealthy flee.\n       The bottom line is that when the government spends money on \n     health care, the patient does not. The patient is then \n     separated from the transaction in the sense that costs are no \n     longer his concern. And when the patient doesn't care about \n     costs, only those who want higher costs--like doctors and \n     drug companies--care.\n       Thus, health-care reform should be based on policies that \n     diminish the health-care wedge rather than increase it. Mr. \n     Obama's reform principles--a public health-insurance option, \n     mandated minimum coverage, mandated coverage of pre-existing \n     conditions, and required purchase of health insurance--only \n     increase the size of the wedge and thus health-care costs.\n       According to research I performed for the Texas Public \n     Policy Foundation, a $1 trillion increase in federal \n     government health subsidies will accelerate health-care \n     inflation, lead to continued growth in health-care \n     expenditures, and diminish our economic growth even further. \n     Despite these costs, some 3o million people will remain \n     uninsured.\n       Implementing Mr. Obama's reforms would literally be worse \n     than doing nothing.\n       The president's camp is quick to claim that his critics \n     have not offered a viable alternative and would prefer to do \n     nothing. But that argument couldn't be further from the \n     truth.\n       Rather than expanding the role of government in the health-\n     care market, Congress should implement a patient-centered \n     approach to health-care reform. A patient-centered approach \n     focuses on the patient-doctor relationship and empowers the \n     patient and the doctor to make effective and economical \n     choices.\n       A patient-centered health-care reform begins with \n     individual ownership of insurance policies and leverages \n     Health Savings Accounts, a low-premium, high-deductible \n     alternative to traditional insurance that includes a tax-\n     advantaged savings account. It allows people to purchase \n     insurance policies across state lines and reduces the number \n     of mandated benefits insurers are required to cover. It \n     reallocates the majority of Medicaid spending into a simple \n     voucher for low-income individuals to purchase their own \n     insurance. And it reduces the cost of medical procedures by \n     reforming tort liability laws.\n       By empowering patients and doctors to manage health-care \n     decisions, a patient-centered health-care reform will control \n     costs, improve health outcomes, and improve the overall \n     efficiency of the health-care system.\n       Congress needs to focus on reform that promotes what \n     Americans want most: immediate, measurable ways to make \n     health care more accessible and affordable without \n     jeopardizing quality, individual choice, or personalized \n     care.\n       Because Mr. Obama has incorrectly diagnosed the problems \n     with our health-care system, any reform based on his \n     priorities would worsen the current inefficiencies. Americans \n     would pay even more for lower quality and less access to \n     care. This doesn't sound like reform we can believe in.\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Illinois is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, how much time do we have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is 6 minutes 12 seconds \nremaining.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8895-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8895-S8896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CASH FOR CLUNKERS\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, later today, we are going to take up the \nCash for Clunkers Program. This is an idea whose time has come. When we \npassed this legislation a few weeks ago, I wasn't sure. I didn't know \nif this would work, if we put a dollar incentive in front of American \nbuyers and said: If you will bring in an old car or truck and trade it \nin on a new car or truck that is more fuel efficient, would you \nconsider it--I didn't know if they would. We are in a recession and \npeople don't have a lot of money.\n  Well, they not only considered it, they made it a wild success. In a \nmatter of just a few days, the $1 billion we set aside for the program \nled to dramatic increases in sales in auto showrooms in Illinois and \nall across the Nation. I got phone calls from dealers who said: Keep it \ncoming. Folks are finally coming into our showrooms and buying cars.\n  The good news is it is not only activity that is clearing the \ninventory in these dealerships, it also means we have more jobs. As we \nhave more of these cars being purchased, there is more demand to \nrebuild that inventory at the auto dealership, and we put auto workers \nback to work. Also, the good news is people are buying more fuel-\nefficient vehicles. Eighty-three percent of the vehicles being traded \nin are old trucks that are not fuel efficient. Most people--the \nmajority of them--are buying fuel-efficient cars, and that is a good \nchange. It means there will be less fuel use, less dependence on \nforeign oil, and less pollution. For those who buy it, it will be a car \nthey can operate more cheaply than the one they traded in.\n  We have a chance to extend this program today. It may be our last \nchance. A lot of amendments will be offered. Some may be good-faith \namendments to improve the bill, and I fear some may be mischievous. \nHere is the reality. Any amendment adopted today means this program \nwill be stopped in its tracks, and we will have to wait for the House \nto return in September. So for the next 4, 5, 6 weeks, nothing would \nhappen.\n  Let's not lose the momentum in the Cash for Clunkers Program. This \nprogram is helping to put life back into our economy, save and create \njobs, and get our automobile sector moving forward again. That is \nsomething we desperately need to come out of the recession--creating \njobs and getting back on our feet and be strong again. The Cash for \nClunkers Program has been a success. Let's continue it.\n\n\n                              Health Care\n\n  The second issue I have relates to health care. I heard my colleague \nfrom Tennessee come forward and suggest that he is working on an \nalternative to health care reform. I salute him for that, and I hope he \nwill continue that effort. I also salute the three Republican Senators \nwho have met for weeks, if not months, trying to hammer out the \ndifferences in health care reform. It is a constructive, positive \ndialog. I am sure I would not agree with everything they have come to \nagreement on, but that is not what this is about. It doesn't have to be \na bill that is perfect in my eyes; it has to be a bill that is \nreasonable, that will bring down the cost of health care.\n  I know what happened in Illinois. In 1997, health insurance premiums \nthrough employers averaged $5,462. Just 9 years later, that number was \n$11,781. If we do nothing, by 2016, it will more than double, to \n$25,409.\n  Those who come to the floor and to town meetings and say, ``Don't \ntouch it; all you can do is make a mess of it,''\n\n[[Page S8896]]\n\nignore the obvious. The current health care system is unsustainable for \nfamilies and for small businesses. Fewer and fewer businesses are \noffering health insurance protection. More people are finding \nthemselves without health insurance protection.\n  In fact, in Illinois 15 percent of the population has no insurance at \nall. During the course of any given year, one out of three Illinoisans \nhave no health insurance coverage at least some time during that year. \nThat is unacceptable. People without health insurance coverage are one \ndiagnosis or one accident away from bankruptcy. We know more and more \npeople are going into bankruptcy court because of health care and \nmedical bills they cannot pay. For those who stand here and say ``Don't \ntouch it; leave it alone,'' it is unsustainable. It is a system headed \ntoward disaster.\n  Who wants to keep the current health care system? It is the people \nwho are making the most money in the system, the health insurance \ncompanies. They have been profitable, when many other parts of the \neconomy have not. They are now sponsoring activities and advertisements \nand all sorts of things at town meetings to try to create resistance to \nchange in health care. That is not good. It is not a constructive \ndialog. To think that these town meetings that are supposed to take \nplace for a healthy, honest dialog back home have now turned into \npolitical theater. Some groups have Web sites that instruct people \nabout how to disrupt a town meeting and embarrass a Senator or \nCongressman. I know that when I go to town meetings, people may \ndisagree and be emotional, and that is OK. To think they have a \ncoordinated effort to disrupt a town meeting. Who wants that? That is \nnot constructive.\n  Let's move forward with an honest, constructive, bipartisan dialog. \nThree Republicans are doing that now. If we do that, we can reach a \nbipartisan compromise that I and the President would like to see by \nSeptember. Let us come back with resolve in September to make sure \nthere is real health care reform that brings stability to the costs \nthat businesses and Americans pay, stability to coverage so you don't \nlose your health insurance because of a preexisting condition, changing \na job, caps and limits on your policy, with quality access to \npreventive care, wellness care, and the quality care that every \nAmerican deserves.\n  We can do that with patient-centered health insurance reform, and we \ncan get it done in a bipartisan fashion in September when we return.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8896-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor, of New York, \nto be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the time \nuntil 2 p.m. will be equally divided in 1-hour alternating blocks of \ntime, with the Republicans controlling the first hour.\n  The Senator from South Carolina.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Madam President, I do want to talk about the President's \nnominee to the Supreme Court, but first I wish to give a couple of \ncomments in response to the Senator about health care because if the \nrecord be known to Americans, the preponderance of health reform \nlegislation that has been presented over the last 5 years in the Senate \nhas come from Republicans. The Democrats have consistently blocked any \nreform that would make health insurance more affordable and available \nto Americans. Their goal appears to be not patient-centered care but \ngovernment-controlled care.\n  If we look back a few years, the President, along with all the \nDemocrats, voted against interstate competition among insurance \ncompanies. It is hard to say they are not on the side of insurance \ncompanies when they vote to prevent a national market, a national \ncompetitive market that people all over the country could buy policies \nthat are more affordable and perhaps match their needs much better than \nthe ones they can get in their own States.\n  Today Americans can only buy health insurance in the States where \nthey live. That means a few insurance companies can dominate the \nmarket. This is something we have tried to change, we have introduced, \nand the President has voted against it.\n  We have also proposed tax fairness for Americans who do not get their \nhealth insurance at work. The other side seldom discusses the fact that \nwhen you get your insurance at work, you get pretty big tax breaks. The \ncompanies that provide that health insurance do not have to pay taxes \non it. They can deduct it. It is a business expense. And the employees \ndo not have to pay income tax on the benefits. It is an equivalent \nbenefit over $3,000.\n  The bills we Republicans have introduced will give health care \nvouchers to every American. Every family would get $5,000 a year to buy \nhealth insurance if they do not get their health insurance at work. \nEvery individual would get $2,000.\n  In addition, there would be some lawsuit abuse reform and some block \ngrants to States to make sure people who are uninsurable, who have \npreexisting conditions, can buy affordable insurance.\n  The Heritage Foundation says one of the Republican plans would have \n22 million Americans insured within 5 years. They are plans that work. \nBut, unfortunately, the other side will not even discuss plans that do \nnot have more government control involved with them.\n  What we can do is make what is working work better. We do not need to \nreplace it with what is not working. One of the reasons health \ninsurance is more expensive today--a third more expensive--is that the \ngovernment programs of Medicare and Medicaid do not pay their fair \nshare, and those costs are shifted on to employers and individuals who \nhave private insurance.\n  We do not need to expand the part that is broken in health care. We \ncertainly do not need to expand a cash-for-clunkers type of health care \nsystem for America.\n  I am here today to talk about the President's nominee to the Supreme \nCourt, Sonia Sotomayor. I commend my Republican colleagues, \nparticularly Senator Jeff Sessions, for conducting a very respectful \nand civil hearing process for the nominee. This is something we have \nnot seen in a number of years here. They were respectful toward her. \nEven those who disagree with her judicial philosophy showed courtesy \nand respect during the hearings, and it is something I very much \nappreciate.\n  Our goal through this process has not been to block this nomination \nand to stop her from going to the Supreme Court. The votes have never \nbeen there to do that. What we have been trying to show is a pattern by \nthe Obama administration and the Democratic majority of moving toward \nmore and more government control in all areas of our lives. We see it \nin the stimulus plan, that instead of leaving money in the private \nsector, we take it away and spend it on programs such as turtle tunnels \nand other kinds of wasteful spending all across the country--government \nspending.\n  We are trying to manage the private economy. We see it in cash for \nclunkers where we create an economic earmark for one sliver of our \neconomy. At the same time, in this health care legislation, we are \ntalking about adding taxes to the small businesses that create 70 \npercent of the jobs in this country.\n  We are benefiting a few at the expense of many. This is economic \ncentral planning. It is a concept that has failed throughout history. \nYet we are trying again.\n  What we see in the President's nominee to the Supreme Court is this \nbelief that our Constitution is inadequate, that we need to have judges \non our courts, Justices on the Supreme Court, who add to it.\n\n[[Page S8897]]\n\n  The President has said that our Constitution is a charter of negative \nliberties. It tells the government what it cannot do, but it does not \ntell us what we have to do. The whole point of the Constitution is to \nlimit what we can do. But the President considers it inadequate, and he \nis nominating people to the courts who will be activists, who will \nexpand what the Federal Government does and make arbitrary decisions \nrather than those based on the Constitution.\n  Unfortunately, I do rise today in opposition to the confirmation of \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court. I met with her \npersonally, and I watched the hearings. I believe she is a very smart \nand gracious person with an inspiring personal story. But I also found \nher evasive and contradictory in her answers.\n  On several issues ranging from judicial temperament to her infamous \n``wise Latina'' speeches, Judge Sotomayor experienced what we call \nconfirmation conversion on many of her issues and simply walked away \nfrom a lot of her past statements and positions.\n  Now seeing her willingness to tell us what we want to hear, neither \nher testimony nor her long record on the judicial bench can give the \nAmerican people any confidence that she will rule according to the \nclear language and intent of the Constitution.\n  Let me talk for a second about the Constitution versus precedent. I \nam very concerned with Judge Sotomayor's repeated efforts to deflect \nquestions by stating she relied on precedent to guide her decisions. I \nunderstand circuit court judges are guided and even bound by Supreme \nCourt precedent, but precedent is not the same thing as the \nConstitution, particularly on the Supreme Court. A judicial \nconfirmation process that puts the constitutional interpretation \noutside the bounds of discussion is a waste of time.\n  On issue after issue during her hearings, Judge Sotomayor, rather \nthan giving her own opinion, simply offered the opinions of many other \njudges. We have no idea what she thinks. In one sense, this is fitting. \nThe Congress routinely passes legislation that none of us reads or \nunderstands. So perhaps it is consistent for us to nominate and confirm \na Justice when we do not understand what she actually believes.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor may be very learned in constitutional law, but we \nrarely heard her actually mention the Constitution itself. This is a \nbig problem for our judiciary and our system of checks and balances.\n  In 1825, Thomas Jefferson said that the Federal judiciary was at \nfirst considered as the most harmless and helpless of all its organs. \nBut it has proved that the power of declaring what is law has allowed \nit to slyly, and without alarm, sap away the foundations of the \nConstitution.\n  What concerns me, as Jefferson observed, is that there are many \nconfusing and contradictory precedents that can be used by judges to \njustify whatever decision they want to make. Without the Constitution \nas the fixed standard, court decisions become very arbitrary, and we \nare ruled by the opinions of Justices rather than the rule of law.\n  When the law is unmoored from the Constitution, it becomes like the \nold schoolroom game of telephone. Some may remember it. One student \nsays something to her neighbor and on and on across the room until the \nsecret reaches the other side of the class. What do you know--the final \nmessage no longer even resembles the original. That is how precedent \nhas worked in our court system. Every time the Supreme Court bases a \ndecision on a precedent rather than on the underlying Constitution, the \noriginal intent of the Founders is lost and becomes distorted.\n  There is nothing stopping a determined judge from finding a precedent \nthat suits whatever they want to decide in any case before the Court. \nNor apparently is there anything that will stop Judge Sotomayor from \nunmooring her decisions, not only from the Constitution but from \nprecedent itself, as she did in the Ricci racial discrimination case \nand with regard to the fundamental right of citizens to own firearms.\n  In the Ricci case, she claimed she was following precedent, but her \nown colleagues on the circuit court refuted her claim.\n  On the second amendment, she disregarded the Supreme Court's Heller \ndecision and still refuses to acknowledge the right to bear arms for \nevery American, that it is a fundamental right.\n  Decisions such as these, understandably, undermine the credibility of \nour judicial system. Americans are led to suspect that some judges are \nmore interested in their particular outcomes rather than objectivity.\n  Let me conclude. Judge Sotomayor is obviously a talented jurist, but \nI believe her when she says that she chooses her words very carefully. \nAnd her words, both in her testimony and throughout her career, \nundermine her claims to objective and impartial justice.\n  I realize my view is the minority view here, and if Judge Sotomayor \nis confirmed, she will have my best wishes on a long and distinguished \ncareer. Given the available evidence, however, I cannot support her \nconfirmation, nor the judicial philosophy that she will carry with her \nto the Supreme Court.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, on Tuesday I explained some of the \nreasons I cannot support the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to \nreplace Justice David Souter, and I will mention a few others here \ntoday. These are important points. Her record simply creates too many \nconflicts with principles about the judiciary in which I deeply \nbelieve. I wish President Obama had chosen a Hispanic nominee whom all \nSenators could support.\n  During the debate this week, many of my Democratic friends have spent \ntime reading Judge Sotomayor's resume rather than reviewing her record. \nNearly every speaker on the other side has repeated the talking point \nthat she has more Federal judicial experience than any Supreme Court \nnominee in a century. I believe she does, and I respect her for it. But \nJustice Samuel Alito had only 1 less year of Federal judicial \nexperience and actually had 5 more years on the U.S. court of appeals \nwhen he was nominated. He, too, had been a prosecutor and he, too, had \nreceived a unanimous ``well qualified'' rating from the ABA. Yet 19 \ncurrent Democratic Senators voted to filibuster his nomination, \nincluding the current President, and 35 voted against confirmation.\n  Other Senators emphasize the importance of appointing someone with \nJudge Sotomayor's inspiring life story and ethnic heritage. Once again, \nI do not disagree. She has an inspiring life story and a great ethnic \nheritage. Yet she is being treated with far more dignity and respect \nthan was Miguel Estrada, a highly qualified Hispanic nominee with an \ninspiring life story, who everybody knows is one of the best attorneys \nin the country. The Senate, for example, will actually vote on Judge \nSotomayor's nomination today. In 2003, for the first time in American \nhistory, this body was prevented from voting at all on the Estrada \nnomination, even though he had majority support. Senators and \ngrassroots groups, including Hispanic organizations that today say a \ngood resume, rich life story, and ethnic heritage make a compelling \nconfirmation case for Judge Sotomayor, opposed even holding an up-or-\ndown vote for Mr. Estrada. The treatment of Miguel Estrada was unfair \nand disgraceful toward the nominee and damaging to the traditions and \npractice of this body.\n  My Democratic colleagues want people to believe the concerns about \nthe Sotomayor nomination are limited to one speech and one case. Some \nof them have said as much. At the same time, they say our review should \nbe limited to only certain parts of the nominee's record. As I have \ndone with past nominees, however, I examined Judge Sotomayor's entire \nrecord for insight into her judicial philosophy.\n  In addition to the controversial speeches I discussed on Tuesday, \nJudge Sotomayor gave a speech at Suffolk University Law School which \nwas later published in that school's law review.\n\n[[Page S8898]]\n\nShe embraced the idea that the law is indefinite, impermanent, and \nexperimental. She rejected what she called ``the public myth that law \ncan be certain and stable.'' She said that judges may, in their \ndecisions, develop novel approaches and legal frameworks that push the \nlaw in new directions.\n  Judge Sotomayor's speeches and articles, then, present something of a \nperfect judicial storm in which her views of judging meet her views of \nthe law. Combine partiality and subjectivity in judging with \nuncertainty and instability in the law, and the result is an activist \njudicial philosophy that I cannot support and that the American people \nreject.\n  My Democratic colleagues will no doubt quickly say Judge Sotomayor's \ncases do not reflect that judicial philosophy. But remember that \nappeals court judges are bound by Supreme Court precedent. On the \nSupreme Court, Justice Sotomayor will help fashion the precedents that \ntoday bind Judge Sotomayor. That makes the rest of her views--\nexpressed, I might add, while she has been a sitting judge--much more \nrelevant to her future on the Supreme Court than to her current \nposition on the appeals court.\n  Nonetheless, Judge Sotomayor has made plenty of troubling decisions \non the appeals court. On Tuesday, for example, I discussed the case of \nDidden v. Village of Port Chester, in which Judge Sotomayor refused to \ngive a man his day in court whose property was taken and given to a \ndeveloper. She came to the bizarre conclusion that Mr. Didden should \nhave sued before his property was even taken.\n  In Kelo v. City of New London, the Supreme Court held that general \neconomic development can constitute the public use that the fifth \namendment says justifies the taking of private property.\n  We hear a lot these days that judges should appreciate how their \ndecisions should affect people. When the Court in Kelo greatly expanded \nthe government's power to take private property, the San Francisco \nChronicle no less said that the decision might turn the American dream \nof home ownership on its head. And one Washington Post headline after \nthe decision read: ``Court Ruling Leaves Poor at Greatest Risk.'' This \ndecision was devastating not only for the right to private property in \ngeneral but for individual homeowners in particular.\n  The decision in Kelo was issued after the briefing and argument in \nDidden but before Judge Sotomayor had issued her decision. Even though \nKelo was a hallmark--or should I say landmark--decision that \ndramatically changed the law of takings, she did not ask for a \nrebriefing or a reargument. Instead, it took her more than a year to \nissue a cursory, four-paragraph opinion that not only made it easier \nfor the government to take property but also severely limited the \nability of property owners to challenge the taking of their property in \ncourt.\n  Other Senators and I have already discussed Judge Sotomayor's \ntroubling decisions regarding the second amendment right to keep and \nbear arms. She has applied the wrong legal standard to conclude that \nthe second amendment does not keep State and local government from \nrestricting the right to bear arms, and she has gratuitously held that \nthe right to bear arms is so insignificant that virtually any reason is \nsufficient to justify a weapons restriction. No Federal judge in \nAmerica has expressed a more narrow, cramped, and limited view of the \nright to bear arms.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle have made some creative \nattempts to downplay these troubling decisions. Perhaps the most \ncurious is the claim that the second amendment right to keep and bear \narms was created by the Supreme Court. On the other hand, I am baffled \nwhy this should bother those who believe in a flexible and shape-\nshifting Constitution. The Supreme Court, after all, makes up rights \nall the time--the right to abortion comes immediately to mind--without \na peep from most of my Democratic friends on the other side of the \naisle.\n  But the Senator who offered this strange theory should simply read \nthe Constitution. The right to keep and bear arms is right there, right \nin the Constitution, in black and white. Perhaps he is instead \nreferring to the Supreme Court's recognition last year that the right \nto bear arms is an individual rather than a collective right. Perhaps \nthat is why he believes the Supreme Court created these rights. But the \nsecond amendment said that the right to bear arms is the right of ``the \npeople.''\n  The fourth amendment says the same thing about the right against \nunreasonable searches and seizures. It, too, is a right ``of the \npeople.'' Does any Senator doubt that the fourth amendment protects an \nindividual right? Does a Senator who believes that the Supreme Court \nmade up the individual right to bear arms believe that the Supreme \nCourt made up the individual right to be free from unreasonable \ngovernment searches?\n  When I chaired the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution in \n1982, we published a report on the second amendment right to keep and \nbear arms. It thoroughly examined the long and rich history of this \nright, which predates the Constitution itself. Thus, anybody can see \nwhy I am very concerned about this. We went to the bother of really \nwriting about it back in 1982.\n  As the Supreme Court has recognized, it was a fundamental individual \nright of Englishmen at the time of America's founding, which the second \namendment merely codified. Justice Joseph Story, in his classic \n``Commentaries on the Constitution,'' called this right ``the palladium \nof the liberties of the republic.'' Our report showed definitively that \nthe right to bear arms is indeed both fundamental and individual. The \nSupreme Court may have taken a long time to recognize this \nconstitutional fact, but it made up nothing in doing so.\n  Madam President, I commend to my colleagues the subcommittee report \nto which I have referred.\n  Madam President, finally, let me describe one other matter which \narose during the hearing which I found very troubling. And before I say \nthat, 8 of the 10 cases of Judge Sotomayor, heard by the Supreme Court, \nwere reversed. On the ninth one, she was seriously criticized for her \napproach to the law, and that was a 5-to-4 decision. These are matters \nthat bother a lot of people. I have mentioned a whole raft of other \ncases and a whole raft of other issues in my prior remarks here, so I \nwill refer back to those remarks.\n  Prior to her judicial service, Judge Sotomayor was closely associated \nwith the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, a respected \ncivil rights organization. From 1980 to 1992, Judge Sotomayor held at \nleast 11 different leadership positions with the fund, including \nserving as a member of both its board of directors and executive \ncommittee and as both a member and chairman of its litigation \ncommittee. In a 1992 profile, the New York Times described Judge \nSotomayor as a top policymaker with the fund. Other articles and \nprofiles in the Times and Associated Press say that she met frequently \nwith the legal staff, reviewed the status of pending cases and briefed \nthe board about those cases, and was an involved and ardent supporter \nof the fund's legal efforts. These descriptions relied upon and quoted \nlawyers with whom she worked at the fund. Minutes from the fund's \nlitigation committee specifically describe Judge Sotomayor reviewing \nthe fund's litigation strategy and cases.\n  At the hearing, I asked Judge Sotomayor whether she had been aware of \nthe friend-of-the-court briefs--the amicus curiae briefs--that the fund \nfiled in several high-profile Supreme Court abortion cases. I just \nwanted to know what the truth was. I asked her about that because those \nbriefs made arguments that can only be described as extreme, even by \nsome who are in the pro-abortion movement. The fund, for example, \ncompared the previous refusal to pay for abortions with taxpayer \nMedicaid funds to oppression of Blacks symbolized by the Supreme \nCourt's infamous Dred Scott decision. The fund opposed any and all \nabortion restrictions, including laws requiring that parents be \ninformed before their young daughters have an abortion. The fund even \nargued that the first amendment right to freely exercise religion \nsomehow undermines parental notification laws.\n  When I asked Judge Sotomayor about these briefs and arguments, I made \nabsolutely clear in my prefaced remarks that I was asking only about \nwhether she knew about and agreed\n\n[[Page S8899]]\n\nwith them at the time the briefs were filed. I was not asking her even \nabout her current views, let alone any position or approach she might \ntake in the future. Judge Sotomayor told me that at the time she did \nnot know the fund was filing those briefs or making those arguments. At \ntimes, she used what appeared to be the prepared talking point that she \nhad not ``reviewed the briefs.''\n  But in answering my question, she went much further than that and \nsaid:\n\n       Obviously, [the Fund] was involved in litigation, so I knew \n     generally they were filing briefs. But I wouldn't know until \n     after the fact that the brief was actually filed.\n\n  To be clear, Judge Sotomayor said she never knew until after a brief \nhad already been filed what arguments were made in the brief or even \nthat it had been filed at all. I was shocked at this response and \nfrankly found this claim very difficult to believe. How can a leader at \na legal defense fund, who is actively working with the legal staff, \nsupervising the staff, directing some of the years, briefing a board \nabout pending cases, and an involved supporter of the fund's legal \nefforts, be completely out of the loop about the briefs it has filed \nand the arguments the fund is making? Did her discussions with the \nlegal team about the pending cases skip these high-profile Supreme \nCourt cases? I have to tell you, I doubt it. Did she brief the board \nabout everything but these abortion briefs? I doubt it.\n  The six abortion cases in which the Fund filed briefs were among the \nmost visible cases on the Supreme Court docket. The 1989 case of \nWebster v. Reproductive Health Services, for example, attracted a \nrecord 78 different friend-of-the-court briefs, evidence that it was \none of the most anticipated cases in decades. Virtually everyone in the \npublic interest legal world, especially at civil rights groups, had it \nat the top of their watch list. And yet Judge Sotomayor would have us \nbelieve that, despite her leadership positions and active involvement \nwith the Fund's cases and legal strategy, she was completely unaware \nthat the Fund filed a brief in Webster until after the fact. In other \nwords, she knew no more than an outsider reading the newspaper about \nthe Fund's briefs and arguments in high-profile Supreme Court cases \nabout hot-button social issues. I find that simply implausible.\n  When I met with Hispanic leaders and groups during the confirmation \nprocess, their common message was that Senators should treat Judge \nSotomayor seriously and respectfully. I believe we have done that. But \nthey also insisted that our confirmation decision should be based on \nthe merits, not on race. It was disturbing to hear, therefore, that \nsome of these same groups appeared yesterday with the chairman of the \nDemocratic Senatorial Campaign Committee warning about political \nrepercussions of voting against a Hispanic nominee. I ask unanimous \nconsent that a column published yesterday in Politico by former Florida \nHouse Speaker Marco Rubio addressing this issue be printed in the \nRecord following my remarks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is or \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Let me once again return to where I began. One of America's oldest \nstate constitutions opens by asserting what it identifies as essential \nand unquestionable rights and principles. In their charter, the people \nof Rhode Island State:\n\n       In the words of the Father of his Country, we declare that \n     the basis of our political system is the right of the people \n     to make and alter their constitutions of government; but that \n     the constitution which at any time exists, till changed by an \n     explicit and authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly \n     obligatory upon all.\n       The Constitution belongs to the people. The people \n     established it, and only the people can change it. This \n     essential and unquestionable principle would be a farce if \n     the people could change the words, but judges could change \n     the meaning of those words. Judges would still control the \n     Constitution, and their oath to support and defend it would \n     really be an oath to support and defend themselves. America \n     needs judges who are guided and controlled not by subjective \n     empathy that they find inside themselves, but by objective \n     law that they find outside themselves.\n\n  I take a generous approach to the confirmation process. I believe \nthat the Senate owes some deference to a President's qualified nominees \nand that qualifications for judicial service include not only legal \nexperience but, more importantly, judicial philosophy. A judicial \nnominee must understand and be committed to the proper role and power \nof judges in our system of government. Evidence for a nominee's \njudicial philosophy must come from her entire record.\n  I hope that on the Supreme Court, Judge Sotomayor will take an \nobjective, modest, and restrained approach to interpreting and applying \nwritten law. I hope that she actively defends her impartiality against \nsubjective influences such as personal sympathies and prejudices. I \nhope that she sees the Constitution, both its words and its meaning, as \nsomething that she must follow rather than something she can change at \nwill.\n  I hope she will do all of that. I hope she proves me wrong in my \nnegative vote against her.\n  Because the record does not convince me she holds those views today, \nI cannot support her appointment to the Supreme Court.\n  Finally, I refer those who are interested back to my remarks on \nTuesday because I covered a number of other cases there that are \nequally important, but I believe, since I covered them there, I did not \nhave to go through them here.\n  I am very concerned about this nomination. I feel very bad that I \nhave to vote negatively. It is not what I wanted to do when this \nprocess started, but I believe I am doing the honorable and right \nthing, even though I feel bad about it. As I have said, I like Judge \nSotomayor, I like her family, I like her life story. I am hoping she \nwill listen to some of the things we have said on the floor, and I do \nwish her the best once she is confirmed.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                     [From Politico, Aug. 5, 2009]\n\n                 Not Anti-Hispanic To Oppose Sotomayor\n\n                            (By Marco Rubio)\n\n       Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to the Supreme Court was a \n     truly historic moment in our nation's history. As an \n     accomplished jurist who rose from humble roots, she is an \n     inspiration to all who share her Hispanic heritage and all \n     Americans who believe hard work is key to success.\n       Since that moment, however, I have considered it vital to \n     ensure that the historic nature of her nomination did not \n     interfere with the Senate's constitutional duty of evaluating \n     it and having a proper debate about the judiciary's proper \n     function in America. After all, the lifetime nature of her \n     appointment brandishes the post with enduring influence on \n     the nation's affairs long after the nominating president \n     vacates office. Whereas voters hold senators accountable \n     every six years, this is the nation's only chance to evaluate \n     Sotomayor before sending her to the Supreme Court for life.\n       During the recent Judiciary Committee hearings, it became \n     clear that I could not in good conscience support Sotomayor's \n     confirmation and would vote against it if I were in the \n     Senate today. I reached this conclusion on the basis of a \n     fair and thorough analysis.\n       As a whole, Sotomayor's record reflects a view that judges \n     can and should inject personal experiences and biases into \n     what should be the objective interpretation and application \n     of the law. While her comments about the ``better \n     conclusions'' a ``wise Latina woman'' would bring to the \n     bench are universally known, I have more specific concerns \n     about her case history and testimony regarding the Second \n     Amendment at the state level, eminent domain takings and the \n     so-called constitutional right to privacy that resulted in \n     the Roe v. Wade decision. Together, these and other cases \n     point to a nominee who would bring an activist approach to \n     the highest court in the land.\n       Some have said my opposition to Sotomayor's confirmation \n     and that of Republican senators would incense Hispanic-\n     American voters. Right on cue, many are now attempting to \n     brand Republicans as anti-Hispanic. It should be clear, \n     however, that our opposition to her judicial philosophy is in \n     no way a wholesale opposition to Hispanics.\n       I believe the greatest disservice we could offer the \n     Hispanic community and the nation as a whole is to avoid a \n     serious, principled discussion about the role of the \n     judiciary. I reject the notion that judges should be \n     representative of their sex, race or class. For these \n     reasons, the suggestion that senators who have fundamental \n     concerns about Sotomayor's judicial philosophy should not \n     dare oppose her for fear of being branded anti-Hispanic is \n     disappointing.\n       The true measure of our nation's progress on issues of race \n     and ethnicity is the freedom of people of conscience to \n     disagree with one another based on sound philosophical \n     reasoning, without fear of being negatively branded because \n     the person they oppose is of a different background or skin \n     color.\n       Reasonable people can disagree, and, in fact, many do in \n     this case. This competition\n\n[[Page S8900]]\n\n     of ideas is healthy when properly centered on policy and \n     philosophy, as it has been. The debate is only poisoned when \n     the color of one's skin becomes a political football. \n     Unfortunately, some of Sotomayor's supporters have injected \n     race into the discussion, indicating that a vote against her \n     is a vote against Hispanics, even though I have not heard one \n     utterance from any senator opposing her that reflects a \n     hostility toward Sotomayor personally or to her roots.\n       In evaluating judicial nominees, what matters most is \n     determining what kind of judges they will be. And nominees \n     who share Sotomayor's view that their role is to make law \n     rather than interpret it are individuals I cannot support and \n     would urge others not to, as well.\n       As Florida's first Hispanic speaker of the House, I too \n     blazed a trail that has been a great source of pride for my \n     community, particularly for those of my parents' and \n     grandparents' generations. My experience, like Sotomayor's, \n     is a testament to the boundless promise that exists in our \n     great land, where the son of a bartender and housekeeper who \n     came from Cuba without even a grasp of the English language \n     could rise to such heights.\n       Those of us of Hispanic descent don't expect special \n     treatment, only the same treatment and same opportunities \n     afforded to all Americans. I believe it would be wrong to \n     apply a higher or lower standard to Sotomayor than the one \n     applied to other Supreme Court nominees.\n       In the final analysis, we are not worthy of Hispanics' \n     trust or the support of any other Americans if we abandon our \n     principles or cease articulating our philosophical \n     disagreements on the role of the judiciary. I would rather \n     lose an election than diminish the rights afforded by the \n     Constitution. By consenting to a judge whose record \n     demonstrates an inclination to set policy from the bench, we \n     would be undermining our governing document.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS.

During the period leading up to her hearing, \n     Sotomayor has repeatedly made apparent her view that a \n     judge's personal feelings and experiences should play a \n     prominent role in her application of the law.\n       Our organization is concerned that this approach will lead \n     Judge Sotomayor, if she is confirmed to the Supreme Court, to \n     favor an interpretation of the Constitution that is even more \n     protective of abortion rights than Roe v. Wade. Such a \n     drastic reinterpretation of the Constitution, which would \n     establish abortion as a fundamental right, would frustrate \n     the will of the vast majority of Americans who oppose an \n     unlimited right to abortion and undermine the legitimacy of \n     the Constitution.\n       Judge Sotomayor offered a glimpse of her disposition toward \n     these important issues in her recent conversation with \n     Senator Jim DeMint during which she expressed that she had \n     never thought about whether an unborn child has \n     constitutional rights. This statement indicates that Judge \n     Sotomayor does not share the values of a majority of \n     Americans and that her decisions on the Supreme Court will \n     fail to protect the rights of unborn children.\n       Although Judge Sotomayor has never directly addressed \n     abortion-related questions while on the bench, her \n     association with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education \n     Fund (PRLDEF), a radical organization that has supported an \n     unlimited right to abortion, indicates that she shares the \n     organization's views on these issues. Judge Sotomayor served \n     on the PRLDEF's board of directors between 1980 and 1992. \n     During this period, the PRLDEF filed several amicus briefs in \n     prominent abortion cases.\n       These briefs repeatedly emphasized that the PRLDEF opposes \n     any effort to limit the rights recognized by Roe v. Wade, \n     arguing that abortion is a fundamental right and that the \n     Constitution requires strict scrutiny of limitations on the \n     ability to obtain an abortion. We believe that, if Judge \n     Sotomayor is given a position on the Supreme Court, her \n     decisions when confronted with these important questions will \n     align with the radical views expressed in PRLDEF's amicus \n     briefs.\n       In fact, these briefs indicate that Judge Sotomayor may \n     favor even more expansive abortion rights than Justice \n     Souter, whose support for abortion has been qualified by his \n     willingness to permit reasonable state and federal \n     regulations. Souter has indicated his approach by supporting \n     regulations of federal funding for abortion counseling in \n     Rust v. Sullivan and by voting to uphold state consent laws \n     in Planned Parenthood v. Casey. The PRLDEF's briefs supported \n     striking down both of these regulations as unconstitutional.\n       We ask that you please carefully question Judge Sotomayor \n     during her confirmation hearing about these issues, which \n     implicate important values shared by a majority of the \n     American public and threaten to diminish the legitimacy of \n     the Constitution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Brian Burch,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         National Rifle Association of America, Institute for \n           Legislative Action,\n                                        Fairfax, VA, July 7, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: I am \n     writing to express the National Rifle Association's very \n     serious concerns about the nomination of Judge Sonia \n     Sotomayor to the Supreme Court of the United States.\n       We are particularly dismayed about the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the Second Circuit's recent decision in the case \n     of Maloney v. Cuomo, which involved the application of the \n     Second Amendment as a limit on state law, via incorporation \n     of the Second Amendment through the Fourteenth Amendment's \n     Due Process Clause. Judge Sotomayor was on the panel that \n     decided this case in a brief--and in our opinion, clearly \n     incorrect--per curiam opinion.\n       The Maloney panel claimed that ``it is settled law . . . \n     that the Second Amendment applies only to limitations the \n     federal government seeks to impose on this right.'' It based \n     this ruling on the 1886 case of Presser v. Illinois, decided \n     long before the development of the Supreme Court's modern \n     incorporation doctrine. But as the Court made clear last year \n     in District of Columbia v. Heller, post-Civil War cases such \n     as Presser ``did not engage in the sort of Fourteenth \n     Amendment inquiry required by our later cases.''\n       Further, Presser (along with United States v. Cruikshank) \n     only stands for the concept that the guarantees in the Bill \n     of Rights do not apply directly to the States. As we have \n     seen throughout the Supreme Court's Twentieth Century \n     jurisprudence, most of the Bill of Rights has been \n     incorporated against the States through the Fourteenth \n     Amendment's Due Process Clause. Thus, the failure of the \n     Maloney panel to engage in a proper due process analysis of \n     the Second Amendment is extremely troubling, to say the \n     least.\n       The Second Circuit's decision (as well as the Seventh \n     Circuit's similarly flawed reasoning in Nat'l Rifle Ass'n of \n     Am., Inc. v. City of Chicago) is at odds with the Ninth \n     Circuit's decision in Nordyke v. King, which did engage in a \n     full Fourteenth Amendment analysis (again, as required by the \n     Supreme Court in Heller). The Ninth Circuit held that while \n     the Second Amendment does not apply to the states directly or \n     through the Privileges or Immunities Clause, modern \n     Fourteenth Amendment cases do require its incorporation \n     through the Due Process Clause. This stark circuit split \n     makes it highly likely that the Supreme Court will take up \n     one or more of these cases in the immediate future, perhaps \n     as soon as next term.\n       In addition, Judge Sotomayor was a member of the panel in \n     the case of United States v. Sanchez-Villar, where (in a \n     summary opinion) the Second Circuit dismissed a Second \n     Amendment challenge to New York State's pistol licensing law. \n     That panel, in a terse footnote, cited a previous Second \n     Circuit case to claim that ``the right to possess a gun is \n     clearly not a fundamental right.'' Since the precedent cited \n     for that point is no longer valid in the wake of Heller, \n     Judge Sotomayor should be asked whether she would take the \n     same position today.\n       The cases in which Judge Sotomayor has participated have \n     been dismissive of the Second Amendment and have troubling \n     implications for future cases that are certain to come before \n     the Court. Therefore, we believe that America's eighty \n     million gun owners\n\n[[Page S8901]]\n\n     have good reason to worry about her views. We look forward to \n     a full airing of her past decisions and judicial philosophy \n     at the upcoming committee hearings, and urge you and all \n     committee members to engage in the most serious questioning \n     possible on these critical issues.\n       Out of respect for the confirmation process, the NRA has \n     not announced an official position on Judge Sotomayor's \n     confirmation. However, should her answers regarding the \n     Second Amendment at the upcoming hearings be hostile or \n     evasive, we will have no choice but to oppose her nomination \n     to the Court.\n       Finally, we would caution you against lending any credence \n     to the endorsement of Judge Sotomayor's nomination by \n     organizations that falsely claim to represent gun owners, \n     while promoting an anti-gun agenda. These front groups' \n     actions give them no credibility to speak on this nomination.\n       Thank you for your attention to our concerns. Should you \n     have any questions or wish to discuss further, please do not \n     hesitate to call on me personally.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Chris W. Cox,\n     Executive Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     July 7, 2009.\n       Dear Senators: As Americans who have dedicated themselves \n     to protecting the Second Amendment right of U.S. citizens to \n     keep and bear arms, we urge you not to confirm Judge Sonia \n     Sotomayor as the next associate justice of the United States \n     Supreme Court.\n       It is extremely important that a Supreme Court justice \n     understand and appreciate the origin and meaning of the \n     Second Amendment, a constitutional guarantee permanently \n     enshrined in the Bill of Rights. Judge Sotomayor's record on \n     the Second Amendment causes us grave concern over her \n     treatment of this enumerated constitutional right.\n       Last year, the Supreme Court decided the landmark case \n     District of Columbia v. Heller, holding that the Second \n     Amendment guarantees to all law-abiding, responsible citizens \n     the individual right to keep and bear arms, particularly for \n     self-defense. Following Heller, the Supreme Court is almost \n     certain to decide next year whether the Second Amendment \n     applies to states and local governments, as it does to the \n     federal government (see NRA v. Chicago and McDonald v. \n     Chicago.)\n       While on the Second Circuit, Judge Sotomayor revealed her \n     views on the right to keep and bear arms in Maloney v. Cuomo, \n     a case decided after Heller, yet holding that the Second \n     Amendment is not a fundamental right, that it does not apply \n     to the states, and that if an object is ``designed primarily \n     as a weapon'' that is a sufficient basis for total \n     prohibition even within the home. Earlier in a 2004 case, \n     United States v. Sanchez-Villar, Sotomayor and two colleagues \n     perfunctorily dismissed a Second Amendment claim holding that \n     ``the right to possess a gun is clearly not a fundamental \n     right.'' Imagine if such a view were expressed about other \n     fundamental rights guaranteed by the Bill of Rights, such as \n     the First, Fourth and Fifth Amendments.\n       Surprisingly, Heller was a 5-4 decision, with some justices \n     arguing that the Second Amendment does not apply to private \n     citizens or that if it does, even a total gun ban could be \n     upheld if a ``legitimate governmental interest'' could be \n     found. The dissenting justices also found D.C.'s absolute ban \n     on handguns within the home to be a ``reasonable'' \n     restriction. If this had been the majority view, then any gun \n     ban could be upheld, and the Second Amendment would be \n     meaningless.\n       The Second Amendment survives today by a single vote in the \n     Supreme Court. Both its application to the states and whether \n     there will be a meaningfully strict standard of review remain \n     to be decided by the High Court. Judge Sotomayor has already \n     revealed her views on these issues and we believe they are \n     contrary to the intent and purposes of the Second Amendment \n     and Bill of Rights. As Second Amendment leaders deeply \n     concerned about preserving all fundamental rights for current \n     and future generations of Americans, we strongly oppose this \n     nominee, and urge the Senate not to confirm Judge Sotomayor.\n           Sincerely,\n         Sandra S.

Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, The Capitol, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Leader Reid and Leader McConnell: On behalf of the \n     National Right to Life Committee (NRLC), the federation of \n     right-to-life organizations in all 50 states, we write to \n     express the opposition of our organization to the \n     confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as an associate justice \n     of the United States Supreme Court.\n       As a judge, Ms. Sotomayor has encountered little in the way \n     of abortion-related litigation, either at the district court \n     or the court of appeals. In the single ruling that she \n     authored that bore directly on an abortion-related federal \n     policy, Center for Reproductive Law and Policy v. Bush, the \n     result was unambiguously governed by the precedents of the \n     U.S. Supreme Court and the Second Circuit. Yet, there are \n     many troubling indications that Ms. Sotomayor believes that \n     it is the proper role of the U.S. Supreme Court to construct \n     and enforce constitutional doctrines on social policy \n     questions, even where the text and history of the \n     Constitution provide no basis for removing an issue from the \n     realm of lawmaking by the duly elected representatives of the \n     people.\n       Legal abortion on demand was imposed by seven Supreme Court \n     justices in Roe v. Wade. Roe was an exercise in judicial \n     legislation, aptly branded ``an exercise of raw judicial \n     power'' by dissenting Justice Byron White. The ruling lacked \n     any real basis in the text of the Constitution, and imposed a \n     policy that was completely at odds with the intent of the \n     lawmakers who crafted and ratified the Fourteenth Amendment.\n       The evidence indicates that Ms. Sotomayor approves of the \n     Roe ruling and approves of the type of judicial activism that \n     produced it. For a period of 12 years (1980-1992), prior to \n     becoming a judge, Ms. Sotomayor served on the governing board \n     of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund \n     (PRLDEF), and for part of that time she was the chair of the \n     PRLDEF Litigation Committee. During her tenure on the board, \n     the PRLDEF was actively involved in litigation that attempted \n     to persuade the Supreme Court to expand the judge-created \n     ``right to abortion,'' often beyond what the Court was \n     willing to embrace. During this period, the fund joined \n     briefs at the U.S. Supreme Court in six abortion-related \n     cases. These briefs urged the Court to regard abortion as a \n     ``fundamental right'' (a right on the level of freedom of \n     speech), to apply the strictest standard of scrutiny when \n     reviewing abortion-regulated laws, and thereby to nullify \n     informed consent requirements (including those involving \n     ultrasound), waiting periods, parental notification \n     requirements, restrictions on taxpayer funding of abortion, \n     and even record keeping requirements. The PRLDEF's own \n     ``statement of interest'' in three of these cases said that \n     the PRLDEF ``opposes any efforts to overturn or in any way \n     restrict the rights recognized in Roe v. Wade.''\n       During her recent confirmation hearings, Ms. Sotomayor \n     suggested that she was only aware of this litigation activity \n     in the most general terms, and had no responsibility for or \n     awareness of the substance of the briefs. Frankly, this \n     testimony was not very believable. Ms. Sotomayor was a Yale \n     Law School graduate who, according to many accounts, is \n     exceedingly--even excessively--detail oriented on the legal \n     matters in which she is involved. More believable is what the \n     New York Times reported on May 29, 2009, after\n\n[[Page S8902]]\n\n     interviewing various parties who were directly involved in \n     the PRLDEF litigation activity during this period: ``Ms. \n     Sotomayor stood out, frequently meeting with the legal staff \n     to review the status of cases, several former members said. . \n     . . The board monitored all litigation undertaken by the \n     fund's lawyers, and a number of those lawyers said Ms. \n     Sotomayor was an involved and ardent supporter of their \n     various legal efforts during her time with the group.''\n       If confirmed to the U.S. Supreme Court, Ms. Sotomayor will \n     no longer be constrained by the precedents of that Court, \n     including the precedents in which the Court upheld laws \n     requiring notification of a parent before performing an \n     abortion on a minor, requiring a pre-abortion waiting period, \n     barring public funding of abortion, and--by a single vote, in \n     2007--banning partial-birth abortion. Nor, it appears, will \n     she feel greatly constrained by the text and history of the \n     Constitution, in which Roe v. Wade and its progeny find no \n     support.\n       Because the available evidence strongly suggests that once \n     on the Supreme Court, Sonia Sotomayor will seek to nullify \n     abortion-related laws adopted through the normal legislative \n     processes of our democracy, consistent with the extreme legal \n     theories with which she was associated before being appointed \n     to the federal bench, National Right to Life urges all \n     senators to vote against her confirmation to the Supreme \n     Court.\n           Respectfully,\n     David N. O'Steen, Ph.D.,\n       Executive Director.\n     Douglas Johnson,\n       Legislative Director.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 13, 2009.\n       Dear Chairman Patrick Leahy and Senate Judiciary Ranking \n     Member Jeff Sessions: On behalf of FRC Action (FRCA), the \n     legislative arm of the Family Research Council, and the \n     families we represent, I write to you today with serious \n     reservations regarding the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to \n     the United States Supreme Court.\n       The Senate Judiciary Committee has the important role of \n     properly vetting any nominee to ensure that the nominee has \n     the requisite competence, temperament, character, knowledge \n     of the law and experience to make a good jurist. The nominee \n     must be committed to making decisions based on the law and \n     the facts of each case. Personal ideological predispositions \n     toward certain results must be set aside, and the nominee \n     must have the ability to faithfully uphold the Constitution \n     recognizing that it is the supreme law and source of \n     authority for all American law, including judicial \n     precedents. A review of Ms. Sotomayor's record shows she is \n     lacking in many of these qualities.\n       Senators on the committee need to have Ms. Sotomayor \n     address what exactly she meant by some of her more \n     controversial statements, why she tried to suppress her \n     ruling in the Connecticut firefighters' discrimination case \n     and her seeming disregard for U.S. judicial sovereignty. Ms. \n     Sotomayor should also describe the extent of her role in the \n     anti-life work at the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and \n     Education Fund (PRLDEF).\n       From 1980 to 1992, Judge Sotomayor was an active governing \n     board member of the PRLDEF where she helped to shape the \n     group's controversial legal policy. Just one example of work \n     done while she was there is the brief for Webster v. \n     Reproductive Health Services, written in 1989, in which the \n     organization called the right to abortion ``precious.'' Ms. \n     Sotomayor's troubled history as a jurist, an activist and as \n     an attorney have surfaced numerous other concerns on sanctity \n     of life issues, on sovereignty matters, marriage questions \n     and more that makes us question her fitness to serve on our \n     nation's highest court.\n       Barring significant revelations at her Senate confirmation \n     hearing that change our assessment of her judicial \n     philosophy, Family Research Council Action must stand in \n     opposition to Judge Sotomayor's confirmation. The available \n     evidence reveals Judge Sotomayor to be a judicial activist \n     who does not have a proper understanding of the limited role \n     of judges and the judiciary in our constitutional system.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              Thomas McClusky,\n\n                                            Senior Vice President,\n     FRC Action.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 13, 2009.\n\nAs Hearings Begin, Women's Coalition for Justice Questions Sotomayor's \n                        Ability To Be Impartial\n\n       Washington, DC.--Members of the Women's Coalition for \n     Justice released the following statements in response to \n     today's first Senate confirmation hearing for Supreme Court \n     Nominee Judge Sonia Sotomayor.\n       Genevieve Wood, Vice President of Strategic Initiatives, \n     The Heritage Foundation, stated, ``I am troubled by Judge \n     Sotomayor's rejection of Justice O'Connor's favored adage \n     that a wise old man would reach the same conclusion as a wise \n     old woman. It is deeply offensive that she has suggested that \n     the sexes and ethnicities `have basic differences in logic \n     and reasoning,' and even more offensive that she believes it \n     is somehow patriotic to indulge in gender or ethnic biases. \n     Her statements raise grave concerns about whether she can \n     truly be impartial and the current defense that she simply \n     endorses including different perspectives doesn't hold water. \n     The Senators must ask challenging questions to determine \n     whether she believes that a wise woman can reach the same \n     conclusion as a wise man, or whether she intends to bring \n     bias, as she has suggested, even to most cases.''\n       Marjorie Dannenfelser, President of the Susan B. Anthony \n     List, stated, ``Women are best protected by the rule of law--\n     and blind justice. Their rights are most endangered when \n     personal preference, ideology or painful personal history \n     inform judgment. Susan B. Anthony and her early feminist \n     compatriots fought for a human rights standard sustained only \n     through blind justice. When evidence of personal preference \n     appears in any Supreme Court nominee's judgment, it should \n     give all women pause. Sonia Sotomayor's record of support for \n     judicial activism and her work for the pro-abortion Puerto \n     Rican Legal Defense Fund offer little comfort that she will \n     be a friend to the unborn on the Supreme Court. Given what we \n     know about Sonia Sotomayor's own judicial philosophy, \n     including her support of policymaking from the bench, \n     senators have just cause to reject her appointment to the \n     United States Supreme Court.''\n       Connie Mackey, Senior Vice President for FRCAction \n     remarked, ``I reject the admonition of Senator Chuck Schumer \n     that opposing the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor will cause \n     the Republican Party to lose women's vote permanently. I \n     believe his crystal ball is cloudy when it comes to women in \n     America. Women think independently and most women will see \n     that Sonia Sotomayor is a judicial activist who will use the \n     courts to make policy reflective of her own personal \n     judgments as opposed to ruling based upon the tenets put \n     forth by the Constitution. Her career as an activist is well-\n     documented and disqualifies her from taking the 9th seat on \n     the United States Supreme Court.''\n       Wendy Wright, President of Concerned Women for America \n     Legislative Action Committee stated, ``Sonia Sotomayor's \n     record reveals she lacks the primary characteristic required \n     of a judge--impartiality. She has used her position as a \n     judge to deny equal justice to people based on their \n     ethnicity. She worked with organizations that aggressively \n     fought against common-sense regulations on abortion. Her \n     flippant dismissal of cases and unwillingness to provide \n     Constitutional reasoning for her decisions exposes her \n     arrogance, disrespect for our judicial system and the people \n     whose lives are dramatically impacted by her decisions. \n     Through her work as a judge and in organizations, she has \n     denied people equal opportunity to make a living because of \n     the color of their skin, preborn babies their right to live, \n     and women the right not to be exploited by abortionists. \n     After giving her the benefit of the doubt, her record of \n     giving preferences to certain classes of people and denying \n     equal justice to others obliges Concerned Women for America \n     Legislative Action Committee to oppose her nomination to the \n     U.S. Supreme Court. Sonia Sotomayor has disqualified herself \n     from the U.S. Supreme Court. Senators need to set aside their \n     party loyalty and do their Constitutional duty to uphold \n     equal justice for all by opposing Sonia Sotomayor's \n     nomination.''\n       Charmaine Yoest, President and CEO of Americans United for \n     Life remarked, ``It's important for the American people to \n     understand that the confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to \n     the Supreme Court will dramatically shift the dynamics of the \n     Court. Her record of activism in support of a radical pro-\n     abortion agenda is clear and documented. This is a judge with \n     a record significantly worse than Judge Souter's. We are \n     asking the Senate Judiciary Committee to seriously consider \n     the consequences of confirming a Supreme Court justice whose \n     radical record shows she would rule against all common-sense \n     legal protections for the unborn, including parental \n     notification, informed consent and bans on partial-birth \n     abortion. The American people will not tolerate a nominee who \n     is outside the mainstream of American public opinion.''\n                                  ____\n\n         The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern \n           Baptist Convention,\n                                     Nashville, TN, July 14, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: This week, \n     the Senate Judiciary committee begins its confirmation \n     hearings for Judge Sonia Sotomayor. We are deeply troubled by \n     many aspects of Judge Sotomayor's record. While we could \n     identify a number of factors that concern us, we describe \n     below those that are the most troubling.\n       Judge Sotomayor does not appear to share the pro-life \n     values of nearly all Southern Baptists and of most Americans. \n     Recent polling reveals that the majority of Americans are \n     pro-life. Her lack of rulings on major sanctity of life \n     issues makes it more difficult to determine how she would \n     rule on sanctity issues, but her association with the Puerto \n     Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund raises serious \n     questions about her commitment to pro-life values. She served \n     on the Board of this organization, including as Vice \n     President and Chair of the litigation committee. During that \n     time, the Fund filed briefs in at least six prominent court \n     cases in support of abortion rights.\n\n[[Page S8903]]\n\n       While Judge Sotomayor has ruled favorably on abortion-\n     related cases at times, we note that her rulings on race-\n     related issues reveal a much more ideologically rigid \n     attitude toward race. Her ruling in Ricci v. DeStefano is \n     indefensible. We support full racial equality, and therefore \n     support efforts that create equal opportunity for all races. \n     However, we oppose policies that discriminate against some \n     races in order to achieve a predetermined racial outcome. \n     Racial discrimination is wrong in any circumstance.\n       We are also disturbed by Judge Sotomayor's lack of respect \n     for private property rights. Her ruling in Didden v. Village \n     of Port Chester demonstrates a willingness to ignore the \n     Constitution's Fifth Amendment protection of private \n     property. While the Kelo case was certainly precedential in \n     her panel's ruling, the Supreme Court stated in their \n     majority opinion that municipalities could not take private \n     property under ``the mere pretext of a public purpose, when \n     its actual purpose was to bestow a private benefit.'' Judge \n     Sotomayor was either unaware of this qualification or chose \n     to ignore it.\n       Judge Sotomayor has often ruled very responsibly, but the \n     rate at which she has been overruled by the U.S. Supreme \n     Court reveals that she should not be in a position where her \n     decisions cannot be subjected to review. She is out of the \n     mainstream of the American public and too often of the very \n     Court for which she is being considered. We urge you to do \n     all you can to bring out all the facts about Judge Sotomayor \n     during her confirmation hearings, and if these troubling \n     issues remain, to vote against her confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Richard D. Land,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n         The Ethics & Religious Liberty Commission of the Southern \n           Baptist Convention,\n                                     Nashville, TN, July 28, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: This week, the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee is scheduled to vote on the confirmation of Judge \n     Sonia Sotomayor as our nation's newest Supreme Court Justice. \n     As you recall, we raised a number of concerns about her \n     record that we believed required examination during her \n     hearings.\n       We watched the hearings and listened to Judge Sotomayor's \n     answers to some very probing questions, but we are not \n     convinced that she is an appropriate candidate for the United \n     States Supreme Court. We urge therefore that you vote against \n     her confirmation.\n       While we appreciated Judge Sotomayor's affirmation of the \n     centrality of the U.S. Constitution in rulings, we believe \n     her record demonstrates an inconsistent application of that \n     standard at best. The following cases remain determinative \n     for us. In Owkedy v. Molinari she showed no regard for the \n     1st Amendment guarantee of speech or religious expression. In \n     Maloney v. Cuomo she weakened the 2nd Amendment's guarantee \n     of the individual's right to bear arms. In Didden v. Village \n     of Port Chester she failed to uphold the 5th Amendment's \n     protection of personal property. In Ricci v. DeStefano she \n     violated the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection.\n       Additionally, we are deeply concerned about Judge \n     Sotomayor's failure to adequately address her 12 year \n     involvement with the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education \n     Fund. We believe she was more involved with the group's \n     active efforts to promote a pro-abortion agenda than she \n     admitted.\n       Finally, her numerous reversals by the U.S. Supreme Court \n     reveal that Judge Sotomayor does not have the grasp of the \n     fine points of Constitutional law required of a member of the \n     Supreme Court. She needs someone to pass final judgment on \n     her decisions. No such oversight would be possible if she \n     were to join the Court of last resort.\n       We regret that we must oppose the nomination of Judge \n     Sotomayor. She is obviously very gifted. Her personal story \n     as well is the kind of story that compels respect and \n     appreciation, We applaud her for her commitment and \n     dedication. Nevertheless, we do not believe Judge Sotomayor \n     meets the requirements for this extremely important position \n     in our nation. We therefore urge you to vote against her \n     confirmation,\n       Thank you for your service to our nation. We pray God's \n     guidance and wisdom for you as you make the decisions that \n     affect life for hundreds of millions of people.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Richard D. Land,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                              American Association\n\n\n                                         of Christian Schools,\n\n                                    East Ridge, TN, July 15, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC\n       Dear Senator Leahy: The American Association of Christian \n     Schools strongly urges you to oppose the confirmation of \n     Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the United States Supreme Court, \n     based on her inability to judge without respect of persons \n     and her misinterpretation of the rule of law and the United \n     States Constitution.\n       As President Obama sought a possible nominee, he \n     consistently used the term ``empathy'' to describe the \n     character of his first Supreme Court Justice nominee. When he \n     nominated Judge Sonia Sotomayor, he based the criteria of a \n     U.S. Supreme Court Justice on superficial elements rather \n     than on character which demonstrates an actual understanding \n     of the rule of law and original intent of the judicial system \n     established by our Founding Fathers. She has continually met \n     his standards of ``empathy,'' proving through her actions and \n     words her desire to exercise empathy from the bench. \n     According to Judge Sotomayor, to ``ignore . . . our \n     differences as women and men of color [is to] do a disservice \n     both to the law and society.'' She further believes her \n     ``experience will affect the facts that [I] choose to see as \n     a judge.''\n       We are concerned that the element of ``empathy'' in the \n     highest Court of the land will redefine and replace the \n     longstanding aspect of impartiality under the law. It seems \n     that the standard of law should no longer solely lie on the \n     Constitution, but also on the hearts of justices.\n       Other concerns are based on Judge Sotomayor's \n     interpretation on the right to life. She recently expressed \n     that she has never thought about the rights of the unborn. We \n     find this tragic. Whether a person supports abortion or \n     opposes it, a U.S. Supreme Court Justice should be extremely \n     familiar with the rights that every American is endowed, \n     including life.\n       While Judge Sotomayor may have more experience than any \n     other Supreme Court Justice currently sitting on the bench, \n     the Administration and many members of the Senate are \n     impatiently rushing her through the process without properly \n     and adequately researching and critiquing her credentials and \n     past decisions that come with that experience. It is \n     essential that every Senator is given the time and resources \n     to fully examine Judge Sotomayor's past decisions and present \n     understanding of the rule of law.\n       Qualifications and credentials are a necessity when filling \n     the bench, but an ability to carry out the duties of a \n     Supreme Court Justice and meet the standards by which they \n     are held to, is of equal importance. Understanding the rights \n     which we are endowed by our Creator and interpreting the law \n     as our founding fathers originally intended is essential. \n     Just as Lady Justice holds the scales to depict her \n     impartiality and a blindfold to cover her eyes from the \n     spheres that try to influence her, her wisdom lies in the \n     ability to pursue the law and to demand nothing less. She is \n     un-influenced, she is impartial.\n       We urge you to oppose this nominee, as we believe that she \n     will cause not only harm to the judicial system and the \n     principles of law on which our country was founded, but she \n     also poses a threat to every American who does not receive \n     her ``empathy.''\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Keith Wiebe,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    July 14, 2009.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the Susan B. Anthony List (SBA \n     List), and our 260,000 members and pro-life activists across \n     the country, I write to encourage you to oppose the \n     nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the United States \n     Supreme Court.\n       Women are best protected by the rule of law--and blind \n     justice. Their rights are most endangered when personal \n     preference, ideology or painful personal history inform \n     judgment. Susan B. Anthony and her early feminist compatriots \n     fought for a human rights standard sustained only through \n     blind justice. When evidence of personal preference appears \n     in any Supreme Court nominee's judgment, it should give all \n     women pause.\n       Sonia Sotomayor's record of support for judicial activism \n     and her work for the pro-abortion Puerto Rican Legal Defense \n     Fund offer little comfort that she will be a friend to the \n     unborn on the Supreme Court.\n       While Sotomayor served as a board member of the Puerto \n     Rican Legal Defense Fund, the group filed six briefs with the \n     court advocating for unmitigated abortion on-demand. Multiple \n     accounts tell us that the board closely monitored the fund's \n     work, and that Sotomayor was ``an involved and ardent \n     supporter of their various legal efforts.'' (New York Times, \n     May 28, 2009)\n       The briefs in question advocate a philosophy that rejects \n     any legal restrictions on abortion. This position disregards \n     both the broad public support for such restrictions and the \n     fact that such laws save lives. For example when the \n     government restricts funding for abortion on-demand, we see \n     fewer abortions. Even abortion advocates recognize this \n     reality. The Guttmacher Institute recently issued a report \n     showing that when public funding is not available, 1-in-4 \n     Medicaid-eligible women do not have abortions. That means \n     approximately 25% of babies whose mothers receive government \n     subsidized health care likely survive due to laws like the \n     Hyde Amendment. Sotomayor's record indicates she would not \n     uphold such commonsense restrictions.\n       Women facing unplanned pregnancies deserve woman-centered \n     solutions to help both mother and child, not abortion on-\n     demand, which pits mother against child in the most tragic of \n     circumstances. They deserve Supreme Court Justices who will \n     uphold the Right to Life.\n       Given what we know about Sonia Sotomayor's own judicial \n     philosophy, including her support of policymaking from the \n     bench, you have just cause to reject her appointment to the \n     United States Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                            Marjorie Dannenfelser,\n                                 President, Susan B. Anthony List.\n\n\n[[Page S8904]]\n\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Those letters were from Fidelis, Defending Life, Faith \nand Family, outlining their opposition; a letter from the National \nRifle Association; a letter from the National Right to Life Committee; \na letter from FRCAction; the Women's Coalition for Justice; the SBA \nList, the Susan B. Anthony List; the American Association of Christian \nSchools; and the Ethics and Religious Liberty Commission of the \nSouthern Baptist Convention. Those were one group of letters.\n  In addition, there are letters from the National Rifle Association, \nas I mentioned earlier. They have not often, if ever, weighed in on a \njudicial nomination. But this case, this nomination was so close to one \nof the most critical issues facing the country today. That is, whether \nthe second amendment applies to States.\n  If the second amendment does not apply to States, then States and \ncities can completely ban guns within their jurisdiction.\n  Judge Sotomayor earlier this year, after the Heller decision, in the \nfirst case of its kind after the Supreme Court's decision in Heller, \nconcluded the second amendment does not apply to the States.\n  She concluded in her very brief opinion that the second amendment \ndoes not apply to the States; they could eliminate firearms. She \nconcluded it was settled law that this was the case when the Supreme \nCourt in Heller--and as the ninth circuit concluded, which held \ndifferently--explicitly left open this question.\n  So I think any person who cares about the second amendment and the \nright to keep and bear arms has to be very troubled that the nominee, \nearlier this year, concluded that it does not apply and it is settled \nlaw, when the Supreme Court had opened it up, as the ninth circuit \nsaid.\n  If it is not reversed, her opinion is not reversed, then cities and \ncounties will be able to restrict firearm possession completely.\n  Sandra Froman, who is the former president of the National Rifle \nAssociation, a Harvard law graduate herself, wrote that:\n\n       Surprisingly, Heller was a 5-4 decision, with some justices \n     arguing that the Second Amendment does not apply to private \n     citizens or that if it does, even a total gun ban would be \n     upheld if a ``legitimate governmental interest'' could be \n     found.\n\n  She goes on to say:\n\n       The Second Amendment survives today by a single vote in the \n     Supreme Court.\n\n  Heller was a 5-to-4 decision.\n\n       Both its application to the States and whether there will \n     be a meaningfully strict standard of review remain to be \n     decided by the High Court.\n\n  I have offered that letter and other letters that we have received \ninto the Record. I also printed in the Record a series of op-eds I have \nwritten on the way I believe an analysis of a nominee should be \nconducted and what are the important principles.\n  Mr. President, I would like to express my appreciation to my staff \nwhose assistance throughout this process was critical to the fair \nhearing that Judge Sotomayor received. The Senate Judiciary Committee \nheld a hearing for Judge Sotomayor more quickly than it had for the \nlast three Supreme Court nominees, despite the fact that she has been \ntouted as having the most extensive legal record of any recent Supreme \nCourt nominee. As such, my staff went to great efforts to prepare for \nthe hearing on her nomination.\n  Our team was led by chief counsel for the Supreme Court nomination \nElisebeth Cook; staff director Brian Benczkowski; chief counsel William \nSmith; deputy staff director Matt Miner; and general counsel Joe Matal. \nTheir knowledge of the issues and wise counsel proved invaluable during \nthis confirmation process.\n  In addition, I am grateful to our Supreme Court team, including \ncounsels Ted Lehman, Seth Wood, Ashok Pinto, Ryan Nelson, and Isaac \nFong; law clerks Chris Mills, Matt Kuhn, Anne Mackin, and Andrew \nEnglish; and intern Jamie Sunderland.\n  I would like to acknowledge and extend my gratitude to the dedicated \nand talented members of my permanent staff who worked tirelessly on \nthis nomination, all the while handling the regular legislative \nbusiness and other nominations that came before the Judiciary \nCommittee: counsels Danielle Brucchieri, Bradley Hayes, Nathan \nHallford, and Phil Zimmerly; professional staff member Lauren \nPastarnack; and staff assistants Sarah Thompson and Andrew Bennion.\n  I would be remiss if I failed to mention the important work done \nevery day by my communications director Stephen Boyd, press secretaries \nSarah Haley and Stephen Miller, and press assistant Andrew Logan.\n  The people I have mentioned bore the bulk of the workload, laboring \ntirelessly night after night, day after day, and nonstop through the \nweekends. They deserve our recognition as a tribute to their hard work, \nprofessionalism, and dedication to public service.\n  I also would like to acknowledge the great help we received from the \nRepublican majority leader and his staff: John Abegg, Josh Holmes, and \nWebber Steinhoff; as well as the invaluable contributions of Republican \nPolicy Committee counsel Mark Patton.\n  Finally, my thanks to the Judiciary Committee's chief clerk, Roslyne \nTurner and her assistant, Erin O'Neill.\n  All of these fine staff members contributed to this process and we \nwould not have been able to conduct such a fair and thorough hearing \nwithout their hard work and their professionalism. To each of them, I \nextend my heartfelt thanks.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Idaho.\n  Mr. RISCH. I rise today, fellow Senators, to discuss the current \nnomination that is under consideration by the Senate for the U.S. \nSupreme Court seat.\n  Like every Member of this body, I take this responsibility seriously. \nThe Constitution of the United States gives each one of the 100 Members \nof this body the solemn duty to participate in this under what has been \ncalled the advice and consent provisions.\n  Obviously, there are two parts here. First ``advice'' and the second \n``consent.'' The first part, the advice that the President seeks, is \nnot under the control of any Member here but is under the control of \nthe President. He did not seek my advice on this, which is not \nsurprising.\n  But, secondly, I am required to exercise my constitutional duty to \nexpress either consent or the withholding of consent. I appear here \nthis morning to explain the conclusion I have reached in that regard.\n  This is a serious constitutional duty. I think every Member here \ntakes it seriously. I think as we do exercise this constitutional duty, \nit is incumbent upon each one of us to create, in our own mind, a path \nforward and a criteria, if you would, as to how to reach a conclusion \nconcerning that consent.\n  I think all of us come at it from a different point of view. Some of \nus have had some experience in that regard. Although I have not had \nexperience here in this body with a U.S. Supreme Court appointment, I \nhad the opportunity at the State level, since I have served as Governor \nand had to appoint judges, to determine if, in my mind, a path forward, \nif you would, or a way, a method, in which we would reach that \nconclusion as to the appropriateness of a person, their qualifications \nto serve in a judicial capacity. I have done that.\n  In addition to that, I think all of us look to other people who have \nexercised this responsibility and looked for the type of matrix they \nused to reach the conclusion. I have also done that. I have chosen \nsomeone to emulate as far as how I would reach a conclusion as to \nwhether I would grant the consent or withhold the consent.\n  That person whom I have chosen to emulate is a person who actually \nchose a matrix that is similar to mine; that is, when we do this, we \njudge who the person is, and what that person stands for--the ``who'' \nand the ``what.''\n  Like the person I have chosen to emulate, my focus is not on the \n``who,'' my focus is on the ``what.'' What does this person stand for? \nBecause it is, indeed, at the end of the day, the ``what'' that will \nguide that person when that person, when the nominee, makes decisions \nin their capacity as a U.S. Supreme Court Justice.\n  I met with the nominee. I have read her opinions. I have read a lot \nthat has been written about the nominee, and weighed those using the \nmatrix I have chosen, and that person I chose to emulate chose to reach \na conclusion as to whether to grant the consent or to withhold the \nconsent.\n\n[[Page S8905]]\n\n  I think this is a decision that no one should reach lightly but \nshould reach based upon weighing the factors that they have chosen. \nWhen it comes to the ``who,'' I find the nominee that the President has \nput forward to be a person who is engaging, who is very wise, who has \nhad clearly the experience to fill this position. I have no difficulty \nwith that at all. I am honored that she would spend the considerable \ntime she made available for me to meet with her and discuss with her \nthe various issues that are important to the great State of Idaho.\n  At the end of the day, I have to move from the ``who'' to the \n``what.'' And in that regard, I want to talk about now who I chose to \nemulate when it comes to making this decision. The person I chose to \nemulate is a person who currently serves as the President of the United \nStates.\n  He came to this body and had the opportunity to do just what I have \ndone; that is, to go through this exercise to determine the ``who'' and \nthe ``what'' when it comes to the appointment and the qualifications to \nserve as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Then-Senator Obama went through this exact same exercise. At the end \nof the day, when he voted on two of the nominees, two of the Supreme \nCourt nominees, he determined that based upon his weighing of the \nnominees, he could not, in good conscience, vote for the nominees \nbecause--not because of the ``who'' part of the equation but because of \nthe ``what does this person stand for'' part of the equation.\n  He did that based upon his vision of what he wanted to see in \nAmerica. I did likewise. He concluded that when he withheld his consent \non those two, that person did not meet his view of what the vision for \nAmerica was. I have reached the same conclusion on this nominee.\n  In all good conscience, I must withhold the consent. My fellow \nSenators, I will withhold my consent based not on the ``who'' but on \nthe ``what'' on this nomination. I will vote no.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, what is the parliamentary situation?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The majority controls the next 60 \nminutes with respect to the nomination of Judge Sotomayor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I thank the many Senators who took part \nyesterday in the historic debate over the nomination of Judge Sonia \nSotomayor to the Supreme Court. In fact, the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer was one who introduced her to the Judiciary Committee and also \nspoke eloquently in the Chamber yesterday. I am hopeful that today will \nnot only conclude the debate, but we will then vote on her confirmation \nand vote favorably.\n  Senator Klobuchar, the senior Senator from Minnesota, a very active \nmember of the Judiciary Committee, led a group of five women Senators \nin a powerful opening hour of debate yesterday. The distinguished \nPresiding Officer was one of them, and it also included Senators \nShaheen, Stabenow, and Murray. Their speeches were very moving. Several \nJudiciary Committee Senators gave strong speeches of support for Judge \nSotomayor's nomination, including Senator Schumer, Senator Specter and \nSenator Cardin. Senator Franken, the newest Member of the Senate and \nnewest member of the Judiciary Committee, gave his first Senate speech. \nMost of us follow the tradition of waiting for our first Senate speech \nto make sure it is on a matter of some moment. In his case, it was as \nmomentous a matter as one could pick, the nomination of a Supreme Court \nJustice. Senator Franken eloquently spoke on her behalf.\n  We heard from Senator Lautenberg; Senator Dodd, my neighbor in the \nSenate, both in the row I sit and also in my Senate office, and a good \nfriend. Senators Baucus, Merkley, Akaka, Lieberman, Casey, Wyden, and \nBennet all spoke for her.\n  Statements of support for Judge Sotomayor yesterday came from both \nsides of the aisle. On the Republican side, Senator Martinez, who has \nbeen a strong supporter of Judge Sotomayor, gave a particularly moving \nspeech. Senator Bond, a former Governor, former attorney general, and \none who has appointed judges, joined him in announcing his intent to \nvote for this well-qualified nominee. My neighbors from New England, \nSenators Collins and Snowe, also spoke in favor of her nomination.\n  The troubling thing yesterday was to hear some critics of hers making \nunfounded insinuations about the integrity and character of this \noutstanding nominee. That is wrong. She is a judge of unimpeachable \ncharacter and integrity. These critics have also chosen to ignore her \nextensive record of judicial modesty and restraint from 17 years on the \nFederal bench. Instead they have focused on and mischaracterized her \nrulings in a handful, out of more than 3,600, of cases. That is \ninteresting, out of 3,600 cases, they could find only a tiny handful to \ncriticize, and they can criticize those only by mischaracterizing them.\n  Let me go to one area in particular. Some Republican Senators have \ntwisted Judge Sotomayor's participation in a unanimous Second Circuit \ndecision that applied a 123-year-old U.S. Supreme Court precedent to \nreject a challenge to a New York State law of restriction on chukka \nsticks, a martial arts device. What she was doing was following the \nprecedent of the Supreme Court; again, one of the reasons why it was a \nunanimous decision of the Second Circuit. Some have trumped up a straw \nman by ignoring the facts of Judge Sotomayor's decision. It is easy to \ncome to a conclusion if you ignore the facts and the law and just go to \nyour conclusion. Of course, that doesn't make it right. They ignored \nthe facts of her decision. They ignored the developing state of second \namendment law, and they ignored Judge Sotomayor's testimony during her \nconfirmation hearing, recognizing the individual right to bear arms \nthat is guaranteed by the second amendment.\n  In fact, in joining the per curiam decision in Maloney v. Cuomo, \nJudge Sotomayor followed and applied the holding of the Supreme Court \nthat the second amendment provides individuals with the right to keep \nand bear arms. When the Supreme Court handed down its decision in \nDistrict of Columbia v. Heller last year, I applauded the Court for \naffirming what so many Americans already believe. The second amendment \nprotects an individual's right to own a firearm. The Heller decision \nreaffirmed and strengthened our Bill of Rights. Vermont has some of the \nleast restrictive gun laws in the country. In fact, most would say they \nhave the least restrictive gun laws. One does not need a permit to \ncarry a concealed firearm in Vermont, if they don't have a felony \nconviction. But Vermonters are trusted to conduct themselves \nresponsibly and safely, and we do.\n  I am a native Vermonter. I have lived there all my life. I find \nVermonters do conduct themselves safely and responsibly. Similar to \nmany Vermonters, I grew up with firearms. I have enormous respect and \nappreciation for the freedoms the second amendment protects. In fact, I \nown many firearms. Similar to other rights protected by our Bill of \nRights, the second amendment right to keep and bear arms is one I \ncherish. Fortunately, I live in a rural area in Vermont. I can set up \ntargets and use my backyard as an impromptu pistol range and often do.\n  The Supreme Court's decision in Heller recognized that the second \namendment guarantees an individual the right to keep and bear arms \nagainst Federal restrictions. So before we go off using talking points \nand ignore what she did or ignore what she said, I thought it might be \ngood to kind of spoil the rhetoric by actually going to the facts.\n  The facts are these. At her confirmation hearing, Judge Sotomayor \nrepeatedly affirmed her view of the second amendment guarantees as set \nforth in the Heller decision. This seems to be ignored by some who \ncriticize her. In fact, I asked a question on it because it is \nimportant to me as a Vermonter, as a Senator and certainly as chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee. In response to my question, she testified:\n\n       I understand how important the right to bear arms is to \n     many, many Americans. In fact, one of my godchildren is a \n     member of the NRA, and I have friends who hunt. I understand \n     the individual right fully that the Supreme Court recognized \n     in Heller.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor reaffirmed that statement in answers to questions \nfrom Senators Kyl, Coburn, and Feingold.\n\n[[Page S8906]]\n\nJudge Sotomayor testified in response to a question from Senator Kyl:\n\n       The decision of the Court in Heller . . . recognized an \n     individual right to bear arms as applied to the Federal \n     Government.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor testified in response to Senator Coburn:\n\n       In the Supreme Court's decision in Heller, it recognized an \n     individual's right to bear arms as a right guaranteed by the \n     Second Amendment.\n\n  In response to Senator Feingold, Judge Sotomayor testified about \nHeller:\n\n       [T]he Supreme Court did hold that there is . . . an \n     individual right to bear arms, and . . . I fully accept that.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor participated on a Second Circuit panel in a case \ncalled Maloney v. Cuomo that was decided earlier this year in which the \nunanimous panel--let me emphasize, the unanimous panel--recognized the \nSupreme Court decision in Heller that the personal right to bear arms \nis guaranteed by the second amendment against Federal law restrictions.\n  Justice Scalia, arguably the most conservative Justice on the U.S. \nSupreme Court, said in his opinion in the Heller case that the Heller \ncase expressly left unresolved and explicitly reserved as a separate \nquestion whether the second amendment guarantee applies to the States \nand laws adopted by the States, whether the State of Vermont or any \nother State. In doing so, the Court left in place a series of Supreme \nCourt holdings from 1876 to 1894 that the second amendment does not \napply to the States.\n  I mention this because there are those who want Justices to not be \nactivists but to be traditionalists. Going back to 1876 to 1894 \nrecognizes a tradition of this country. The question posed to Judge \nSotomayor and the Second Circuit in Maloney involved a challenge by a \ncriminal defendant to a New York State law restriction on a martial \narts device called nunchucks or chukka sticks, not firearms. Indeed, in \nthat case the appellant had pleaded guilty to disorderly conduct, \nagreed to the destruction of the nunchucks as part of the plea, and the \ncharge of possession of the nunchucks in violation of New York law had \nbeen dismissed. The Second Circuit considered the case on appeal from a \ndenial of a subsequent declaratory judgment case.\n  In declining to overrule the trial judge--the trial judge would not \nset aside the State law against nunchucks--the Second Circuit panel \nemphasized that its decision was dictated by Supreme Court precedent, \nholding that: ``Where, as here, a Supreme Court precedent has direct \napplication in a case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some \nother line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the case \nwhich directly controls, leaving to the Supreme Court the prerogative \nof overruling its own decisions.' '' Had the Second Circuit acted \notherwise, it would have been seen as judicial activism and an \nunwillingness to adhere to Supreme Court precedent. That is something \nthat every single Member of this Chamber has said judges should do, \nfollow Supreme Court precedent.\n\n  Now Judge Sotomayor is criticized for doing what a Circuit Court of \nAppeals judge is supposed to do; that is, follow the precedent of the \nSupreme Court. She seems to be caught in a Hobson's choice. Had she \nviolated that rule, had they acted otherwise, had they refused to \nfollow Supreme Court precedent, I am sure she would be attacked as \nbeing a judicial activist. Come on. Let's be fair. When we have had \nnominees by Republican Presidents, we have heard over and over again \nhow Republicans want these people because they follow precedent. Here, \nsome Republicans are attacking Judge Sotomayor because she did follow \nprecedent, because she did do what a Court of Appeals judge is supposed \nto do.\n  In fact, the approach taken by the Second Circuit decision in Maloney \nwas adopted by some of the most respected, very conservative jurists in \nthe country. Judges Easterbrook and Posner, both renowned \nconservatives, people whom I hear quoted by the Republican side over \nand over again, serve on the Seventh Circuit. They agreed with the \nSecond Circuit panel. This may sound like it is getting into the weeds, \nbut what I am saying is, judges of all stripes ruled the same way. In \nNational Rifle Association v. City of Chicago, they cited the Second \nCircuit in Maloney. Judges Easterbrook and Posner refused to ignore the \ndirection of the Supreme Court to implement Supreme Court holdings, \neven if the reasoning in later opinions undermines their rationale and, \ninstead, ``leave to [the Supreme Court] the prerogative of overruling \nits own decisions.''\n  What I am saying is, conservative judges, liberal judges, and \nmoderate judges such as Judge Sotomayor all came to the same \nconclusion: You have to follow precedent. It may sound like I am doing \na tutorial for a law school class, but I thought rather than having the \nrhetoric, let's go to the facts and let's go to the law. Because both \nthe facts and the law are irrefutable.\n  If Republican Senators wish to criticize, let them criticize Justice \nScalia for the Supreme Court's decision in Heller to limit its \napplication against Federal Government restrictions and expressly \nreserve for another Supreme Court decision whether to incorporate the \nSecond Amendment right against the States. Judges Easterbook, Posner \nand Bauer of the Seventh Circuit and Judges Pooler, Sotomayor and \nKatzmann of the Second Circuit all followed Justice Scalia and the \nholdings of Supreme Court precedent.\n  Petitions for certiorari have been filed in both Maloney and National \nRifle Association and are currently pending before the Supreme Court. A \nthird, related decision by a panel of the Ninth Circuit is being \nreconsidered en banc by that Court of Appeals. Republican Senators \ninsisted during the Roberts and Alito hearings that a Supreme Court \nnominee must avoid making predictions about how she might rule in a \ncase that is likely to come before the Supreme Court. Yet Republican \nSenators have now reversed their approach to demand that Judge \nSotomayor ignore these standards and commit to how she intends to rule \non these cases and this issue if confirmed.\n  Recognizing that she would be unable to say how she would rule, I \nasked Judge Sotomayor whether she would approach these matters with an \nopen mind and she assured us that she would. I do not see how any fair \nobserver could regard her testimony as hostile to the Second Amendment \npersonal right to bear arms, a right she has embraced and recognizes.\n  The question of incorporation of the Second Amendment of the Bill of \nRights against the States is not merely likely to come before the \nCourt; petitions to decide it are currently pending before the Supreme \nCourt. There are well-recognized limits to how much a judicial nominee \ncan say during her confirmation hearings. Nominees do not answer \nquestions about cases or issues pending before the Supreme Court. It is \nstriking that many of those who today criticize Judge Sotomayor's \nadherence to these limits strongly defended them just a few years ago, \nwhen a Republican President was doing the nominating.\n  A 2005 Senate Republican Policy Committee Report commissioned by \nSenator Kyl concluded that ``the preservation of an independent \njudiciary'' depends on a nominee's ability to avoid signaling how she \nwill rule on upcoming cases. According to this report:\n\n       It is inappropriate for any nominee to give any signal as \n     to how he or she might rule on any issue that could come \n     before the court, even if the issue is not presented in a \n     currently pending case. If these novel ``prejudgment \n     demands'' were tolerated, the judicial confirmation process \n     would be radically transformed.\n\n  Senator Kyl's Republican Policy Committee Report raised concerns that \n``no judge can be fair and impartial if burdened by political \ncommitments that Senators try to extract during confirmation hearings'' \nand concluded that ``nothing less than judicial independence and the \npreservation of a proper separation of powers is at stake.''\n  Senators Sessions, Cornyn, Grassley, Coburn and Hatch referred to \nthese restrictions on a nominee's ability to answer questions during \nthe Senate's consideration of President Bush's Supreme Court nominees. \nDuring the Senate's consideration of the Roberts nomination, Senator \nSessions said:\n\n       Judges apply the facts to the legal requirements of the \n     situation, and only then make a decision. [Judge Roberts] \n     refused to make opinions on cases that may come before him. \n     Of course, he should not make opinions on that . . . He \n     should not be up there making opinions on the cases. That is \n     so obvious.\n\n\n[[Page S8907]]\n\n\n  At that time, Senator Cornyn shared their view and strongly defended \nRepublican nominees who refused to discuss legal issues that might \narise in the future. He said:\n\n       It undermines a nominee's ability to remain impartial once \n     he or she becomes a judge if he or she has already taken \n     positions on issues that might come before him or her on the \n     bench. . . . In other words, just because some Members may \n     ask these questions does not mean the President's nominee \n     should answer them. In accordance with long tradition and \n     norms of the Senate in the confirmation process, they should \n     not answer them.\n\n  At the beginning of confirmation hearings for John Roberts, Senator \nGrassley said: ``The fact is that no Senator has a right to insist on \nhis or her own issue-by-issue philosophy or seek commitments from \nnominees on specific litmus-test questions likely to come before that \nCourt.''\n  Senator Coburn criticized those Senators whom he said planned to vote \nagainst the Roberts nomination for his failure to state positions on \nspecific issues: ``The real reason they will be voting against John \nRoberts is because he would not give a definite answer on two or three \nof the social issues today that face us. He is absolutely right not to \ngive a definite answer because that says he prejudges, that he has made \nup his mind ahead of time.''\n  In 2005, Senator Hatch noted the ethical restrictions on a nominee's \nability to answer questions and said:\n\n       I have said Senators on the Judiciary Committee can ask any \n     question they want, no matter how stupid the question may be. \n     . . . But the judge does not have to answer those questions. \n     In fact, under the Canons of Judicial Ethics, judges should \n     not be opining or answering questions about issues that may \n     possibly come before them in the future.\n\n  Both Judge Roberts and Judge Alito followed their advice and did not \nanswer questions with any specificity about cases that could come \nbefore the Supreme Court. Judge Roberts testified during his hearing: \n``I think I should stay away from discussions of particular issues that \nare likely to come before the Court.'' During his hearing, Judge Alito \ntestified:\n\n       I think it's important to draw a distinction between issues \n     that could realistically come up before the courts and issues \n     that . . . are still very much in play . . . that's where I \n     feel that I must draw a line, because no issues that could \n     realistically come up, it would be improper for me to express \n     a view, and I would not reach a conclusion regarding any \n     issue like that before going through the whole judicial \n     process that I described.\n\n  I asked Judge Sotomayor during her hearing whether, if not bound by \nSecond Circuit or Supreme Court precedent, on whether second amendment \nrights should be considered ``fundamental rights,'' she would keep an \nopen mind in evaluating that legal question. Her response to me was \nstraightforward. She said:\n\n       You asked me whether I have an open mind on that question. \n     Absolutely.\n\n  She said:\n\n       I would not prejudge any question that came before me if I \n     was a Justice on the Supreme Court.\n\n  She could not have gone any further without prejudging the question \nJustice Scalia's opinion in Heller left open, one that is currently \npending before the Supreme Court.\n  In response to a question from Senator Coburn, Judge Sotomayor \ntestified: ``In the Supreme Court's decision in Heller, it recognized \nan individual's right to bear arms as a right guaranteed by the Second \nAmendment. . . . The Maloney case presented a different question. That \nwas whether that individual right would limit the activities that \nStates would do to limit the regulation of firearms.'' Judge Sotomayor \nalso told Senator Coburn at the hearing: ``I can assure your \nconstituents that I have a completely open mind on this question. I do \nnot close my mind to the fact and the understanding that there were \ndevelopments after the Supreme Court's rulings on incorporation that \nwill apply to this question or be considered.''\n  In response to a question from Senator Sessions on how she would come \ndown on the question of incorporation of the Second Amendment, Judge \nSotomayor testified: ``I have not prejudged the question that the \nSupreme Court left open in Heller . . . of whether this right should be \nincorporated against the States or not.'' She also answered Senator \nSessions' questions about the panel decision in Maloney:\n\n       Well, when the Court looks at that issue, it will decide is \n     it incorporated or not. And it will determine by applying the \n     test that it has subsequent to its old precedent, whether or \n     not it is fundamental and hence, incorporated. But the \n     Maloney decision was not addressing the merits of that \n     question. It was addressing what precedent said on that \n     issue.\n\n  The only other case in which Judge Sotomayor was involved as an \nappellate judge involving a Second Amendment contention was a case in \nwhich an illegal alien was convicted of distribution and possession \nwith intent to distribute approximately 1.2 kilograms of ``crack'' \ncocaine and of illegal possession of a firearm while an illegal alien. \nIn that case, United States v. Sanchez-Villar, decided in 2004--before \nthe Supreme Court's decision in Heller--involved an attempt to overturn \na jury conviction. The defendant in that case claimed he had received \nineffective assistance from his lawyer because his possession of the \nfirearm in New York did not provide probable cause for seizure and \narrest was rejected by a unanimous panel of the Second Circuit. The \nSecond Circuit unanimously rejected this claim. In so doing, the panel \nquoted in a footnote to language from an earlier Second Circuit \ndecision decided before Heller or Maloney. This is not unlike a number \nof cases in which Judge Sotomayor has upheld police actions when \nundertaken in good faith.\n\n  So I am disappointed by recent news accounts that the National Rifle \nAssociation has decided to ``score'' the vote on confirming Judge \nSotomayor to the Supreme Court. They did this in response to pressure \nfrom the Republican leader. In fact, this is the first time in the \nhistory of the NRA that it has ``scored'' a Supreme Court confirmation \nvote. The irony of this is, if she had been nominated by a Republican \nPresident, they would all be supporting her with her record.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord, at the conclusion of my statement, a copy of the July 24 letter \nfrom four members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, who have \nconsistently earned high ratings from the NRA, to the NRA's executive \nvice president and executive director.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. LEAHY. Congressmen Joe Baca, Solomon Ortiz, Silvestre Reyes, and \nJohn Salazar wrote:\n\n       [W]e are disappointed by the NRA's opposition to the \n     nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme \n     Court. It is not merited by either Judge Sotomayor's record \n     or hearing testimony.\n\n  In their letter, they point out that at her hearing Judge Sotomayor \n``emphasized that she has an `open mind' on the question of \nincorporation and `has not prejudged' the issue.''\n  In fact, they said:\n\n       Judge Sotomayor has said more than either of the two \n     previous Supreme Court nominees about the Second Amendment--\n     specifically, she said that it confers an individual right, \n     as recognized by the Supreme Court in its Heller decision.\n\n  The letter continues: ``Even more troubling, it appears you are \nholding Judge Sotomayor to a different standard than you held Judges \nRoberts and Alito when they were nominated to the Court, or for that \nmatter, any previous nominee to the Court. The double standard you have \nset for Judge Sotomayor is a disservice to all members of the NRA, \nparticularly those who are Hispanic'' and that ``we are mystified as to \nwhy the NRA is characterizing Judge Sotomayor as hostile to the rights \nof gun owners and evaluating Judge Sotomayor by a different standard \nthan that to which you have held previous Supreme Court nominees.''\n  I think it is a double standard. When Justices Roberts and Alito were \nnominated by a Republican President, Republicans did not have this \nstandard. When this woman was nominated by a Democratic President, \nsuddenly they change the standard. All I am saying is, they ought to \nfollow the same standards they followed when President Bush nominated \nthe two men he did now, when President Obama has nominated this woman \nto the Supreme Court.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the \nRecord letters of support for Judge Sotomayor from a large number of \nprosecutors, including the National District Attorneys Association.\n\n[[Page S8908]]\n\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                                    National Black\n\n\n                                      Prosecutors Association,\n\n                                        Chicago, IL, July 9, 2009.\n     Senator Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate Office \n         Bldg., Washington DC.\n     Senator Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate \n         Office Bldg., Washington DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Sessions: On behalf of the National \n     Black Prosecutors Association, representing local, state and \n     Federal African American prosecutors, it is my pleasure to \n     endorse the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the \n     position of Associate Justice of the United States Supreme \n     Court. It is noteworthy to mention that she will be this \n     nation's third female and first Latina United States Supreme \n     Court Justice. I highlight Justice Sotomayor's gender and \n     ethnicity only to point out that it is shocking that in its \n     220 year history, the United States Supreme Court has \n     previously had only two female justices, and never a Hispanic \n     justice. It is well overdue that qualified female nominees of \n     varying ethnicities be seriously considered for service on \n     the United States Supreme Court\n       Despite the adversity of being diagnosed with Type I \n     diabetes and shortly thereafter losing her father at the age \n     of nine, Judge Sotomayor was a scholastic achiever throughout \n     her elementary and high school years. While at Princeton \n     University, she fought for increased opportunities for Puerto \n     Rican students and to diversify the University's faculty and \n     curriculum. After graduating summa cum laude, she entered \n     Yale Law School, where she became the editor of the Yale Law \n     Journal.\n       We applaud Judge Sotomayor's distinguished career in public \n     service, which began with her service as a Manhattan \n     Assistant District Attorney. As a trial attorney, Judge \n     Sotomayor honed her skills, gaining firsthand experience with \n     the real world of crime, pursuing justice for the victims of \n     violent crimes. She was firm but fair as a United States \n     District Court Judge, exhibiting a great respect and \n     understanding of the United States Constitution and its \n     application in the twenty-first century. The opinions she has \n     authored since becoming a judge on the Court of Appeals in \n     1997 clearly show that she respects the law and hews close to \n     precedent. Judge Sotomayor's opinions are marked by a clear \n     recitation of the facts and lengthy recitation of the law \n     that she believed to be applicable to the case. In short, \n     Judge Sotomayor's opinions are akin to a road map; one can \n     easily discern where she started in her analysis, where she \n     ended up, and how she got there. This is all one can ask from \n     an impartial jurist; not that you will always agree with the \n     conclusion of a justice, but that issues, arguments and \n     parties will receive a fair hearing, and the final \n     determination can be easily tracked and understood.\n       Judge Sonia Sotomayor's background, life experiences, and \n     accomplishments despite the odds are compelling to say the \n     least. Her intellect, respect for the law and ability to be \n     impartial more importantly would mean that this country would \n     have a Supreme Court Justice that would, without hesitation, \n     examine issues and reach conclusions based on an \n     interpretation of the law and constitutional principles. This \n     country needs a Justice is sensitive to the law's impact on \n     everyday life.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Carmen M. Lineberger,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     July 2, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Dirksen \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Dirksen Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators: As former colleagues of the Honorable Sonia \n     Sotomayor during her years as a prosecutor in the Office of \n     the New York County District Attorney, we write to express \n     our wholehearted support for her nomination to the United \n     States Supreme Court.\n       We served together during some of the most difficult years \n     in our City's history. Crime was soaring, a general sense of \n     disorder prevailed in the streets, and the popular attitude \n     was that increasing violence was inevitable. It was in this \n     setting that Sonia decided to start her career, not in a \n     judge's chambers or at a high-powered law firm, but rather in \n     the halls of New York's Criminal Courts, as an assistant \n     district attorney.\n       She began as a ``rookie'' in 1979, working long hours \n     prosecuting an enormous caseload of misdemeanors before \n     judges managing overwhelming dockets. Sonia so distinguished \n     herself in this challenging assignment that she was among the \n     very first in her starting class to be selected to handle \n     felonies. She prosecuted a wide variety of felony cases, \n     including serving as co-counsel at a notorious murder trial. \n     She developed a specialty in the investigation and \n     prosecution of child pornography cases. Throughout all of \n     this, she impressed us as one who was singularly determined \n     in fighting crime and violence. For Sonia, service as a \n     prosecutor was a way to bring order to the streets of a City \n     she dearly loves. At the same time, she had an abiding sense \n     of justice that spoke of the traditions of an Office headed \n     by Thomas Dewey, Frank Hogan and Robert Morgenthau.\n       Few of us can forget her careful and painstaking jury \n     selection. As diligently as she prepared her cases, she also \n     readied her juries to evaluate the evidence and apply the \n     facts to the law as they were instructed by the judge. As any \n     trial lawyer knows, this is no easy task. Sonia emphasized \n     that it is both a privilege and a duty to sit on a case, and \n     jurors must do so without bias or prejudice.\n       We are proud to have served with Sonia Sotomayor. She \n     solemnly adheres to the rule of law and believes that it \n     should be applied equally and fairly to all Americans. As a \n     group, we have different world views and political \n     affiliations, but our support for Sonia is entirely non-\n     partisan. And the fact that so many of us have remained \n     friends with Sonia over three decades speaks well, we think, \n     of her warmth and collegiality.\n       We urge all Senators to approve Sonia's nomination, as our \n     country will be better off with Judge Sotomayor sitting on \n     our nation's highest court.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n         Steven M.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman,\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: On behalf \n     of the National District Attorneys Association, the oldest \n     and largest organization representing America's state and \n     local prosecutors, we offer our full support for the \n     nomination of the Honorable Sonia Sotomayor to become the \n     next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n       Because state and local prosecutors handle 95 percent of \n     the criminal prosecutions nationally, rulings by the Supreme \n     Court have far-reaching, serious impacts upon criminal cases \n     in state courthouses across the country. As former \n     prosecutors yourselves, you have a unique appreciation of our \n     concerns.\n       We practice where the law is truly tested: not in the \n     deliberative atmosphere of an appellate courtroom, but on the \n     streets where police must make split-second choices in \n     dangerous situations and in trial court situations that \n     sometimes give prosecutors and police only a moment to \n     analyze and react. It is important to the National District \n     Attorneys Association, and to the tens of thousands of \n     prosecutors we represent, that the next Supreme Court justice \n     be well steeped in the law and its practical applications.\n       I have had the opportunity to review the judicial record of \n     Judge Sotomayor, particularly in areas important to \n     prosecutors such as criminal and constitutional law. Through \n     her rulings, Judge Sotomayor reveals a deep understanding of \n     the law. As a prosecutor, I find her to employ a thoughtful \n     analysis of legal precedent and the rule of law and apply \n     that law to the specific facts of each case.\n       Just as important as her sophisticated knowledge of the \n     law, as a former prosecutor and trial court judge Judge \n     Sotomayor displays an understanding of the impact of those \n     laws on law enforcement, victims and defendants. In \n     interviews with prosecutors who served with Judge Sotomayor \n     in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, Judge Sotomayor \n     has often been described as a ``tough and fearless'' \n     prosecutor. She vigorously and effectively prosecuted child \n     pornographers, murderers, burglars and many other ``street \n     crimes'' in the heart of New York City. She worked closely \n     with law enforcement, deconstructed complex crimes, \n     interviewed witnesses and investigated crime scenes. That \n     kind of legal experience, combined with her 17 years on the \n     federal bench, provide Judge Sotomayor with unique and \n     unprecedented qualifications to be on the Supreme Court.\n       Judge Sotomayor's depth of experience with all aspects of \n     the law--as a prosecutor, a private litigator, a District \n     Court Judge and as a Federal Judge--has made her into an \n     exemplary judge and an outstanding nominee to serve on our \n     nation's highest court. She possesses wisdom, intelligence \n     and a real world training that would bring important insight \n     to Supreme Court decisions. The National District Attorneys \n     Association believes that Judge Sotomayor would be a welcome \n     addition to the Supreme Court.\n       We are happy to offer our full support for Judge \n     Sotomayor's nomination to serve as a\n\n[[Page S8909]]\n\n     Supreme Court Associate Justice and encourage her swift \n     nomination by the Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Joseph I.

Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Minority Member,\n     Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: On behalf \n     of the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys (APA), we offer \n     our support to the Honorable Sonia Sotomayor's nomination to \n     become the next Associate Justice of the United States \n     Supreme Court. APA is a national ``think tank'' that \n     represents all prosecutors and provides additional resources \n     such as training and technical assistance in an effort to \n     develop proactive innovative prosecutorial practices that \n     prevent crime, ensures equal justice and makes our \n     communities safer.\n       Judge Sotomayor's proven record as a prosecutor, private \n     litigator, District Court Judge and Federal Appellate Judge \n     has shown her dedication to the law, equality of justice and \n     ensuring safer communities. Her distinguished tenure as a \n     Federal District Court Judge would bring additional insight \n     about the trial process to the Supreme Court.\n       Judge Sotomayor, with her trial experience as both a trial \n     judge and prosecutor, would bring practical experience to the \n     highest court in the land. Therefore, the APA fully supports \n     Judge Sotomayor's nomination to the Supreme Court and we urge \n     her confirmation.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n     Glenn F. Ivey,\n       Chairman of the Board of Directors, Association of \n     Prosecuting Attorneys.\n     David R. LaBahn,\n       President and CEO, Association of Prosecuting Attorneys.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record letters of support for Judge Sotomayor from a broad cross \nsection of law enforcement agencies, including the National Association \nof Police Organizations, the National Sheriffs' Association, and the \nSheriff of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                              National Association\n\n\n                                of Police Organizations, Inc.,\n\n                                     Alexandria, VA, June 5, 2009.\n     Re Endorsement of Judge Sonia Sotomayor for the Untied States \n         Supreme Court.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: On behalf \n     of the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO), \n     representing more than 241,000 law enforcement officers \n     throughout the United States, I am writing to advise you of \n     our endorsement of the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor \n     for the United States Supreme Court.\n       Throughout her distinguished career spanning three decades, \n     Judge Sotomayor has worked at almost every level of our \n     judicial system, giving her a depth of experience and \n     knowledge that will be valuable on our nation's highest \n     court. After five years as the Assistant District Attorney in \n     Manhattan, she went into private practice in 1984 to become a \n     corporate litigator. In 1991, she began her career as a \n     federal judge with her nomination to the United States \n     District Court by President Bush. In 1992, she was promoted \n     to the United States Appeals Court for the Second Circuit by \n     President Clinton, where she has served for the past eleven \n     years.\n       Through her years of trial experience as an Assistant \n     District Attorney, Judge Sotomayor gained an understanding of \n     what law enforcement officers go through day to day in their \n     jobs. Her familiarity with criminal procedure and qualified \n     immunity are evident in the rulings and findings she has \n     issued during her seventeen year career as a federal judge. \n     Judge Sotomayor has shown that as a jurist she has a keen \n     awareness of the real-world implications of judicial rulings, \n     an important aspect when it comes to evaluating the actions \n     of law enforcement officers and to keeping officers and the \n     communities they serve safe.\n       As a Supreme Court Justice, NAPO believes Judge Sotomayor's \n     extensive experience in the judicial system and the knowledge \n     she has gained as a prosecutor and judge will serve our \n     nation well. Therefore, we urge you to confirm the nomination \n     of Judge Sonia Sotomayor for the United States Supreme Court. \n     If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me, or \n     NAPO's Executive Director, Bill Johnson.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Thomas J.

Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: On behalf \n     of the National Sheriffs' Association, we are writing to \n     express our support for the nomination of Sonia Sotomayor to \n     be the Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n       As you know, in most jurisdictions, sheriffs have several \n     responsibilities in the criminal justice system including law \n     enforcement and the administration of our jails. Because of \n     the sheriff's role in enforcing the law and administering the \n     jails, there are many occasions where the sheriffs duties are \n     directly impacted by the actions of the United States Supreme \n     Court. Sheriffs across the country can recite examples in our \n     communities, where criminals have gone free because of \n     technicalities. In many cases, an overriding problem for law \n     enforcement throughout the United States has been the \n     courts--on the federal, state and local level.\n       Because of the critical role that the court plays in our \n     criminal justice system, the National Sheriffs' Association \n     is urging the Senate to confirm Judge Sotomayor who we \n     believe has the qualifications, judicial philosophy and \n     commitment to interpreting the Constitution with an abiding \n     sense of fairness and justice.\n       Judge Sonia Sotomayor's real world experience as a \n     prosecutor who pursued justice for victims of violent crimes \n     as well as a federal judge at both the district and circuit \n     court levels with an unassailable integrity make her an ideal \n     nominee to serve on the Supreme Court. We believe her \n     judicial philosophy in criminal justice to be sound and \n     support her common sense approach in reviewing criminal \n     cases.\n       As one of the largest law enforcement organizations in the \n     nation, the National Sheriffs' Association is calling on the \n     United States Senate to approve Sonia Sotomayor to be the \n     next Associate Justice of United States Supreme Court.\n           Respectfully,\n     Sheriff David A. Goad,\n       President.\n     Aaron D.

Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Committee on the Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy: As Sheriff of the Los Angeles County \n     Sheriff's Department, which is the largest Sheriff's \n     Department in the country in one of the most diverse counties \n     in the world, I support the confirmation of Judge Sonia \n     Sotomayor as a United States Supreme Court Associate Justice \n     and, respectfully, urge your Committee to support her \n     nomination.\n       As you know, Judge Sotomayor has had the gamut of legal \n     experience beginning with her legal education from Yale \n     University. Judge Sotomayor's work as an Assistant District \n     Attorney for the New York County District Attorney's Office \n     and her work in private practice, led to her nomination by \n     President George H.W. Bush to the United States District \n     Court for the Southern District of New York, for which she \n     was confirmed by the United States Senate. She served in that \n     capacity until President Bill Clinton nominated her to the \n     United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, \n     followed by her second Senate confirmation.\n       Judge Sotomayor possesses all the traits important for \n     service on the United States Supreme Court Her educational \n     background, diverse legal experience, and personal story have \n     all contributed to her current success and will continue to \n     positively shape her future on the United States Supreme \n     Court.\n       Judge Sotomayor is an excellent nominee for Associate \n     Supreme Court Justice. I am confident that confirmation of \n     her nomination would be a great step forward for our Supreme \n     Court and our Country. Thank you for your service to our \n     Country and making these critical decisions that profoundly \n     impact our Democracy.

The interests of the nation will be well served \n     when she assumes her seat on the Supreme Court.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                               Washington, DC,\n\n                                                     June 8, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy, Chairman,\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions, Ranking Member,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Sessions, I am writing in support \n     of President Obama's nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to \n     serve as associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United \n     States. I believe that Judge Sotomayor's inspiring life \n     story, and especially her experience as a prosecutor in New \n     York City, where I spent most of my career, demonstrate a \n     strength of character that will serve her well on our \n     nation's highest court.\n       Judge Sotomayor grew up in a housing project in the South \n     Bronx. I patrolled the streets of the South Bronx in the \n     1970s and know what a tough environment that was. I did not \n     have the privilege of working with Assistant District \n     Attorney Sotomayor, but recently I have spoken to several of \n     my colleagues who did work with her, and they give her \n     nothing but rave reviews. They were impressed with her \n     intelligence, her strong work ethic, and her fierce \n     determination to prosecute criminals, and they use words like \n     ``salt of the earth'' to describe her.\n       I believe it is important to note that in the questionnaire \n     that she filled out for the Judiciary Committee, Judge \n     Sotomayor included several criminal cases from her years as a \n     prosecutor in a list of the 10 litigated matters in her \n     career that she considers ``most significant.'' These include \n     the case of the so-called ``Tarzan murderer,'' as well as a \n     child pornography case that Ms. Sotomayor pursued \n     relentlessly when others seemed to consider it a low \n     priority.\n       Like many others, I have been inspired by Judge Sotomayor's \n     personal story. Through hard work and determination, she \n     earned degrees from Princeton and the Yale Law School. After \n     getting her law degree, she could have cashed in at a blue-\n     chip law firm, but she chose instead to take a low-paid \n     position in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, where \n     she gained priceless real-world experience that cannot help \n     but inform her judgment as she decides criminal cases that \n     come before her.\n       Sonia Sotomayor went out of her way to stand shoulder to \n     shoulder with those of us in public safety at a time when New \n     York City needed strong, tough, and fair prosecutors. I am \n     confident that she will continue to bring honor to herself, \n     and now to the Supreme Court, when she is confirmed for this \n     critically important position.\n       Thank you for your consideration.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              John F.

LaPierre and Cox: As Members of Congress whose \n     strong support for the rights of gun owners has earned us \n     consistently high ratings from the NRA, we are disappointed \n     by the NRA's opposition to the nomination of Judge Sonia \n     Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court. It is not merited by \n     either Judge Sotomayor's judicial record or hearing \n     testimony. Even more troubling, it appears that you are \n     holding Judge Sotomayor to a different standard than you held \n     Judges Roberts and Alito when they were nominated to the \n     Court, or for that matter, any previous nominee to the Court. \n     The double standard you have set for Judge Sotomayor is a \n     disservice to all members of the NRA, particularly those who \n     are Hispanic.\n       We support the confirmation of Judge Sotomayor. She is \n     eminently qualified by her experience as a prosecutor, \n     district judge and 12 years on the Second Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. Her judicial record is one marked by modesty and \n     restraint, prompting the New York Times to write that her \n     ``judicial opinions are marked by diligence, depth and \n     unflashy competence'' and are ``models of modern judicial \n     craftsmanship, which prizes careful attention to the facts in \n     the record and a methodical application of layers of legal \n     principles.''

And we believe \n     that the historic act of putting the first Hispanic Justice \n     on the Court, particularly one so well qualified for the job, \n     is an important step for our country.\n       Judge Sotomayor has said more than either of the two \n     previous Supreme Court nominees about the Second Amendment--\n     specifically, she said that it confers an individual right, \n     as recognized by the Supreme Court in its Heller decision. \n     Judge Sotomayor was then asked repeatedly to discuss her \n     position on incorporation, even though there is now a circuit \n     split on the issue and there are petitions pending asking the \n     Supreme Court to take the issue. Judges are prohibited by ABA \n     rules from commenting on pending cases, making it \n     inappropriate for Judge Sotomayor to state a definitive view. \n     Nonetheless, at the hearing on her nomination, she emphasized \n     that she has an ``open mind'' on the question of \n     incorporation and has ``not prejudged'' the issue.\n       Conversely, when now-Chief Justice Roberts testified at his \n     confirmation hearing facing a similar circuit split prior to \n     the Heller decision on the issue of the individual right to \n     bear arms, he declined to discuss the issue at all, saying \n     only: ``That's sort of the issue that's likely to come before \n     the Supreme Court when you have conflicting views.'' And now-\n     Justice Alito was not even asked a question about the \n     subject. Yet the NRA voiced no opposition to these candidates \n     who were less forthcoming on issues of importance to us.\n       Your letter cites two cases as evidence that Judge \n     Sotomayor is hostile to the Second Amendment. Your analysis \n     of those cases is either mistaken or deliberately misleading.\n       United States v. Sanchez-Villar, on which Judge Sotomayor \n     was a member of the panel, was decided in 2004, four years \n     before the Supreme Court's landmark decision in District of \n     Columbia v. Heller. That decision was consistent not just \n     with 2nd Circuit precedent, but with the weight of authority \n     at the time; in 2004, every circuit but the Fifth that had \n     considered the question had similarly concluded that the \n     Second Amendment did not protect an individual right. Your \n     letter fails to mention either fact.\n       Your characterization of Maloney v. Cuomo is similarly \n     erroneous. First, Maloney did not involve firearms at all. \n     The degree to which it was not considered an important case \n     at the time can be gleaned from the fact that no outside \n     entity or organization, including the NRA, filed an amicus \n     brief in that case, in contrast to the multiple amici filed \n     in National Rifle Association v. City of Chicago.\n       Second, the Maloney court did not reject the concept of \n     incorporation; it recognized the prerogative of the Supreme \n     Court, which in Heller explicitly did not overrule prior \n     precedent on incorporation. The panel wrote, ``[w]here, as \n     here, a Supreme Court precedent has direct application in a \n     case, yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other \n     line of decisions, the Court of Appeals should follow the \n     case which directly controls, leaving to the Supreme Court \n     the prerogative of overruling its own decisions.''\n       Two of the most renowned conservative jurists in the \n     country, Judges Posner and Easterbrook of the Seventh Circuit \n     Court of Appeals, recently endorsed the Second Circuit panel \n     opinion in Maloney. In National Rifle Association v. City of \n     Chicago, Judge Easterbrook's opinion explicitly stated that \n     the court ``agree[d] with Maloney.''\n       Even Mr. Maloney himself said the decision in this case was \n     appropriate: ``I did not expect to win . . . it was clear to \n     me that they had a very solid basis for saying that the \n     Second Amendment is not incorporated and that essentially \n     they are powerless to do anything about it, they had a \n     defensible position there.'' Mike Pesca, ``High Court May \n     Review Personal Weapons Ruling,'' NPR Legals Affairs, June 1, \n     2009.\n       In conclusion, we are mystified as to why the NRA is \n     characterizing Judge Sotomayor as hostile to the rights of \n     gun owners and evaluating Judge Sotomayor by a different \n     standard than that to which you have held previous Supreme \n     Court nominees. We are concerned that your opposition will \n     alienate Hispanic NRA members and dismayed that you may \n     unnecessarily force some well-intentioned Senators to choose \n     between disappointing the NRA or infuriating their Hispanic \n     constituents. We hope that you will reconsider your position \n     on Judge Sotomayor.\n           Sincerely,\n     Joe Baca,\n     Silvestre Reyes,\n     Solomon P. Ortiz,\n     John T. Salazar.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I see Senator Lincoln on the floor, one \nof my most distinguished colleagues, and I yield to her.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arkansas.\n\n[[Page S8911]]\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. He is a good and trusted friend, and I appreciate all the \nhard work he and all of our colleagues on the Judiciary Committee have \ndone and all the efforts they have put into this nomination and hearing \nprocess.\n  I rise today to discuss what I think is one of the most consequential \nand long-lasting decisions in the duties a Senator can perform under \nthe Constitution--the confirmation of a U.S. Supreme Court Justice. It \nis a rare practice, so rare, in fact, that my consideration of the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor will mark only the third Supreme \nCourt nomination I will have considered since I was first elected to \nthe Senate in 1998.\n  Even though the President today making this Supreme Court nomination \nhas changed from the previous two nominees, as the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee has mentioned, my standards and the standards of \nany of us for evaluating a nominee have not changed, nor should they \nhave changed.\n  I believe the people of Arkansas, our great State, and certainly our \nNation deserve a Supreme Court Justice who is able to interpret and \napply the rule of law fairly without political favor or bias. Ensuring \nthat a nominee meets this standard is an obligation I have sworn to \nuphold as a Senator and, moreover, is the standard I expect for a \nlifetime appointment to our Nation's highest Court.\n  In making my decision about Judge Sotomayor, I have taken a number of \nfactors into account in evaluating her qualifications for serving on \nour Nation's highest Court.\n  First among these are the opinions of my constituents in my home \nState of Arkansas, including those in the legal community. I have heard \nfrom a number of Arkansans who have expressed strong support for Judge \nSonia Sotomayor, emphasizing her unique background, impressive resume, \nand solid judicial record.\n  I also gained a lot of insight when we met at length in June. I was \nable to learn firsthand about who she is as a person, her temperament, \nand her unique life experiences--all of which I believe will help give \nher the ability to give every litigant who comes before the Supreme \nCourt a fair shake.\n  Arkansans can readily identify with her because Judge Sotomayor is no \nstranger to hard work. She was born in New York, and is the daughter of \nparents who came to the United States from Puerto Rico. After her \nfather died, when she was young, Judge Sotomayor was raised by her \nmother, a nurse, a hard-working woman with tremendous values. She went \non to become valedictorian of her high school, a member of Phi Beta \nKappa at Princeton, and editor of the Law Review at Yale Law School.\n  She has a breadth of professional experience, having served as an \nassistant district attorney and in private practice before beginning \nher 17 years serving as a Federal judge. She has a long history, and, \nagain, one that starts with hard work and dedication to hard work.\n  Arkansas is known for its ability to grow self-made Americans, and \nthose are Americans who are no strangers to hard work. They understand \nwhat is involved in putting into who you are, and what you are trying \nto become, and what it is you want to achieve on behalf of others.\n  Judge Sotomayor even told me in our personal meeting that she had \nentered her practice in real estate and business law because she had a \ngreat appreciation for business and the industries of this great \ncountry and she wanted to increase her knowledge of corporate law and \nbroaden her experience.\n  Moreover, I was impressed during our meeting with her eagerness to \nlearn more about Arkansas and her attentiveness to what issues were \nmost important to my constituents in my home State of Arkansas.\n  The Senate Judiciary Committee hearings also provided me with an \nopportunity to learn about her record and judicial philosophy. I was \nable to monitor the hearings and watch her performance under intense \nscrutiny and pressure, and I was impressed with her knowledge, her \ncomposure, and her candor.\n  Given the weight of this decision and the responsibilities I have to \nmy constituents and my country, I have carefully examined the \ninformation available about Judge Sotomayor's nomination and am ready \nto announce I will support Judge Sonia Sotomayor for the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  I have confidence, as she made clear through the committee hearings, \nthat she understands a judge's obligation is first and foremost a \n``fidelity to the law.''\n  As the chairman of the Judiciary Committee mentioned earlier, I was \nraised as an avid duck hunter and a gun owner. Gun ownership is a \nunique part of my State's heritage. I was pleased to hear Judge \nSotomayor made a promise before the Senate Judiciary Committee to have \nan open mind on the issue of the second amendment and to understand \nwhat it means in terms of our rights as American citizens.\n  In response to questioning, Judge Sotomayor expressed caution in \ndeclaring how she would rule on an unsettled constitutional issue \nlikely to come before the Supreme Court before hearing the arguments \nand studying the opinions before her. I would have been concerned about \na nominee who had already made up their mind about an unsettled legal \nissue that is likely to come before the Court. Her responsibility is to \nnot come in there prejudging or predetermined in her decisions, but to \ncome to the Court with an open mind.\n  Based on her substantial record, serving on two courts, I am \nsatisfied Judge Sotomayor will give future cases involving the second \namendment and the rights of Americans to own firearms for recreation \nand self-protection a very fair hearing. I am also satisfied that her \npast rulings on these issues follow precedent and fall within the \njudicial mainstream.\n  And I think Senator Sessions mentioned some of that in his comments \nin terms of being judicial mainstream.\n  Overall, I appreciated Judge Sotomayor's approach to the judiciary \nhearings and her willingness to respond to questions from Senators on \nboth sides of the aisle on many important topics.\n  Based on her answers, I believe Judge Sotomayor cares more about \nfollowing the law and maintaining the respect for the judiciary than \nshe does about politics and ideology.\n  As Judge Sotomayor stated:\n\n       The task of a judge is not to make law. It is to apply the \n     law.\n\n  Finally, I have again searched my conscience and reflected on my \nprinciples as a Senator for the people of the great State of Arkansas, \nusing my experiences a legislator both here and in the House of \nRepresentatives and also as a farmer's daughter, my experience as a \nwife, a mother, a neighbor, to evaluate a decision of such great \nweight.\n  It has become apparent to me Judge Sotomayor does meet the test to \nserve in our Nation's highest Court. I base this conclusion on the \nrespect and support she has earned from those in my home State, \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle who know her well, on the \nevidence and the record from her own comments and those of her \ncolleagues, that she has had an abiding respect for the Court's \ndecisions, and that she understands the value of continuity in our law.\n  We also see the support from industry representatives, such as the \nChamber of Commerce, as well as labor organizations. The Senate \nJudiciary Committee received a letter of support for Judge Sotomayor's \nnomination from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest \nbusiness federation, representing businesses and organizations of every \nsize, sector, and region.\n  The U.S. Chamber wrote, in their letter:\n\n       Pursuant to our long-standing endorsement policy, the \n     Chamber evaluated Judge Sotomayor's record from the \n     standpoint of legal scholarship, judicial temperament, and an \n     understanding of business and economic issues. Based on the \n     Chamber's evaluation of her judicial record, Judge Sotomayor \n     is well-qualified to serve as an Associate Justice of the \n     U.S. Supreme Court.\n       Her extensive experience both as a commercial litigator and \n     as a trial judge would provide the U.S. Supreme Court with a \n     much needed perspective on the issues that business litigants \n     face. Consistent with her Senate testimony, the Chamber \n     expects Judge Sotomayor to engage in fair and evenhanded \n     application of the laws affecting American businesses.\n\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the letter to the \nSenate\n\n[[Page S8912]]\n\nJudiciary Committee from the Chamber of Commerce be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Chamber of Commerce\n\n\n                              of the United States of America,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: The U.S. \n     Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business federation \n     representing more than three million businesses and \n     organizations of every size, sector, and region, announced \n     today its support of the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor \n     to serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. The Chamber urges members \n     of the Senate Judiciary Committee to vote in favor of \n     reporting Judge Sotomayor's nomination for consideration by \n     the full Senate.\n       Pursuant to our long-standing endorsement policy, the \n     Chamber evaluated Judge Sotomayor's record from the \n     standpoint of legal scholarship, judicial temperament, and an \n     understanding of business and economic issues. Based on the \n     Chamber's evaluation of her judicial record, Judge Sotomayor \n     is well-qualified to serve as an Associate Justice of the \n     U.S. Supreme Court. Her extensive experience both as a \n     commercial litigator and as a trial judge would provide the \n     U.S. Supreme Court with a much needed perspective on the \n     issues that business litigants face. Consistent with her \n     Senate testimony, the Chamber expects Judge Sotomayor to \n     engage in fair and evenhanded application of the laws \n     affecting American businesses.\n       The Chamber urges your support of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as \n     Associate Justice of the United States.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                              R. Bruce Josten,\n\n                                         Executive Vice President,\n                                               Government Affairs.\n\n  Mrs. LINCOLN. Madam President, I do believe Judge Sotomayor will make \nan excellent Supreme Court Justice and she will give all who come \nbefore the Court on which she is poised to serve a fair hearing and the \nattention and respect they deserve. So in this very important decision \nthat each of us as Senators must make, I am proud to be able to support \nher nomination.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, once again, the Senate is being called \nupon to do its constitutional duty to consider a nomination to the U.S. \nSupreme Court. Positions on the Supreme Court are hugely significant \ngiven their lifetime tenures and the impact of the Court's decisions on \nthe lives of Americans. Our votes on Supreme Court nominees are among \nthe most significant that we cast.\n  I commend Chairman Leahy for the extraordinarily thorough and fair \nhearings the Judiciary Committee held on this nomination. It has given \nus a very extensive record upon which we can base our judgment. I have \nreviewed the nominee's qualifications, temperament, and background to \ndetermine if she is likely to bring to the Court an ideology that \ndistorts her legal judgment or brings into question her openmindedness. \nI believe it is clear that Judge Sotomayor satisfies the essential \nrequirements of openmindedness and judicial temperament, and her \ndecisions as a judge fall well within the mainstream of our \njurisprudence.\n\n  Judge Sotomayor's judicial career has received bipartisan support. \nShe was nominated first to the district court in the Southern District \nof New York by President George H.W. Bush. The Senate confirmed her \nnomination. President Clinton nominated Judge Sotomayor to be a circuit \ncourt judge, and the Senate overwhelmingly confirmed her nomination to \nthat position.\n  The American Bar Association Standing Committee evaluated Judge \nSotomayor and interviewed more than 500 judges, lawyers, law \nprofessors, and community representatives from across the United \nStates. They analyzed Judge Sotomayor's opinions, speeches, and other \nwritings. They read reports of Reading Groups comprised of recognized \nexperts in the substantive areas of the law that they reviewed, and \nthey conducted an in-depth personal interview of the nominee. In the \nwords of the committee:\n\n       The Standing Committee's investigation of a nominee for the \n     United States Supreme Court is based upon the premise that \n     the nominee must possess exceptional professional \n     qualifications. The significance, range, and complexity and \n     nation-wide impact of issues that such a nominee will \n     confront on the Court demands no less.\n\n  After that extensive investigation, the American Bar Association gave \nJudge Sotomayor their highest rating unanimously, rating her ``well \nqualified.''\n  Some colleagues have expressed concern over the differences in \nlanguage and ideas they thought they observed in Judge Sotomayor while \nsitting as a judge in the courtroom and as a citizen outside the \ncourtroom. For example, one colleague put it this way during Judge \nSotomayor's confirmation hearing:\n\n       I want to ask your assistance this morning to try to help \n     us reconcile two pictures that I think have emerged during \n     the course of this hearing. One is, of course, as Senator \n     Schumer and others have talked about, your lengthy tenure on \n     the Federal bench as a trial judge and court of appeals \n     judge. And then there's the other picture that has emerged \n     that--from your speeches and your other writings.\n\n  Our colleague went on to say the following:\n\n       I actually agree that your judicial record strikes me as \n     pretty much in the mainstream of judicial decision-making by \n     district court judges and by court of appeals judges on the \n     Federal bench.\n\n  And he said in conclusion then:\n\n       I guess part of what we need to do is to reconcile those--\n\n  Referring to the two different pictures he had.\n  Let's assume for a moment there is a difference between Judge \nSotomayor's rulings in the courtroom and those personal views she \nexpressed outside of the courtroom. If so, aren't we looking for people \nwho can apply the law on the bench, even if he or she has a different \npersonal opinion? At the end of the day, we want our judges to leave \ntheir personal views outside of the courtroom. That is the essence of \nan impartial judiciary. In other words, Judge Sotomayor has \ndemonstrated the very trait that she is accused by some of lacking: the \nability to leave her personal opinions at the courthouse door.\n  The Congressional Research Service has analyzed Judge Sotomayor's \nrecord and has concluded the following:\n\n       Perhaps the most consistent characteristic of Judge \n     Sotomayor's approach as an appellate judge has been an \n     adherence to the doctrine of stare decisis (i.e, the \n     upholding of past judicial precedents). Other characteristics \n     appear to include what many would describe as a careful \n     application of particular facts at issue in a case and a \n     dislike for situations in which the court might be seen as \n     overstepping its judicial role.\n\n  Well, that is the opposite of an activist judge imposing her views \ndespite the law.\n  We all have personal views and sympathies. Some judges, regrettably, \ncan't lay those aside when making their judicial calls. Judge Sotomayor \nhas proven in her judicial career that she can, while faithfully \napplying the principles of the U.S. Constitution.\n  So today, once again, the U.S. Senate is being called upon to do its \nconstitutional duty and consider a nomination to the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Positions on the Supreme Court are hugely significant given \ntheir lifetime tenures and the impact of the Court's decisions on the \nlives of Americans. Our votes on Supreme Court nominees are among the \nmost significant that we cast.\n  Article II, section 2 of the Constitution simply provides that: \n``[The President] shall nominate, and by and with the Advice and \nConsent of the Senate shall appoint . . . Judges of the Supreme Court . \n. . Without specific constitutional guidance, each senator must \ndetermine what qualities he or she thinks a Supreme Court Justice \nshould have, and what scope of inquiry is necessary to determine if the \nprospective nominee has these qualities.\n  This will be the twelfth Supreme Court nomination on which I will \nhave voted. Each time, I have reviewed the nominee's qualifications, \ntemperament and background to determine if the nominee is likely to \nbring to the court an ideology that distorts his or her legal judgment \nor brings into question his or her open-mindedness. I believe that \nJudge Sotomayor satisfies the essential requirements of open-mindedness \nand judicial temperament and her decisions as a judge fell well within \nthe mainstream of our jurisprudence.\n  Judge Sotomayor graduated as valedictorian of her class at Blessed \nSacrament and at Cardinal Spellman High School in New York. She \ncontinued to excel at Princeton University, graduating summa cum laude, \nand Phi Beta\n\n[[Page S8913]]\n\nKappa. She was a corecipient of the M. Taylor Pyne Prize, the highest \nhonor Princeton awards to an undergraduate. At Yale Law School, Judge \nSotomayor served as an editor of the Yale Law Journal.\n  In her 30-year legal career, Judge Sotomayor has been a Federal \ncircuit and trial court judge, a civil commercial litigator in private \npractice, and a State prosecutor. She served as an assistant district \nattorney in the New York County District Attorney's Office and later \nworked in private practice.\n  Judge Sotomayor's judicial career has received bipartisan support. \nDuring the 102nd Congress, President George H.W. Bush nominated Judge \nSotomayor to be a district judge on the Southern District of New York. \nOn August 11, 1992, the Senate confirmed her nomination.\n  During the 105th Congress, President Bill Clinton nominated Judge \nSotomayor to be a circuit judge on the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit. On October 2, 1998, the Senate confirmed her \nnomination by a vote of 67-29.\n  On May 26, 2009, President Obama nominated Judge Sotomayor to be \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court to fill the seat left vacant by \nthe departure of Justice David Souter. Recently, the American Bar \nAssociation Standing Committee evaluated Judge Sotomayor and \ninterviewed more than 500 judges, lawyers, law professors and community \nrepresentatives from across the United States; they analyzed Judge \nSotomayor's opinions, speeches and other writings; read reports of \nreading groups comprised of recognized experts in the substantive areas \nof the law that they reviewed; and conducted an in-depth personal \ninterview of the nominee. In the words of the committee:\n\n       The Standing Committee's investigation of a nominee for the \n     United States Supreme Court is based upon the premise that \n     the nominee must possess exceptional professional \n     qualifications. The significance, range, complexity and \n     nation-wide impact of issues that such a nominee will \n     confront on the Court demands no less.\n\n  After that extensive investigation, the American Bar Association gave \nJudge Sotomayor their highest rating, unanimously rating her ``well \nqualified.''\n  Some colleagues have expressed concern over the differences in \nlanguage and ideas they observed in Judge Sotomayor while sitting as a \njudge in the courtroom, and as a citizen outside of the courtroom. For \nexample, one colleague put it this way during Judge Sotomayor's \nconfirmation hearing,\n\n       I want to ask your assistance this morning to try to help \n     us reconcile two pictures that I think have emerged during \n     the course of this hearing. One is, of course, as Senator \n     Schumer and others have talked about, your lengthy tenure on \n     the federal bench as a trial judge and court of appeals \n     judge.\n       And then there's the other picture that has emerged that--\n     from your speeches and your other writings.\n\n  He further stated,\n\n       You know, I actually agree that your judicial record \n     strikes me as pretty much in the mainstream of--of judicial \n     decision making by district court judges and by court of \n     appeals judges on the federal bench. And while I think what \n     is creating this cognitive dissonance for many of us and for \n     many of my constituents who I've been hearing from is that \n     you appear to be a different person almost in your speeches \n     and in some of the comments that you've made. So I guess part \n     of what we need to do is to try to reconcile those.\n\n  Assume there is a difference between Judge Sotomayor's rulings in the \ncourtroom, and those personal views she expressed outside of the \ncourtroom. If so, aren't we looking for people who can apply the law on \nthe bench, even if he or she has a different personal opinion? At the \nend of the day, we want our judges to leave their personal views \noutside of the courtroom. That is the essence of an impartial \njudiciary.\n  Senator Graham pointed that out when he said,\n\n       Her speeches, [while troubling], have to be looked at in \n     terms of her record. When we look at this 17-year record we \n     will find someone who has not carried out that speech.\n\n  In other words, Judge Sotomayor has demonstrated the trait she is \naccused by some of lacking: the ability to leave her personal opinions \nat the courthouse door. She has an extensive judicial record and we \nhave had the opportunity to review that record. The Congressional \nResearch Service analyzed Judge Sotomayor's record and concluded:\n\n       Perhaps the most consistent characteristic of Judge \n     Sotomayor's approach as an appellate judge has been an \n     adherence to the doctrine of stare decisis (i.e., the \n     upholding of past judicial precedents). Other characteristics \n     appear to include what many would describe as a careful \n     application of particular facts at issue in a case and a \n     dislike for situations in which the court might be seen as \n     overstepping its judicial role.\n\n  That is the opposite of an activist jurist imposing her views despite \nthe law. During her confirmation hearing, Judge Sotomayor was asked \nabout the role of the courts numerous times. Her response makes clear \nthat she adheres to the responsibilities of a judge:\n\n       . . . look at my decisions for 17 years and note that, in \n     every one of them, I have done what I say that I so firmly \n     believe in. I prove my fidelity to the law, the fact that I \n     do not permit personal views, sympathies or prejudices to \n     influence the outcome of cases, rejecting the challenges of \n     numerous plaintiffs with undisputably sympathetic claims, but \n     ruling the way I have on the basis of law rejecting those \n     claims. . . .\n\n  We all have personal views and sympathies. Some judges regrettably \ncan't lay those aside. Judge Sotomayor has proven in her judicial \ncareer that she can, while faithfully applying the principles of the \nU.S. Constitution.\n  For these reasons, I will vote to confirm Judge Sotomayor to the \nSupreme Court.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that letters received by the \nJudiciary Committee from the AFL-CIO and from AFSCME be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 24, 2009.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the AFL-CIO, I am writing to \n     urge you to support the swift confirmation of Judge Sonia \n     Sotomayor as our next Supreme Court Justice.\n       Judge Sotomayor fully acknowledges the real world \n     consequences of judicial rulings, and throughout her career \n     has demonstrated her understanding of the impact of the law \n     on working families. She has also consistently interpreted \n     our labor laws in the manner in which they were intended.\n       Judge Sotomayor has recognized that persecution for union \n     activity can be a basis for granting asylum in this country. \n     She has enforced the rights of workers to be free from all \n     types of discrimination, to be paid correct wages, and to \n     receive the health benefits to which they are entitled. In \n     the baseball strike of 1995, Judge Sotomayor recognized that \n     baseball owners had forced the strike by engaging in unlawful \n     conduct and she issued an injunction that saved baseball.\n       Throughout her nomination hearing before the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee, Judge Sotomayor demonstrated that she is \n     a stellar jurist with a commitment to uphold the \n     constitutional rights of all.\n       Judge Sonia Sotomayor would bring more federal judicial \n     experience to the Supreme Court than any justice in the last \n     100 years. We urge the Senate to confirm her nomination to \n     the Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                               William Samuel,\n\n                                                         Director,\n     Government Affairs Department.\n                                  ____\n\n         American Federation of State, County and Municipal \n           Employees, AFL-CIO,\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2009.\n     Members of the Committee on Judiciary,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator: On behalf of the 1.6 million members of the \n     American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees \n     (AFSCME), I am writing to urge you to vote yes when the \n     Senate Judiciary Committee considers the nomination of Judge \n     Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court. We believe that \n     she conducted herself with distinction during her \n     confirmation hearing and that she should be confirmed as the \n     next U.S. Supreme Court Justice.\n       Judge Sotomayor was impressive during her confirmation \n     hearing, demonstrating that she is well-qualified to serve on \n     the high court. Her successful appearance before the \n     Judiciary Committee is no surprise when you consider her \n     strong educational and professional background. She was \n     valedictorian of her high school class, won a scholarship to \n     Princeton and earned her law degree at Yale University where \n     she served as editor of the Yale Law Review. Judge Sotomayor \n     has served with distinction as a litigator, prosecutor, trial \n     court and U.S. appellate judge and brings more federal \n     judicial experience than any of the current members of the \n     Supreme Court and than any Justice in the last century prior \n     to their nomination to the high court.\n       As an organization representing working men and women, we \n     obviously are interested in a judicial nominee's record on \n     issues impacting the lives of working families. Judge \n     Sotomayor has been consistent in her interpretation of labor \n     laws and has worked to\n\n[[Page S8914]]\n\n     preserve the rights of workers to receive fair pay, health \n     benefits and to be free of workplace discrimination. She has \n     proven that she is well within the mainstream with her views \n     of the Constitution.\n       Judge Sotomayor's nomination marks a milestone, making her \n     the first Hispanic and the first woman of color to be \n     nominated to the high court, thereby fulfilling President \n     Obama's promise to add diversity to the Supreme Court.\n       We strongly support the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor \n     to the U.S. Supreme Court and urge you to vote yes to confirm \n     her.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Charles M. Loveless,\n                                          Director of Legislation.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I yield the floor and note the absence of \na quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, the Judiciary Committee has received \nseveral letters and statements of support from organizations dedicated \nto advancing civil and women's legal rights, including LatinoJustice \nPRLDEF, the Alliance for Justice, and the National Women's Law Center. \nI ask unanimous consent that these letters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            LatinoJustice, PRLDEF.\n\n    Former LatinoJustice PRLDEF Board Member Judge Sonia Sotomayor \n                  Nominated to the U.S. Supreme Court\n\n       We congratulate former board member and present Federal \n     Appeals Court Judge Sonia Sotomayor in being nominated to the \n     U.S. Supreme Court.\n       The LatinoJustice PRLDEF family rejoices and congratulates \n     President Obama for making the historic decision to nominate \n     the first Latina to the Supreme Court. The president has not \n     only chosen a well-qualified and respected judge who will be \n     a great asset to the court and our nation--but with his first \n     opportunity to nominate a Supreme Court Justice, the \n     president brings the Hispanic community into the exclusive \n     chambers of the highest court in the land.\n       ``Sonia is a member of our family and spent more than a \n     decade providing leadership to our organization, said Cesar \n     Perales, LatinoJustice PRLDEF President and General Counsel. \n     ``We profited firsthand from her probing mind as well as her \n     thoughtfulness beyond her extraordinary intellect. She is a \n     most practical person who found solutions to complex \n     issues.''\n       Judge Sotomayor's nomination comes at a time when the \n     Hispanic community is at the heart of a number of highly \n     politicized issues and attacks on our civil liberties. \n     LatinoJustice PRLDEF recently has fought battles against \n     anti-immigration ordinances, a rash of hate crimes against \n     Latinos and attempts to police the use of Spanish.\n       As the second largest and fastest growing population in \n     America, with a large pool of qualified individuals to choose \n     from, it was wholly appropriate for the president to nominate \n     a Hispanic.\n       Although Judge Sotomayor has a stellar judicial record, \n     many of her supporters are expecting a fight from the right \n     and from conservatives.\n       ``We are prepared to engage those who would unfairly \n     tarnish her reputation,'' Perales said. ``The nation needs to \n     know that LatinoJustice PRLDEF will come to her defense.''\n       The Latino community will be looking to the Senate to \n     proceed with the confirmation process in a fair and timely \n     manner.\n       We expect that senators from both parties should treat \n     Judge Sotomayor with the respect she deserves, examine her \n     record thoughtfully, and perform their constitutional duty \n     without undue delay or obstruction.\n       LatinoJustice PRLDEF has organized a Task Force made up of \n     exemplary lawyers and academics to conduct a review of the \n     nominee's published papers and decisions.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                         Alliance for Justice,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: The \n     Alliance for Justice endorses Judge Sonia Sotomayor's \n     nomination to the Supreme Court. Alliance for Justice \n     (``AFJ'') is a national association of over 80 organizations \n     dedicated to advancing justice and democracy. For 30 years we \n     have been leaders in the fight for a more equitable society \n     on behalf of a broad constituency of environmental, consumer, \n     civil and women's rights, children's, senior citizens' and \n     other groups. We believe all Americans have the right to \n     secure justice in the courts and to have our voices heard \n     when government makes decisions affecting our lives.\n       Judge Sotomayor has a record of academic and professional \n     excellence, and we commend President Obama for choosing a \n     brilliant and fair-minded jurist to serve on our nation's \n     highest court. There is no question that Judge Sotomayor is \n     eminently qualified to serve on the Supreme Court. Her rise \n     from modest circumstances to become a graduate of Princeton \n     University and Yale Law School speaks well of her intellect, \n     character, and dedication. Her extensive career as a criminal \n     and commercial litigator and her seventeen years on the bench \n     as trial and appellate judge round out her sterling \n     credentials.\n       Importantly, if confirmed, Judge Sotomayor will bring the \n     perspective provided by being the only sitting justice to \n     have served as a trial court judge. It will be enormously \n     valuable to the Supreme Court to have a member with an \n     understanding of the challenges that trial judges face and \n     the way in which Supreme Court rulings are likely to play out \n     on the front lines of the criminal justice system.\n       We also find it enormously important that throughout her \n     career Judge Sotomayor has worked to open the legal \n     profession to women and people of color. Through her \n     involvement in community activities and as a mentor, she has \n     shared her remarkable talents and example.\n       As part of AFJ's work to promote a fair and independent \n     judiciary, we conducted a thorough analysis of Judge \n     Sotomayor's judicial record, composed of the more than 700 \n     opinions she has authored in a wide range of areas of law. We \n     focused on four areas of her jurisprudence--access to \n     justice; criminal law and procedure; constitutional and civil \n     rights; and business and consumer litigation--each of which \n     will be addressed in greater detail below. Judge Sotomayor is \n     a careful jurist who digs into the facts of a case and issues \n     narrow rulings. She has written frequently in her opinions \n     about the limited role of a judge, and she has approached \n     change in the law in a very restrained and incremental \n     fashion. A moderate voice who displays no signs of bias \n     toward parties of any particular background or affiliation, \n     Judge Sotomayor tends to avoid announcing new rules or \n     issuing broad statements of principle. She does not \n     consciously espouse a grand theory of interpretation or \n     judicial philosophy. Judge Sotomayor shows deference to the \n     intent of Congress and emphasizes close reading of statutory \n     texts. Above all, her opinions adhere closely to Supreme \n     Court and Second Circuit precedent, showing Judge Sotomayor's \n     deep respect for the rule of law and the importance of stare \n     decisis.\n       Judge Sotomayor's rulings on legal issues such as \n     justiciability, preemption, jurisdiction-stripping, and \n     sovereign immunity exemplify her cautious, technical approach \n     to judicial review. They also demonstrate both judicial \n     restraint and a commitment to access to federal courts. \n     Taking a measured approach to questions of standing, she has \n     consistently demonstrated fidelity to examining \n     justiciability prerequisites before allowing a case to \n     proceed. Attentive to issues of mootness and ripeness, Judge \n     Sotomayor systematically works through alleged harms, \n     identifies those that create an active case or controversy, \n     and gives attention to statutory limits on injury or on the \n     class of plaintiffs authorized to seek court redress. \n     Although Judge Sotomayor has ruled on only a few preemption \n     cases, her rulings reflect the often complex interplay \n     between state and federal law, and she subjects preemption \n     claims to rigorous statutory analysis, relying on text and \n     legislative history to discern Congressional intent. Her \n     rulings on other doctrines concerning parties' access to \n     justice, such as court stripping, sovereign immunity, and \n     attorneys' fees, demonstrate awareness of the importance of \n     access to a fair and impartial judiciary.\n       Judge Sotomayor's criminal law experience is lengthy and \n     varied. She spent the first five years of her career as a \n     prosecutor in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, and \n     she has participated in hundreds of criminal cases during her \n     long tenure on the federal bench. Importantly, Judge \n     Sotomayor will bring to the Supreme Court the insights gained \n     from her years presiding over criminal proceedings as a \n     district court judge, which will make her the only sitting \n     justice who has been directly responsible for implementing \n     the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines and meting out punishment. \n     Her district court record reflects a tough jurist unafraid \n     of imposing sentences at the high end of the guideline \n     range for both white collar and violent criminals. She \n     does not, however, uniformly support sentence \n     enhancements, and she vigorously opposed a district \n     court's injection of personal policy preferences into a \n     sentencing decision.\n       Judge Sotomayor's criminal justice opinions reveal the \n     temperament of a former prosecutor who understands the real-\n     world demands of prosecuting crime and fundamentally respects \n     the rule of law. When reviewing the constitutional rights of \n     criminal defendants, Judge Sotomayor closely follows Second \n     Circuit precedent and dispenses narrow rulings tailored to \n     the particular facts of the case. Exhibiting a moderate and \n     restrained approach to judicial review of trial process, she \n     focuses on procedural issues, and she has resolved the \n     overwhelming majority of her cases without reaching the \n     merits of a defendant's claim. Significantly, she frequently \n     concludes that trial defects resulted\n\n[[Page S8915]]\n\n     in harmless rather than structural error. Her restrained \n     manner is most evident in her habeas corpus decisions, in \n     which she strictly adheres to the procedural requirements of \n     the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act \n     (``AEDPA''), often dismissing habeas petitions as unexhausted \n     or time-barred under AEDPA, even when faced with potentially \n     credible--and, in one instance, ultimately proven--claims of \n     actual innocence. While the Alliance for Justice believes \n     that, where possible, judges should reach the merits of a \n     defendant's constitutional claims and recognize the damage \n     that a trial court error inflicts on the integrity of a \n     criminal proceeding, we nonetheless respect Judge Sotomayor's \n     moderate approach and commitment to preserving the delicate \n     balance between the government's ability to prosecute crime \n     and an individual's constitutional rights.\n       Judge Sotomayor takes a similarly cautious approach in \n     civil rights cases, above all taking care to strictly follow \n     precedent and limit her rulings to the facts at hand. When \n     finding that the matter before her is not squarely addressed \n     by precedent, she tends to rule narrowly, moving the law in \n     small increments rather than in bold steps. While we do not \n     always agree with her restrained interpretation of statutes \n     or the Constitution, we applaud the consistent attention she \n     has paid to matters of process, including procedural due \n     process. Her opinions insist that individuals in our justice \n     system are entitled to adequate notice, a right to be heard, \n     and representation. In particular, we appreciate that she has \n     shown particular attention to the procedural rights of \n     individuals who are less likely to be able to fend for \n     themselves. She has also emerged as a strong defender of \n     First Amendment rights to free speech and free exercise of \n     religion, as well as the rights of the disabled.\n       Her limited record reviewing controversial constitutional \n     issues, such as those involving the Second Amendment and the \n     Takings Clause, is a model of restraint, faithfully applying \n     Supreme Court precedent. She does not depart from her \n     cautious approach when reviewing civil rights protections \n     against discrimination. Her employment discrimination \n     decisions are within the legal mainstream, and she has ruled \n     in a consistently balanced manner for both plaintiffs and \n     defendants. Contrary to the accusations by some commentators, \n     there is no evidence of racial bias in any of the hundreds of \n     decisions Judge Sotomayor has written. Rather, her \n     jurisprudence in cases involving racial discrimination claims \n     is very much like her jurisprudence in other areas of the \n     law: deliberate, measured, and strictly adherent to \n     precedent. Finally, on other hot-button issues such as \n     reproductive rights, capital punishment, and executive power, \n     her record is too slim to arrive at any meaningful \n     conclusions about her views.\n       Our review of Judge Sotomayor's rulings in business and \n     consumer litigation further emphasized Judge Sotomayor's \n     dedication to careful attention to the facts of each case, \n     deference to the legislature, and adherence to legal \n     precedents. Judge Sotomayor has a wealth of experience in \n     business and consumer litigation garnered from her time spent \n     as a judge, in private practice, and through her public \n     service activities. Consequently, she will bring to the Court \n     an impressive working knowledge of commercial law, including \n     securities, antitrust, employment, banking, trademark and \n     copyright, and product liability. An analysis of Judge \n     Sotomayor's opinions in labor cases showed that she cannot be \n     pigeonholed as pro-union, pro-employer, or pro-employee, \n     although her rulings show judicial restraint and a respect \n     for the National Labor Relations Board and Congress's \n     national labor policy favoring collective bargaining.\n       In sum, our examination of Judge Sotomayor's record \n     demonstrates her consistency and restraint as a jurist. \n     Importantly, her very presence on the Court may have a \n     ``Marshall effect'': justices who sat with Justice Thurgood \n     Marshall have noted that his presence in conference and on \n     the bench changed their conversations and informed their \n     decisions. As the Court's first Hispanic and only its third \n     woman, Judge Sotomayor may have a similar effect on the \n     activist justices on the Court who appear intent on weakening \n     our core constitutional, civil rights, environmental, and \n     labor protections.\n       Most fundamentally, Judge Sotomayor is a highly \n     accomplished and qualified nominee who has proven herself to \n     be fair, reasonable, and committed to upholding the rule of \n     law and core constitutional values. For these reasons, \n     Alliance for Justice is proud to endorse her historic \n     nomination to the Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                         Nan Aron,\n     President, Alliance for Justice.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                  National Women's Law Center,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 21, 2009.\n     Re nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be Associate \n         Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chair, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Sessions: On behalf of the \n     National Women's Law Center (the ``Center''), we write in \n     support of the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be an \n     Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. \n     Judge Sotomayor possesses sterling academic and legal \n     credentials, with a varied legal career including government \n     service as a prosecutor, private practice in complex areas of \n     commercial law, and 17 years as a federal judge, both at the \n     trial and appellate level. She is well-respected in the \n     profession and has an excellent reputation as a careful, \n     thoughtful, fair, and extremely intelligent jurist. The ABA \n     Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary unanimously rated \n     her well-qualified for the Supreme Court. She has also \n     received the endorsement of the National Association of Women \n     Lawyers, the Hispanic National Bar Association, and the New \n     York City Bar Association. In addition to her exceptional \n     legal qualifications, Judge Sotomayor brings an inspiring \n     life story and a demonstrated commitment to public and \n     community service, including within the civil rights \n     community.\n       As an organization dedicated to advancing and protecting \n     women's legal rights, the National Women's Law Center since \n     1972 has been involved in virtually every major effort to \n     secure and defend women's legal rights in this country. The \n     Center has reviewed Judge Sotomayor's legal record, including \n     her judicial decisions, public statements, and experiences \n     outside of her service on the bench, and her testimony before \n     the Senate Judiciary Committee during her confirmation \n     hearings. The Center's review of the totality of Judge \n     Sotomayor's legal record has led the Center to conclude that \n     Judge Sotomayor will bring a real-world perspective, much-\n     needed diversity of experience and background, considerable \n     legal acumen, and a fair-minded approach to the Court. The \n     National Women's Law Center is proud to support Judge \n     Sotomayor, an exceptionally qualified nominee who is only the \n     third woman, the third person of color, and the first Latina \n     and woman of color, to be nominated to the Supreme Court.\n       The Center's review focused, on issues of particular \n     importance to women--including prohibitions against sex \n     discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause, the \n     constitutional right to privacy (which includes the right to \n     terminate a pregnancy and other aspects of women's \n     reproductive rights and health), as well as the statutory \n     provisions that protect women's legal rights in such \n     fundamental areas as education, employment, health and \n     safety, and social welfare, access to justice, and public \n     benefits. The Center's analysis is set forth in full in a \n     public report, The Record of Judge Sonia Sotomayor on \n     Critical Legal Rights for women, available at www.org/pdf/\n     Sotomayor Report.pdf, which was released on July 17, 2009.\n       Judge Sotomayor's legal record demonstrates that she is a \n     careful judge who is extremely respectful of the role of the \n     judiciary, who is deferential to precedent, and who delves \n     deeply into the factual record. Judge Sotomayor's decisions \n     have been fully justifiable as a matter of law and fall well \n     within the mainstream of judicial thought. Questioned \n     extensively about her prior statements regarding the \n     influence that a judge's background and experiences have on \n     the decisionmaking process, Judge Sotomayor replied \n     consistently that she believes strongly that the even-handed \n     application of the law must always prevail. Judge Sotomayor's \n     testimony at her confirmation hearings on a variety of topics \n     and legal issues reinforced her record as a judge, \n     reiterating her commitment to precedent, her careful and \n     fact-bound approach, and her understanding of the role of the \n     judiciary.\n       Judge Sotomayor's record and testimony provide confidence \n     that her judicial philosophy and approach to the law are \n     consistent with the legal rights and principles that are \n     central to women, including the constitutional right to \n     privacy and Roe v. Wade, Equal Protection, and key statutory \n     protections.\n       The Center offers its strong support of Judge Sotomayor's \n     nomination to the Supreme Court, and urges the Committee to \n     approve her nomination quickly.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nancy Duff Campbell,\n       Co-President.\n     Marcia D. Greenberger,\n       Co-President.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Madam President, as a Member of Congress, there are votes \nyou cast that you remember for a lifetime. Recently, a new Senator, Al \nFranken, came to my office the day after he was sworn in, and we talked \nabout his adjustment to the Senate. He talked to me about his concern \nabout the first three votes he cast in the Senate, that he was pushed \nin quickly and had to make decisions and didn't have a chance to \nreflect as he would have liked to reflect on those votes. I said to him \nthat I understood that, but after he has been in the Senate for a \nwhile--or the House for that matter--and he has cast many votes, he \nwould realize that some are more important than others.\n  This is an important vote. It is not the most important vote a Member \nof the Senate can cast--a vote for a nomination of the Supreme Court. I \nwould argue the most important vote you can\n\n[[Page S8916]]\n\ncast is whether America goes to war because if the decision is made in \nthe affirmative, as it has been, people will die. I can't think of \nanything more compelling than that vote.\n  But this ranks a close second in terms of the impact it will have. \nThese are lifetime appointments to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court \nJustices on average serve 26 years, longer than most Members of \nCongress. The Supreme Court has the last word in America when it comes \nto our most significant legal issues. This High Court across the \nstreet, comprised of nine men and women, defines our personal rights as \nAmericans to privacy and the restrictions the government can place on \nthe most personal aspect of our lives and our freedom. It doesn't get \nany more basic than that.\n  The Supreme Court decides the rights of workers, consumers, \nimmigrants, and victims of discrimination. The nine Justices decide \nwhether Congress has the authority to pass laws to protect our civil \nrights and our environment. They decide what checks will govern the \nexecutive branch--the President--in time of war.\n  In critical moments in American history, the Supreme Court has \nsucceeded and failed our Nation. In the Dred Scott decision in the \n1850s, the Supreme Court perpetuated slavery and led us to a civil war. \nIn Brown v. Board of Education, in the 1950s, that court brought an end \nto the legal blessing on discrimination based on race. Because these \nissues were so important, and tomorrow's issues may be as well, we make \nour choices for the Supreme Court with great care. We obviously need \nJustices with intelligence, knowledge of the law, the proper judicial \ntemperament, and a commitment to impartial and objective justice. More \nthan that, we need Supreme Court Justices who understand our world and \nthe impact their decisions will have on everyday people. We need \nJustices whose wisdom comes from life, not just from law books.\n  Sadly, this important quality seems to be in short supply these days. \nThe Supreme Court has issued decision after decision in recent years \nthat represent a triumph of ideology over common sense. The case of \nLedbetter v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Company is the best example of this \ntroubling trend of the Court. In that case, the Supreme Court dismissed \na claim of pay discrimination simply because the claim was filed more \nthan 180 days after the initial discriminatory paycheck. But most \nemployees in most businesses in America have no idea how much the \nperson next to them is being paid, so it is often impossible to know \nyou are a victim of pay discrimination until long after the fact, long \nafter 180 days. The Supreme Court's Ledbetter decision defied common \nsense, the realities of the workplace, and a long record of earlier \ndecisions.\n  There was another case, Safford Unified School District v. Redding. A \n13-year-old girl was strip-searched at her school based on a false \nrumor that she was hiding ibuprofen pills. At the oral argument before \nthe Court in April, several Supreme Court Justices asked questions \nabout the case that revealed a stunning lack of concern for the eighth \ngrade victim. One of the Justices even suggested that being strip-\nsearched was no different than changing clothes for gym class. Justice \nRuth Bader Ginsburg helped her eight male colleagues understand why the \nstrip search of a 13-year-old girl was humiliating enough to violate \nher constitutional rights. The majority of the Justices, nevertheless, \nruled that school officials were immune from liability.\n  These and other decisions demonstrate that the Supreme Court needs to \nunderstand the real world and the impact its decisions have on real \npeople. I believe Judge Sonia Sotomayor will be such a Justice.\n  One of my favorite memories of Judge Sotomayor's hearing was watching \nher mother's face glow with pride as Judge Sotomayor talked about the \nhistory of her family. She spoke about growing up in public housing, \nlosing her father when she was 9 years old, and struggling to succeed \nagainst adversity, illness, and the odds. She talked about what a great \nimpact her mom had on her life, and that her mom taught her what a \nfriend was worth. She talked about earning scholarships to Princeton \nUniversity and Yale Law School, serving as a prosecutor and a corporate \nlitigator, and then being selected by President George H.W. Bush to \nserve the Federal judiciary and being promoted to a higher judicial \noffice by President Bill Clinton.\n  It is a rare occurrence for a Federal judge to receive appointments \nby Presidents of different political parties. Sonia Sotomayor received \nthose and that reflects so well on her skill as a judge.\n  Judge Sotomayor has served for more years as a Federal judge than any \nother Supreme Court nominee in a century and, if confirmed, she will be \nthe only Justice on the current Supreme Court with actual experience on \nthe district court and the trial court, the front line of our judicial \nsystem.\n  For many who oppose Sonia Sotomayor, her life achievements and her \njudicial record aren't good enough. They have gone through 3,000 \ndifferent court decisions that this woman has written or been part of. \nThey have scoured through hundreds of speeches she has given. If you \nwatched the hearing, they focused primarily on one case and one \nsentence in one speech.\n  At Judge Sotomayor's hearing, Republican Senators mentioned the words \n``wise Latina woman''--that one line in one speech--17 different times. \nSenator after Senator asked her, ``What did you really, really mean \nwith those three words?''\n  Those of us who are Senators live in a world of daily decisions, \nspeeches, and votes. If we vote in a way that is controversial, we ask \nthe people to be fair and judge us on our life's work, not on a single \nvote. It is a standard we ask for ourselves. But for some Senators, it \nis not a standard they would give Judge Sotomayor when it comes to her \ndecisions and life in public office.\n  Members of Congress also live in a world of revised and extended \nremarks. We live in a world of jokes that aren't that funny, and verbal \ngaffes. Many want to condemn Judge Sotomayor for her ``wise Latina'' \nremark that she herself conceded was ``a rhetorical flourish that fell \nflat.'' I think some of her critics in the Senate are applying a double \nstandard here.\n  I pointed out at the hearing that those who read the ``wise Latina'' \nsentence should have kept reading, because a little further in that \nsame speech, the judge noted that it was nine white male Justices on \nthe Supreme Court who unanimously handed down the Brown v. Board of \nEducation decision, and other cases involving race and sex \ndiscrimination.\n  Judge Sotomayor made it clear at her hearing that she believes no \nsingle race or gender has a monopoly on good judgment. But her \nstatements are not good enough for some of my colleagues. I hope that \nSenators would be wise enough themselves to look at her long record on \nthe bench and not one line in one speech.\n  Let's be honest. A great deal of concern about her nomination has to \ndo with the issue of diversity. Why do we even seek diversity when it \ncomes to appointments to the Federal judiciary? First, it is because we \nlive in a diverse nation. We want every American to believe they have \nan equal opportunity to succeed. We want every American, Black, White, \nbrown, male and female to know that our system of government is fair. \nWe want all Americans to look at our Congress and our courts and feel \nthere are leaders who can identify with the diversity of life \nexperience in this great diverse Nation.\n  Second, diversity on the Federal bench is important because different \nlife experiences can lead to different perspectives.\n  Does anybody believe there is a clear, objective answer to every case \nthat comes before the Supreme Court? If they do, please explain to me \nwhy one-third of all rulings in that Court in the last term were \ndecided by a 5-to-4 vote.\n  Does anybody believe the Supreme Court's recent strip search case \nwould have come out the same way if Justice Ginsburg, the only woman on \nthe Supreme Court at this moment, had not helped her eight male \ncolleagues to reflect on what it was like for a 13-year-old girl to be \ntreated in such a humiliating fashion at her school?\n  Does anybody believe that women judges have not helped their male \ncolleagues understand the realities of sex discrimination and sexual \nharassment in the workplace? Study after study has shown that men and \nwomen on the\n\n[[Page S8917]]\n\nbench sometimes rule differently in discrimination cases. That is why \ndiversity is so important.\n  This doesn't mean their rulings are based on personal bias. It simply \nmeans that Americans see the world through the prism of various \nexperiences and perspectives. Our Supreme Court Justices should possess \nan equally rich and wide field of vision as they interpret the facts \nand the law. Criticizing Judge Sotomayor for recognizing this reality \nis unfair.\n  The criticism of Judge Sotomayor for her position in the Ricci case, \nwhich involved the firefighters in Connecticut, is also unfair. Judge \nSotomayor's position in that case followed past judicial precedents. At \nher nomination hearing, she offered clear explanations about the law as \nshe saw it when she reached her conclusion, and about how her decision \nwas fully consistent with the way the law has historically dealt with \ncompeting claims of discrimination.\n  Her position in the Ricci case was supported by a majority of the \nmembers of her appellate court, a unanimous three-judge panel of her \ncourt, the district court, and by four of the nine members of the \nSupreme Court. Hers was not a radical, unreasonable position. I think \nwe know that. When my colleague Senator Specter asked the firefighters \nthemselves if they believed that Judge Sotomayor's ruling in the case \nwas made in good faith, they said they had no reason to believe \notherwise. Nor do I.\n  To those who say Judge Sotomayor wouldn't have an open mind in race \ndiscrimination cases, look at her 17 years on the bench. Based on an \nindependent study by Supreme Court scholar Thomas Goldstein, after \nlooking at all 96 of her race discrimination cases, he found that she \nruled in favor of the plaintiffs less than 10 percent of the time. \nThere is no bias in her decisionmaking. The facts don't support that \nconclusion.\n  There are two other issues I will address--foreign law and the second \namendment. These issues are near and dear to the rightwing conservative \nbase.\n  With respect to foreign law, Judge Sotomayor stated repeatedly over \nand over, in question after question, that American courts should not \nrely on decisions of foreign courts as controlling precedent. But she \nsaid that in limited circumstances, decisions of foreign courts can be \na source of ideas, akin to law review articles or legal treatises.\n  She is hardly alone in her thinking on this. Justice Ginsburg took \nthe same position and observed: ``I will take enlightenment wherever I \ncan get it.''\n  This commonsense approach has been embraced by two conservative \nSupreme Court Justices appointed by President Reagan: William Rehnquist \nand Anthony Kennedy.\n  Indeed, we cannot expect the rest of the world to adopt the \ndemocratic principles and fundamental freedoms we promote as a Nation, \nwhile at the same time saying we will never consider ideas developed in \nother countries. This is plain common sense.\n  It is sad that some of my colleagues are in the thrall of small-\nminded xenophobes and don't appreciate that the march of democracy has \nreached many corners of the world and generated thoughtful reflection \non our most basic values.\n  On the issue of the second amendment, I was sorry to see a major \nlobby group in Washington, DC, the National Rifle Association, not only \nannounce their opposition to Judge Sotomayor but also notify its \nmembers and colleagues that this vote is going to be scored against \nthem on the annual legislative scorecard. This is the first time in its \nhistory that the NRA has taken a position on a Supreme Court Justice.\n  Every citizen is entitled to his opinion, but it is unfortunate that \nthe decision of this historic gravity has become a bargaining chip for \nlobbyists in Washington, and contributions in the next political \ncampaign. What is worse, Judge Sotomayor has a record of honest \nreflection on the second amendment.\n  Most of the gun-related criticism of Judge Sotomayor is focused on \nthe Maloney case. But in that case, she came to the exact same \nconclusion as a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the \nSeventh Circuit, based in Illinois. That three-judge panel was not a \ngathering of liberals. It featured three Republican appointees and two \nof the most conservative icons on the Federal bench, Judge Frank \nEasterbrook and Judge Richard Posner.\n  They concluded that only the Supreme Court, not appellate courts, \ncould overrule century-old Supreme Court precedents on whether the \nsecond amendment right to bear arms applies to the States.\n  I realize the NRA and their Senate allies don't like that ruling. \nThey wanted Judge Sotomayor to do what the Ninth Circuit did and \noverrule Supreme Court precedent. But in the Maloney case, Judge \nSotomayor did what an appellate court should do, and she followed the \nlaw.\n  I am pleased that not every conservative group joined the NRA's line \nof fire. I will mention some organizations and individuals who don't \ntypically show up at Democratic party rallies but who support the \njudge: Kenneth Starr, a man who led the impeachment of President \nClinton; Charles Fried, a conservative Republican who served as \nSolicitor General during the Reagan administration, also supports her \nconfirmation, as do conservative columnists Charles Krauthammer and \nDavid Brooks. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has endorsed her. In \nIllinois, the conservative Chicago Tribune said:\n\n       In four days of testimony under often intense questioning, \n     [Judge Sotomayor] handled herself with grace and patience, \n     displaying a thorough knowledge of case law and an \n     appreciation of her critics' concerns. The result was to \n     reinforce a strong case that she will make a good Supreme \n     Court justice and deserves Senate approval.\n\n  I want to acknowledge that, as of this moment, eight Republican \nSenators have stepped forward and announced they are going to support \nJudge Sotomayor. I am heartened by their courage and their support of \nthis fine judge.\n  The last issue I would like to address is that word ``empathy.'' \nJudge Sotomayor's critics have twisted and tortured this word in an \neffort to discredit her and raise doubts about her objectivity. Empathy \nis simply the ability to see another person's point of view. It is the \nability to put yourself in their shoes. That is it. It doesn't mean \nexercising bias or favoring a particular side. The judge's critics are \nwrong to conflate these concepts.\n  I believe, and President Obama believes, that Judge Sotomayor's life \nexperience--from her days growing up in public housing, to her service \nas a high-powered lawyer representing large corporations--will give her \na unique ability to understand the interests of all the parties that \ncome before her for decisions of the Supreme Court. It gives her an \nability to understand different perspectives and points of view. That \nis what empathy is all about.\n  Judge Sotomayor had demonstrated this quality in 17 years on the \nbench. It explains why she enjoys such a reputation for fairness and \nthoughtfulness.\n  In the 220-year history of the United States, 110 Supreme Court \nJustices have served under our Constitution, and 106 of them have been \nwhite males. We have had two women Justices, Sandra Day O'Connor and \nRuth Bader Ginsburg. Two of them have been African Americans, Thurgood \nMarshall and Clarence Thomas.\n  In life, and in our Nation, if you want to be first, you have to be \nthe best. Sonia Sotomayor's resume and inspirational background clearly \nmeet that higher standard. What a great story it is for America that \nPresident Obama has given us a chance to consider Sonia Sotomayor to \nserve as the first Hispanic woman on the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor should not be chosen to serve on the Court because of \nher Hispanic heritage. But those who oppose her for fear of her unique \nlife experience do no justice to her or our Nation. Their names will be \nlisted in our Nation's annals of elected officials one step behind \nAmerica's historic march forward.\n  I urge my colleagues to support and vote yes on the nomination of \nSonia Sotomayor to be the next Justice of the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I am proud to support the confirmation \nof Judge Sonia Sotomayor as the next Associate Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n\n[[Page S8918]]\n\n  Judge Sotomayor's story is proof of the central American promise: \nthat any person, by sheer force of their talent, can rise from the \nhumblest background to one of the highest offices in this country. Born \nto a Puerto Rican family, Judge Sotomayor grew up in public housing in \nthe South Bronx. Her father, a tool-and-die worker with a third grade \neducation, died when she was nine years old. Due to her mother's \nstruggle and sacrifice, and Judge Sotomayor's tremendous ability and \nperseverance, she graduated valedictorian of her high school in New \nYork, then graduated summa cum laude from Princeton University.\n  She went on to earn her law degree from Yale Law School, where she \nwas editor of the Yale Law Journal. After law school, Judge Sotomayor \nserved as an assistant district attorney in New York County for 5 years \nand then entered private practice as a corporate litigator. For the \npast 17 years, she has served as a Federal district and appellate court \njudge.\n  Given her experiences and career, there is no doubt that Judge \nSotomayor is immensely qualified to serve on our Nation's highest \nCourt. What is clear from her 17-year judicial career, from my meeting \nwith her, and from her confirmation hearing is that she is an unbiased, \nmainstream judge with a deep commitment to the rule of law and \nconstitutional values. She has an exemplary record during her tenure on \nthe bench, and every independent analysis has made clear that she is a \njudge who faithfully applies the law.\n  Given her record, I am saddened that many Republicans have chosen to \ngrossly distort her record, and have spent so much time focusing on a \nfew out-of-context quotes and less than a handful of decisions. Putting \nrhetoric aside, she has participated in nearly 3,000 decisions and \nauthored approximately 400 opinions. Her 17-year record overwhelmingly \ndemonstrates that she is anything but a ``judicial activist.''\n  Considering her outstanding intellect, credentials and judicial \nrecord, there simply is no doubt Judge Sotomayor should be confirmed. \nHowever, for me, there is another, equally important, consideration. I \nalso firmly believe that Judge Sotomayor will be an important and \nneeded voice on the Court to ensure proper effect is given to our most \nimportant statutes, such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, ADA, \nthe Civil Rights Act, and the Age Discrimination Employment Act, ADEA, \nso all Americans receive the fullest protections of the law.\n  This is illustrated in an area of the law that I care deeply about--\ndisabilities rights. Unfortunately, as many in Congress know, the \nRehnquist Court repeatedly misread the ADA, ignored the intent of \nCongress and narrowed the scope of individuals deemed eligible for \nprotection under the ADA. The result of these decisions was to \neliminate protection for countless thousands of Americans with \ndisabilities. These flawed, harmful decisions were reversed last year \nwhen Congress unanimously enacted the ADA Amendments Act.\n  The contrast between the Rehnquist Court and Judge Sotomayor is \nstark. In Bartlett v. New York State Board of Bar Examiners, Marilyn \nBartlett had a Ph.D. in educational administration and a law degree \nfrom Vermont Law School. She was also diagnosed with a disability that \naffected her reading speed and fluency. After completing law school, \nMs. Bartlett worked as an associate and received excellent reviews. \nHowever, when she took the bar exam, she was denied accommodation for \nher reading impairment, such as extra time and permission to record her \nessays on tape. She failed the exam. The bar claimed that she did not \nhave a disability because the examiners did not believe she was limited \nin the major life activities of reading or working.\n  Judge Sotomayor, however, ruled for Ms. Bartlett, holding that a \nstudent with learning disabilities was entitled to an accommodation \nwhile taking the bar exam. Understanding the true purposes of the ADA, \nshe noted:\n\n       For those of us for whom words sing, sentences paint \n     pictures, and paragraphs create panoramic views of the world, \n     the inability to identify and process words with ease would \n     be crippling. Plaintiff, an obviously intelligent, highly \n     articulate individual reads slowly, haltingly, and \n     laboriously. She simply does not read in the manner of an \n     average person. I reject the basic premise of defendants' \n     experts that a learning disability in reading can be \n     identified solely by a person's inability to decode, i.e., \n     identify words, as measured by standardized tests, and I \n     accept instead the basic premise of plaintiff's experts that \n     a learning disability in reading has to be identified in the \n     context of an individual's total processing difficulties.\n\n  As the Congressional Research Service noted, ``She anticipated the \nlegislative discussions surrounding the ADA Amendments Act by finding \nthe use of self accommodations did not mean that the plaintiff was not \nan individual with a disability.''\n  The contrast between Judge Sotomayor's approach to judging--with her \nrespect for congressional intent and for long-standing precedent--and \nthe current Court's activism is likewise illustrated by their \nrespective treatment of so called ``mixed motive'' discrimination \ncases.\n  In June of this year, the Supreme Court decided Gross v. FBL \nFinancial, Inc. In a case involving an Iowan, Jack Gross, the Court \nmade it harder for those with legitimate age discrimination claims to \nprevail under the ADEA. In doing so, it reversed a well established, \n20-year-old standard, consistent with that under title VII of the Civil \nRights Act, that a plaintiff need only show that membership in a \nprotected class was a ``motivating factor'' in an employer's action. \nInstead, the Court held that a plaintiff alleging age discrimination \nmust prove that an employment action would not have been taken against \nhim or her ``but for'' age. In other words, the plaintiff must now \nprove that age discrimination was not a cause or a motivating factor, \nbut must prove that it was the exclusive cause of an adverse employment \naction. Proving ``but for'' cause is extremely difficult and will \ngreatly limit potentially meritorious suits involving discrimination \nCongress sought to prevent.\n  In doing so, the Court did not even address the question it granted \ncertiorari on. As Justice Stevens noted in dissent, ``I disagree not \nonly with the Court's interpretation of the statute, but also with its \ndecision to engage in unnecessary lawmaking. The Court is unconcerned \nthat the question it chooses to answer has not been briefed by the \nparties or uninterested amici curie. Its failure to consider the views \nof the United States, which represents the agency charged with \nadministering the [Age Discrimination Employment Act], is especially \nirresponsible.''\n  The contrast with Judge Sotomayor is telling. In Parker v. Columbia \nPictures, she addressed the very same question in the disabilities \ncontext--whether a plaintiff need show discrimination was a \n``motivating factor'' or ``but-for'' cause under the ADA. In contrast \nto Justice Thomas's opinion in Gross, she carefully analyzed the \nstatutory language, intent of Congress and precedents and noted that \n``Congress intended the statute . . . to cover situations in which \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability is one factor, but not the \nonly factor, motivating an adverse employment action.''\n  Unfortunately, the Supreme Court has transformed the legal landscape \nregarding the ability of Congress to protect our most vulnerable \ncitizens. In fact, since 1995, the Rehnquist and Roberts Courts have \nstruck down 38 acts of Congress. Until then, the Court had struck down \nan average of one statute every 2 years.\n  For example, in University of Alabama v. Garrett, a case I personally \nattended, the Court limited the rights of people with disabilities. In \ndoing so, it ignored numerous congressional hearings and a task force \nwhich collected evidence through 63 public forums around the country \nattended by more than 7,000 persons. In United States v. Morrison and \nKimel v. Florida Board of Regents, the Court completely ignored \nextensive congressional fact-finding and struck down parts of the \nViolence Against Women's Act and Age Discrimination Employment Act, \nrespectively. In June, in Northwest Austin Municipal Utility District \nv. Holder, the Court suggested it was poised to strike down the Voting \nRights Act, disregarding expansive congressional fact-finding, \nincluding 21 hearings and 16,000 pages of testimony.\n  Given the current Court's repeated disregard for Congress and for our \nefforts to expansively protect American citizens from discrimination, I \nbelieve it is imperative that the next Justice\n\n[[Page S8919]]\n\nbe someone who respects precedent, strives to apply congressional \nintent and purpose, and understands the importance of this Nation's \nlandmark civil rights protections. Based on her long judicial record, I \nam confident Judge Sotomayor is precisely that type of jurist.\n  Confirmation of Judge Sotomayor will be historic. She clearly has the \nintellect, experience and judgment to be an outstanding Justice. I am \nproud to support her nomination.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Madam President, I rise today in support of the \nconfirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as an Associate Justice of the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  The role of the Senate in the nomination of a Supreme Court Justice \nis to give its advice and consent on the President's nomination. I \nbelieve it has been the longstanding tradition of this body that we are \nto judge whether an individual is qualified to serve based on the \ncomplete record of each nominee.\n  Once again, I compliment Senators Sessions and Leahy for the \nexcellent job they have done in handling the confirmation hearings for \nJudge Sotomayor. The hearings were fair and enabled the American people \nto get a better understanding of what sort of Justice Judge Sotomayor \nwill be. Equally important, these hearings were conducted with \ncivility, allowing Senators to disagree without being disagreeable. \nThis is something I would like to see more of in the Senate. Sadly, as \nsome of my colleagues have pointed out, the judicial nomination process \nhas become so partisan that it seems to bring out the worst in the \nSenate, when it ought to bring out the best.\n  I believe the factors to be examined in determining whether a Supreme \nCourt nominee is qualified include her education, prior legal and \njudicial experience, judicial temperament, and commitment to the rule \nof law. Based on my review of her record, and using these factors, I \nhave determined that Judge Sotomayor meets the criteria to become a \nJustice of the Supreme Court. I didn't come to this determination \nlightly, and Judge Sotomayor has made statements that give me pause. \nHowever, after reviewing her judicial record and the comments made \nduring the Judiciary Committee hearings, on balance, I believe she is \nfit to serve on our Nation's highest Court.\n  I am comforted by Judge Sotomayor's express rejection of then-Senator \nObama's view that in a certain percentage of judicial decisions ``the \ncritical ingredient is supplied by what's in the judge's heart and the \ndepth and breadth of one's empathy.'' In answer to a question from \nSenator Kyl, Judge Sotomayor said:\n\n       I can only explain what I think judges should do, which is \n     judges can't rely on what's in their heart. They don't \n     determine the law. Congress makes the laws. The job of a \n     judge is to apply the law. And so it's not the heart that \n     compels conclusions in cases, it's the law. The judge applies \n     the law to the facts before that judge.\n\n  In addition to being fit for the bench, the story of Judge Sotomayor \nis the story of so many Americans who rose from humble beginnings to \nreach levels of achievement that would not be possible in any other \nnation.\n  It is sort of the story that reminds me of what is so unique and \nspecial about our Nation, that a young working-class Latina woman or \nthe son of a first-generation Eastern European immigrant family can be \nnominated to the Supreme Court or be elected to serve his home State in \nthis great Chamber.\n  During our private meeting, Judge Sotomayor and I were able to \ndiscuss this opportunity. What struck me is she is someone who \nunderstands what a great opportunity this is, as well as the great \nchallenges that await her. While the Founding Fathers may have a \ndisagreement with her on some of her legal views, I think they would be \nproud that judging individuals on their merit has endured as part of \nthis great experiment.\n  As a number of my colleagues have already noted, Judge Sotomayor, \nthrough hard work, has risen from humble beginnings to now await \nconfirmation to the Supreme Court. Judge Sotomayor excelled throughout \nher academic career. From the time at Blessed Sacrament School and \nCardinal Spellman High School, where she was the valedictorian of her \nclass, she has excelled in highly competitive environments. Like \nJustice Alito, she is a graduate of Princeton University and Yale Law \nSchool. Judge Sotomayor attended Princeton on scholarship and graduated \nnot only summa cum laude but also was the recipient of the prestigious \nPyne Prize from that university. Judge Sotomayor went on to Yale Law \nSchool, where she served as an editor of the Yale Law Journal. Her \nacademic record should serve as an inspiration to all that in a \nmeritocracy, we all have an equal opportunity to rise to the top.\n  After her stellar academic career, Judge Sotomayor entered public \nservice as a district attorney in New York, where her drive and basic \nfairness were well noted. This commitment to public service impressed \nme.\n  Judge Sotomayor not only succeeded in the public sector, she also \nworked her way up from associate to partner, practicing corporate law \nat a New York law firm. In private practice, Judge Sotomayor \nspecialized in intellectual property and copyright law. Her rise from \nassociate to partner in such a specialized field is a clear indication \nthat the private sector recognized her merit and rewarded her for her \nskill and ability.\n  Judge Sotomayor returned to public service with her appointment to \nthe district court, where she served for 6 years. I believe Judge \nSotomayor's experience on the district court will be invaluable to the \nSupreme Court, where none of her colleagues have experience as a judge \nin a trial court. I hope her experience there will help shape her \nfuture opinions, particularly in procedural cases where many \ncommentators have noted a need for rules that work in practice, not \njust in theory.\n  Judge Sotomayor's time on the trial bench was marked by opinions that \nset forth the facts and applied the law narrowly. Did you hear that? \nHer time on the trial bench was marked by opinions that set forth the \nfacts and applied the law narrowly--exactly what one would want from a \ntrial court.\n  In addition to district court experience, Judge Sotomayor has \nappellate court experience, over 10 years on the Second Circuit. I \nreviewed many of her opinions from her time on the Second Circuit, and \nwhile many were not opinions I would have offered, her opinions, as \nwell, were within the legal mainstream. Judge Sotomayor's opinions, for \nthe most part, were lengthy, workman-like, limited rulings, the sort of \nopinions that exhibit the judicial restraint one would hope for a \nSupreme Court Justice.\n  Given her academic and professional achievements, it is not \nsurprising that the American Bar Association has given the judge its \nhighest ratings when considering her for the Supreme Court.\n  While impressive in what she has overcome to reach this point in her \ncareer, her record is not without blemish. In particular, the one \ncomment that gave me significant pause as to whether I would support \nher nomination is the now well-known statement by the judge that ``a \nwise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often \nthan not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn't lived \nthat life.'' Such a statement is repugnant to someone like me who has \nworked so hard to reach a colorblind society where an individual's race \nor gender is not considered in judging a person's merit. The question I \nhad to ask myself was, Is this comment an indication that Judge \nSotomayor would reject the rule of law and blind justice to favor \ncertain people on the basis of inappropriate criteria? After study of \nher judicial record, I have concluded it is not. Based on my review, \nJudge Sotomayor's decisions, while not always decisions I would render, \nare not outside the legal mainstream and do not indicate an obvious \ndesire to legislate from the bench. Furthermore, Judge Sotomayor \nrecognized during her nomination hearings that this ``could be \nhurtful'' and was not reflective of how she would judge cases. Through \nmy review and my staff's review of her cases, her testimony, and my \nconversations with the judge, I have confidence that the parties who \nappear before her will encounter a judge who is committed to \nrecognizing\n\n[[Page S8920]]\n\nand suppressing any personal bias she may have to reach a decision that \nis dictated by the rule of law and precedent.\n  I think I would be remiss in my discussion of the judge if I failed \nto address the Supreme Court's decision in the Ricci v. DeStefano case. \nBy now, all my colleagues and many Americans are aware that the Supreme \nCourt reversed the Second Circuit's decision in the Ricci case. The \ncase involved a reverse-discrimination suit against the city of New \nHaven, CT.\n  Some opponents of Judge Sotomayor's confirmation have used this \nopinion to suggest that her legal philosophy is outside the mainstream \nof American jurisprudence and that her nomination should be rejected. I \nbelieve a review of the close decisions rendered by the various Federal \ncourts, including the Second Circuit's 7-to-6 decision to refuse to \nrehear the case and the Supreme Court's 5-to-4 decision to reverse the \nSecond Circuit, suggests this matter was, for a number of the judges \nwho reviewed the case, a close call. In other words, it was very close. \nFor one to say she is outside the mainstream when these decisions were \nso close I think is really stretching things quite a bit. Nevertheless, \nI believe Judge Sotomayor and her fellow panel judges would have better \nserved the public by issuing a more comprehensive decision regarding \ntheir logic in affirming the district court's decision in favor of the \ncity of New Haven.\n  In closing, I wish to make a few remarks about the judicial \nconfirmation process.\n  Judge Sotomayor is the third nominee to the Supreme Court to come \nbefore the Senate since I came to the Senate in 1999. For both Justice \nRoberts and Justice Alito, then-Senator Obama promoted an ``empathy \nstandard'' to determine if he would vote for these nominees. Then-\nSenator Obama said:\n\n       The critical ingredient is supplied by what is in the \n     judge's heart.\n\n  Such an analysis is no analysis at all. In fact, it flies in the face \nof the meritocracy in which Judge Sotomayor succeeded. All of us in \nthis Chamber can examine the academic credentials of and prior judicial \ndecisions authored by a nominee and determine whether he or she is \nqualified. We cannot examine and judge what is in the heart.\n  Let me be clear. If I applied Senator Obama's standard, I would not \nbe voting for Judge Sotomayor, his nominee. The President was wrong. I \nthink his standard makes the whole nomination process an exercise in \npartisan politics. We need less politics in the judicial selection \nprocess and the judiciary in general, not more. It has become too \npoliticized in the last several years. It is something about which all \nof us should be concerned.\n  I urge all my colleagues to reject the Obama empathy standard--just \nas Judge Sotomayor rejected it, just as I am rejecting it--and return \nto a standard where it is the qualifications of the nominee we judge, \nnot the politics or heart of that nominee.\n  Judge Sotomayor is not the nominee I would have selected if I were \nPresident, but making a nomination is not my role today. My role is to \nexamine her qualifications to determine if she is fit to serve. Again, \nin reviewing her academic and professional record, taking into account \nher temperament and integrity, it is clear to me she is qualified to \nserve as the next Associate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Will the Senator withhold the \nrequest for a quorum call?\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Yes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to jump to the \nDemocratic side for 5 minutes, if that is possible.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. SANDERS. Madam President, I thank my Republican colleague.\n  I begin by congratulating my colleague from Vermont, Senator Leahy, \nfor the distinguished manner in which he has led these hearings.\n  I rise today in support of the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to \nbe an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. As an assistant district \nattorney, a Federal district judge for the Southern District of New \nYork, and a Federal circuit court judge for the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit, Judge Sotomayor has demonstrated her eminent \nqualifications, impartial jurisprudence, and a faithful interpretation \nof the U.S. Constitution, and this body has every reason to vote today \nin support of her nomination.\n  It is no secret that over the last 50 years, the Supreme Court has \nbecome a very conservative institution. We are long past the days when \nthe Court respected and dutifully applied the full implications of the \nBill of Rights and vigorously protected the freedoms provided us by the \nFounders of our country and the Framers of the Constitution. Recently, \nthis rightwing drift has become worse, not better. The present Court \nhas routinely favored corporate interests over the needs of working \npeople and the interests of the wealthy and powerful against those of \nordinary citizens.\n  My hope is that Judge Sotomayor will help bring balance to a Supreme \nCourt that today is way out of balance and has moved very far to the \nright.\n  The Court recently gutted a key provision of the McCain-Feingold \ncampaign finance law, allowing well-financed corporations to manipulate \nthe legislative process under the guise of free speech--as if the Bill \nof Rights were written to grant giant corporations the same level of \nconstitutional protection that it does flesh-and-blood American \ncitizens. That is wrong, and that is unfortunate.\n  The Supreme Court recently made it easier for employers to avoid \nvalid pay discrimination claims by their employees on procedural \ntechnicalities, a decision Congress had to rectify. And just this past \nterm, the Court scaled back environmental protections, holding that the \nClean Water Act permits a mining company to pump hundreds of thousands \nof gallons of toxic wastewater per day into an Alaskan lake.\n  I sincerely hope and I have every confidence that Judge Sotomayor's \nnomination to the Supreme Court will help curb this corporatist trend \nand put the Court back on the path of respecting the rights of \nindividual Americans and the environmental and other laws passed by \nCongress. For that reason, I intend to vote for Judge Sotomayor as \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, I strongly support the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be a Justice on the Supreme \nCourt of the United States. She will be the most experienced jurist to \nbe placed on the Supreme Court in a century, and she will be the first \nLatina Justice in our Nation's history.\n  With her extensive career in public service and her lifelong \ncommitment to equal justice, Judge Sotomayor will bring a remarkable \nperspective to the Court. Given her extraordinary and far-ranging \nexperience, she has already distinguished herself as one of the most \nable and hardworking Federal judges in the Nation, and I am confident \nthat she will bring the same high ability and dedication to all issues \nbefore the Supreme Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor has already spent 17 years as a Federal judge. She \nwas first nominated to the U.S. District Court for the Southern \nDistrict of New York in 1992 by President George H.W. Bush. Six years \nlater, she was nominated by President Clinton to the U.S. Court of \nAppeals for the Second Circuit. She received bipartisan support in the \nSenate each time, and it is a special privilege for me to support her \nfor the third time.\n  Judge Sotomayor has a deep understanding of our legal system as a \nresult of the experience she has had as an attorney and a judge. She \nhas more judicial experience at both the appellate and district court \nlevel than any Supreme Court nominee in the past 70 years. In addition, \nin her earlier legal career, she served as an assistant district \nattorney in New York City and worked as a civil litigator in private \npractice. Her experience in the criminal and civil systems and as a \ndistrict judge and an appellate court judge give her a unique \nperspective that will be invaluable as a Justice of the Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S8921]]\n\n  During her years as a Federal judge, she has participated in over \n3,000 decisions, including over 400 Second Circuit decisions by panels \nthat included at least one judge appointed by a Republican President. \nIn those cases, she has agreed with the result favored by the \nRepublican appointee over 95 percent of the time. Some have sought to \nportray Judge Sotomayor as a judicial activist, but her record clearly \nshows that she is a mainstream jurist who does not let personal \nideology dictate the outcome of the cases she is deciding.\n  Not only is Judge Sotomayor eminently qualified by her experience to \nserve on the Supreme Court, but her nomination is historic. I, like \nmany Americans, welcome the insight and perspective that Judge \nSotomayor will bring to the Court, and she will serve as a role model \nfor millions of our people.\n  Judge Sotomayor's compelling life story is an impressive example of \nthe best of our country. She was born in the Bronx and raised in New \nYork City by hardworking parents. Through the strong support of her \nfamily and her own hard work and dedication and extraordinary \nachievement, she has been nominated to be the Nation's 111th Supreme \nCourt Justice.\n  I commend President Obama for selecting her. With her intelligence, \ninsight, and experience, she is an excellent choice to serve in this \ndistinguished role, and I am sure she will do an outstanding job \nprotecting the rule of law and the fundamental rights and liberties of \nall Americans. Judge Sotomayor has worked hard to achieve success, and \nI commend her for her life's accomplishments. I wish her well in this \nnew role, and I urge my colleagues to support her confirmation.\n  On the day soon to come, when she walks up the steps of the Supreme \nCourt and passes under those famous and inspiring words, ``Equal \nJustice Under Law,'' inscribed in the marble over the entrance, \nmillions of our fellow citizens and communities across the Nation will \nbe able to say, ``Yes, the American dream is alive and well in America \ntoday.''\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of Judge \nSonia Sotomayor's nomination to be an Associate Justice of the U.S. \nSupreme Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor's nomination to the highest court in the land is \nhistoric in several respects. Clearly, becoming the first Hispanic to \nserve on the U.S. Supreme Court is an important milestone. Our country \nis well served when these barriers fall and we are able to put forward \nqualified candidates who reflect the diversity of our citizenry.\n  But what also makes Judge Sotomayor's nomination so significant is \nthe extent of her judicial experience and her overall qualifications.\n  Judge Sotomayor has more Federal judicial experience than any jurist \nnominated to the Court in the last 100 years, and has more overall \njudicial experience than any nominee in the last 70 years. She is the \nfirst Supreme Court nominee to have sat on both a Federal trial court \nand an appellate court, and would be the only current justice with \ntrial court experience. Altogether, she has been a Federal judge for \nover 17 years, including 6 years on the U.S. District Court for the \nSouthern District of New York and 11 years on the U.S. Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit. In addition to serving on the bench, Judge \nSotomayor has a distinguished record as a prosecutor and an attorney in \nprivate practice.\n  Considering the depth of Judge Sotomayor's experience, it is not \nsurprising that after a thorough review of her record the American Bar \nAssociation unanimously gave her their highest rating. The ABA found \nthat she was ``well qualified'' to serve as a justice based on her \nintegrity, competence, and judicial temperament. Judge Sotomayor's \ntestimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee also demonstrated her \nadherence to mainstream jurisprudence and commitment to objectively \nmaking decisions based on the facts of each case and the applicable \nlegal precedent.\n  I strongly believe Judge Sotomayor has the qualifications, \nexperience, and impartiality necessary to be an excellent justice of \nthe Supreme Court, and I urge my colleagues to support her nomination.\n  I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Madam President, we have heard a number of discussions \nfrom Senators throughout this confirmation process regarding judicial \nactivism--what is it and what does it mean. I think our former \nJudiciary Committee chairman and great legal constitutional scholar, \nOrrin Hatch, has defined it clearly and fairly and in the right way. \nOrrin Hatch has said for years that judicial activism is when a judge \nis assigned a case and they allow their personal, political, moral, \nreligious or ideological views to influence their decision, and not \nrender a verdict based on the law and the facts. It is true of a \nconservative jurist with a conservative ideology as well as a liberal.\n  In truth, in recent years, we have had a pretty frequent national \ndebate--for maybe 20 or more years--over this question. The \nintellectual defense of activism--the living constitutional view of \nactivism--has come from the liberal side. Conservatives have said: No, \nthat is not the role of a judge. A judge is supposed to decide the \ndiscrete issue before them in a way that handles that case because it \nmay well provide precedent in the future. And that is what they should \ndo and not be expansive in their rulings and set policy or to promote \nsome long-term agenda they believe--rightly or wrongly--may be the \ngreatest thing the country could ever do. They weren't elected to set \npolicy. Judges aren't elected to declare to the United States how we \nought to tax or regulate the environment or that kind of thing. That is \nwhat the legislative branch gets to do.\n  So I wished to raise that and discuss it a little further. It has \nalso been mischaracterized that conservative jurists who show restraint \nare activists--they are not, but they have been accused of activism--\nbecause they have actually seen fit to throw out and find \nunconstitutional a statute passed by Congress. Well, we passed an 800-\npage stimulus package, we passed a bailout bill last fall that nobody \neven got to read or to study. I am surprised there are not more pieces \nof legislation held unconstitutional than there are.\n  It is not activism for a judge, such as Chief Justice Roberts--who \nhas been accused of being an activist--to declare a statute \nunconstitutional. What would be wrong is if he were doing so to promote \nhis own personal views about policy. That would be wrong.\n  The second amendment to the Constitution says that ``a well-regulated \nmilitia being essential for the security of a free State, the right of \nthe people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'' That is what \nthe second amendment says. It is in the Constitution. It is one of the \nBill of Rights. Essentially, when the city of Washington, DC--a Federal \nenclave, a district--saw fit to almost completely ban the right of \ncitizens in this city to have guns, Chief Justice Roberts and four \nother members of the Supreme Court found it violated the Constitution. \nIt violated the right of the people to keep and bear arms. That is not \nactivism, is what I am saying. Somehow we have gotten confused on this \nmatter. Therefore, we need to be alerted to it.\n  Sometimes my colleagues, I think, have tried to say: Well, everybody \ndoes it. Everybody is an activist, so the Constitution is a malleable \ndocument. It gets redefined as the years go by. It is a living \ndocument, they say. But it is not living, is it? You can go over to the \narchives building and you can see it. It is a contract. The American \npeople granted certain rights to this government and they reserved \ncertain rights to themselves. Of the rights they reserved, for example, \nwas the right of free speech, the right to assemble, and to criticize \ntheir incumbent politicians if they are not happy with them. They \nreserved the right to keep and bear arms.\n  I think we need to get our minds straight. Judges should see their \nrole as a limited role, and they should not seek to impose their policy \nvalues on the country. They should see it as then-Judge Roberts said in \nhis hearing so beautifully and so eloquently: A\n\n[[Page S8922]]\n\njudge is a neutral umpire. They call the balls and strikes. They do not \ntake sides in the ball game. How much more basic can it be than that?\n  I wanted to try to clarify that point, and I think it is important. \nWe have other constitutional rights--the right to keep your property \nunless it be taken for public use, such as a highway. That is a public \nuse. But in the Kelo case, 5 to 4, and in the case rendered by Judge \nSotomayor, they ruled that the government could take one man's \ndrugstore--his property on which he was going to build a private \ndrugstore--and the city could condemn it and give the property to \nanother man to build a different drugstore on for personal profit. \nWhere does the public use come from?\n  Justice O'Connor dissented in the Kelo case and ruled the other way. \nShe ruled the other way, and it was okay to do that. The case dealing \nwith Judge Sotomayor went even further than that. But it is not \nactivism for a court to say that no city, or whatever, can take a man's \nproperty under some redevelopment scheme or plan so they can get more \ntax money, because if they take it and give it to this other private \nguy, he can build a big shopping center there and they will get more \ntax revenue. That is not a public use. The question is: Is the property \nused for a public purpose, not otherwise? The Constitution gives an \nindividual the right to have their own property and people can't take \nit from you.\n  The Constitution, likewise, says every American citizen is entitled \nto equal protection of the laws and that they cannot be denied equal \nprotection of the laws on account of their race. It is a big important \nconstitutional issue. So we get into a situation where a city, New \nHaven, conducts a fair test, by all accounts; a carefully crafted test. \nNo one criticized its validity. They conducted a test and 18 \nfirefighters passed the test. They testified that they studied very \nhard to master the test which related directly to their firefighting \nability. They go out and do the right thing and they are on track to be \npromoted. But not enough people of one group or another did well on the \ntest, and the city--the government--decides they didn't get the results \nthey liked on this test and so they threw it out.\n  It is not activism for the U.S. Supreme Court to say--really all of \nthem to say--that this is not right, that this is not complying with \nthe Constitution or even the civil rights statutes in America that \nrequire equal justice under the law, not favoritism based on one or the \nother because of their background, ethnicity, or race. That is just \nwhat it is all about.\n  The Justices on the Supreme Court, the ones who are known for showing \nrestraint, should not be criticized if on occasion they declare the \nU.S. Congress did something wrong and it was unconstitutional. I am \nafraid we do it more often than we like to admit, the truth be known. \nBills come through here late at night, nobody has done any \nconstitutional research on most of what is in them to see if it is \nconstitutional or not. The American people are entitled to have the \nfinal decision about constitutionality rest with a court that is \nprepared to defend their individual rights.\n  On the three cases I mentioned--the case of a property taking from a \nprivate individual, the case of 18 firefighters who passed the test and \nwere ready to claim their promotion, and the question of the right to \nkeep and bear arms--each one of those was an individual situation in \nwhich an individual American appealed to the courts and claimed they \nhave a right in plain words provided to them by the Constitution and \nthey are asserting that right and they are pleading their case in the \nCourt and asking the Court to grant them that right. In the three cases \nI mentioned, unfortunately Judge Sotomayor ruled with the government, \nthe power of the State, and against the individuals asserting their \nclaims in three exceedingly important cases.\n  It is not activism to throw out a city's decision on forfeiture or \nguns; nor is it activism to throw out a decision that discriminates \nagainst American citizens based on their race.\n  That is one of the things we discussed a lot in this debate. I think \nit has been a good debate. I complimented Senator Leahy this morning \nagain. He gave us all a chance to ask questions. We had 30 minutes, as \nwe have done before. Some wanted to do less, but he said no, that is \nthe way we do these things. We had 30-minute rounds and then 20-minute \nrounds and then 10-minute rounds to ask questions. I think pretty much \nthe fundamental issues involved in this nomination got discussed in \ncommittee. Some written questions were filed in addition. Now that it \nis on the Senate floor, I believe the Members of the Senate have an \nadequate record from which they can make a decision on what they think \nis best for America.\n  I believe we should not have anyone on the Court who is not committed \nto the Constitution, not committed to putting aside their personal \npolitical agenda, and who will stay in strict adherence to the law and \nthe facts of the cases that come before them. That is how I evaluated \nthis case.\n  I am proud of Judge Sotomayor. She handled herself well and patiently \nat the committee. She was asked a lot of tough questions, but if you \nwant to be a Justice on the U.S. Supreme Court you have to be prepared \nfor that. You should not submit yourself if you are not prepared for \nthat. But she handled it nicely and courteously.\n  I think the Senators conducted themselves well also. A lot of people \nwanted to vote for her but, as the hearings went by and they studied \nthe record, they concluded they were not able to vote for her based on \nphilosophy and her approach to the law. But I think the committee \nhearing did what it was supposed to.\n  There have been no delays. This will be one of the fastest \nconfirmations in history. Within a few hours we will be having an up-\nor-down vote on her confirmation, unlike what happened when Judge \nAlito--a fabulous nominee, in my opinion--was subjected to a filibuster \nbefore he was confirmed. She is going to be given an up-or-down vote in \njust a few hours.\n  I thank the Chair for this time. I look forward to the rest of the \ndebate and final vote in a few hours.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, for a second time now, I come to the \nfloor to voice my opposition to the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to be \nan Associate Justice. I cannot support her nomination because I am not \npersuaded she has the right judicial philosophy to be on the Supreme \nCourt. I have spoken many times and have again spoken at the Judiciary \nCommittee and on the floor at some length about my reasons for opposing \nthe judge's confirmation, but I want to reiterate some of these reasons \nbefore we vote on her nomination about 2 hours from now.\n  It is the Senate's constitutional responsibility to thoroughly review \nthe qualifications of the President's judicial nominations. This advice \nand consent process is especially important when we consider nominees \nto the Supreme Court, which obviously is the highest court in our land.\n  Both Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions did an admirable job \nin conducting a fair but very rigorous examination of the judge's \nrecord. The nominee was asked tough questions, but she was also treated \nfairly and with respect, as is appropriate for all judicial nominees.\n  We want to make sure judicial nominees have a number of qualities, \nbut superior intelligence, academic excellence, distinguished legal \nbackground, personal integrity, and proper judicial demeanor and \ntemperament are not the only qualities we must consider in a judicial \nnominee. Judges, and in particular Supreme Court nominees, must have a \ntrue understanding of the proper role of a Justice as envisioned by the \nwriters of the Constitution as well as an ability to faithfully \ninterpret the law and Constitution without personal bias and \nprejudices. Since becoming a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee \nthe very first year I came to the Senate in 1981, I have used this \nstandard to confirm both Republican and Democratic Presidents' nominees \nfor the Supreme Court.\n\n[[Page S8923]]\n\n  Because Supreme Court Justices have the last say with respect to the \nlaw and have the ability to make precedent, they do not have the same \nkinds of restraints lower court judges have. So we need to be convinced \nthese nominees have judicial restraint--in other words, the self-\nrestraint to resist interpreting the Constitution to satisfy their \npersonal beliefs and preferences. We need to be persuaded these \nnominees will be impartial in their judging and bound by the words of \nthe Constitution and legal precedent. We need to be certain these \nnominees will not overstep their bounds and encroach upon the duties of \nthe legislative and executive branch. That is our checks-and-balances \nsystem of government. Our American legal tradition demands that judges \nnot take on the role of policymakers, reserved to those of us in the \nlegislative branch, but that instead they check their biases and \npreferences and politics at the door of the courthouse. The \npreservation of our individual freedoms depends on limiting \npolicymaking to legislators rather than on elected judges who have a \nlifetime appointment.\n  When then-Senator Obama voted against now-Chief Justice Roberts, he \nspoke from his desk over there about how a judge needed to have, in his \nwords, ``empathy'' to decide the hard cases. He said:\n\n       That last mile can only be determined on the basis of one's \n     deepest values, one's core concerns, one's broader \n     perspective on how the world works and the depth and breadth \n     of one's empathy. . . . in these difficult cases the critical \n     ingredient is supplied by what is in the judge's heart.\n\n  In another speech, President Obama further elaborated on this empathy \nstandard:\n\n       In those 5 percent of cases, what you've got to look at is \n     what is in the Justice's heart. What's their broader vision \n     of what America should be . . . We need somebody who's got \n     the heart--the empathy--to recognize what it's like to be a \n     young teenage mom, the empathy to understand what it's like \n     to be poor or African-American or gay or disabled or old--and \n     that's the criteria by which I'll be selecting my judges.\n\n  He spoke very well in that quote about the empathy those of us who \nwere elected ought to have, but I think he spoke incorrectly about what \njudges should have. And when the President then nominated Judge \nSotomayor to the Supreme Court, he did that with the belief that she \nmeets his empathy standard.\n  President Obama's empathy standard has been widely criticized as \ncontrary to the proper role of judges--and that is my point--and that \nis because an empathy standard necessarily connotes standards of \nimpartiality. That is a very radical departure from our American \ntradition of blind impartial justice. In fact, even Judge Sotomayor \nrepudiated President Obama's empathy standard at her confirmation \nhearing.\n  A judge's impartiality is so critical to his or her duty as an \nofficer in an independent judiciary that it is mentioned three times in \nthe oath of office for Federal judges. Every judge swears ``to \nadminister justice without respect to persons,'' to ``do equal right to \nthe poor and to the rich,'' and to ``faithfully and impartially \ndischarge and perform all [his] duties.'' That is from the oath judges \ntake. Therefore, empathetic judges who choose to embrace their personal \nbiases cannot uphold their sworn oath.\n  If we are to have a government of laws and not of men and women, then \nour judges must not favor any party or class over another, whether they \nbe historically privileged or historically disadvantaged. Our judges \nmust decide the cases before them on the law this Congress writes and \nwhat it requires, even if the law compels a result that is at odds with \nthe judge's personal, deeply held feelings.\n  The fact that we have an independent judiciary means that it is not a \npolitical body. In exchange for remaining unchecked by the will of the \npeople, the judicial branch is required to maintain impartiality. This \ncountry was founded on the principle that justice is the same for \neveryone. No one is entitled to special treatment, whether by fate or \nfortune, because no man or woman is above the law.\n  No matter what you call it--empathy, compassion, personal bias, or \nfavoritism--it can have no place in the decisionmaking process of a \njudge--it can have a place in decisionmaking by a Senator--but \nespecially in the case of the judicial branch, notably the Supreme \nCourt or a Supreme Court Justice.\n  While justice is not an automated or mechanical process, it also is \nnot a process that permits a patchwork of cases where the outcome is \ndetermined not by the law but by the judge's personal predilections. \nJudges may differ on what the law is, but they should never reach a \nconclusion because of a difference in ideology or because of their \nempathy for one of the parties.\n  An empathy standard for judging would betray the very cause of \nequality that it purports to champion by creating classes among our \ncitizens in the eyes of the law. That is what is so dangerous about \nPresident Obama's standard and why we should be cautious in deferring \nto his choices for the judicial branch. That is why we should continue \nto assess judicial nominees based on their fidelity to the rule of law \nand not on some well-intentioned hope or belief that the personal \nbiases they will rely on in judging will be the right ones.\n  Unfortunately, Judge Sotomayor's speeches and writings over the years \nreveal a judicial philosophy that highlights the importance of personal \npreferences and beliefs in her judicial method. Her speeches and \nwritings reveal her views of a judge and judicial decisionmaking \nprocess that are quite contrary to what our American tradition demands \nof the judiciary and our system of justice.\n  I will cite a few troubling statements she has made. She questioned \n``whether achieving the goal of impartiality is possible at all in even \nmost cases'' and also ``whether by ignoring our differences as men, \nwomen, people of color, we do a disservice to both the law and the \nsociety.''\n  She promoted identity politics where she openly admitted that ``[my \nexperiences] will affect the facts I choose to see'' and that ``I \nwillingly accept that . . . judge[s] must not deny the differences \nresulting from experience and heritage.''\n  She claimed that the court of appeals is where ``policy is made.''\n  She said that a ``wise Latina would more often than not reach a \nbetter conclusion than a white male.''\n  She disagreed with a statement by Justice O'Connor that ``a wise old \nwoman and a wise old man would eventually reach the same conclusion in \na case.''\n  She said that ``unless American courts are more open to discussing \nthe ideas raised by foreign cases, and by international cases, that we \nare going to lose influence in the world,'' as if it is for the Supreme \nCourt Justices to worry about our influence in the world. It seems to \nme the chief diplomat of our country is the President of the United \nStates. She urged judges to look to foreign law so they can get their \n``creative juices'' flowing.\n  At her confirmation hearing, Judge Sotomayor attempted to distance \nherself from these statements and explain them away, most likely \nrecognizing that they were controversial and out of the mainstream. \nHowever, in my mind, she was not very successful. Even the Washington \nPost said Judge Sotomayor's testimony about some of her statements \nbefore the Judiciary Committee was ``less than candid'' and \n``uncomfortably close to disingenuous.''\n  I was not the only one who had problems reconciling what Judge \nSotomayor said at the hearing with the statements she has repeated over \nand over throughout the years. That is because the statements made at \nthe hearing and those made in speeches and in law review articles \noutside the hearing are polar opposites. Some of her explanations were \ncontrived or far-fetched. In my opinion, these statements in her \nwritings and speeches cannot be reconciled with her hearing testimony. \nI am not sure which Judge Sotomayor I am to believe. She appears to be \nJustice Ginsburg in her speeches and writings but made statements like \nChief Justice Roberts in her confirmation hearing.\n  So I think the Washington Post's conclusions are worth repeating:\n\n       Judge Sotomayor's attempts to explain away and distance \n     herself from that [wise Latina] statement were uncomfortably \n     close to disingenuous, especially when she argued that her \n     reason for raising questions about gender or race was to warn \n     against injecting personal bias into the judicial process. \n     Her repeated and lengthy speeches on that matter do not \n     support that interpretation.\n\n\n[[Page S8924]]\n\n\n  I am not only troubled by the speeches and writings of the judge--\nthese were produced during her time as a sitting judge on the Second \nCircuit--and her contradictory statements before the Judiciary \nCommittee but I also have concerns with cases Judge Sotomayor decided \nwhen she sat on the Second Circuit. Some cases raise serious concerns \nabout whether Judge Sotomayor will adequately protect the second \namendment right to bear arms and the fifth amendment property rights.\n  Statements she made at the hearing raise concerns that she will \ninappropriately create or expand rights under the Constitution. Other \ncases raise concerns about whether she will impose her personal policy \ndecisions instead of those of the legislative or executive branch. In \naddition, Judge Sotomayor's track record on the Supreme Court is not a \nparticularly good one. She has been reversed 8 out of 10 times and was \ncriticized in another of the 10 cases.\n  At the hearing, Judge Sotomayor was asked about her understanding of \nrights under the Constitution, including the second and fifth \namendments and the right to privacy. She was asked about her legal \nanalysis in certain cases, like the Ricci, Maloney and Didden cases. \nShe was also asked about how she views precedent and applies it in \ncases before her. Ultimately, I wasn't satisfied with her responses, \nnor was I reassured that Judge Sotomayor would disregard her strong \npersonal sympathies and prejudices when ruling on hard cases dealing \nwith important constitutional rights.\n  With respect to the Ricci case, I wasn't persuaded by Judge \nSotomayor's claims that she followed precedent, nor her explanation as \nto why she could dismiss such a significant case in summary fashion. \nThe only reason this case found its way to the Supreme Court was \nbecause her Second Circuit colleague read about it in the newspaper, \nrecognized its importance, and asked to have it reconsidered. When the \nSupreme Court reversed Judge Sotomayor's decision, it held that there \nwas no ``strong basis in evidence'' to support her opinion. In fact, \nher legal reasoning in Ricci was so flawed, all nine Justices rejected \nit.\n  With respect to the Maloney case, I was concerned with Judge \nSotomayor's explanation of her decision holding that the second \namendment right to bear arms is not ``fundamental,'' as well as her \nclaims that she was simply following Supreme Court and Seventh Circuit \nprecedent. I was also concerned with her refusal to affirm that \nAmericans have a right of self-defense. If Maloney is upheld by the \nSupreme Court, the second amendment will not apply against State and \nlocal governments, thus permitting potentially unrestricted limitations \non this important constitutional right.\n  With respect to the Didden case, I was troubled with Judge \nSotomayor's failure to understand that her decision dramatically and \ninappropriately expands the ability of State, local, and Federal \nGovernments to seize private property under the Constitution. In fact, \nbased on the Didden holding, it is not clear whether there are any \nlimits to the ability of State, local, and Federal Governments to take \nprivate property. I also was concerned with Judge Sotomayor's \nmischaracterization of the Supreme Court's holding in Kelo. And I \nwasn't satisfied with her explanation about why she summarily dismissed \nthe property owner's claims based on the statute of limitations. I \ndon't think these concerns are off the mark--the Didden case has been \ndescribed as ``probably the most extreme anti-property rights ruling by \nany federal court since Kelo.''\n\n  So Judge Sotomayor's discussion of landmark Supreme Court cases and \nher own Second Circuit decisions raise questions in my mind about \nwhether she understands the rights given to Americans under the \nConstitution. I question whether she will refrain from expanding or \nrestricting those rights based on her personal preferences.\n  Almost two decades ago, then-Judge Souter during his confirmation \nhearing spoke about courts ``filling vacuums'' in the law. That \ndiscussion struck me as odd and troubled me, because clearly it is not \nthe role of a court to fill voids in the law left by Congress. Although \nJudge Souter backtracked on his courts ``filling vacuums'' statement \nwhen I pressed him about it, I believe that his decisions on the \nSupreme Court actually reveal that he does believe courts can and do \nfill vacuums in the law. It is no secret that I regret my vote to \nconfirm him. And because of that, I have asked several Supreme Court \nnominees about the propriety of judges ``filling vacuums'' in the law \nat their confirmation hearings. So this question shouldn't have come as \na surprise to Judge Sotomayor when I asked her about it at her \nconfirmation hearing. Unfortunately, I wasn't satisfied with her \nlukewarm answers to my question. In fact, it just reinforced the \nconcerns I had with her hearing testimony, cases, speeches and \nwritings.\n  Judge Sotomayor has overcome many obstacles to get to where she is \ntoday. There is no doubt that Judge Sotomayor is an engaging, talented, \nintelligent woman. She has tremendous legal experience and many other \ngood qualities. I very much enjoyed meeting with her and getting to \nknow her personally. But I can't just base my decision on these things. \nI have to look at her judicial philosophy and determine whether I \nbelieve it is one that is appropriate for the Supreme Court. That is my \nconstitutional responsibility. And based on her answers at the hearing \nand her decisions, writings, and speeches, I am not comfortable with \nwhat I understand to be Judge Sotomayor's judicial philosophy. I am not \npersuaded that she will protect important constitutional rights, and I \nam not convinced that she will refrain from creating new rights under \nthe Constitution. I am not persuaded that she won't allow her own \npersonal biases and prejudices to seep into her decisionmaking process \nand dictate the outcome of cases before her. So it is with regret that \nI must oppose her nomination to the Supreme Court.\n  I said this in the Judiciary Committee, and I repeat it now on the \nfloor. Only time will tell which Judge Sotomayor will sit on the \nSupreme Court. Is it the judge who proclaimed that the court of appeals \nis where ``policy is made,'' or is it the nominee who pledged \n``fidelity to the law?'' Is it the judge who disagreed with Justice \nO'Connor's statement that a wise woman and a wise man will ultimately \nreach the same decision, or is it the nominee who rejected President \nObama's empathy standard? Only time will tell.\n  Mr. CORKER. Madam President, Judge Sonia Sotomayor has an impressive \nbackground and an inspiring American story. She is a testament to the \npower of a strong work ethic and a focus on education and is a role \nmodel to many Americans as a result.\n  I enjoyed meeting with her in June and found her to be very \nintelligent and eloquent in expressing her thoughts. I let her know I \nwould reserve judgment on her nomination until the conclusion of a fair \nand thorough hearing process.\n  After much deliberation and careful review, I have determined that \nJudge Sotomayor's record and many of her past statements reflect a view \nof the Supreme Court that is different from my own.\n  I view the Supreme Court as a body charged with impartially deciding \nwhat the law means as it is applied to a specific case. I believe Judge \nSotomayor views the Supreme Court as more of a policymaking body where \nlaws are shaped based on the personal views of the justices.\n  Unfortunately, nothing I heard during Judge Sotomayor's confirmation \nhearing or in my meeting with her in June sufficiently allayed this \nconcern.\n  For this reason, I am disappointed to say, I will not be able to \nsupport Judge Sotomayor's nomination.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nRhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that this hour under \nDemocratic control be divided in the following manner: Reed of Rhode \nIsland, 15 minutes; Senator Carper, 10 minutes; Senator Kerry, 10 \nminutes; Senator Menendez, 5 minutes; Senator Schumer, 5 minutes; \nSenator Nelson of Florida, 3 minutes; and Senator Boxer, 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, the nomination before us of Sonia Sotomayor \nto replace Associate Justice David Souter is of great importance. The \nSupreme Court is the ultimate arbiter of justice\n\n[[Page S8925]]\n\nin the land. Therefore, this is one of the most consequential votes \nthat any Senator can cast.\n  The Constitution makes the Senate an active participant, along with \nthe President, in the confirmation of a Supreme Court justice. Article \nII, section 2, clause 2 of the Constitution states that nominees to the \nSupreme Court shall only be confirmed ``by and with the Advice and \nConsent of the Senate.'' The Senate's role in the confirmation process \nplaces an important democratic check on America's judiciary. As a \nresult, this body's consent is both a constitutional requirement and a \ndemocratic obligation. It is in upholding our constitutional duties as \nSenators to give the President advice and consent on his nominations \nthat I believe we have one of our greatest opportunities and \nresponsibilities to support and defend the Constitution of the United \nStates.\n  As I have said before, in weighing a nominee's qualifications for the \nCourt, we must consider an individual's intellectual gifts, experience, \njudgment, maturity and temperament. Judge Sotomayor's compelling life \nstory demonstrates that she possesses each of these qualities.\n  She overcame early adversity--with the loss of her father, a \ndiagnosis of juvenile diabetes--to become an accomplished student at \nher high school. She went on to Princeton, where she excelled both \ninside and outside of the classroom, receiving the school's highest \nacademic prize upon graduation.\n  From there she became a stellar student at Yale Law School and served \non its prestigious law journal. Upon graduating from Yale, Judge \nSotomayor surely had a number of very lucrative options available to \nher. It is a testament to her early commitment to public service that \nshe chose to serve 5 years as assistant district attorney in New York.\n  By all accounts, she was a zealous and thorough prosecutor and \ndemonstrated the same rigor and commitment to excellence that have been \nher hallmark throughout her career.\n  Judge Sotomayor is extremely qualified for this role. As a Supreme \nCourt Justice, Judge Sotomayor would bring to bear her rich and varied \nreal-world experience. She has been a big-city prosecutor. She has been \nan attorney in private practice. She has been a trial judge, and she \nalso knows what it means to be an appellate judge. Judge Sotomayor \nwould make history as only the third female Justice and the first \nHispanic Justice. Moreover, she has more Federal judicial experience \nthan any nominee to the Court in 100 years.\n  Yet as compelling as these qualities and accomplishments are, there \nis a higher bar for a nominee to the Nation's highest Court. In \nprevious consideration of Supreme Court judges, I have stated my test \nfor a nominee for the Supreme Court. It is a simple test, one drawn \nfrom the text, the history and the principles of the Constitution. A \nnominee to the Supreme Court must live up to the spirit of the \nConstitution. A nominee must not only commit to enforcing the laws but \nalso to doing justice. A nominee must give life and meaning to the \ngreat principles of the Constitution: Equality before the law, due \nprocess, freedom of conscience, individual responsibility, and the \nexpansion of opportunity.\n  In my view, Judge Sotomayor has met this test quite admirably. Judge \nSotomayor's opinions demonstrate that she is no ideologue. Instead, she \nseeks to carefully weigh the facts in determining a just and fair \noutcome.\n  One issue of great concern at this time of conflict is executive \npower. As Commander in Chief, the President's duty is to guard the \ncountry's national security while also safeguarding individual \nfreedoms. All too often, in my view, President Bush, guided by other \ngovernment officials and questionable legal opinions, erred on the side \nof concentrating executive power. Indeed, I noted during my comments on \nJudge Alito's nomination that his avowal of the unitary executive \ntheory was troubling in light of the Bush administration's policies. \nJudge Sotomayor's record on this issue suggests that she would more \nappropriately balance national security and individual freedom, and the \nrole of Congress.\n  In the case of Doe v. Mukasey, she joined a unanimous panel decision \nthat stated:\n\n       The fiat of a governmental official, though senior in rank \n     and doubtless honorable in the execution of official duties, \n     cannot displace the judicial obligation to enforce \n     constitutional requirements. ``Under no circumstances shall \n     the Judiciary become the handmaiden of the Executive.''\n\n  But she has also shown a clear recognition that within the \nappropriate sphere, the executive must be supported. In Cassidy v. \nChertoff, she authored a unanimous panel opinion on the \nconstitutionality of a ferry company's search of baggage and vehicles. \nThe panel ultimately concluded that searches were permissible because \n``it is minimally intrusive, and we cannot say, particularly in light \nof the deference we owe to the Coast Guard, that it does not constitute \n`a reasonable method of deterring the prohibited conduct.' ''\n  In answering questions from my colleagues on the boundaries of \npresidential power during her confirmation hearing, Judge Sotomayor \nchose her words carefully. However, she was clear in affirming that no \none is above the law. On this issue and many others, Judge Sotomayor \nhas demonstrated a fair and balanced approach that will add to the high \nCourt.\n  I believe Judge Sotomayor would be an able successor to Judge Souter \na court that in recent years has taken a sharp turn away from \nprotections of privacy, freedom, and other values we hold dear.\n  Judge Sotomayor's careful application of the facts to the \nConstitution and the quest for justice persuade me that she will make a \nworthy addition to our Nation's highest Court. Indeed, she meets my \ntest as someone who will not only uphold the letter of the law but the \nspirit of the law. It is with great pleasure that I support her \nnomination to the highest Court in the land and urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a joint letter \nof support signed by more than 1,200 law professors from all 50 States \nand the District of Columbia. In their joint letter, these professors \nwrite:\n\n       Her opinions reflect careful attention to the facts of each \n     case and a reading of the law that demonstrates fidelity to \n     the text of statutes and the Constitution. She pays close \n     attention to precedent and has proper respect for the role of \n     courts and the other branches of government in our society.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jefferson B. Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, U.S. Senate Committee on the Judiciary, \n         Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Ranking Member Sessions: We the \n     undersigned professors of law write in support of the \n     confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as an Associate Justice \n     of the United States Supreme Court.\n       As a federal judge at both the trial and appellate levels, \n     Judge Sotomayor has distinguished herself as a brilliant, \n     careful, fair-minded jurist whose rulings exhibit unfailing \n     adherence to the rule of law. Her opinions reflect careful \n     attention to the facts of each case and a reading of the law \n     that demonstrates fidelity to the text of statutes and the \n     Constitution. She pays close attention to precedent and has \n     proper respect for the role of courts and the other branches \n     of government in our society. She has not been reluctant to \n     protect core constitutional values and has shown a commitment \n     to providing equal justice for all who come before her.\n       Judge Sotomayor's stellar academic record at Princeton and \n     Yale Law School is testament to her intellect and hard work, \n     and is especially impressive in light of her rise from modest \n     circumstances. That she went on to serve as an Assistant \n     District Attorney for New York County speaks volumes about \n     her strength of character and commitment to the rule of law. \n     When in private practice as a corporate litigator in New \n     York, she was deeply engaged in public activities, including \n     service on the New York Mortgage Agency and the New York City \n     Campaign Finance Board, as well as serving on the Board of \n     Directors of the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education \n     Fund.\n       Her career won bi-partisan respect, which led to her \n     becoming a U.S. District Court judge (nominated by President \n     George H.W. Bush on the recommendation of Senator Daniel \n     Patrick Moynihan, and confirmed by a majority Democratic \n     Senate in 1992). Her performance on the district court \n     solidified Judge Sotomayor's support, and in 1998 she was \n     elevated to the Second Circuit (nominated by President Bill \n     Clinton and confirmed by a majority Republican Senate).\n       Judge Sotomayor will bring to the Supreme Court an \n     extraordinary personal story, academic qualifications, \n     remarkable professional accomplishments and much needed \n     ethnic and gender diversity. We are\n\n[[Page S8926]]\n\n     confident that Judge Sotomayor's intelligence, her character \n     forged by her extraordinary background and experience, and \n     her profound respect for the law and the craft of judging \n     make her an exceptionally well-qualified nominee to the \n     Supreme Court and we urge her speedy confirmation.\n\n  Mr. REED. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARPER. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I rise in support of Judge Sonia \nSotomayor's confirmation to the U.S. Supreme Court. Those of us who are \nprivileged to serve in the Senate cast literally thousands of votes \nduring our years here. We take many votes that crucial and important. \nBut a handful of them are far more meaningful than others. These votes \nhave historic consequences, ones which will resonate for years--in some \ncases, for decades--to come. This is one of those votes.\n  This is my third opportunity to vote on a Supreme Court nominee. On \nthe previous two occasions, we faced different circumstances in which I \nhad to decide whether to vote for or against candidates who were \nnominated by a President not of my party, nominees who may not have \nshared my political beliefs or my judicial philosophy. Similar to my \ncolleagues, I take seriously our constitutional obligation to provide \nadvice and consent to determine whether a President's nominees truly \nmerit a lifetime appointment.\n  In each of those two earlier cases, I considered my decision \ncarefully and deliberately. In one of those cases, that of now-Chief \nJustice John Roberts, I chose to support the President's selection. In \nthe other, I did not. Reasonable people can disagree about the nominee \nbefore us this week. I certainly respect the views of my friends on the \nother side of the aisle who may ultimately vote against Judge \nSotomayor's confirmation. But, first, I wish to explain why I am \nsupporting Judge Sotomayor and, second, I want to encourage my \nRepublican colleagues to support her nomination as well.\n  In 2005, I voted to confirm Judge John Roberts' nomination to become \nChief Justice of the Supreme Court. I admitted it was a close call, at \nleast it was for me. Ultimately, I chose to take what I described at \nthat time as a ``leap of faith.''\n  Chief Justice Roberts holds political and legal opinions that are not \nconsistent totally with mine in a number of respects. I knew he would \nsometimes deliver decisions I might not fully agree with. But after \ncarefully considering his testimony, meeting with him at some length, \nand personally talking to a number of his colleagues--colleagues who \nknew him well and colleagues who had worked closely with him in the \npast--I concluded that John Roberts would prove to be a worthy \nsuccessor to retiring Chief Justice Rehnquist, and I think he has.\n  In short, by supporting John Roberts' nomination, I voted my hopes, \nnot my fears. Just as I voted my hopes instead of my fears in the case \nof then-Judge, now-Chief Justice Roberts, I hope many of our friends \nand colleagues on the other side of the aisle will see their way clear \nto doing the same in this instance.\n  Before coming to the Senate, I served as Governor of Delaware. As \nGovernor, I nominated dozens of--actually scores of--men and women to \nserve as judges in our State courts. The qualities I sought in the \njudicial nominees whom I submitted to the Delaware State Senate \nincluded unimpeachable integrity, a thorough understanding of the law, \na keen intellect, a willingness to listen to both sides of a case, \nsound judicial temperament and judgment, and a strong work ethic.\n  These are qualities that still guide me as I decide how to vote on \njudicial nominees in the Senate. In applying each of those standards to \nJudge Sotomayor during the course of my examination of her record, it \nis clear to me she meets or exceeds all of them.\n  First, consider her experience. Judge Sotomayor has a compelling life \nstory--a story that confirms her work ethic and informs her judicial \ntemperament. In June of this year, I had the pleasure of meeting \npersonally with Judge Sotomayor. We spoke at length about her \nexperience, her service, and her life. We talked about our respective \nchildhoods, our respective educational opportunities, and our careers. \nIt was a revealing conversation, and her responses were forthright. \nThey were insightful. And they were sincere.\n  The nominee before us truly highlights the diversity of the country \nin which we live. We know her story by now. Sonia Sotomayor grew up in \na south Bronx housing project. Her parents were both immigrants from \nPuerto Rico. Her father had limited education and did not speak \nEnglish.\n  Her mom worked 6 days a week to support her family and instilled in \nher daughter the importance of a quality education. Judge Sotomayor \nexcelled in school and went on to attend Princeton University on a \nscholarship. She later went on to Yale Law School, where she served as \nan editor of the Yale Law Journal.\n  I have met many people in my life who have built themselves up from \nnothing. Unfortunately, I have found that a number of them--maybe many \nof them--seem to have forgotten where they came from. But it is clear \nto me that Sonia Sotomayor has not forgotten. When we met, she told me \nshe was ``still Sonia from the projects.'' Despite all her success, she \nstill has not forgotten her roots. Let me say, I find that enormously \nrefreshing and encouraging.\n  After law school, Sonia Sotomayor served as an assistant district \nattorney in New York. During her 5 years in that position, she tried \ndozens of major criminal cases and became known, in the words of Robert \nMorgenthau--who was then, and still remains, the district attorney in \nManhattan--as a ``fearless and effective prosecutor.''\n  Starting in 1984, Sonia Sotomayor spent 8 years in private practice. \nAs a civil and international corporate litigator, she gained \nconsiderable experience in the private sector, handling cases involving \neverything from real estate to contract law, from intellectual property \nto banking.\n  Then, in 1992, with bipartisan support, Sonia Sotomayor began her \nservice to this country in the Federal judiciary. She was nominated to \nserve as a Federal district judge, not by a Democrat but by a \nRepublican, President George Herbert Walker Bush, and was unanimously--\nunanimously--confirmed by this Senate.\n  Six years later, when Democratic President Bill Clinton nominated her \nto the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, she received the support of 25 \nof our colleagues on the other side of the aisle. Their vote of \nconfidence in Judge Sotomayor then has since been confirmed by her \nreputation for moderation and impartiality.\n  The Second Circuit is considered by many to have one of the most \ndemanding caseloads in our Nation. Judge Sotomayor participated in over \n3,000 decisions and has written more than 230 opinions for the \nmajority. During her time on the bench, she examined difficult issues \nof constitutional law, complex business disputes, and high-profile \ncriminal cases.\n  Judge Sotomayor brings more Federal judicial experience to the \nSupreme Court than any Justice confirmed in the last 100 years.\n  As a Federal judge for nearly two decades, Sonia Sotomayor has \ndemonstrated a clear commitment to unbiased, impartial justice and to \nthe rule of law. Unlike some nominees for the Federal bench, with Judge \nSotomayor, we can see a long paper trail of her legal rulings.\n  Her record reveals that she consistently takes each case on its own \nmerits--regardless of the ideological outcome--and narrowly applies the \nlaw to the particular facts. She may even be more of a strict \nconstructionist, when it comes to applying the law, than many of the \nJustices my friends on the other side of the aisle admire the most. \nQuite frankly, she is a model of judicial restraint.\n  As a circuit court judge, Sonia Sotomayor is known as a moderate who \nagrees with her more conservative colleagues far more than she \ndisagrees with them. One of those colleagues on the Second Circuit, \nRichard C. Wesley, himself an appointee of George W. Bush, had this to \nsay about her:\n\n       Sonia is an outstanding colleague with a keen legal mind. \n     She brings a wealth of knowledge and hard work to all her \n     endeavors on our court. It is both a pleasure and an honor to \n     serve with her.\n\n\n[[Page S8927]]\n\n\n  Another Second Circuit colleague, Judge Roger Miner, who was \nappointed by President Ronald Reagan, described Judge Sotomayor as an \n``excellent choice,'' saying:\n\n       I don't think I'd go as far as to classify her in one camp \n     or another. I think she just deserves the classification of \n     outstanding judge.\n\n  And the Second Circuit's current chief judge, Dennis Jacobs, \nappointed by the first President Bush, said:\n\n       Sonia Sotomayor is a well-loved colleague on our court. \n     Everybody from every point of view knows that she is fair and \n     decent in all her dealings. The fact is, she is truly a \n     superior human being.\n\n  The strength of Judge Sotomayor's record and reputation is perhaps \nwhy, to some extent, many critics have focused almost exclusively on \none or two legal rulings, and on a line from a speech she gave years \nago. But I do not find much to agree with in these criticisms. But even \nif I did, it does not seem fair to me that she should be judged on \nthose few items alone. These few quibbles need to be put in the context \nof her lifetime of work.\n  Of all people--of all people--we in the Senate should understand \nthis. As Senators, whether we have served here for 12 years or 24 years \nor for 50 years, such as Robert Byrd has done, we will vote thousands \nof times. As many of us know from personal experience, it is easy to \ntake one vote or one decision or one line from one of our speeches \ncompletely out of context and make us appear to be someone we are not \nor to stand for something that is entirely alien to our beliefs and \nvalues. It has happened to me. I suspect it has happened to most, if \nnot all, of our colleagues. I might add, I believe that is what has \nhappened to the nominee before us today.\n  As a result, I believe it is incumbent upon us to examine carefully a \nnominee's overall record, much as I hope the people of Delaware will \nconsider my overall record when they cast their votes every 6 years.\n  If nothing else, Judge Sotomayor's extensive record demonstrates she \nsticks to the law. Perhaps that is why, in part, the American Bar \nAssociation has given this judge, this nominee, its top rating of \n``well qualified'' in assessing her record and in evaluating her \njudicial temperament.\n  For all these reasons--and more--I invite my conservative colleagues \non the other side of the aisle to take a leap of faith, as I did a few \nyears ago with John Roberts--as I did 4 years ago--and join me in \ncasting their vote in favor of Judge Sotomayor's nomination to serve on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court.\n  With that, I say thank you to the Presiding Officer and yield the \nfloor. Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I have never missed a vote on a \nnomination for a Supreme Court Justice in my time in the Senate. Today, \nI will vote to support the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor. I \nsubmitted questions to Judge Sotomayor on matters of great importance \nto the preservation of congressional power: the constitutional grant of \nthe purse strings to the Congress; the role and responsibility of the \nlegislative branch to conduct oversight and investigation; and the \ndeliberate restraints on the executive branch created by the \nConstitution's separation of powers. I found her answers thoughtful, \nher intellect keen, and that Judge Sotomayor possessed the requisite \nreverence--and patience--for the process outlined in article II, \nsection 2 of the Constitution.\n\n  I watched the hearings intently; I studied Judge Sotomayor's words. \nWhat struck me about the Judiciary Committee's hearings was the dearth \nof inquiry into her judicial record. Indeed, her record is certainly \nsubstantial; the most substantial record I have seen in some time. But, \ninstead of delving into her many opinions, or questioning her on \nSupreme Court jurisprudence, Judge Sotomayor was asked the same few \nquestions over and over, needlessly.\n  The tendency to grandstand is hardly a partisan thing. The Senate's \nability to question a nominee is a precious gift from our Founding \nFathers--a check on the Judiciary and on the Executive. While the \nPresident may nominate, the advice and consent of the Senate is \nrequired for confirmation. But, in this particular instance, partisan \ntrifles took the place of constitutional probing. Statements were taken \nout of context, while volumes of Judge Sotomayor's judicial record went \nunquestioned, and likely unread. Unfortunately, by not probing, the \nSenate shirks its responsibilities.\n  Judge Sotomayor's story is similar to my own story. Much like my own \njourney from the southern coalfields of Raleigh County to the U.S. \nSenate, Judge Sotomayor overcame tremendous adversity through \ndetermination and hard work.\n  Judge Sotomayor will be confirmed by the Senate. That is a good \nthing. I hope that we as a body will reflect on the nomination and \nconfirmation processes as envisioned in the Constitution, and ask \nourselves whether we can do a better job in living up to the spirit of \nthe law in the future.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today to announce my full \nsupport for the confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be our \nNation's 111th Supreme Court Justice. I am proud of Judge Sotomayor's \ndedication to her country, and I am impressed by her outstanding \naccomplishments. Today marks an historic occasion for our country, as \nJudge Sotomayor becomes only the third woman and first Hispanic ever to \nserve on the highest Court in the land.\n  The decision of whether to confirm a nominee for a lifetime \nappointment to the U.S. Supreme Court is one of the Senate's most \nsignificant and solemn duties under the Constitution. It will affect \ngenerations of Americans for years to come.\n  After 24 years of service to the people of West Virginia as their \nU.S. Senator, the nomination of Judge Sotomayor marks the 11th Supreme \nCourt nominee under five Presidents that I have had the opportunity to \nconsider. I have supported most nominees, but have opposed some. In \neach instance, I came to my decision after a careful and thorough \nprocess, and the same is true of my support for Judge Sotomayor.\n  The first question that must be answered about any nominee is: Does \nhe or she possess the intellect, experience, and temperament to serve \non the Supreme Court? For Judge Sotomayor, the clear answer is yes.\n  Her educational and professional background is impeccable. She was \nvaledictorian of her high school class, graduated summa cum laude from \nPrinceton University, and served as an editor of the Yale Law Journal \nwhile attending Yale Law School. Judge Sotomayor has served with \ndistinction on almost every level of our judicial system as a \nprosecutor, civil litigator, district court judge, and appeals court \njudge. In her confirmation hearings before the Judiciary Committee, she \nshowed herself to be an even-tempered and honest person, as well as a \nstraightforward and critical thinker.\n  But once a nominee's impressive credentials and integrity are \nestablished, my analysis of his or her fitness to serve on the Supreme \nCourt cannot end. The tremendous responsibility that all Justices have \nto the Constitution--and their decisions' impact on all Americans \nrequires further consideration of the nominee's core beliefs about our \ncountry and our justice system.\n  Before supporting a nominee, I need to know that he or she \nunderstands the consequences of the Supreme Court's decisions. I need \nto know that he or she will protect the best interests of West \nVirginians. And I need to know that he or she will uphold the \nfundamental rights and freedoms that all Americans enjoy under the \nConstitution and in our laws.\n  Every American needs to know that our courthouse doors are open for \neveryone, not just the wealthy, the powerful, or the well-connected. \nThe Founders intended our courts to serve as a place where all citizens \ncan go to resolve disputes, seek relief from injustices, and hold \nwrongdoers accountable. As members of our court of last resort, Supreme \nCourt Justices have a particularly important role in upholding our \nconstitutional freedoms, even when lawmakers or public opinion would \nlimit them.\n  To understand the enormously important role of the Court in the lives \nof Americans, we need only look at cases such as Gideon v. Wainwright, \nin which the Court recognized the fundamental right of defendants to be \nrepresented by counsel, even those who cannot afford to hire an \nattorney; or Brown v. Board of Education, in which the Court struck \ndown racial segregation in our\n\n[[Page S8928]]\n\npublic schools. These are the types of decisions that require a deep \nrespect for our Constitution and the courage to do what is right.\n  After meeting with Judge Sotomayor in person and reviewing her \nextensive judicial record, I firmly believe that she possesses those \nqualities, and will always put the American people first.\n  I also believe that she understands the real world implications of \nour laws and how they affect the lives of everyday people. She knows \nwhat it is like to overcome adversity and work against the odds to \nbecome a successful lawyer and judge. In her, I see someone who shares \nthe values that are important to West Virginians: hard work; \ndetermination; love for her country; love for her family; and a sense \nof pride in her community. It is no surprise that her nomination is \nsupported by Democratic and Republican officials; conservatives, \nliberals, and moderates; prosecutors and law enforcement organizations; \ncivil rights organizations; former colleagues; and fellow jurists.\n  I am disappointed that some of my colleagues have suggested that \nJudge Sotomayor's comments in a few of her speeches indicate that she \nwill let personal biases influence her decisionmaking. I could not \ndisagree more. Her extensive judicial record reflects a fair, \nthoughtful, and careful approach to decisionmaking--one that is based \non meticulous analysis of the facts and a close following of the law \nand precedent.\n  As a trial court judge, she presided over approximately 450 cases. As \nan appeals court judge, she participated in over 3000 decisions and \nauthored approximately 400 published opinions. With 17 years of service \non the bench, she brings more Federal judicial experience to the \nSupreme Court than any nominee in nearly 100 years.\n  Judge Sotomayor's record speaks for itself, and I commend President \nObama for nominating such a highly qualified individual to serve my \nfellow West Virginians and Americans on the Supreme Court.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, the story of Sonia Sotomayor's life is a \nremarkable one. Born in humble circumstances, she has risen to the top \nof the legal field, and earned the opportunity to be considered for a \nplace on America's highest court.\n  As evidenced by her exceptional educational achievements, and her \nvast and varied legal resume as a prosecutor, private practice \nlitigator and Federal judge, Sonia Sotomayor is unquestionably \nqualified from the standpoint of experience, competence, and intellect. \nIn fact, having been appointed to the Federal bench in 1992 by \nPresident George H.W. Bush, she has more Federal judicial experience \nthan any Supreme Court nominee in 100 years, and more overall judicial \nexperience than any nominee in 70 years.\n  Judge Sotomayor's record places her squarely within the mainstream of \nAmerican jurisprudence. Even some of her harshest critics have conceded \nthat her long record on the bench is one of mainstream decisions and \njudicial opinions.\n  And Judge Sotomayor's record shows that she is not an activist and \nhas not legislated from the bench. Instead, she has faithfully adhered \nto precedent. In fact, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, \nCRS, found that ``perhaps the most consistent characteristic of Judge \nSotomayor's approach as an appellate judge has been an adherence to the \ndoctrine of stare decisis (i.e., the upholding of past judicial \nprecedents).'' Further, CRS found that Sotomayor has exhibited ``a \ncareful application of particular facts at issue in a case and a \ndislike for situations in which the court might be seen as overstepping \nits judicial role.''\n  Finally, Judge Sotomayor has the temperament to serve on the Supreme \nCourt. Her grueling nomination hearings demonstrated her patience, \nthoughtfulness and composure in the face of tough and aggressive \nquestioning by almost 20 Senators over several days.\n  Those same qualities of character were evident during our personal \nmeeting. During our wide-ranging discussion, I also found Judge \nSotomayor to be genuine, humble and open-minded. Although she grew up \nin an urban setting, I am confident that she can relate to people from \nmore rural areas like North Dakota, because she understands everyday \npeople and their struggles, she has common sense, and she is no \nstranger to hard work and the need to overcome obstacles. In short, I \nbelieve she learned the same values and the same lessons growing up in \nthe Bronx that I learned growing up in Bismarck.\n  Some Senators have announced their intention to vote against Judge \nSotomayor, but their criticism has not been based on a comprehensive \nassessment of her 17-year record as a judge, or her 30 years in the \nlegal profession. One source of opposition has been various comments \nshe has made in speeches, particularly on the topics of race and \ngender. Judge Sotomayor herself has admitted that she could have \nphrased some of her comments in these areas more effectively or \nappropriately. But when taken in their full context, her remarks seem \nto be primarily an expression of support for the unique American \n``melting pot'' and the notion that a diversity of backgrounds has made \nus a stronger and better nation. Perhaps more importantly, there is no \nevidence whatsoever that her personal views have improperly influenced \nher decisions in the courtroom.\n  Some have also questioned Sotomayor's views on gun rights, and, in \nparticular, whether or not she believes the second amendment restricts \nthe right of individual States to regulate firearms. Despite the \nconcerns that have been raised, a careful reading of her judicial \nrecord indicates that she has been very much in the judicial mainstream \non gun issues. And she clearly stated during her confirmation hearings \nthat she has a completely open mind on the specific question of how the \nsecond amendment should be applied to the States. I take her at her \nword, and it is my hope that the Supreme Court will indeed find that \nthe second amendment protects the rights of gun owners and users \nagainst intrusion by State laws.\n  When voting on judges, all we can do is look at the nominee's record \nand accomplishments, analyze his or her intellect and character, and \ndecide whether he or she is qualified to serve on the bench. I have \nconsistently followed that approach in the past, most recently in \nvoting to confirm Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito. Using the \nsame standards I applied to those nominations, I believe Sonia \nSotomayor is eminently qualified for a place on the Supreme Court, and \nI am proud to support her nomination.\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, there are few decisions that have a more \nlasting effect on our democracy than fulfilling my constitutional duty \nof advice and consent for Justices of the Supreme Court. This body will \nassume this tremendous responsibility once again today as we consider \nthe nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to fill a seat on the Supreme \nCourt that has been vacated by Justice David Souter. She is the third \nwoman to be nominated to the Supreme Court and the first nominee to be \nof Hispanic descent.\n  This will be the third time that I have cast a vote in regards to a \nSupreme Court Justice. The previous two times were for current Chief \nJustice Roberts and current Associate Justice Alito. Both of these \nJustices were appointed by former President George W. Bush. I voted in \nfavor of both of these nominees even though their ideologies often \ndiffer from my own. They are both qualified members of the Judiciary \nand while our philosophies may differ, they both are, and were, within \nthe broad mainstream of contemporary jurisprudence.\n  It is within this mainstream that I find Judge Sonia Sotomayor. Her \ncareer as a jurist is a model of integrity and discipline. Her judicial \nphilosophy is rooted in precedent and a devotion to the law. Judge \nSotomayor has consistently pledged during the confirmation process her \ncommitment to the law. She has stated that it is her duty to interpret \nthe law and not to enact law. She has many years of service and \nexperience as a prosecutor and litigator; district court judge and \ncircuit court Judge. She has twice received bipartisan support from \nthis body--the second time with my support. She has received the \nhighest rating from the American Bar Association. It is clear that she \nhas an accomplished resume.\n  Earlier this summer, I met with Judge Sotomayor to form my own \nopinions on her judicial theory. While our conversation centered on a \nvariety of interests, it was clear that Judge\n\n[[Page S8929]]\n\nSotomayor distinguished herself as an able jurist who relied on \nprecedent. I reviewed her record and did not find anything that would \ndeter me from that belief. The same can be said of her testimony before \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee during her confirmation hearings. She \nhas said that she does not inject personal bias in her decision making \nprocess and I trust her at her word.\n  Often, I think that this process has become overpoliticized. Judge \nSotomayor is highly qualified and able to serve on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt. Opposition for opposition's sake is not constructive to our \nnational dialogue. However, while I believe the President should have \nsome latitude in selecting judges this does not mean that those \nnominees should be ideologues that stand outside of conventional \njudicial theory. Most Americans do not sit on the ends of the political \nspectrum but within the middle. I believe that Judge Sotomayor is \nwithin that middle ground. I support Judge Sotomayor to be Associate \nJustice of the U.S. Supreme Court and look forward to casting my vote \nin favor of this historic nominee.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, today I rise to address one of the most \nsignificant and far reaching decisions a Senator makes: The vote on a \nconfirmation of a Supreme Court Justice. This vote will have an immense \nimpact on future generations. A Senator is called upon to make two \ndecisions that are irrevocable; one is the decision to go to war and \nthe other is the confirmation of the members of the Supreme Court. The \npeople of Maryland have entrusted in me the right make this decision \nand I take this responsibility very seriously.\n  When I decide how I will vote on any nominee for the Federal bench, I \nhave three criteria. First, the nominee must possess the highest \npersonal and professional integrity. Second, the nominee has to have \nthe competence and temperament to serve as a judge. Finally, the \nnominee must demonstrate a clear commitment to core constitutional \nprinciples. Judge Sonia Sotomayor passes all those tests with flying \ncolors.\n  If confirmed, Sonia Sotomayor would be the third woman to serve on \nthe Supreme Court and the first Hipanic on the Supreme Court. She has a \ncompelling personal story, as well as a distinguished judicial record. \nHer father was a tool-and-die worker with third grade education who \nspoke no English and died when Judge Sotomayor was only nine years old. \nShe was raised by her mother, a nurse in a public housing project in \nthe Bronx, New York. After her father's death, she turned to reading \nNancy Drew mystery novels, which inspired her love of reading and \nlearning that put her on a path that ultimately led her to the law. \nSotomayor excelled in school, graduated top of her class at Blessed \nSacrament and Cardinal Spellman High School. She won a scholarship to \nPrinceton University where she graduated summa cum laude and Phi Beta \nKappa. She then attended Yale Law School and served as an editor for \nthe Yale Law Journal.\n  Sonia Sotomayor's competence cannot be questioned. She is a champion \nof the law with a distinguished legal career spanning three decades. \nShe has served at almost every level of the judicial system and she is \nthe first Supreme Court nominee in 50 years to have served as a trial \njudge. She began her legal career as a fearless and effective \nprosecutor, working in the Manhattan District Attorney's Office for 5 \nyears where she tried dozens of criminal cases from street crimes, to \nchild abuse, police misconduct and homicides. She then became a \ncorporate litigator for over 8 years in private practice. She made \npartner at the law firm where she tried complex corporate cases, \nincluding intellectual property, trademark and copyright infringement, \nreal estate and banking.\n  For nearly two decades, Sonia Sotomayor has been a sharp and fearless \ntrial judge. In 1992, President George H.W. Bush nominated Sotomayor to \nserve as a Federal district judge and she was unanimously confirmed by \nthe Senate. As a Federal district court judge, she heard over 450 cases \nduring 6 years as trial judge and ruled against Major League Baseball \nowners to end the baseball strike. She was then nominated by President \nClinton to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals and confirmed by the \nSenate on a vote of 69-29. She has been a tough, fair and thoughtful \nappellate judge who has written over 400 opinions, of which the Supreme \nCourt reviewed only five cases and reversed only three of those \nopinions. Sonia Sotomayor understands upholding the law means the \nconsistent, fair and common sense application of the law. She has an \nunderstanding of real world consequences of decisions and recognizes \nthat her job as a judge is to interpret the laws passed by Congress and \nnot making laws from the bench. Under her tenure as a judge, she has \ndemonstrated a level head, the ability to handle difficult situations \nwith a calm and thoughtful temperament, and is well respected among her \ncolleagues.\n  Judge Sotomayor's integrity is unquestioned. Throughout her career \nshe has worked to make sure that the courthouse doors are open to all. \nShe was raised by hardworking parents who instilled strong work ethic. \nThroughout her life she has been active in her community and serves as \na role model. She mentors kids from troubled neighborhood, teaches at-\nrisk high school students job and life skills, and helps find summer \njobs for these students. In addition, Sonia Sotomayor holds \nuncompromising views on judicial independence and has demonstrated she \nis an independent thinker dedicated to the rule of law. Sotomayor has \nstated that the Constitution should not be bent under any circumstance \nand from the bench she has shown she is a moderate judge who respects \njudicial precedent. In fact, 95 percent of her decisions have been \nfavored by Republican appointees on the Second Circuit and she is well \nknown for her judicial restraint.\n  In sum, Sonia Sotomayor is an outstanding nominee to the highest \ncourt in the United States and an inspiration to all Americans. She is \nliving proof that the American dream can be achieved. She is the \ndaughter of hardworking immigrants, who overcame obstacles, went to Ivy \nLeague schools on scholarship, and has served for over 17 years as a \nFederal judge. Today I am proud to say when my name is called, I will \nvote aye.\n  Mr. NELSON of Nebraska. Mr. President, I wish today to discuss the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court and share \nthe reasons why I will cast my vote in favor of her confirmation.\n  For me, the single most important consideration in deciding whether \nto provide my consent to a judicial nomination is an assessment of \nwhether the judge will bring an ideology to the bench, seeking to \nadvance a set agenda regardless of the facts a case presents and the \nlaws and precedents at hand. I believe--as most Nebraskans and \nAmericans believe--that a political agenda belongs in the political \nbranches, and thus activists and would-be policymakers should seek \nlegislative or executive office if they want to make laws and set \npolicy.\n  Judges, on the other hand, must show respect for the laws and \nConstitution of The United States and deference to settled law and \nprecedent. The role of a judge is to adjudicate impartially; and the \nimpartial application of justice should be devoid of personal views and \npolitical agendas.\n  Judge Sonia Sotomayor's education and legal career show that she is a \nbrilliant woman with a breadth and depth of legal experience. She has \nbeen a prosecutor, an attorney in private practice, a trial court \njudge, and an appellate judge. I am particularly impressed by her \nrecord on the bench, where she has earned a reputation as tough on \ncrime, fair on the facts and the law, respectful of precedent, and \nmindful of the limited role of the judiciary.\n  Judge Sotomayor has pledged fidelity to the law, and her extensive \nrecord of upholding the law as a trial and appellate judge is a \nconcrete example of how she has carried out this pledge. Her 17-year \nrecord provides evidence of a restrained and mainstream judicial \nphilosophy and shows that she has not been an activist. An objective \nreview of Judge Sotomayor's record shows a fair, impartial, and humble \njudge.\n  For example, in addition to achieving a unanimous rating of ``well \nqualified'' from the American Bar Association's Standing Committee on \nthe Federal Judiciary, the highest rating possible, Judge Sotomayor has \nwon praise for\n\n[[Page S8930]]\n\nher judicial restraint. Of particular importance to me was this \nstatement by the ABA Committee: ``Judge Sotomayor's opinions show an \nadherence to precedent and an absence of attempts to set policy based \non the judge's personal views. Her opinions are narrow in scope, \naddress only the issues presented, do not revisit settled areas of law, \nand are devoid of broad or sweeping pronouncements.''\n  In addition, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service analyzed \nher record as a judge and concluded: ``Perhaps the most consistent \ncharacteristic of Judge Sotomayor's approach as an appellate judge has \nbeen an adherence to the doctrine of stare decisis (i.e., the upholding \nof past judicial precedents). Other characteristics appear to include \nwhat many would describe as a careful application of particular facts \nat issue in a case and a dislike for situations in which the court \nmight be seen as overstepping its judicial role.'' This is high praise \nindeed, for those of us like me who value a limited role and eschew \njudicial activism.\n  Having discussed some of the reasons why I believe Judge Sotomayor is \nfit to serve on the High Court, I would like to take a moment to \nrespectfully address some of the concerns and criticisms that some of \nmy constituents and a certain few of my colleagues have raised about \nJudge Sotomayor.\n  Foremost, I believe that actions speak louder than words. Throughout \nthis confirmation process, certain comments Judge Sotomayor has made \noutside of the courtroom have been the subject of much criticism. \nIndeed, some of these remarks could be cause for concern if they proved \nto slant the judge's approach to the law or impede her ability to \nrender an unbiased opinion. But after examining her record, meeting \npersonally with her, and observing the Judiciary Committee hearings, I \nam convinced that Judge Sotomayor will approach the Supreme Court with \nthe same unbiased fidelity to the law that has marked her distinguished \ncareer thus far. Simply put, I see no significant evidence that she has \nmanipulated the facts of cases or interpretations of the law in the \ncourtroom to alter the outcome of a case.\n  In addition, some have singled out a handful of decisions the judge \nhas participated in as grounds for disqualification. Mr. President, I \ndo not expect a judge to agree with me all of the time, just as I do \nnot agree with all the laws or all the precedents on the books; \nhowever, I firmly believe that disagreeing with a law or a precedent is \nnot grounds for a judge to rewrite the law as he or she sees fit. And \nwhile I may not personally agree with the outcome of every single case \nJudge Sotomayor has decided, it is clear to me that her opinions were \ninformed by facts, bound by precedents, and faithful to the law.\n  Judge Sotomayor has decided more than 3,000 cases as a member of the \nSecond Circuit Court of Appeals. Only 13 of these have been reviewed by \nthe Supreme Court; only 5 have been reversed. Of the opinions she \nauthored, five were reviewed, her opinion was upheld in two, and she \nwas reversed or vacated in three. This compares favorably with recent \nSupreme Court reversal rates and with recent Supreme Court nominees.\n  My approach to confirmation of judicial nominees has not changed \nduring my time in the Senate. I have voted to confirm the overwhelming \nmajority of nominees to come before us--including both Chief Justice \nRoberts and Justice Alito for the Supreme Court--and my standards for \nwhat I consider a qualified judge have not changed since my days in the \nGovernor's office, when I appointed 81 judges, including the entire \nNebraska Supreme Court and Court of Appeals. I wish I could say the \nsame for the way the Senate considers judicial nominations, which to my \ndisappointment has just become increasingly political and partisan. In \nthe 1990s, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was confirmed with only three \ndissenting votes, Justice Stephen Breyer with only nine dissenting \nvotes. Yet recent nominations show that rising partisanship has \naffected both the tenor of the debate and the outcome of the vote. The \nSenate confirmed Chief Justice Roberts with 22 dissenting votes, and \nJustice Alito was confirmed with 42 dissenting votes.\n  In 2005, the nomination process became so polarized that I joined \nwith 13 of my colleagues to form the Gang of 14 to prevent the shutdown \nof the Senate over partisan positioning with respect to appeals court \nnominees. I commend the Judiciary Committee for presiding over a \ncordial and fair hearing process for Judge Sotomayor, but as in all \nthings, I wish the Senate could return to a more bipartisan approach to \nour constitutional responsibility to provide advice and consent.\n  As a Senator, I have taken very seriously my role to responsibly, \nthoughtfully, and thoroughly review a nominee's qualifications and \nrecord. After examining her record, meeting personally with her, and \nobserving the Judiciary Committee hearings, I am convinced that Judge \nSotomayor's approach on the Supreme Court will demonstrate the same \nfidelity to the law that has marked her distinguished career. In the \nyears ahead, I believe she will make an important contribution on the \nSupreme Court. I wish her well in her new role.\n  I thank the Senate for this opportunity to offer my perspective on \nthis historic nomination.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, I will vote to confirm the nomination of \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court. \nLet me explain why I am supporting her.\n  Judge Sotomayor's impressive life story is an American story of \nworking hard and making the most of every opportunity. She grew up in a \nhousing project in the South Bronx nurtured by a working mother who \ninstilled in her the values of America. She understood that education \nwas the key to unlocking the greatness that is available in our \ncountry. She won a scholarship to Princeton University, where she \ngraduated with highest honors. But she did not stop there. She then \nattended one of America's finest law schools, where she also excelled \nand was a member of the prestigious Law Review.\n  In addition to her extraordinary academic achievements, Judge \nSotomayor's many work experiences in the legal profession make her \nideally suited to be a Supreme Court Justice. She has been a \nprosecutor, an attorney in private practice, a trial judge and an \nappellate court judge. She has been a Federal judge for more than 17 \nyears. When she is confirmed, she will have had more judicial \nexperience than any other Supreme Court Justice in more than 100 years, \nand she will be the only justice on this Supreme Court to have had \nexperience as a trial judge. The knowledge she has gained over those \nmany years will serve her, the Court, and our country well.\n  After reviewing her career on the bench and closely following her \nconfirmation hearings, I have concluded that Judge Sotomayor is sincere \nin her commitment to apply the law, rather than to make the law. Her \nrecord shows that she cannot be fairly labeled ``left'' or ``right.'' \nFor many years, she has looked at the facts and law of the many cases \nthat have come before her and she has called them as she sees them \nwithout regard for anything else. Her record clearly demonstrates that \nshe is a moderate, mainstream judge with great respect for the law, our \nConstitution, our country, and its institutions.\n  In my own meeting with Judge Sotomayor, I found her to be \nintelligent, measured, deliberate, and thoughtful. Judge Sotomayor \nassured me that she holds great respect for settled law. The more than \n3,000 cases she has participated in support that conclusion as well.\n  This extensive record, and all of her experiences in life and law, \nlikely explain the remarkable breadth and scope of people and \norganizations, many from opposite ends of the political and ideological \nspectrum, supporting her nomination. For example, the Chamber of \nCommerce and labor unions support her as well as numerous police \norganizations and defense lawyers. These are not natural allies, but \nthey have seen what I have seen: a person of exceptional intelligence, \nwide-ranging experience, judicious temperament, and a commitment to \neven-handedly and fairly applying the law without fear or favor.\n  This is also demonstrated by her appointments to the bench. It is \ntelling that Judge Sotomayor was first appointed to the Federal bench \nby President George H. W. Bush, who nominated her to the District Court \nfor the\n\n[[Page S8931]]\n\nSouthern District of New York. Judge Sotomayor was then promoted by \nPresident Clinton to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. \nIt is rare indeed to have a judge nominated by Presidents of both \nparties, and this is a testament to Judge Sotomayor's intellect, \nimpartiality, and judicial conduct.\n  A Supreme Court appointment is for life and many Justices serve for \ndecades, but their influence does not stop there. The cases they write \nor participate in have an effect on the law of the land for many \ndecades even after they leave the Court. That is why I take my duty as \na Senator to confirm a President's nomination for the Court so \nseriously, as I have done here.\n  One of the things that makes our country great and an inspiration to \nso many throughout the world is our commitment to ``Equal Justice Under \nLaw,'' which is carved in marble over the entrance to the Supreme \nCourt. Equal justice means that, under our law, who you are does not \nmatter; who you know or are connected to does not matter; how much \nmoney you have or do not have does not matter; the color of your skin, \nyour ethnicity, your gender or any other personal characteristic does \nnot matter. The facts of a case and the applicable law are all that \nmatter in our justice system. That is what the phrase ``Equal Justice \nUnder Law'' means in our country and to our country.\n  I am confident that ``Equal Justice Under Law'' will inform and \nanimate Judge Sotomayor's decisions throughout her years on the Supreme \nCourt. If one looks with an open and fair mind at the full breadth of \nJudge Sotomayor's inspiring life, extraordinary career and superb \nqualifications, as I have, it is clear that she has earned a place on \nthe Supreme Court and I am proud to be supporting her nomination. I \nhave no doubt that our country will be well served by her.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, more than half a century ago, a young \ncouple from Puerto Rico settled down in the Bronx with dreams of a \nbetter life.\n  They didn't have much money, but they had a vision for the future.\n  A vision that their son and daughter might be able to get a good \neducation, find a rewarding job, and live out the full promise of the \nAmerican dream.\n  Today, their son Juan is a doctor and university professor near \nSyracuse, NY.\n  And their daughter Sonia is about to become the first Latina Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  This family's story could only take place in America.\n  It is a testament to the greatness of our democracy that the daughter \nof a relatively poor family can grow up to attend the finest \nuniversities in the world, and even rise to the highest judicial body \nin the land.\n  But it is not only her remarkably American story that will make Judge \nSonia Sotomayor an excellent addition to the Court.\n  Her legal background marks her as the single most qualified Supreme \nCourt nominee in the last 60 years.\n  After graduating from Princeton University and Yale Law School, she \nserved as an assistant district attorney and then had a successful \nlegal practice of her own.\n  In 1991, President George H.W. Bush appointed Ms. Sotomayor as the \nfirst Hispanic judge on the U.S. District Court in New York State.\n  Eight years later, President Clinton elevated her to the U.S. Court \nof Appeals, where she serves today.\n  Throughout her distinguished career, Judge Sotomayor has been a \nprudent and thoughtful jurist.\n  She has consistently exhibited the highest standards of fairness, \nequality, and integrity.\n  She is a brilliant legal mind and a moderate on the bench.\n  No one can argue with her professional qualifications for this post.\n  And I believe that her personal background will lend a fresh and \ndynamic perspective to the highest court in our land.\n  That is why I was proud to write to President Obama on May 15, urging \nher nomination.\n  I am pleased that he shares my high regard for Judge Sotomayor, and I \nthank him for giving us an eminently qualified nominee to confirm.\n  When we consider the makeup of the Supreme Court, we seek to build \ndebate, not consensus.\n  Judge Sotomayor's uniquely American story will bring diversity to the \nCourt's rulings.\n  And it is this diversity--of background, of perspective, of opinion--\nthat will lend legitimacy and integrity to each decision.\n  As a former attorney general of Illinois, I have a deep understanding \nof these issues.\n  Every legal opinion should be bound by law and the weight of \nprecedent.\n  The law must be grounded in sound and objective reasoning, and it is \na powerful force in people's everyday lives.\n  That is why we need jurists like Sonia Sotomayor on the U.S. Supreme \nCourt.\n  Because, when five voices come together to render a court decision, \nit becomes the law of the land.\n  There is no army, no threat of violence to back it up--just the quiet \nforce of a written opinion.\n  That is the wonderful thing about this democracy.\n  And as a Supreme Court Justice, Sonia Sotomayor will never forget \nthat.\n  She will be a strong addition to the highest court in our land, and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in giving her our utmost support.\n  Let us come together to make history by confirming the first Latina \nSupreme Court Justice in American history.\n  Let us renew our commitment to fairness, equality and diversity by \nconfirming the most qualified nominee this Senate has seen in more than \nhalf a century.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today with great pride to express \nmy support for the confirmation of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be \nAssociate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. Today, the Senate is on \nthe verge of a historic decision in confirming Judge Sotomayor. She \nbrings a wealth of experience to this lifetime appointment, with 17 \nyears of service on the judicial bench--more than any member of the \ncurrent court. She has served as a prosecutor, a trial judge, an \nappellate judge and has also worked as an attorney in the private \nsector.\n  In fact, with the retirement of Justice David Souter and the \nconfirmation of Judge Sotomayor, she will become the only justice on \nthe current Supreme Court with experience as a trial judge. This \nexperience gives her a perspective that will be a much-needed addition \nto the Court.\n  If we confirm her today--and I am confident we will--Judge Sotomayor \nwill become the nation's first Hispanic in history to sit on the \nhighest court in the land, and only the third female Justice. Women, \nLatinos and Latinas--indeed all Americans--can join in celebrating \nthese significant milestones. Judge Sotomayor embodies the progress our \ncountry has achieved, and yet I know she would agree with me that there \nis much more to be done.\n  According to the American Bar Association, women comprise 47 percent \nof all law students, as compared to 1947, when women made up 3 percent \nof law students. That is significant progress. I firmly believe that \nfor Hispanics, Judge Sotomayor's appointment will mark the beginning of \na new era of steady progress. According to the U.S. Department of \nLabor, today only about 4 percent of lawyers and 3 percent of judges \nare of Hispanic descent.\n  Judge Sotomayor will serve as an able Associate Justice. She will \nalso serve as a tremendous role model for law students and other young \npeople thinking about entering the legal profession and for those who \naspire to become judges. Her confirmation and service on the U.S. \nSupreme Court will serve to accelerate progress into the future.\n  Like election of the president who appointed her, Judge Sotomayor's \nconfirmation says to young people of all incomes and backgrounds: You \ncan be anything you want to be.\n  All of us have been moved by Judge Sotomayor's personal story--of her \nupbringing in the Bronx by a working mother, and her rise from those \nhumble beginnings to graduate in one of Princeton University's first \nclasses to include women. From there she went on to Yale Law School, \nwhere she excelled, and then to a coveted post--one of the few held by \nwomen--in the Office of the Manhattan District Attorney.\n\n[[Page S8932]]\n\n  With her record of solid experience, clearly Judge Sotomayor is ready \nto serve on the U.S. Supreme Court. In rating Judge Sotomayor, the \nAmerican Bar Association conducted confidential interviews with a large \nnumber of judges and litigants who have worked with her or argued cases \nin her court. The ABA unanimously found Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be \n``well qualified,'' the highest rating the association can give a \njudicial nominee.\n  Judge Sotomayor has received support from Democrats and Republicans, \nlaw enforcement groups and civil rights organizations. Among these \ngroups are the Association of Prosecuting Attorneys, International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, National Fraternal Order of Police, \nMajor Cities Chiefs Association, Women's Legal Defense and Education \nFund, and the NAACP.\n  I agree with the Hispanic National Bar Association, which said that \nJudge Sotomayor ``embodies all the qualities required for service as a \nJustice and are confident that, when confirmed, she will render fair \nand impartial justice for all Americans.''\n  The National Association of Women Lawyers has noted that Judge \nSotomayor's record, ``establishes her lack of gender, racial, ethnic or \nreligious bias and her willingness to maintain and open mind, deciding \ncases on the record before her.''\n  Throughout her 17 years on the bench, Judge Sotomayor has shown a \nrespect for established precedent and deference to the role of the \nelected branches of government. She made this point clear in the \nmeeting I had with her shortly after President Obama nominated her for \nthe post. The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, CRS, stated \nthat ``perhaps the most consistent characteristic of Judge Sotomayor's \napproach as an appellate judge has been an adherence to'' existing \njudicial precedent.\n  In her meeting with me and in testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee, Judge Sotomayor repeatedly acknowledged the right to privacy \nis enshrined in our Constitution. I believe she will preserve that \nright.\n  President Obama made a wise choice in selecting Judge Sotomayor to \nserve on our highest court. She has demonstrated her integrity and \nintellect throughout the thorough confirmation process. Having followed \nher confirmation hearings closely, I am confident that Judge Sotomayor \nnot only has a deep understanding of the law and great respect for \nprecedent. I am confident she will make a fine associate justice.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Massachusetts is recognized.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I rise to express my support for the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to be an Associate Justice of the \nU.S. Supreme Court.\n  Her career on the Federal bench, from the Southern District Court in \nNew York to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and her personal \njourney, from a childhood in a housing project in the Bronx, to honors \nat Princeton University and Yale Law School, are now well known to \neverybody in the country.\n  But one of the things that received a small amount of attention in \nher confirmation hearing are the 5 years--right out of law school--she \nspent as a prosecutor in the office of legendary Manhattan district \nattorney Robert Morgenthau. It is a reflection of Sonia Sotomayor's \ngrit, determination, and courage that she took on this challenge at \nthat particular time to serve as an assistant district attorney during \none of the most crime-laden periods of New York's history.\n  It is not often we get a chance to elevate to the Nation's highest \nCourt someone who has followed police into shooting galleries, someone \nwho has tracked down witnesses on streets awash in drug-related \nviolence, and someone who has personally taken on witnesses and \nshredded some of them on cross-examination, and who has personally \nmoved juries to tears in her closing arguments.\n  It is not often we get a chance to confirm a Supreme Court nominee \nwho does not come from what Chairman Pat Leahy likes to call the \n``judicial monastery.'' But rather we have a chance to confirm someone \nwho has the personal experience, perspective, and understanding of how \nthe world works within our system of law as a practitioner and also \nhaving seen what it is like for those who try to enforce the law at the \nstreet level, our police, our law enforcement officials, and also in \nseeing what happens to victims and families drawn into the system \nunwillingly.\n  Judge Sotomayor certainly was not in a ``judicial monastery'' when \nshe was undertaking the task of putting criminals behind bars in New \nYork. I believe experience will prove of enormous value to somebody on \nthe Supreme Court--someone who can go there understanding what it means \nto work 12-hour days as a prosecutor struggling to put together a case \nwith reluctant witnesses, with police who have a difficult time coming \nto the courthouse, and, obviously, with experience in interpreting the \nfifth amendment, fourth amendment rights with respect to search and \nseizure and personal incrimination.\n  One of her cases, in particular, stands out, which is the 1983 so-\ncalled Tarzan Murderer case, involving a man who broke into apartments, \nsometimes by swinging from rooftops, robbing the residents, and then \nshooting them for no apparent reason. It was Judge Sotomayor's first \nhomicide case and also her first homicide conviction. The defendant, \nRichard Maddicks, went to prison for 62\\1/2\\ years.\n  Judge Sotomayor said the case affected her as no other; that it \nunderscored for her how crime destroys families and how prosecutors \n``must be sensitive to the price that crime imposes on our society.'' I \nbelieve, having been a prosecutor, those are lessons I learned also \nfirsthand and did not come automatically to the bar with a sensitivity \nto.\n  As much as I admire her work as a New York prosecutor, that \nexperience alone, obviously, does not qualify her for confirmation to \nthe Supreme Court. But I think it is an important experience, and it \nsays a lot about her approach to the law and what she is willing to \nfight for.\n  There are, obviously, few things we do that are as important as \nconfirming a Supreme Court Justice, and especially now with the Court \nso evenly divided. So this is a pivotal moment for the Court. The \ndirection our country will take for the next 30 years is being \ndetermined now by this debate.\n  A vote for a Supreme Court nominee is a vote for each of our personal \nunderstandings of the Constitution, of the laws of the land, and of \nwhat we think is important with respect to the application of the \nrights and freedoms that define this country of ours. That is what this \nvote is. It is a vote to protect the basic rights and freedoms that are \nimportant to every American, and I would say, particularly, privacy, \nequality, and justice.\n  Consider, for example, the case of Lilly Ledbetter and Diana Levine \nas an example of how just one Supreme Court appointment can affect the \nlives and freedoms of countless Americans. In the Ledbetter case, five \nof the Court's nine Justices granted immunity to employers who \ndiscriminate against workers in matters of salary. It took a new \nCongress and a new President to strike down the Court's ruling in the \ncontinuing effort to ensure that all Americans--women and men--receive \nequal pay for equal work.\n  I have voted for Supreme Court nominees in the past, when it was \nclear to me they would protect those constitutional rights and \nfreedoms. And I have voted against Supreme Court nominees, when it was \nclear to me they would not protect those rights and freedoms.\n  So we have to ask ourselves: What direction will this nominee take \nthe Supreme Court? Will this nominee protect the civil rights and \nliberties enshrined in the Constitution and protected by law that we \nhave fought for so long and hard? Will this nominee support Congress's \npower to enact critical legislation--sometimes defining those rights? \nWill the nominee be an effective check on the executive branch?\n  As a Senator, each of us has a right--not just a right, but an \nobligation, a duty--to protect the fundamental rights that are part of \nour Constitution. I think part of that means we have to preserve the \nincredible progress we have made with respect to civil rights and \nrealizing those rights.\n  Having reviewed Judge Sotomayor's extensive record, and having read \nsome\n\n[[Page S8933]]\n\nof her more important rulings, I have concluded that she will do \nexactly that, she will protect them. She is someone who understands \nwhat sets America apart from almost every other country is the right of \nany citizen--no matter what level they are at, in terms of their work, \nemployment or pay, income, status--that no matter where they come from, \nno matter what is their lot in life, they have a right to have their \nday in court. Recently, in this country, over the last 15 or 20 years, \nwe have seen those rights reduced, in some cases. We have seen the \naccess of average citizens to the courts of America diminished.\n  I believe Judge Sotomayor understands the real world, and how \nimportant it is to preserve that relationship of an individual citizen \nto access to the courts.\n\n  It took a Supreme Court that understood the real world to see that \nthe doctrine of ``separate but equal'' was anything but equal and, \ntherefore, to break the Constitution out of the legal straightjacket it \nfound itself in. I believe Judge Sotomayor meets the standard that was \nset by Justice Potter Stewart, who said:\n\n       The mark of a good judge is a judge whose opinions you can \n     read . . . and have no idea if the judge is a man or a woman, \n     Republican or Democrat, Christian or Jew . . . You just know \n     that he or she was a good judge.\n\n  For the last 17 years, she has applied the law to the facts in the \ncases she has considered, while always cognizant of the impact of her \ndecisions before the court. I think she showed restraint, but she also \nshowed fairness and impartiality in performing her duties under the \nConstitution.\n  I believe, though, it is clear her years as a prosecutor prepared her \nfor the Federal bench in ways that few jurists get to experience. After \nthat she spent nearly 6 years as a district court judge and almost 12 \nyears on the appellate court demonstrating a very sophisticated grasp \nof legal doctrine and earning a reputation as a sharp and fearless \njurist.\n  Courage is one of the qualities that Judge Sotomayor's colleagues and \nfriends often attribute to her. One of those colleagues who ought to \nknow these things was her one-time boss and, I might add, somebody \nwhom, when I was a prosecutor, we modeled much of what we did in \nMassachusetts on his approach to the New York District Attorney's \nOffice, and that is Robert Morgenthau. He said she was a ``fearless \nprosecutor'' and ``an able champion of the law.'' The police with whom \nshe worked so closely felt the same way. That is why her nomination to \nthe Supreme Court has been endorsed by nearly every major law \nenforcement organization in the country.\n  As a district court judge, she showed just how fearless she could be \nwhen, in 1995, she ended the Major League Baseball strike with an \ninjunction against the league's powerful owners. All of her actions on \nthe district court were important.\n  Of all her actions on the district court, that was one of my \nfavorites. Some experts suggested that she had saved baseball and, in \ndoing so, she had, as Claude Lewis of the Philadelphia Inquirer wrote, \n``joined the ranks of Joe DiMaggio, Willie Mays, Jackie Robinson and \nTed Williams.'' I am not sure I would go as far as Ted Williams, but \nJudge Sotomayor's actions did get the Red Sox back on the field at \nFenway Park.\n  It is interesting to me that Judge Sotomayor would bring more Federal \njudicial experience to the Supreme Court than any Justice in the last \n100 years. That is a fact her critics conveniently ignore.\n  In fact, she would bring more Federal judicial experience to the high \ncourt--more that 17 years all totaled--than any of the current \nassociate justices.\n  Chief Justice Roberts came to the court with just 2 years on the \nFederal bench, Justice Alito 16 years, Justice Scalia 4 years, Justice \nThomas 1 year, Justice Kennedy 13 years, Justice Ginsburg 13 years, \nJustice Souter 1 year, Justice Brennan and Justice Breyer zero years.\n  As we all know, Judge Sotomayor would be the first Latina to serve on \nthe Supreme Court, just as she was the first Latina on the Second \nCircuit Court of Appeals. Much was made of this after her nomination by \nPresident Obama. And rightly so.\n  Judge Sotomayor is a role model of aspiration, of discipline, of \ncommitment, of intellectual prowess and integrity. Her story is an \nAmerican story, a classic American story, an inspiring American story.\n  How could anyone not be moved by the sight of Judge Sotomayor's \nmother, Celina, wiping away tears as the Judge paid loving tribute to \nher during her confirmation hearing? How could anyone not celebrate the \njourney that is the Judge's life story? An improbable journey, an \nextraordinary journey, a uniquely American journey.\n  We should not underestimate the importance of the diversity Judge \nSotomayor will bring to the Supreme Court. People from different \nbackgrounds bring different perspectives to bear on decisions, and that \nproduces better decisions. That is especially important for the Supreme \nCourt, which is, after all, the ultimate champion of the rule of law \nand protector of rights in America.\n  How important is diversity? The Supreme Court recently decided a case \nand found that school officials violated the fourth amendment rights of \na young girl by conducting an intrusive strip search of her \nunderclothes while looking for the equivalent of a pain killer. During \noral arguments in that case, one of the male Justices compared the \nsearch to changing for gym clothes. Several other Justices laughed, but \nJustice Ruth Ginsburg, the lone female on the court, pointed out how \n``humiliating'' such a search is to young girls.\n  I know that the Judge's critics claimed that she would rely on \n``empathy'' rather than the law when deciding cases. But during her \nconfirmation hearing, she made clear her commitment to the rule of law. \n``Judges can't rely on what's in their heart,'' she testified. ``They \ndon't determine the law The job of the judge is to apply the law. And \nit's not the heart that compels conclusions in cases. It's the law.''\n  She, in fact, has never used the word ``empathy'' in any of her \ndecisions in more than 3,000 cases or the nearly 400 opinions she has \nwritten. Nor has she ever used it to describe her judicial philosophy \nin any speech or article. Her decisions have been based on established \nprecedent and a respect for the limited role of a judge.\n  But every judge, even Supreme Court Justices, are shaped by the \nexperiences of their lives.\n  One recent Supreme Court nominee testified before the Senate \nJudiciary Committee that he would bring to the court ``an understanding \nand the ability to stand in the shoes of other people across a broad \nspectrum.'' That was Justice Clarence Thomas.\n  Another acknowledged being influenced by the fact he came from a \nfamily of immigrants. ``When I get a case about discrimination, I have \nto think about people in my own family who suffered discrimination \nbecause of their ethnic background or because of religion or because of \ngender. And I do take that into account,'' he said. That was Justice \nSamuel Alito.\n  Another touted his status as a racial minority in expressing his \ncommitment to a society without discrimination. ``I am a member of a \nracial minority myself, suffered, I expect, some minor discrimination \nin my years,'' he said. That was Justice Antonin Scalia.\n  I don't know why anyone would think gender and ethnicity do not \ninform one's worldview. How could it be otherwise? ``We're all \ncreatures of our upbringing,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor once \nobserved.\n  So, too, is Judge Sotomayor. But that does not mean she will not \njudge fairly. There is nothing in her long career to suggest otherwise. \nAbove all, in fact, Judge Sotomayor will bring to the court a keen \nlegal mind to the court and an extraordinary record of following, \ndefending and upholding the rule of law.\n  It is no wonder that she earned a ``well qualified'' rating from the \nAmerican Bar Association, the highest rating available in the ABA's \nevaluation of Federal judicial nominees' credentials, a process the \norganization of legal professionals has conducted for more than 50 \nyears.\n  Our Nation's highest court will certainly benefit from Judge \nSotomayor's scholarship, her years on the Federal bench and the \nuniquely American aspects of her life.\n  But as I noted earlier, the High Court's Justices will also benefit \nfrom Judge Sotomayor's years as a prosecutor, from having someone among\n\n[[Page S8934]]\n\nthem who has been on the front lines in the fight against chaos and \nviolence of the city, someone who has seen up close the awful toll \ncrime exacts on its victims, someone who has stared down evil and who \nhas sent the most evil to prison for life.\n  Judge Sotomayor's experience on the bench and her experiences in life \nhave given her a keen sense of compassion and an unique understanding \nof everyday Americans--qualities that will serve her well as an \nAssociate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, qualities that will serve \nour country well in the Court's deliberations.\n  It is clear she understands that our Nation is defined by the great \nstruggle of individuals to earn and protect their rights.\n  I believe Judge Sotomayor will protect those rights, which did not \ncome easily--access to the court house and the school house, civil \nrights, privacy rights, voting rights, antidiscrimination laws, all the \nresult of bloodshed and loss of life, all written into law in a fight, \nall requiring constant vigilance to make sure they are enforced and \nmaintained.\n  Do I overstate the importance of vigilance? Hardly. Just a few short \nmonths ago, the Court heard oral arguments in a case challenging the \nconstitutionality of the reenacted Voting Rights Act. The act remained \nintact. But the fact that the Court heard the case is cause for concern \nthat even a slight shift in the makeup of the Court could weaken or \nundo laws that protect the rights and well being of the American \npeople.\n  It was the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. who said that ``the arc of \nthe moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.'' I believe \nJudge Sotomayor's nomination to the Supreme Court--indeed, her entire \ncareer, as a prosecutor, as a district judge, as an appeals court \njudge--is part of that arc bending toward justice.\n  Mr. President, I proudly support her nomination and urge all my \ncolleagues to do the same. A vote to confirm Judge Sotomayor will be a \nhigh mark in the history of the Senate and in the history of this \ncountry.\n  Mr. President, on behalf of Senator Leahy, I ask unanimous consent \nthat a letter and statement of support for the nomination of Judge \nSotomayor to be a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court from the Lawyers' \nCommittee for Civil Rights Under Law be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                            Lawyers' Committee for\n\n\n                                       Civil Rights Under Law,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, July 9, 2009.\n     Chairman Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Ranking Member Jeff Sessions,\n     Senate Judiciary Committee, Dirksen Senate Office Building, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Sessions; As the Co-Chairs of the \n     Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, we submit the \n     attached Statement in Support of the nomination of Judge \n     Sonia Sotomayor as an Associate Justice of the United States \n     Supreme Court. This Statement is presented on behalf of our \n     organization and with the particular support of the \n     identified individual members of the Board of Directors and \n     Trustees, who have joined to highlight their commitment to \n     the Lawyers' Committee's position.\n       We also enclose an 81 page Report analyzing Judge \n     Sotomayor's record pertaining to constitutional \n     interpretation and civil rights, issues which are of \n     paramount importance to the Lawyers' Committee.\n       We believe that the members of the Lawyers' Committee who \n     have joined us in support of Judge Sotomayor have done so \n     because the record demonstrates that Judge Sotomayor is well \n     qualified to serve as an Associate Justice, with a record of \n     judicial service characterized by both its longevity and its \n     quality. Judge Sotomayor's record in the area of civil rights \n     reveals a balanced and considered approach to following \n     precedent and safeguarding the protections contained in our \n     nation's Constitution and civil rights statutes. We also \n     believe Judge Sotomayor brings needed diversity to the Court \n     based on her gender, ethnicity and experience as a prosecutor \n     and trial judge.\n       We urge the members of the Senate Judiciary Committee to \n     recommend Judge Sonia M. Sotomayor for confirmation by the \n     full Senate.\n           Sincerely,\n     Nicholas T. Christakos,\n       Co-Chair.\n     John S. Kiernan,\n       Co-Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n  Statement Supporting the Nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor as an \n          Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court\n\n       The Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, and the \n     undersigned members of its Board of Directors and Trustees, \n     write to support the nomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to \n     the Supreme Court of the United States and to urge the Senate \n     to confirm that nomination.\n       On May 26, 2009, President Barack Obama nominated Judge \n     Sotomayor, who currently serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals \n     for the Second Circuit, to replace retiring Justice David \n     Souter. The last vacancy on the Court occurred in 2005, when \n     Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman to serve on the Supreme \n     Court, retired. If confirmed, Judge Sotomayor would be the \n     first Hispanic and the third female justice in the 219 year \n     history of the Supreme Court.\n       Judge Sotomayor has impressive academic and professional \n     credentials. She has had a wide-ranging legal career as a \n     prosecutor, a corporate litigator, and both a district and \n     appellate court judge. These combined experiences would add a \n     perspective not currently available on the Supreme Court. In \n     addition, having sat for six years on the district court and \n     more than ten years on the court of appeals, Judge Sotomayor \n     has more federal judicial experience at the time of her \n     nomination than any Supreme Court nominee in the last hundred \n     years.\n       This nomination is of special interest to us as directors \n     and trustees of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under \n     Law because of our shared goal of promoting equal justice. In \n     recent years, the Supreme Court has issued a number of \n     decisions scaling back the critical protections against \n     discrimination that are afforded by the Constitution and our \n     nation's civil rights laws. This trend underscores the \n     pressing need for a Justice who understands the persistent \n     realities of discrimination and who interprets our civil \n     rights laws as they were intended--to provide meaningful \n     protections.\n       We believe that the best evidence of Judge Sotomayor's \n     qualifications as a nominee is the judicial opinions she has \n     written over her long career on the bench. Analysis of her \n     opinions in civil rights cases and related areas prepared by \n     the Lawyers' Committee forms the primary basis for our \n     support for Judge Sotomayor's nomination. The Lawyers' \n     Committee also examined her speeches and other writings to \n     see whether they contained anything that should disqualify \n     her from serving on the Supreme Court or that might indicate \n     that she has a different judicial philosophy, particularly in \n     the civil rights arena, from that reflected in her judicial \n     opinions. The results of the Lawyers' Committee's analysis \n     are contained in its Report on Judge Sotomayor's nomination.\n       Based on our review, we conclude that Judge Sotomayor's \n     record in civil rights cases demonstrates careful judicial \n     analysis, with full consideration of the relevant facts and \n     law, accompanied by a sensitivity to civil rights issues that \n     is consonant with constitutional and statutory provisions. We \n     have found nothing in Judge Sotomayor's speeches or non-\n     judicial writings, which appropriately refer to her unique \n     life story and the perspective she has gained from her \n     background, that should disqualify her from serving on the \n     Supreme Court. Our review of her judicial decisions, as well \n     as her speeches and other writings, leads us to conclude that \n     Judge Sotomayor would bring to the Court an appropriate \n     regard for the importance of enforcement of the civil rights \n     protections of the Constitution and federal civil rights \n     laws. We further conclude that her performance as a Court of \n     Appeals judge clearly supports the proposition that she will \n     honor stare decisis and adhere to the rule of law.\n       On the Second Circuit, Judge Sotomayor has heard over 3,000 \n     appeals and has written over 250 signed panel opinions. Her \n     opinions reveal a jurist who follows established precedent \n     yet is willing to raise concerns about the practical impact \n     of that precedent. Her opinions exhibit deference to the \n     discretion of trial judges. Judge Sotomayor's jurisprudence \n     in civil rights cases indicates that she carefully weighs the \n     facts and the law, and her rulings fall within the mainstream \n     of existing judicial decisions and legal scholarship. She \n     interprets civil rights laws in a manner that provides \n     meaningful protection from discrimination, while being \n     mindful of the need to grant early relief to defendants \n     when the facts and law justify a summary ruling.\n       Judge Sotomayor possesses both the exceptional competence \n     necessary to serve on the Court and a profound respect for \n     the importance of protecting the civil rights afforded by the \n     Constitution and the nation's civil rights laws. \n     Additionally, we believe that having a diverse Court is \n     important for our nation. For these reasons, we support the \n     nomination of Judge Sotomayor to the Supreme Court of the \n     United States and urge the Senate to confirm her nomination.\n       By action of the Executive Committee, this statement has \n     been submitted to members of the Board of Directors and the \n     Board of Trustees of the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights \n     Under Law, for the individual signature of subscribing Board \n     members whose names are set forth below.

The Senator from New Jersey is recognized.\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, the Senate will soon vote to confirm \nJudge Sonia Sotomayor. In doing so, we will not only make history, but \nwe will stand witness to a coming of age of America.\n  Our Founders devised a unique experiment in a new form of government \nbuilt on tolerance, equal rights, justice, and a Constitution that \nprotected us from the mighty sword of tyranny. It was a revolutionary \nnotion that in this new Nation, no one--no one--would be bound by an \naccident of birth. No one would be limited by their economic or social \ncircumstances. In America we have come to believe that all is possible.\n  Today, on the anniversary of the signing of the Voting Rights Act, at \nthe other end of Pennsylvania Avenue is an African American sitting in \nthe Oval Office. This is America.\n  Across the street in that magnificent symbol of equal justice under \nlaw, a woman--a Latina--will take a seat on the U.S. Supreme Court. \nThis is America.\n  In this Chamber, this Senator respectfully stands before you born in \nthe same year as Judge Sotomayor and in similar circumstances--raised \nin a tenement in an old neighborhood in New Jersey, the son of \nimmigrants, the first in my family to go to college. I never dreamed I \nwould stand on this floor on this day to rise in support of an \neminently qualified Hispanic woman who grew up in a housing project in \nthe Bronx, as I was growing up in that old tenement in Union City. Yes, \nthis is America. It is the America our Founders intended it to be.\n  I said on this floor earlier in this debate that when Judge Sotomayor \ntakes her seat on the U.S. Supreme Court, we will only need to look at \nthe portrait of the Justices of the new Supreme Court to see how far we \nhave come as a nation, to understand who we are as a people. It is true \nthat we are often divided by deeply held individual beliefs that too \noften prevent us from reaching compromise on the complex issues and \nchallenges facing this Nation. But in America, we are entitled to our \nindividual beliefs. We are entitled to hold them firmly, passionately, \nwith resolve, reason, and fairness. We are free to fight for them with \nevery fiber of our being; to express them, to shout them from the \nrooftops if we like. Put simply, all of us see the world differently. \nAll we can ask of ourselves, all any of us can ask, is that wisdom, \nintelligence, reason, and logic will always prevail in every decision \nwe make.\n  I have said before on this floor, and I will say again: Who we are is \nnot a measure of how we judge, it is merely one part of the many-\nfaceted prism through which we see and analyze the facts. The real test \nis how we think and what we do. I know in my heart and in my mind that \nJudge Sotomayor will do what is right for America.\n  The worst her opponents have accused her of is an accident of \ngeography that gave her the unique ability to see the world from the \nstreet view, from the cheap seats. I know that view well. I know it \nvery well. It gives us a unique perspective on life. It allows us to \nfocus a clear lens on the lives of those whose struggles are more \nprofound than ours and whose problems run far deeper than our own. The \nview of the world from a tenement remains with me today, and it will \nremain with me all of my life, just as the view from that housing \nproject in the Bronx will remain with Judge Sotomayor. It is a part of \nwho she is. But let's be clear. It is not what she will do or how she \nwill judge. It is the long view of America--a wide, inclusive view--\noften profoundly moving, sometimes heartbreaking, and it gives her an \nedge where she may see what others cannot, and I truly believe that is \na gift that will benefit the Nation as a whole.\n  So I call on my colleagues to step back, take the long view, think of \nwhat our Founders hoped for this Nation, and let's vote. History awaits \nand so does an anxious Hispanic community in this country.\n  I have made my decision, and I will proudly stand in the well of this \nChamber to cast my vote to confirm Judge Sotomayor as the next Justice \nof the U.S. Supreme Court. When she places her hand on the Bible and \ntakes the oath of office, the new portrait of the Justices of the \nSupreme Court will clearly reflect who we are as a nation, what we \nstand for as a fair, just, and hopeful people.\n  Let that be the legacy of our generation, for this is America--the \nAmerica our Founders intended it to be.\n  Mr. President, the Judiciary Committee has received letters of \nsupport for Judge Sotomayor's nomination from local, national, and \ninternational law enforcement, including the chiefs of police of major \ncities, among others. I ask unanimous consent that those letters, as \nwell as letters from national Latino and Hispanic rights organizations, \nsuch as MANA, ASPIRA, and others be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                               Metropolitan Police Department,\n\n                                      Nashville, TN, July 7, 2009.\n     Senator Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: After careful consideration of Judge \n     Sonia Sotomayor's established record of respect and \n     understanding for the work of law enforcement, I am today \n     writing to express my strong support of her nomination as the \n     next Associate Justice of the United States Supreme Court.\n       In my nearly 30 years experience as a police officer and \n     police executive in three states, Louisiana, Washington, and \n     Tennessee, it is clear to me that our citizens are ultimately \n     best served and protected by members of the judiciary who are \n     committed to respect for the rule of law. I am encouraged \n     that Judge Sotomayor, through her work as a prosecutor in New \n     York, and later as a trial judge, learned first hand how \n     crime impacts a community and how members of law enforcement \n     are in the trenches every day working to make a difference \n     for safer neighborhoods. I believe that she understands the \n     challenges police agencies face in dealing with criminals, \n     and, if confirmed, will ensure that law enforcement is \n     treated with respect and fairness in matters coming before \n     the Supreme Court.\n       Senator Leahy, I understand that you will explore and \n     consider a number of issues and factors before making your \n     confirmation decision. I have every confidence that Judge \n     Sotomayor's clear familiarity with how the courts impact law \n     enforcement and the criminal justice system will be given \n     full consideration. Thank you for your kind attention to this \n     letter, and thank you for your support of the men and women \n     in Tennessee, Vermont and our great nation's 48 other states \n     who wear the badge of protection and service.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Ronal W. Serpas,\n                                                  Chief of Police.\n\n[[Page S8936]]\n\n     \n                                  ____\n                              Major Cities Chiefs Association,\n\n                                                     June 7, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Messrs. Leahy and Sessions: On behalf of the Major \n     Cities Chiefs, representing the 56 largest jurisdictions \n     across the Nation, we are writing to support the nomination \n     of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court of the United \n     States.\n       We applaud her distinguished career in public service, a \n     record of achievement that began with her work as a \n     prosecuting attorney. During those early years as an \n     Assistant District Attorney, Sonia Sotomayor earned high \n     marks from law enforcement. She has been praised by those who \n     worked at her side on criminal cases as well as officials who \n     have taken cases to her courtroom in later years.\n       Her record as a prosecutor and a judge both show a \n     commitment to public safety and sensitivity to the needs of \n     the community. She has made decisions that are both tough and \n     compassionate. Her record shows respect for the laws and \n     cases that enable the police to do their job.\n       American law enforcement has always looked to you for \n     leadership and we again turn to you to move the nomination of \n     Sonia Sotomayor quickly through the confirmation process.\n       Sincerely,\n\n                                           William J. Bratton,\n\n                                                  Chief of Police,\n     President, Major Cities Chiefs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         International Association\n\n\n                                          of Chiefs of Police,\n\n                                    Alexandria, VA, July 10, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chair, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: On behalf of the International \n     Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP), I am pleased to \n     inform you of our support for the nomination of Judge Sonia \n     Sotomayor to be the next Associate Justice on the United \n     States Supreme Court.\n       As you know, the IACP is the world's oldest and largest \n     association of law enforcement executives. With more than \n     20,000 members in over 100 countries the IACP has, throughout \n     its 116 year history, been committed to advancing the law \n     enforcement profession and promoting public safety.\n       It is for these reasons that the IACP is proud to endorse \n     the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to the United States \n     Supreme Court. Throughout her career, Judge Sotomayor has \n     consistently demonstrated a firm understanding of, and a deep \n     appreciation for, the challenges and complexities confronting \n     our Nation's law enforcement officers. As a prosecutor, and \n     at the District and Circuit Courts, Judge Sotomayor has \n     clearly displayed her profound dedication to ensuring that \n     our communities are safe and that the interests of justice \n     are served.\n       The IACP believes that Judge Sotomayor's years of \n     experience, her expertise and her unwavering dedication to \n     the rule of law are evidence of her outstanding \n     qualifications to serve as the next Associate Justice of the \n     United States Supreme Court. The IACP urges the Judiciary \n     Committee and the members of the United States Senate to \n     confirm Judge Sotomayor's nomination in a timely fashion.\n       Thank you for your attention to this matter. Please let me \n     know how the IACP may be of further assistance in this \n     vitally important process.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Russell B. Laine,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                                         MANA,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 9, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate Office \n         Building, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Judiciary Committee, Russell Senate \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senators Leahy and Sessions: MANA, A National Latina \n     Organization, with headquarters in Washington, DC, twenty-six \n     chapters nationwide, and six affiliates across the nation \n     expresses wholehearted support for the appointment of the \n     Honorable Sonia Sotomayor to serve as a Supreme Court \n     Justice.\n       Growing up in the Bronx after her parents moved from Puerto \n     Rico, Sotomayor's mother instilled the value of education \n     early in her life. After graduating valedictorian at her \n     Catholic high school, Sotomayor went on to Princeton, where \n     she continued to excel. She attended Yale Law School and \n     wrote for the Yale Law Journal.\n       Judge Sotomayor has had an exceptional and diverse career \n     that will be an invaluable asset in a role as a Supreme Court \n     Justice. She began her career as an assistant district \n     attorney in the state of New York. Later, she worked in \n     private practice as a corporate litigator, dealing with cases \n     for both American and foreign clients. In 1992 she served as \n     a federal judge for the U.S. District Court, having been \n     nominated by President George H.W. Bush. In this position she \n     was the youngest judge in the Southern District of New York \n     and the first Hispanic federal judge in New York. During that \n     time she supported claims to freedom of religious expression \n     under the First Amendment. She continued in that position \n     until her appointment as appellate judge by President William \n     Jefferson Clinton in 1998.\n       The Honorable Sonia Sotomayor's perseverance, work ethic, \n     integrity, and tested and proven ability to excel demonstrate \n     her strength of character. Her commitment to nonpartisan, \n     fair decision making, and upholding the law without bias \n     makes Judge Sotomayor a clear choice for Supreme Court \n     Justice. We are confident that Judge Sotomayor will dutifully \n     represent the law as it is written, always serving in the \n     best interests of the nation. A true example of living the \n     American dream, she is an inspiration.\n       Moving forward, we urge that the Senate follow the timeline \n     suggested by the White House, with an expeditious hearing by \n     mid-July. As is our established procedure, we will also be \n     submitting this legislative vote to the National Hispanic \n     Leadership Agenda for consideration on the Annual \n     Congressional Report Card, which tracks and publishes the \n     voting records of Members of Congress on issues relevant to \n     the Hispanic community. In the best interest of our nation, \n     we ask you to confirm the Honorable Sonia Sotomayor based on \n     her credentials, experience, and desire to honorably serve \n     our great nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Alma Morales Riojas,\n     President & CEO.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          MANA de Albuquerque,\n\n                                    Albuquerque, NM, June 2, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     Chairman, Semite Judiciary Committee, U.S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy, On behalf of MANA de Albuquerque, its \n     thirty-five members, and it's affiliation with MANA, A \n     National Latina Organization that represents twenty-six \n     Chapters, six Affiliates, and individual members nationwide, \n     I would like to declare my support for the confirmation of \n     Judge Sonia Sotomayor as Justice of the Supreme Court.\n       The Honorable Sonia Sotomayor has had an exceptional and \n     diverse career that will be an invaluable asset in a role as \n     a Supreme Court Justice. Judge Sotomayor's perseverance, work \n     ethic. veracity, and tested and proven ability to excel \n     demonstrate her strength of character. Her commitment to \n     bipartisan, fair decision making, and upholding the law \n     without bias makes Judge Sotomayor a clear choice for Supreme \n     Court Justice.\n       Judge Sonia Sotomayor's nomination reflects an enormous \n     achievement for the Latina community. She is a woman of \n     astonishing achievement, keen intellect, and integrity. These \n     characteristics will aid her in making just decisions in \n     representing and reflecting the law of the United States of \n     America.\n       As a member of your constituency, the Latino community, and \n     MANA de Albuquerque, I ask you to support Judge Sonia \n     Sotomayor's expeditious confirmation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                              Lydia Lopez Maestas,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                           Women of El Barrio,\n\n                                       El Barrio, NY, May 8, 2009.\n     Re United States Supreme Court nomination of Judge Sonia \n         Sotomayor.\n\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, Russell \n         Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Leahy: Women of El Barrio (WOES) proudly and \n     respectfully urge you to make Judge Sonia Sotomayor your \n     first appointment to the Supreme Court of the United States \n     of America. Our appeal is consistent with WOEB's mission to \n     develop the leadership and promote the contributions of \n     Puerto Rican grandmothers and young women from our community, \n     through efforts that extend from preserving a block, to \n     honoring the gifts of our precious Planet! Sonia Sotomayor, \n     is a star whose light shows working class boys and girls that \n     they can become men and women who achieve in order to serve.\n       As a Latina, Judge Sotomayor's appointment addresses two \n     glaring deficiencies in the court's lack of diversity and \n     will bring our court system closer to real equality of \n     opportunity.\n       In their appeal New York Senators Schumer and Gillibrand \n     recognize that ``Latinos are a large and growing segment of \n     our society that have gone grossly underrepresented in our \n     legal system. Indeed, while Latinos comprise around 15 \n     percent of the population, only about 7 percent of federal \n     judges are Latino. Moreover, not a single Latino has served \n     on the United States Supreme Court in the history of our \n     country.''\n       While more than half the U.S. population is female, nearly \n     one-third of all U.S. lawyers are women. Approximately 30 \n     percent of the judges serving on the lower federal courts are \n     women. It is truly shameful that the retirement of Justice \n     Sandra Day O'Conner should have resulted in the reduction of \n     the paltry number of women from\n\n[[Page S8937]]\n\n     two to one. Most recently the lone remaining female, Justice \n     Ruth Bader Ginsburg, has battled serious health problems.\n       In Judge Sotomayor you have a nominee of unquestioned legal \n     prowess and excellent academic credentials. She's a Princeton \n     University graduate, summa cum laude; a Juris Doctor from \n     Yale Law School, including Editor of the Yale Law Journal. As \n     a practicing attorney, she was a litigator in an \n     international law firm and served as Manhattan Assistant \n     District Attorney under Robert Morgenthauy 17 years on the \n     federal bench as trial judge in the Southern District of New \n     York and her current position on the 2nd Circuit.\n       In its October 2008 issue of Esquire magazine found that \n     ``In her rulings, Sotomayor has often shown suspicion of \n     bloated government and corporate power. She's offered a \n     reinterpretation of copyright law, ruled in favor of public \n     access to private information, and in her most famous \n     decision, sided with labor in the Major League Baseball \n     strike of 1995. More than anything else, she is seen as a \n     realist. With a likely 20 years ahead on the bench, she'll \n     have plenty of time to impart her realist philosophy.''\n       Just as importantly, we, the people want a Supreme Court of \n     men and women who uphold the Constitution of the United \n     States and the laws flowing from it; a court that is balanced \n     when it is called upon to scrutinize preemptive war, torture, \n     black prisons, warrantless surveillance, erosion of the \n     common wealth, and deemed the true arbiter of social, \n     economic and electoral justice for all.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Sandra Talavera,\n     Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 The ASPRIA Association, Inc.,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2009.\n     Re vote to confirm Judge Sonia Sotomayer to the U.S. Supreme \n         Court.\n\n     Hon. Patrick Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy: ASPIRA, the largest national Latino \n     organizations in the United States and the only national \n     organization dedicated exclusively to the education of Latino \n     youth, urges you, as a member of the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee, to vote to confirm Judge Sonia Sotomayor after a \n     thorough but swift confirmation process.\n       Judge Sotomayor's outstanding academic credentials, keen \n     intellect, extensive judicial experience, and long history of \n     fairness and adherence to the law, make her an exemplary \n     candidate to serve on the Supreme Court. Raised by a single \n     mother in public housing in the Bronx, Judge Sotomayor went \n     on to graduate with honors from Princeton and Yale Law \n     School, two of the most prestigious universities in the \n     country. In her three-decade career, Judge Sotomayor has \n     served as an Assistant District Attorney, a litigator in \n     private practice, and served as U.S. District judge for six \n     years before serving eleven years on the U.S. Court of \n     Appeals for the 2nd District. She was appointed to the \n     District Court by Republican President George H.W. Bush and \n     to the appeals court by President Clinton. She has \n     participated in over three thousand court decisions, and has \n     written over 380 opinions. No other Supreme Court nominee in \n     the last 100 years has had the experience she will bring to \n     the court. Judge Sotomayor's compelling life experiences will \n     allow her to bring a range of experiences and perspectives to \n     the court's deliberations.\n       We sincerely hope that you will join the majority of \n     senators, Republicans and Democrats to confirm this exemplary \n     American to the Supreme Court.\n           Sincerely,\n                                          Ronald Blackburn Moreno,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. MENENDEZ. Mr. President, with that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I am honored to be here today. In a few \nhours, we will have achieved something truly great as a nation. Our \nfirst African American President has nominated the first Hispanic \nJustice to the U.S. Supreme Court. Times are changing.\n  If there are two words that sum up this nomination, it is these: \n``It's time.'' It is time that we confirm a nominee to the Supreme \nCourt who will improve its diversity. It is time that we confirm a \nmoderate nominee to the Supreme Court who will pull it back into the \nmainstream and away from the extreme. It is time we confirm a nominee \nwhose life story, personal history, intelligence, and experience \nrepresent the best America has to offer.\n  Judge Sotomayor's story is a true American story, a true New York \nstory, and a great story. When Sonia Sotomayor was growing up, the \nNancy Drew stories inspired her sense of adventure, developed her sense \nof justice, and showed her that women could and should be outspoken and \nbold. Now, in 2009, there are many more role models for a young student \nfrom her alma mater, Cardinal Spellman, to choose from, with Judge \nSotomayor foremost among them.\n  If one listened to the debate over the last 2 days, one could easily \nthink that my colleagues on the other side of the aisle are not talking \nabout the same person we are. Those who are voting for Judge \nSotomayor's confirmation have focused, as they should, on her history \nand her record. Judge Sotomayor was a prosecutor and a commercial \nlitigator. She was nominated to the district court bench by a \nRepublican President. Her record shows she is a true moderate. She has \nagreed with her Republican colleagues 95 percent of the time. She has \nruled for the government and against the immigrant petitioner in 83 \npercent of immigration cases. She has denied race claims in 83 percent \nof race cases. All of these numbers place her squarely in the middle of \nthe judges on her circuit.\n  But my Republican colleagues have chosen instead to focus on the \nspeeches she has given outside the courtroom. They have zeroed in on a \nfew choice quotes we have heard over and over again about the ``wise \nLatina woman'' quote. Is this the same person who has sat on 3,000 \ncases in 17 years, who ruled against Hispanic and African American \nplaintiffs in a wide variety of cases, and who ruled in favor of a \npolice officer who engaged in blatantly racist speech because the first \namendment protected him? Should three words outweigh 3,000 cases? Only \nif you have something against her in the first place.\n  ``Bias'' and ``activism'' are now code words for ``not hard right.'' \nMy colleagues say they don't want activist judges. What they really \nmean is they don't want judges who disagree with them and who put rule \nof law ahead of moving America in ideological directions.\n  We must and will continue to fight for mainstream judges. We must and \nwill continue to free our unelected branch of government from \nideologues and result-oriented extremism.\n  With the nomination of Judge Sotomayor, we have an opportunity to \nrestore faith in the notion that the Court should reflect the same \nmainstream ideals that are embraced by America.\n  Judge Sotomayor is clearly a moderate. She is highly qualified. She \nis extremely intelligent. She represents the American ideal that at the \nend of the day, race and ethnicity and class aren't supposed to \npredetermine anything; through hard work and a good education, a girl \nfrom a Bronx housing project can rise to the highest Court in the most \ndemocratic country in the world.\n  I am so proud to cast my vote for Judge Sonia Sotomayor. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. NELSON of Florida. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from New \nYork for what are heartfelt words.\n  I was able to spend some time privately with the judge to get to know \nher from a first impression. Usually, in my 37 years of public life, I \nhave been able to size up a person, and it has proven to be a fairly \naccurate measure of a person. My sense from that private meeting is \nthat here we have a judge who will use a lot of common sense in making \njudicial decisions.\n  I think that is important. I think it is also important that a judge \nhave deference in the rule of law to precedent that has already been \nestablished. I believe that to be the case with this judge.\n  Since it is the U.S. Supreme Court, the Supreme Court will also have \nthe final determination on what a law does or does not say. In that \ncase, I think we not only want a judge who is extremely sharp, \nintelligent, well schooled in the law, with a long history in the law, \nwith common sense, but of moderate disposition.\n  I think that is what Judge Sotomayor brings to this position of the \nU.S. Supreme Court. I believe Judge Sotomayor will be a fair, \nimpartial, and an outstanding Supreme Court Justice. I am very proud \nthat I will be able to cast my vote for her in a few minutes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S8938]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I want to begin my remarks by introducing \ninto the Record a letter I wrote with Senator Olympia Snowe in May, \nafter Justice Souter announced he would be retiring from the Supreme \nCourt.\n  I ask unanimous consent that this letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 11, 2009.\n     The President,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: The announced retirement of United \n     States Supreme Court Justice David Souter--an outstanding \n     jurist--has left you with the crucial task of nominating \n     someone for a lifetime appointment to our nation's highest \n     bench.\n       The most important thing is to nominate an exceptionally \n     well-qualified, intelligent person to replace Justice \n     Souter--and we are convinced that person should be a woman.\n       Women make up more than half of our population, but right \n     now hold only one seat out of nine on the United States \n     Supreme Court. This is out of balance. In order for the Court \n     to be relevant, it needs to be diverse and better reflect \n     America.\n       Mr. President, we look forward with great anticipation to \n     your choice for the Supreme Court vacancy.\n           Sincerely,\n     Barbara Boxer,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Olympia Snowe,\n       U.S. Senator.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, at that time, we wrote, in part:\n\n       The most important thing is to nominate an exceptionally \n     well-qualified, intelligent person to replace Justice \n     Souter--and we are convinced that person should be a woman.\n\n  That was the letter that was written by a Democrat and a Republican \nSenator who believe strongly that it does matter, when you only have \none woman on a Court of nine, as we do right now--until we vote--it is \njust not enough.\n  President Obama has nominated an exceptionally well-qualified and \nintelligent woman. She has more experience on the Federal bench than \nany Supreme Court nominee in the last hundred years.\n  Judge Sotomayor received the highest rating from the American Bar \nAssociation, and she will be an outstanding addition to the high Court.\n  When she is confirmed, she will become only the third woman ever to \ndon the robes of a Supreme Court Justice. She will make history as the \nNation's first Hispanic Supreme Court Justice.\n  This is a proud moment for our entire Nation, and especially for the \n13 million Latinos in California and the 45 million Latinos nationwide. \nShe already is a role model for so many young women.\n  As Justice Sandra Day O'Connor said in a recent interview:\n\n       About half of all law graduates today are women, and we \n     have a tremendous number of qualified women in the country \n     who are serving as lawyers. So they ought to be represented \n     on the Court.\n\n  In the weeks since she was nominated, Judge Sonia Sotomayor has \nproven that she has the right judgment and the right temperament to \nserve on the Nation's high Court. This is a proud moment for our \nNation, a very proud moment.\n  She demonstrated, during a week of intense questioning before the \nJudiciary Committee, that she is tough, she is smart and, most \nimportantly, she knows the law.\n  During those hearings, she made clear that she understands the role \nof a judge, which is to apply the law to the facts of each and every \ncase. She said:\n\n       In the past month, many Senators have asked me about my \n     judicial philosophy. It is simple: fidelity to the law. The \n     task of a judge is not to make law. It is to apply the law.\n\n  Her 17-year record as a Federal judge demonstrates a respect for the \nlaw and for precedent.\n  Let me read some comments from Judge Sotomayor's many supporters. \nRobert Morgenthau, District Attorney for the County of New York, said:\n\n       Judge Sotomayor's career in the law spans three decades, \n     and [she] worked in almost every level of our judicial \n     system--prosecutor, private litigator, trial court judge, and \n     appellate court judge. . . . She is an able champion of the \n     law, and her depth of experience will be invaluable on our \n     highest court.\n\n  Kim Askew, chair of the American Bar Association's Standing Committee \non the Federal Judiciary, said:\n\n       [Judge Sotomayor] has a reputation for integrity and \n     outstanding character. . . . Her judicial temperament meets \n     the high standards for appointment to the court.\n\n  I have to say, having watched some of the very tough questioning of \nJudge Sotomayor--if I might say, questions that were asked and \nanswered, asked and answered, and asked and answered--the judge showed \nshe understood that the Senators had a right to be tough, had a right \nto ask her anything they wanted, and she stood her ground beautifully.\n  Second Circuit Chief Judge Dennis Jacobs said:\n\n       Sonia Sotomayor is a well-loved colleague on our court--\n     everybody from every point of view knows that she is fair and \n     decent in all her dealings. . . . The fact is, she is truly a \n     superior human being.\n\n  We all bring different experiences to our work. The judge has had \nexperiences growing up as a young Latina that have shaped her life, and \nshe has a firsthand appreciation of the American dream.\n  She was raised in a South Bronx housing project. Her father, a \nfactory worker, died when she was only 9 years of age. Her mother \nworked two jobs to support the family. From this humble background, she \ngraduated summa cum laude from Princeton and became an editor of the \nYale Law Review.\n  As a woman, Judge Sotomayor will bring a different perspective than \nher male counterparts on the high Court. As we have said, those of us \nwho feel it is important to have women represented, whether it is in \nthe Senate, the House, or in corporate boardrooms or on the Supreme \nCourt, a different perspective is important. I will give you an example \nof why I believe this.\n  During oral arguments in a recent Supreme Court case involving a 13-\nyear-old girl who was strip-searched, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg \npointed out that her male colleagues didn't understand the humiliation \na teenage girl would feel from being strip-searched. Justice Ginsburg \nsaid the obvious:\n\n       They have never been a 13-year-old girl. It's a very \n     sensitive age for a girl. I didn't think that my colleagues, \n     some of them, quite understood.\n\n  So Justice Ginsburg pointed out in that one case how important it is \nto have this type of diversity on the court. As the Nation's first \nLatina Supreme Court Justice, Judge Sotomayor will bring a unique set \nof experiences to her role; and the Court will be a richer place \nbecause of her perspective.\n  I commend our President for selecting such an outstanding, well-\nqualified nominee.\n  I congratulate Judge Sotomayor for the very dignified manner in which \nshe carried herself throughout this long, grueling process.\n  As President Obama said when he nominated her:\n\n       When Sonia Sotomayor ascends those marble steps to assume \n     her seat on the highest Court of the land, America will have \n     taken another important step toward realizing the ideal that \n     is etched above its entrance: Equal justice under the law.\n\n  I look forward to seeing her sworn in as our next Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, Senators have an enormous responsibility \nwhen it comes to deciding whether to support or oppose a Supreme Court \nnominee.\n  We must examine whether the person nominated to the highest court in \nthe land will uphold and defend the principles contained in the \nConstitution, refrain from judicial activism, respect the rule of law, \ndeliver blind justice to each and every litigant before the Court, and \nrender reasoned decisions that adhere to precedent.\n  This duty has been characterized by many of my colleagues as one of \nthe most important and far reaching decisions a Senator will ever make. \nI couldn't agree more.\n  I entered into the nomination process of Judge Sonia Sotomayor, a \nwoman with an impressive life story and resume, with an open mind and a \nsteadfast resolve to evaluate the nominee's qualifications on an \nunbiased basis.\n  In fact, having gone through the confirmation process myself before \nbeing sworn in as Secretary of Agriculture, I believe that a necessary \namount of deference should be given to the President's choices.\n  However, after carefully reviewing Judge Sotomayor's record and \nspeeches as well as closely monitoring her hearing before the Judiciary \nCommittee, I could not support her nomination.\n\n[[Page S8939]]\n\n  There are several areas that concern me with regard to Judge \nSotomayor.\n  First, I am concerned that she will not be a neutral umpire. You see, \na judge has the duty to preside over a courtroom with no inclination to \nside with one team over the other.\n  A judge must be able to put aside his or her personal or political \nagenda before sitting down on that bench. That is because no matter who \nyou are--Black or White, woman or man, rich or poor--every person in \nthis country is entitled to receive equal justice under the law.\n  There is a reason that Lady Justice wears a blindfold.\n  By now, most people are aware of Judge Sotomayor's comments that a \n``wise Latina woman'' would ``more often than not reach a better \nconclusion than a White male.'' However, I think it bears pointing out \nto those who claim the comment was made in isolation and taken out of \ncontext, that Judge Sotomayor has made a series of similar comments \nover the years.\n  For example:\n\n       In short, I accept the proposition that a difference will \n     be made by the presence of women on the bench and that my \n     experiences will affect the facts that I choose to see as a \n     judge.\n       Our experiences as women and people of color affect our \n     decisions. The aspiration to impartiality is just that--it's \n     an aspiration.\n       I willingly accept that we who judge must not deny the \n     differences resulting from experience and heritage but \n     attempt . . . continuously to judge when those opinions, \n     sympathies, and prejudices are appropriate.\n       By ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do \n     a disservice both to the law and society.\n\n  Nowhere in the history of our judicial system have judges been told \nto ``go with their gut'' as implied in the judge's statement. Such a \nstandard would erode the legitimacy of the judicial system and would \nput every litigant in jeopardy of receiving an unfair trial.\n  Rather, judges are expected to decide cases based on the rule of law, \nnot on the basis of their feelings. Otherwise empathy towards one \nperson would mean antipathy against another.\n  A concrete example of my concern that Judge Sotomayor would not be \nable to set aside her personal preferences and biases is the Ricci v \nDeStefano case. In this case, Judge Sotomayor and two of her colleagues \ndismissed in a summary one paragraph unpublished opinion the claims of \n17 white firefighters and one Hispanic firefighter. They alleged \nreverse discrimination based on New Haven's decision to discard the \nresult of a promotional exam because not enough minorities would be \neligible for promotion. Nearly half of the judges on the Second Circuit \ncriticized the ruling as a ``perfunctory disposition.''\n  However, on June 29, 2009, the Supreme Court announced it was \noverturning the Second Circuit's ruling in the Ricci case. And while \nthe final outcome appeared to narrowly overturn the Circuit's decision \nby a vote of 5-4, a deeper analysis is needed. All nine Justices \nunanimously rejected the lower court's specific holding and legal \nstandard.\n  It also bears mentioning Justice Alito's concurring opinion in the \ncase:\n\n       The dissent grants that petitioners' situation is \n     ``unfortunate'' and that they ``understandably attract this \n     Court's sympathy.'' But ``sympathy'' is not what petitioners \n     have a right to demand. What they have a right to demand is \n     evenhanded enforcement of the law--of Title VII's prohibition \n     against discrimination based on race. And that is what, until \n     today's decision, has been denied them.\n\n  Many of my colleagues questioned Judge Sotomayor about her decision \nin Ricci. Judge Sotomayor repeatedly indicated that she relied on \nprecedent, but the Supreme Court disagreed, saying, there were ``few, \nif any, precedents in the Court of Appeals.''\n  Because the Supreme Court is the highest court in the land and there \nis no backstop, I cannot support Judge Sotomayor's nomination. She did \nnot convince me, either through her past rulings or during her \nconfirmation hearing, that she would carry out justice in an impartial \nmanner. Impartiality is essential to our justice system.\n  Beyond my concern that Judge Sotomayor will not be able to set aside \npersonal views and prejudices, is her overall record before the Supreme \nCourt. The Supreme Court has substantively reviewed 10 of Judge \nSotomayor's decisions. Of those cases, eight have been reversed or \nvacated, one was upheld on a different legal standard and sharply \ncriticized for using a flawed legal theory, and the last one was upheld \non a slim 5-4 margin. This is a record that directly questions the \nnominee's legal reasoning and the ability to sufficiently apply the \nrule of law. A 10-percent success rate does not exude the confidence \nand mastery of the law that I feel is necessary of a Supreme Court \nJustice.\n  The final point of concern that I would like to highlight is Judge \nSotomayor's view of the Second Amendment. In Maloney v. Cuomo, Judge \nSotomayor joined a panel opinion that decided in one paragraph that the \nSecond Amendment did not apply to the states. Also, in United States v. \nSanchez-Villar, she joined a summary panel opinion that, among other \nthings, used a one-sentence footnote to conclude that ``the right to \npossess a gun is clearly not a fundamental right.''\n  Judge Sotomayor believes that states have the authority to infringe \non Second Amendment rights. This is fundamentally at odds with the \nConstitution.\n  Although Judge Sotomayor attempted to disavow and reconcile her past \ncomments during the hearing, her record speaks for itself. Even the \nWashington Post, which endorsed Judge Sotomayor, found her testimony \n``less than candid'' and ``uncomfortably close to disingenuous.''\n  Ultimately, I came to the decision that too many uncertainties exist \nregarding whether Judge Sotomayor will uphold the rule of law equally \nfor all people and adhere to the Constitution.\n  While I respect and appreciate her impressive life story and \naccomplishments, I cannot support her nomination to the highest Court.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the \nnomination of Judge Sonia Sotomayor to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor has a compelling biography.\n  As the first daughter of a young Puerto Rican couple, she grew up in \na public housing project in the South Bronx.\n  Her father, a factory worker, died when she was 9 years old.\n  Her mother, a nurse, then raised her and her younger brother, and \ninstilled in them a belief in the power of education.\n  Judge Sotomayor excelled in school.\n  She graduated as valedictorian of her class at Blessed Sacrament and \nat Cardinal Spellman High School in New York.\n  She won a scholarship to Princeton University, where she continued to \nexcel, graduating summa cum laude and Phi Beta Kappa.\n  She was a co-recipient of the M. Taylor Pyne Prize, the highest honor \nPrinceton awards to an undergraduate.\n  At Yale Law School, Judge Sotomayor served as an editor of the Yale \nLaw Journal and as managing editor of the Yale Studies in World Public \nOrder.\n  Over a distinguished career that spans three decades, Judge Sotomayor \nhas worked at almost every level of our judicial system.\n  Today, she serves on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second \nCircuit.\n  An appointee of President Clinton on the Second Circuit Court, she \nhas participated in over 3,000 panel decisions, and authored roughly \n400 published opinions.\n  When I met with Judge Sotomayor last month, I found her to be a very \nlikeable woman.\n   She also displayed these traits during her Senate confirmation \nhearings.\n  If she is confirmed, she will be the first Hispanic Supreme Court \nJustice--an ascendency that will mark a historical moment for our \ncountry.\n  I have, throughout my career, been a strong supporter of Hispanic \nnominees for judicial appointments and confirmation.\n  I am proud of the fact that, of the 40 judges I have had a role in \nnominating for the district courts in Texas, and the Fifth Circuit \nCourt of Appeals, 30 percent have been Hispanic.\n  Likewise, I was a strong supporter of Miguel Estrada, who, like Judge \nSotomayor, had an incredibly compelling life story, but whose \nnomination for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District Circuit was \nfilibustered.\n\n[[Page S8940]]\n\n  I believe the decision of whether to support a nominee for the \nFederal courts--and especially the highest court--must be grounded in \nqualification and judicial philosophy.\n  She certainly meets the academic and experience criteria for service \non our country's highest court.\n  The criteria for judicial philosophy for my concurrence is to apply \nthe law, not make the law.\n  A judge must interpret the Constitution, not amend it by judicial \ndecree.\n  One of the most important and recently confirmed constitutional \nrights is the right to keep and bear arms.\n  The Founding Fathers knew what they were doing when they put the \nsecond amendment in the Bill of Rights. This wasn't an accident.\n  They knew from their experience in the Revolutionary War that a free \npeople must have the right to possess and bear arms.\n  The second amendment clearly says: ``A well regulated Militia, being \nnecessary to the security of a free State, the right of the People to \nkeep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.''\n  Although some people are confused by the word ``militia,'' it is \nclear that the Founders did not use the word ``militia'' to mean that \ngun rights could only be used in an organized army.\n  The Framers did not intend for this right to be a ``collective'' \nright.\n  If that had been their purpose, they would have been satisfied with \narticle 1 section 8 of the Constitution that gives Congress the power \n``to provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the \nUnion, suppress Insurrections and repel Invasions.''\n  The Framers went further than that.\n  They wanted to ensure that gun ownership was recognized by posterity \nas an ``individual right.'' So they included it as part of the Bill of \nRights, which is a compilation of protected individual liberties such \nas free speech, freedom of religion, and a fair trial.\n  The second amendment ensures that every American can secure his \nfreedom, and defend his life and property, if necessary.\n  In that sense, the right to keep and bear arms could very well be one \nof our most important rights--because it is the right from which all of \nour other rights, freedom of speech, freedom of religion, et cetera are \nsecured.\n  That's why, last year, I led a congressional effort to support the \naffirmation of the second amendment as an important individual right in \nthe Supreme Court case of D.C. v. Heller, which overturned Washington, \nDC's unconstitutional ban on handguns.\n  In that case, Senator Tester and I, joined by 53 of our colleagues \nand 250 members of the U.S. House, filed a ``friend of the court'' \nbrief in favor of Dick Heller, who simply wished to exercise his \nconstitutional right to protect himself and his family.\n  That brief was proof that a majority in Congress believe that the \nsecond amendment is a constitutionally secured individual right.\n  It was the first time in history that a majority of the House and \nSenate sent this type of brief to the Supreme Court.\n  In the case of D.C. v. Heller, the Supreme Court affirmed the right \nto keep and bear arms as an individual right for the first time in \nalmost seven decades.\n  Unfortunately, however, just a few months ago, even after the Supreme \nCourt's verdict in D.C. v. Heller, Judge Sotomayor issued an opinion in \nanother case, Maloney v. Cuomo refusing to acknowledge that the second \namendment is a fundamental right, and therefore may not be binding on \nthe States.\n  As a strong advocate of the second amendment, I cannot ignore this \ndecision.\n  I am very troubled by Judge Sotomayor's opinion in Maloney v. Cuomo \nbecause it appears to disregard an instruction by the Supreme Court in \nHeller specifically regarding fundamental rights.\n  In Footnote 23 of the Heller decision, the Supreme Court stated: \n``With respect to Cruikshank's continuing validity on incorporation, a \nquestion not presented by this case, we note that Cruikshank also said \nthat the First Amendment did not apply against the States and did not \nengage in the sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by our \nlater cases.''\n  These ``later cases'' to which the court is referring held most Bill \nof Rights guarantees to be incorporated through the due process clause \nof the 14th amendment against State violation.\n  This was a clear instruction to the circuits that in future second \namendment cases they will need to confront the incorporation argument \nand do so following the Supreme Court's line of cases on incorporation.\n  I must take issue with Judge Sotomayor's per curiam opinion in \nMaloney because while her opinion references the Heller footnote, it \nonly acknowledges the portion noting the continued validity of Supreme \nCourt precedent indicating the second amendment is not binding on the \nStates.\n  Her court failed to recognize the instruction to conduct the \ncontemporary 14th amendment incorporation analysis the Heller footnote \ndemands.\n  As such, the Sotomayor opinion reaches the conclusion that the cases \nfrom the 1890s are still applicable--and therefore, basically, the \nsecond amendment is not binding on the states.\n  When questioned by the Judiciary Committee about the Maloney case, \nJudge Sotomayor said she was following precedent.\n  However, she did not follow the instruction of the Supreme Court in \nHeller on this point.\n  In Maloney, the Second Circuit cites the Supreme Court cases of \nHeller and Presser v. Illinois, decided in 1886, and the Second Circuit \nopinion Bach v. Pataki, decided in 2005.\n  Judge Sotomayor determines that Presser and Bach instruct the court \nto maintain Presser 's conclusion that the second amendment is not \napplicable to the States.\n  But Heller's Footnote 23 asks the Court to ``engage in a Fourteenth \nAmendment inquiry.''\n  I specifically asked Judge Sotomayor when we met why she did not \nfollow this instruction, articulated just last year by the Court?\n  I did not receive a satisfactory explanation to this very pivotal \nquestion, nor did I hear one in her testimony before the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Heller is precedent, and in this precedent, the Supreme Court tells \nthe circuits to perform a 14th amendment inquiry.\n  In April of this year, the Ninth Circuit considered the same second \namendment incorporation question.\n  While also looking to Presser for guidance, the Ninth Circuit turned \nto its own circuit precedent, Fresno Rifle & Pistol Club, Inc. v. Van \nde Kamp, and--like the Second Circuit--it would have been inclined to \nconclude that the second amendment did not apply to the States.\n  However, the Ninth Circuit acknowledged that it had not yet engaged \n``in the sort of Fourteenth Amendment inquiry required by [the Supreme \nCourt's] later cases,'' and therefore undertook the due process \nincorporation analysis as envisioned by the Heller footnote.\n  At the conclusion of the analysis, the Ninth Circuit finds that the \nsecond amendment right to keep and bear arms is ``deeply rooted in this \nNation's history and tradition'' and ``compels [us] to recognize that \nit is indeed fundamental'' and is therefore incorporated by the due \nprocess clause of the 14th amendment and applied against the states and \nlocal governments.\n  Let me repeat that. The Ninth Circuit's opinion holds that the second \namendment protects an individual's liberty, and because that protection \nis enumerated and so fundamental, the due process clause guarantees it, \nand the second amendment is therefore binding on the States.\n  We cannot escape the fact that both courts, each bound by the same \nHeller precedent, reached opposite conclusions, with Judge Sotomayor's \nopinion failing to subject the second amendment to the incorporation \nanalysis required by the Supreme Court, and failing to identify the \nsecond amendment as a fundamental right, binding against the States.\n  It is from this fact, this outcome, that I am unable to reconcile \nwith my earnest desire to confirm the first Hispanic Justice to the \nSupreme Court.\n  With the circuit courts split on the question of whether the second \namendment is an individual right protected against State infringement, \nthe Supreme Court will undoubtedly have this issue before it in the \nupcoming term.\n\n[[Page S8941]]\n\n  With the constitutional right to keep and bear arms hanging in the \nbalance, I cannot in good conscience vote to confirm a nominee whose \njudicial record indicates an unwillingness to protect and defend such a \nfundamental, individual right.\n  For that reason, I must oppose the nomination of Judge Sotomayor to \nthe Supreme Court of the United States.\n  I similarly opposed the confirmation of Attorney General Eric Holder \nearlier this year due to his stance on the second amendment embodying a \ncollective right rather than an individual right.\n  One added point. I am troubled by a line in her February 25, 2005, \nspeech at the Duke Law School, ``Court of Appeals is where policy is \nmade.''\n  This is a troubling statement in the area of judicial philosophy.\n  As I have stated earlier, I believe policy is made by elected \nofficials who must be accountable through elections, not by Federal \njudges with lifetime appointments.\n  Judge Sotomayor is without a doubt an intelligent, experienced, and \ncapable nominee, and she will bring much needed diversity to the Court.\n  But, after careful examination, I cannot support her confirmation to \nthe highest court in the land.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the time until 3 \np.m. will be divided, with the following speakers controlling 15 \nminutes each in the following order: the Senator from Alabama, Mr. \nSessions; the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Leahy; the Republican leader; \nand the majority leader.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, when President Obama nominated Judge \nSotomayor to the Supreme Court, I pledged that we would treat her with \nrespect and that our questions would be tough but always fair. It is an \nimportant office. I believe we have lived up to that obligation.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Leahy and the members of the Judiciary \nCommittee for their efforts. I think it did help provide a basis for \nour full debate in the Senate. I thank Judge Sotomayor for her kind \nwords regarding how the process has been conducted, and the way she \nconducted herself.\n  We have had a robust debate on the Senate floor over these past few \ndays, and we have addressed many important questions and issues.\n  The debate over Judge Sotomayor's nomination began with President \nObama's radical new vision for America's court system. According to the \nPresident, all nominees to the Federal bench would now have to meet an \n``empathy standard.'' This standard requires judges to reach their most \ndifficult and important decisions through the ``depth and breadth of \n[their] empathy'' and ``their broader vision of what America should \nbe.'' This is a stunning ideology. It turns law into politics. The \nPresident of the United States is breaking with centuries of American \nlegal tradition to enter a new era where a judge's personal feelings \nabout a case are as important as the Constitution itself.\n  The President's empathy standard is much more than a rhetorical \nflourish. It is a dangerous judicial philosophy where judges base their \nrulings on their social, personal, and political views. It is an \nattempt to sell an old, discredited activist philosophy by marketing it \nunder a new label. It is this activist philosophy, now under the guise \nof empathy, that has led judges to ban the Pledge of Allegiance because \nit contains the words ``under God,'' to interpret the Constitution on \nthe basis of foreign laws, to create a new right for terrorists who \nattacked the United States while robbing American citizens of their own \nrights to engage in activities such as silent prayer.\n  That philosophy also helps explain why Judge Sotomayor's panel of \nFederal judges allowed the city of New Haven to strip 18 firefighters \nof their eligibility for promotion on the basis of their race. It \nexplains why judges have interpreted the second amendment to permit \ncities and States to ban guns despite the Constitution's clear \nlanguage: ``the right of the people to keep and bear arms . . . shall \nnot be infringed.'' And it explains why judges have allowed government \nto seize private property for private commercial development despite \nthe Constitution's guarantee that private property may not be taken \nexcept for ``public use.''\n  The empathy standard may sound nice, but in reality, it is cruel. It \nis, in truth, a bias standard. The power to rule on empathy is the \npower to rule on prejudice, and the power to deny the rights of some is \nthe power to deny the rights of any or of all. A judge embraces empathy \nat the expense of objectivity and equality and fairness.\n  Eighteen firefighters in New Haven worked, studied, and sacrificed to \npass the city's promotion exam. But when the results did not fit a \ncertain racial quota, the city leaders unceremoniously scrapped the \nresults. The firefighters put their faith in the system, and the system \nlet them down. So they took their case to court. But Judge Sotomayor \nsummarily dismissed their case in a one-paragraph order that did not \neven consider their civil rights claims. But the Judge Sotomayor who \ntestified before the Committee did not effectively explain her ruling \nto deny these firefighters their day in court.\n  She also did her best to distance herself from the activist \nphilosophy she has so long spoken of and championed. But it was an \nunconvincing effort. I believe she failed to offer a credible \nexplanation for her critically important rulings that would eviscerate \ngun rights and property rights. She failed to offer a credible \nexplanation of her policy role in an advocacy group that took extreme \npositions when pursuing racial quotas, advocating that the Constitution \nrequires that the government fund abortions and opposing reinstatement \nof the death penalty. Her effort to rebrand her judicial approach \nstretched the limits of credulity. As one editorial page opined, her \ntestimony was ``at times uncomfortably close to disingenuous.''\n  Nevertheless, I believe we have had a deeply valuable public \ndiscussion. By the end of the hearing, not only Republicans and not \nonly Democrats but the nominee herself ended up rejecting the very \nempathy standard the President used when selecting her. This process \nreflected a broad public consensus that judges should be impartial, \nrestrained, and faithfully tethered to the law and the Constitution.\n  I think it will now be harder to nominate activist judges. This is \nnot a question of left versus right or Republican versus Democrat. This \nis a question of the true role of a judge versus the false role of a \njudge. It is a question of whether a judge follows the law as written \nor as they might wish it to be. It is a question of whether we live up \nto our great legal heritage or whether it is abandoned.\n  Empathy-based rulings, no matter how well-intentioned, do not help \nsociety but imperil the legal system that is so essential to our \nfreedoms and so fundamental to our way of life. We need judges who \nuphold the rights of all, not just some, whether they are New Haven \nfirefighters, law-abiding gun owners, or Americans looking for their \nfair day in court. We need judges who put the Constitution before \npolitics and the right legal outcome before their desired personal \npolitical and social outcome. We need judges who understand that if \nthey truly care about society and want it to be strong and healthy, \nthen they must help ensure our legal system is fair, objective, and \nfirmly rooted in the Constitution.\n  Our 30th President, Calvin Coolidge, said of the Constitution:\n\n       No other document devised by the hand of man ever brought \n     so much progress and happiness to humanity. The good it has \n     wrought can never be measured.\n\n  I certainly believe he is correct. That document has given us \nblessings no people of any country have ever known, which is why real \ncompassion is not found in the empathy standard but in following the \nConstitution.\n  Judge Sotomayor, however, has embraced the opposite view. For many \nyears before her hearings, she has bluntly advocated a judicial \nphilosophy where judges ground their decisions not in the objective \nrule of law but in the subjective realm of personal ``opinions, \nsympathies, and prejudices.''\n  A Supreme Court Justice wields enormous power--a power over every \nman, woman, and child in our country. It is the primary guardian of our \nmagnificent legal system. Because I believe Judge Sotomayor's \nphilosophy of law and her approach to judging fail to demonstrate the \nkind of firm, inflexible commitment to these ideals, I must withhold my \nconsent.\n  Mr. President, I see my colleague, Senator Leahy, is here. He has \nhandled\n\n[[Page S8942]]\n\nmany of these nominations over quite a few years. We did not agree on a \nlot of the things that came up in the hearings, but he committed to \ngiving the opportunity to the minority party to have a full opportunity \nto ask questions and to raise issues and speak out. I thank the \nchairman. I think it did credit to the Senate.\n  I thank the chairman, and I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Alabama for his \nkind comments. As he knows, I made similar comments about him this \nmorning in the Senate Judiciary Committee. I reiterate them here today.\n  We did decide, both Senator Sessions and I, at the beginning of this \nprocess that we would try to make sure everybody was heard. We may have \ndifferent outcomes on how everybody would vote, but everybody was \nheard. That has been done. I compliment the leaders of the Senate for \ndoing that.\n  We are about to conclude Senate consideration of this nominee. I \nthank those Senators who evaluated this nomination fairly. I thank \nespecially those Republican Senators who have shown the independence to \njoin the bipartisan confirmation of this historic nomination. I thank \nall Senators on both sides of the aisle who spent hours and hours and \ndays and days in our hearings.\n  Some critics have attacked President Obama's nomination of Judge \nSonia Sotomayor by contending he picked her for the Supreme Court to \nsubstitute empathy for the rule of law. These critics are wrong about \nthe President; they are wrong about Sonia Sotomayor.\n  Let's leave out the rhetoric and go to the facts. When the President \nannounced his choice of Judge Sotomayor 10 weeks ago, he focused on the \nqualities he sought in a nominee. He started with ``rigorous \nintellect'' and ``a mastery of the law.''\n  He then referred to recognition of the limits of the judicial role \nwhen he talked about ``an understanding that a judge's job is to \ninterpret, not make, law; to approach decisions without any particular \nideology or agenda, but rather a commitment to impartial justice; a \nrespect for precedent, and a determination to faithfully apply the law \nto the facts at hand.'' That is what President Obama said.\n  Then he went on to mention experience. He said:\n\n       Experience being tested by obstacles and barriers, by \n     hardship and misfortune; experience insisting, persisting, \n     and ultimately overcoming those barriers. It is experience \n     that can give a person a common touch and a sense of \n     compassion; an understanding of how the world works and how \n     ordinary people live. And that is why it is a necessary \n     ingredient in the kind of justice we need on the Supreme \n     Court.\n\n  Then the President concluded by discussing how Judge Sotomayor has \nall these qualities. The President was looking not just for lawyerly \nability, but for wisdom--for an understanding of how the law and \njustice work in the everyday lives of Americans.\n  In a subsequent radio and Internet address, the President reiterated \nthe point when he said:\n\n       As a Justice of the Supreme Court, she will bring not only \n     the experience acquired over the course of a brilliant legal \n     career, but the wisdom accumulated over the course of an \n     extraordinary journey--a journey defined by hard work, fierce \n     intelligence, and the enduring faith that, in America, all \n     things are possible.\n\n  President Obama did not say that he viewed compassion or sympathy as \na substitute for the rule of law. In fact, he has never said he would \nsubstitute empathy for the rule of law. That is a false choice. The \nopposition to this nomination is based on a false premise.\n  When she was first named, Judge Sotomayor said: ``I firmly believe in \nthe rule of law as a foundation for all our basic rights.'' Judge \nSotomayor reiterated time and time again during her confirmation \nhearing her fidelity to the rule of law. She said:\n\n       Judges can't rely on what's in their heart. They don't \n     determine the law. Congress makes the laws. The job of the \n     judge is to apply the law. And so it's not the heart that \n     compels conclusions in cases. It's the law. The judge applies \n     the law to the facts before that judge.\n\n  Those who, after 4 days of hearing, would ignore her testimony, \nshould at least take heed of her record as a judge. Judge Sotomayor has \ndemonstrated her fairness and impartiality during her 17 years as a \njudge. She has followed the law. There is no record of her substituting \nher personal views for the law. The many independent studies that have \nclosely examined Judge Sotomayor's record have concluded it is a record \nof applying the law, not bias.\n  What she has said, and what we should all acknowledge, is the value \nher background brings to her as a judge and would bring to her as a \nJustice, our first Latina Justice.\n  Judge Sotomayor is certainly not the first nominee to discuss how her \nbackground has shaped her character. Justice O'Connor has acknowledged, \n``We are all creatures of our upbringing. We bring whatever we are as \npeople to a job like the Supreme Court.'' Everybody knows that, just as \nall 100 of us bring who we are to the Senate. Many recent Justices have \nspoken of their life experiences as influential factors in how they \napproach the bench. Justice Alito and Justice Thomas, nominated by \nRepublican Presidents, did so famously at their confirmation hearings, \nand then they were praised by the Republican side of the aisle for \ndoing so. Indeed, when the first President Bush nominated Justice \nThomas to the Supreme Court, he touted him as an ``intelligent person \nwho has great empathy.''\n  Some of those choosing to oppose this historic nomination have tried \nto justify their opposition by falsely contending that President Obama \nis pitting empathy against the rule of law. Not so. Not so. This \nPresident and this nominee are committed to the rule of law. They \nrecognize the role of life experience not as a substitute for the law \nor in conflict with its mandates, but as informing judgment.\n  What is really at play is not a new Obama ``empathy standard'' with \nrespect to judicial selection, but a double standard being applied by \nthose who supported the nominations of Justice Alito and Justice \nThomas.\n  Judge Sotomayor's career and judicial record demonstrate that she has \nalways followed the rule of law. The point is, we don't have to guess \nat what kind of a judge she has been. She has had more experience on \nthe Federal court, both trial level and appellate level, than any \nnominee in decades. She will be the only member of the U.S. Supreme \nCourt with experience as a trial judge. We don't have to guess. There \nare well over 3,000 cases, so we don't have to guess. Attempts at \ndistorting that record by suggesting that her ethnicity or her heritage \nwould be the driving force in her decisions as a Justice of the Supreme \nCourt are demeaning to women and all communities of color.\n  I have spoken over the last several years about urging Presidents \nfrom both political parties to nominate someone from outside the \n``judicial monastery.'' I believe that experience, perspective, an \nunderstanding of how the world works and people live, and the effect \ndecisions will have on the lives of people are very important \nqualifications. By striving for a more diverse bench drawn from judges \nwith a wider set of backgrounds and experiences we can better ensure \nthere will be no prejudices and biases controlling our courts of \njustice. All nominees have talked about the value they will draw on the \nbench from their backgrounds. That diversity of experience and strength \nis not a weakness in achieving an impartial judiciary.\n  I have voted on every member of the current U.S. Supreme Court. I \nhave participated in the hearings of all but one of them, and that one \nI voted on the nomination having watched the hearing. I have sat in on \nthe hearings of Justices no longer there, either because of retirement \nor death. I have conducted hundreds of nomination hearings--everything \nfrom courts of appeals judges, Federal district court judges, and \nDepartment of Justice appointees. I have been ranking member on two \nSupreme Court nominations and conducted this one. I mention that to \nthank the Senator from Alabama for his cooperation during it.\n  After those hundreds of hearings, you get a sense of the person you \nare listening to. I met for hours with Judge Sotomayor, either in the \nhearing room or privately. You learn who a person is, you really do, in \nasking these kinds of questions. You have to bring your own experience \nand your own knowledge to\n\n[[Page S8943]]\n\nwhat you are hearing. There are only 101 people in this great Nation of \n300 million people who get a say as to who is going to be one of the \nnine members of the U.S. Supreme Court. First and foremost, it is the \nPresident who makes the nomination, but then the 100 of us in the U.S. \nSenate who must follow our own conscience, our own experience, our own \nabilities in deciding whether we will advise and consent to that \nnomination. It is an awesome responsibility, and we should do it not \nbecause we are swayed by any special interest group of either the right \nor the left.\n  In fact, I have a rule--my office knows it very well--that in Supreme \nCourt confirmations I will not meet with groups on either the right or \nthe left about it. I will make up my mind through those hours and days \nand the transcripts of the hearing. I would urge all Senators to do \nthat. I think it is unfortunate if any Senator of either party were to \nmake up their mind on a Supreme Court nominee based on pressure from \nspecial interest groups from either the right or the left. That is a \ndisfavor to those hundreds of millions of Americans who don't belong to \npressure groups of either the right or the left. They expect us to \nstand up.\n  That is what we should do on Judge Sotomayor. This is an \nextraordinary nominee. I remember when President Obama called me a few \nhours before he nominated her. I was with our troops in Afghanistan, \nand he explained what he was going to do in a few hours. We talked \nabout that and we talked about Afghanistan, but we talked especially \nabout her. He said, you know, there are Web sites already developing \nopposed to her. And within hours, we had leaders calling her racist, \nbigoted, or being affiliated with a group akin to the Ku Klux Klan. \nFortunately, Senators on neither side joined with that.\n  We are almost at a time for a vote. I would hope every Senator would \nsearch his or her conscience and ask whether they are voting for this \nnominee based on their oath of office, based on their conscience, or \nare they reflecting a special interest group.\n  When the Judiciary Committee began the confirmation hearings on this \nSupreme Court nomination, and when the Senate this week began its \ndebate, I recounted an insight from Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., which \nis often quoted by President Obama. ``Let us realize the arc of the \nmoral universe is long, but it bends toward justice.''\n  It is distinctly American to continually refine our Union, moving us \ncloser to our ideals. Our union is not yet perfected, but with this \nconfirmation, we will be making progress.\n  Years from now, we will remember this time when we crossed paths with \nthe quintessentially American journey of Sonia Sotomayor and when our \nNation took another step forward through this historic confirmation \nprocess. I urge each Senator to honor our oath, our Constitution, and \nour national promise by voting his or her conscience on the nomination \nof Sonia Sotomayor to serve as a Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court. I \nwill proudly vote for her.\n  Mr. President, I see the Republican leader is here, and I will \nreserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, once again I wish to thank the chairman \nand the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator Leahy and \nSenator Sessions, and their staffs, for conducting a dignified and \nrespectful hearing. From the beginning of the process, I assured Judge \nSotomayor that Republicans would treat her fairly. At the end of the \nprocess, I can say with pride that we kept that commitment.\n  This particular nominee comes before us with an impressive resume and \na compelling life story. Yet the question we must ask ourselves today \nis whether we believe Judge Sotomayor will fulfill the requirements of \nthe oath that is taken by all Federal judges to administer justice \nwithout respect to persons; that is, to administer justice \nevenhandedly.\n  President Obama asked himself a different question when he was \nlooking for a nominee. The question he asked is whether that person has \nthe ability to empathize with certain groups. And as I have said, \nempathy is a fine quality. But in the courtroom, it is only good if a \njudge has it for you. What if you are the other guy? When he walks out \nof the courthouse, he can say he received his day in court. He can say \nhe received a hearing. But he can't say he received justice.\n  At her hearings Judge Sotomayor was quick and even eager to repudiate \nthe so-called empathy standard. But her writings reflect strong \nsympathy for it. Indeed, they reflect a belief not just that \nimpartiality is not possible, but that it is not even worth the effort.\n  Judge Sotomayor's record of complex constitutional cases concerns me \neven more. Because in Judge Sotomayor's court, groups that didn't make \nthe cut of preferred groups often found they ended up on the short end \nof the empathy standard, and the consequences were real.\n  One group that didn't make the cut in Judge Sotomayor's court were \nthose who needed the courts to enforce their first amendment rights to \nsupport candidates for political office free from government \ninterference. She is free to express her personal opinions on this \nissue, as she did when she wrote that merely donating money to a \ncandidate is akin to bribery.\n  But as a judge she was obligated to follow clear Supreme Court \nprecedent. And when it came to this issue, she followed her political \nbeliefs instead, voting not to correct her circuit's clear failure to \nfollow the Supreme Court precedent in this area of the law.\n  Ultimately, the Supreme Court, in a 6-to-3 opinion authored by \nJustice Breyer, corrected this error by her circuit on the grounds that \nit had failed to follow ``well-established precedent.''\n  Another group that didn't make the cut were those who need the courts \nto protect them from unfair employment preferences. As a lawyer, she \nadvocated for--and, in fact, helped plan--lawsuits that challenged \ncivil service exams for public safety officers. And as a judge, she \nkicked out of court--with just six sentences of explanation and without \nany citation of precedent--the claims of a group of firefighters who \nhad been unfairly denied promotions they had earned. This past June, \nthe Supreme Court reversed her ruling, making her 0 for 3 this term, \nwith all nine Justices finding that she had misapplied the law.\n  Gun owners didn't make the cut, and they haven't fared well before \nJudge Sotomayor either. She has twice ruled the second amendment isn't \na fundamental right and thus doesn't protect Americans when States \nprevent them from bearing arms. And here too, she didn't even give the \nlosing party's claims the dignity of a full treatment. In one case, she \ndisposed of the party's second amendment claim in a one-sentence \nfootnote. In the other, she did it with a single paragraph.\n  Property owners weren't on the list either, and they too haven't \nfared well in Judge Sotomayor's court. In an important fifth amendment \ncase--the amendment that protects against the government taking private \nproperty--Judge Sotomayor broadened even further the government's \npower, a ruling which one property law expert called ``one of the worst \nproperty rights decisions in recent years.''\n  And her ruling in this case fit an all-too-familiar pattern: she \nkicked the aggrieved party's serious constitutional claims out of court \nin an unsigned, unpublished, summary order, with only a brief \nexplanation as to why.\n  These important cases illustrate the real-world consequences of the \nempathy standard, in which judges choose to see certain facts but not \nothers, and in which it's appropriate for judges to bring their \npersonal or political views to bear in deciding cases. Lieutenant Ben \nVargas, one of the firefighters who did not fare well under the empathy \nstandard, may have put it best. Speaking of himself and the other \nplaintiffs in that case, he said,\n\n       We did not ask for sympathy or empathy. We asked only for \n     evenhanded enforcement of the law, and . . . we were denied \n     that.\n\n  Lieutenant Vargas understands what most other Americans understand \nand what all of them expect when they walk into a courtroom: that in \nAmerica, everyone should receive equal justice under the law. This is \nthe most fundamental test for any judge, and all the more so for those \nwho would sit on our Nation's highest court, where a judge's impulses \nand preferences are not subject to review. Because I am not convinced \nthat Judge Sotomayor would\n\n[[Page S8944]]\n\nkeep this commitment, I cannot support her nomination.\n  Mr. President, does our side have time left, I would ask?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Only the leader has time.\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, on May 17, 1954, the Supreme Court of the \nUnited States handed down a ruling that would begin to reroute America \ntoward a more unified Union. When the Justices unanimously directed, in \nBrown v. Board of Education, that our children's schools must no longer \nbe racially segregated, their decision echoed far beyond the walls of a \ncourtroom in Washington, DC, or a classroom in Topeka, KS. The decision \npaved the way for countless future turns that would make our Nation \nmore just and its people more equal.\n  Not 6 weeks later after that opinion, Sonia Sotomayor was born in the \nsouth Bronx. In her lifetime, this Senate has sent to the Supreme Court \nthe only two women and the only two Americans of color to ever sit on \nthat bench.\n  In the 10 weeks since President Obama made history by nominating \nJudge Sotomayor, many have emphasized the importance of putting the \nfirst Hispanic on the Nation's highest Court. This is truly historic \nfor our entire Nation but especially for the young Latinos in this \ncountry who will see in Judge Sotomayor concrete evidence of the \nheights to which they can legitimately aspire.\n  But it is no less significant that in a country where women represent \nhalf of our population, Judge Sotomayor will be the third woman, only \nthe third woman to ever serve as a Justice and will be one of only two \nwomen serving on the Court today.\n  In many ways, Justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg \nhave made this day possible for Judge Sotomayor. Because of the trail \nthese women; that is, O'Connor and Ginsburg and others like them, have \nforged, Judge Sotomayor has been recognized throughout her career for \nher intelligence, talent, and accomplishments rather than being defined \nby her gender.\n  It was not easy. Justice O'Connor finished high school at age 16, and \nwhen she finished Stanford Law School, one of the finest law schools in \nthe world, a year early--she did it in 2 years--she was third in her \nclass, two behind Justice Rehnquist but no law firm in California would \nhire Justice O'Connor as an attorney because--because she was a woman. \nThe most one firm would offer her was a position as a legal secretary.\n  When Justice Ginsburg arrived at Harvard Law School, she was greeted \nby a dean who asked why the nine women in her class--it was a class of \nabout 700 people--why nine women in her class were occupying seats that \ncould otherwise be taken by men.\n  Little did he know she would later join another group of nine legal \nexperts whose membership was long restricted to men, the Supreme Court \nof the United States. Like Justice O'Connor, Justice Ginsburg did not \nreceive a single offer from any of the 12 law firms with which she \ninterviewed, even though she finished first in her law school class.\n  When she was recommended for a clerkship to the Supreme Court, at \nleast two of the Justices refused to hire her. Why? She was a woman.\n  America is grateful that O'Connor and Ginsburg did not give up. We \nare fortunate that their voices and the real-world perspective they \nbrought to the table were part of the debate during some of our \nNation's landmark cases on gender equality.\n  In the Lilly Ledbetter 2007 case before the Supreme Court, Justice \nO'Connor's successor, Samuel Alito, wrote the majority opinion in a 5-\nto-4 ruling that made it virtually impossible for women and other \nvictims of pay discrimination to fight back.\n  Justice Ginsburg, who herself has been a victim of pay discrimination \nbecause she was a woman, read her powerful dissent aloud from the \nbench. It is rarely done. But she stood and proudly voiced her dissent \nin that 5-to-4 opinion. She invited Congress to correct this injustice, \nand we did that. We changed the law. After we passed the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act this year, it was the first piece of legislation \nthat President Barack Obama signed into law.\n  Similarly, when the Supreme Court heard the case of a 13-year-old \nhonor student, a girl who had been strip-searched at school, Justice \nGinsburg heard her colleagues minimize the humiliation the student had \nsuffered. Justice Ginsburg noted that she was the only one on the Court \nwho had ever been a 13-year-old girl and encouraged her colleagues to \ntake into account the victim's perspective. The Court rightly ruled the \nsearch was unreasonable. That would not have happened but for Ruth \nBader Ginsburg.\n  Judge Sotomayor's life experiences will not dictate her decisions any \nmore than Justices O'Connor, Ginsburg, Scalia, or Alito have let their \npersonal pasts prescribe their own rulings. But as the newest member of \nthe Supreme Court, she will bring a perspective not only as a woman and \na Hispanic, but also a former criminal prosecutor, commercial \nlitigator, trial judge, and appellate judge. She will share the depth \nand breadth of that experience with her colleagues, just as they will \nbe able to share their own unique views on any case with her--their own \nviews.\n  Justice O'Connor has said that the first African-American Justice, \nThurgood Marshall, opened for his colleagues a window into a different \nworld and was able to relate to them experiences they could not know.\n  Justices O'Connor and Ginsburg have done the same. Soon so will Judge \nSotomayor. A more diverse Supreme Court is a better Supreme Court.\n  Judge Sotomayor's journey to this day has not been without obstacles. \nBut because of the struggles fought by those who came before her, she \nhas been able to succeed. Today the Senate will make history by \nconfirming the first Hispanic, the third woman, and the third person of \ncolor to the Supreme Court of the United States. But equally as \nimportant, we will also make history by confirming someone as qualified \nas Sonia Sotomayor.\n  Her experiences come not only from the legal world but also the real \nworld. Her understanding of the law is grounded not only in theory but \nalso in practice. Her record is beyond reproach, her respect for the \nlimits of the judiciary is resolute, and her reverence for the law is \nunwavering.\n  Sonia Sotomayor is an American of tremendous credentials. Both her \nacademic record and her career experience are second to none. She \ngraduated summa cum laude from Princeton University and excelled at \nYale; again, Stanford, Harvard, Yale, all in the top three law schools \nin the country. She excelled at Yale where she was a member of the law \nreview, the prestigious Yale Law Review.\n  After she is confirmed, she will be the only Justice who has seen a \ntrial from every single angle. She has seen a trial from prosecuting \ncivil and criminal cases, she has presided over them as a trial judge, \nand handled them as an appellate court judge. That is precisely the \nkind of experience we need on the Supreme Court.\n  I have had concerns for quite some time that we have far too few \njudges on the Court who have had trial experience. As a trial lawyer--I \nhave tried more than 100 cases in front of juries--that experience to \nsomeone sitting on that Court is important. And she will bring that. \nThat is so important.\n  We have too many Supreme Court Justices who have never conducted a \ntrial. Some of them have never been involved in a trial. They have \nlooked at cases from the appellate purview. I wanted someone who has \nlooked at a case from a trial court perspective.\n  As the distinguished ranking member of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, said shortly after her \nnomination, Judge Sotomayor's nomination: ``She's got the kind of \nbackground you would look for, almost an ideal mix of private practice, \nprosecution, trial judge, circuit judge.''\n  I could not agree more with my friend Jeff Sessions. Her experience \nas a trial judge will be invaluable to the Supreme Court. As a former \ntrial lawyer, as I have indicated, a judge is more than just a \npolitical title to me.\n\n[[Page S8945]]\n\nIt is someone who understands the law and sees every day how it affects \npeople, real people.\n  When looking at Judge Sotomayor, I see someone who knows what happens \nin a courtroom, which is an arena unlike any other arena in the world. \nWe tend to think of Supreme Court cases as major milestones that change \nthe arc of our history and define our principles. And they do. But they \noften begin as ordinary, routine cases before a trial judge. It could \nbe a traffic stop that winds up at the Supreme Court, it could be a \nprotest in a park, it could be the placement of some monument in a park \nor some public place, it could be a dispute over money.\n  Linda Brown was a girl trying to go to public school close to her \nhouse in Topeka, Kansas, setting in motion the beginning of the end of \nsegregation in Brown v. Board of Education. Linda Brown was that little \ngirl who wanted to go to school close to her home. Judge Sotomayor \nunderstands people like Linda Brown. She has developed a 17-year record \nas a moderate judge who is squarely in the mainstream.\n  One of her colleagues on the Second Circuit Court of Appeals for our \ncountry has credited Sotomayor with such an insightful and convincing \nunderstanding of the law that she changed his mind many times. He said: \n``I would read one of the memos she had written on a case and say, I \nthink she's got it and I don't.''\n  This is one of the reasons that both Republican and Democratic \nPresidents have nominated her to the Federal bench. It is the reason \nshe has been confirmed twice by this body with strong bipartisan \nsupport. It is the reason that liberals and conservatives alike in the \nSenate will vote today to confirm her.\n  This woman's brilliance was on display last month. Remember, she just \nbroke her leg. But she stood 4 days of grueling testimony with some of \nthe finest legal minds in our country, the Democrats and Republicans of \nthat Judiciary Committee. She did a good job in a very difficult \nsituation. She was asked tough questions and she gave honest answers. \nJudge Sotomayor, who has been credited with saving baseball in one of \nher opinions, hit it out of the park in her testimony and her presence \nbefore the Judiciary Committee. If there ever were a home run, she hit \nit.\n  I thank Chairman Leahy, my dear friend, who has been so good to me \nfor so many years. I think back with fondness of our time here together \nin the Senate. I thank Ranking Member Sessions, who has always been a \ngentleman to me. We have disagreed on many public issues, political \nissues, but never do we disagree on our friendship.\n  I appreciate Chairman Leahy and Senator Sessions for running a \nthoughtful and thorough confirmation hearing. I appreciate the generous \nand genuine cooperation of my colleagues who support this nomination as \nwell as the respect shown by those who dissent.\n  But I commend Barack Obama, the President of the United States, for \nselecting such an accomplished, qualified, and experienced nominee to \nreplace Justice Souter. It is with some sadness that I stand here today \nand recognize that David Souter will no longer be on the Supreme Court. \nI can say about no other Member of the Supreme Court what I can say \nabout David Souter. David Souter was my friend. We did things socially. \nWe had meals together. What a wonderful human being. I will miss him. \nHe has always been a powerful defender of constitutional rights, \nwhether it is the State of New Hampshire's constitutional rights or our \ncountry's constitutional rights. All Americans thank this good man for \nhis decades of service to our Nation, and he has more to give. I am \nconfident, though, that Judge Sotomayor will soon build upon her \nimpressive record which is already very impressive when she is across \nthe street at the Supreme Court.\n  I am certain she will leave the writing of the law to those of us on \nthis side of the street. That is our job, and she will impartially and \nfaithfully fulfill her constitutional duty to apply only the laws that \nwe pass here.\n  I am also convinced that, when she soon takes the same oath every \nJustice before her has taken, she will ``administer justice without \nrespect to persons, and do equal right to the rich and to the poor.''\n  Sonia Sotomayor has risen remarkably from the trials of a modest \nupbringing in the South Bronx of New York to presiding over major \ntrials on the Federal bench. All Americans, men and women of every \ncolor and background, can be confident that she will ensure equal \njustice under the law in our Nation's very highest Court.\n  That is why I am so proud to cast my vote in a few minutes for the \nconfirmation of Sonia Sotomayor as an Associate Justice of the United \nStates Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Senate has concluded consideration of \nthe nomination of Sonia Sotomayor and has confirmed her as a Justice on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. The consideration of a nomination for a \nlifetime appointment to the Supreme Court is one of our most \nconsequential responsibilities. The consideration of the nomination of \nSonia Sotomayor has been a credit to the Judiciary Committee and to the \nSenate.\n  We could not give this process the attention it deserves without the \nhelp of dedicated staff. For 2\\1/2\\ months, the staff of the Judiciary \nCommittee has worked long hours dutifully to help Senators in their \nreview.

ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 1302(c)(1) of the Supplemental \n     Appropriations Act, 2009 (Public Law 111-32; 123 Stat. 1910; \n     49 U.S.C. 32901 note) is amended by adding at the end the \n     following:\n       ``(H) Eligible individuals.--A voucher may only be issued \n     under the Program in connection with the purchase of a new \n     fuel efficient automobile by an individual--\n       ``(i) who filed a return of Federal income tax for a \n     taxable year beginning in 2008, and, if married for the \n     taxable year concerned (as determined under section 7703 of \n     the Internal Revenue Code of 1986), filed a joint return;\n       ``(ii) who is not an individual with respect to whom a \n     deduction under section 151 of the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 is allowable to another taxpayer for a taxable year \n     beginning in the calendar year in which the individual's \n     taxable year begins; and\n       ``(iii) whose adjusted gross income reported in the most \n     recent return described in clause (i) was not more than \n     $50,000 ($75,000 in the case of a joint tax return or a \n     return filed by a head of household (as defined in section \n     2(b) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986)).''.\n       (b) Regulations.--Not later than 7 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act and notwithstanding the \n     requirements of section 553 of title 5, United States Code, \n     the Secretary of Transportation shall promulgate final \n     regulations that require--\n       (1) each purchaser or leaser of a new fuel efficient \n     automobile under the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save \n     Program established under section 1302(a) of such Act (Public \n     Law 111-32; 123 Stat. 1909; 49 U.S.C. 32901 note) to affirm \n     on a standard form, determined by the Secretary, that such \n     purchaser or leaser is an individual described by section \n     1302(c)(1)(H) of such Act, as added by subsection (a); and\n       (2) each dealer that receives a form described in paragraph \n     (1) under such program to submit such form to the Secretary.\n       (c) Fraud Detection.--Upon receipt under paragraph (2) of \n     subsection (b) of a form described in paragraph (1) of such \n     subsection, the Secretary shall submit such form to the \n     Internal Revenue Service to determine whether the purchaser \n     or leaser has violated section 641 of title 18, United States \n     Code.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, the Car Allowance Rebate Program, or the \ncash for clunkers as everyone knows it, has been very popular with the \nAmerican people, there is no doubt about it, the way it has been used. \nIt has been a shot in the arm for the auto industry and our dealers at \na very critical time. But I believe the program should be strengthened, \nand I think we should seize this supplemental time as an opportunity to \ndo just that.\n  When this program was first authorized last year and we put this into \neffect, at that time I made the observation, which I will repeat here \ntoday, that, why would we want to give $4,500 to the President of the \nUnited States, who makes $400,000 a year, so he can buy a new car? Why \nwould we want to give a Member of the Senate, who makes $172,000 a \nyear, $4,500 to buy a new car? Quite frankly, we can afford to buy a \nnew car.\n  But how about the rest of the American people out there, those who \nare making $30,000 a year, just above the minimum wage or $35,000 a \nyear or $40,000 a year? How about them? What do they get out of this? \nWell, they can get $4,500 to buy a new car too. Someone who is making \n$35,000 a year probably does not have health insurance either. They \nprobably have some old clunker made back in the 1990s or 1980s they are \nstill driving that they are paying a lot for because it is a gas \nguzzler and they are paying a lot to get it repaired because they \ncannot afford to buy a new car. If you give them $4,500, many still \ncannot buy a new car.\n  So I argued at that time, when we did this, that we ought to put an \nincome limit on it. That way, if you put an income limit on it, then \nthe amount of money we are appropriating--that is what we are doing, by \nthe way, spending taxpayers' money; we are putting this money out \nthere--then that amount of money goes to a smaller subset of people, \nthose who are low and moderate income. If you do that, then you can \nafford to give them a little bit more money. So someone making $35,000, \n$30,000, $40,000 a year might be able to get not $4,500 but maybe \n$7,500, maybe $8,000. Someone in that income category, then, could go \nout and buy a new car because they could get a loan, say, if they are \nbuying a $16,000 or $17,000 car, and that is what new cars are selling \nfor, at least some of the more modest automobiles. Some of the more \nmodest automobiles cost around $14,000, $16,000, $17,000. So if they \ngot more money, that means they could get a loan for 50 percent of the \nprice. They probably could not get a loan for 75 percent or 80 percent \nof the price because they simply do not have that much credit. But they \ncould get a loan for maybe half of the price of a car because, \nobviously, when they drove it away, the value of the car would still be \nmore than that.\n\n  So I argued at the time that is what we should do with this money, \nand that is what I do again with this amendment. This amendment just \nbasically says it limits the income, restricting the participation to \nindividuals with an adjusted gross income of less than $50,000 and \nfamilies with an adjusted\n\n[[Page S8947]]\n\ngross income of less than $75,000. So if you have an adjusted gross \nincome as a single person of less than $50,000, you can participate; if \nyou are a family, with less than $75,000 in adjusted gross income, you \ncan participate.\n  Again, what I don't have in this amendment is increasing the amount \nof money.\n  So that is the thrust of this amendment. I know the program has been \nvery successful. The first $1 billion was rapidly exhausted. I assume \nthe second $2 billion we are going to be voting on would do the same. \nTo my way of thinking, let's get a couple of bangs for the buck. Let's \nnot only stimulate our economy by getting a lot of those cars off the \nlot and giving a shot in the arm to the auto industry, but let's help \nsome people who really need some help: lower income, moderate-income \nindividuals, and families who, even if you give them $4,500, can't \nafford to buy that new car. So, to me, that is what we ought to do. We \nought to ensure that we get the maximum economic stimulus for every \ndollar we spend.\n  If we are going to give a lot of money to people who make $150,000 or \n$200,000 a year, or whatever--there is no income limit on the bill \nnow--I am not certain that is a lot of economic stimulus. I might like \nit. I could probably take my car--I forget what year my car is, early \n2000--I could take it in and get a new car, and I would get $4,500. But \nis that fair? Is that fair to someone of my status who makes--let's \nface it, I make $172,000 a year. Is it fair that I should get $4,500 to \ngo out and buy a new car? I just don't think that is fair. I don't \nthink it is right. But I think it would be right for someone making \nless than $50,000 a year because they are the ones who need the help. \nThey need some economic stimulus also.\n  The higher the income of the person, the more likely they are to buy \na new car without the rebate and in many cases would do that. Maybe it \nwould not happen this month. But it may very well happen in the months \nto come.\n  By only providing money to those who are less likely to buy a car \nwithout the government benefit, we have a more efficient use of \ngovernment dollars.\n  For the modest income family with an old gas guzzler, they are paying \nmore for gas, they are paying more for repairs because they can afford \nto repair the car but they can't afford to get a new car, so they are \nstuck. They really need the help. I always thought cash for clunkers \nwas a great idea--I still do, if it was targeted--if it was targeted \nand you gave lower and moderate-income people enough money to go out \nand do this.\n  So I think the $1 billion before, and now the $2 billion--so $3 \nbillion--I think could have been much better spent by targeting it to \nlow-income people and giving them the economic stimulus they need, so \nthey will be saving money because they will be spending less on gas and \nthey will be saving money because they are spending less on car \nrepairs.\n  People of modest means are the most likely to have a vehicle that is \nreally old, that is really a gas guzzler. Again, in the absence of an \nincentive, they are going to stick with their old vehicle because they \nsimply can't afford a new car. A $4,500 rebate obviously provides a \npowerful incentive. We have seen that. It works.\n  I don't have any demographics. I don't have any data on who purchased \nthese cars in regard to their income levels because there is no income \nguidelines on this, we don't really know who walked into the showrooms \nand bought these cars. We do know about half the cars were foreign \ncars. We do know that. Almost half were U.S. big three company cars. We \ndo know that. But we just don't know what the incomes were, the \neconomic status of the individuals or families who came in and \npurchased this new car.\n  I will say that I have on a few occasions talked to individuals I \nknow who are of modest income means to ask them if they were taking \nadvantage of this, and in just a few instances that I have been able to \ntap into this--by no means is this any kind of a poll that would be \naccurate, but in just the few cases where I have asked, people have \nsaid: Well, you know, $4,500 is nice, but I don't have the rest of it. \nQuite frankly, my credit is not very good because I am up to here with \ncredit cards, and I am not certain I can get the money together to buy \nthat car. So, again, that is just a couple of instances. I wouldn't say \nthat is generally true, but it gives me an indication there are a lot \nof people out there who would like to have a new car, who would like to \nhave the wherewithal to do it but even with $4,500 would not be able \nto.\n  So, again, that is what my amendment is. It is very simple. It just \nsays right now that $50,000 per person, $75,000 per family. So think \nabout it.\n  Right now, an executive with a $1 million salary and a 10-year-old \ngas-guzzling second car--perhaps a Cadillac; that is their second car \nor their third car--they can walk right into the showroom and purchase \na brand new Cadillac that gets an additional 8 miles per gallon. That \nexecutive making a million-dollar salary, we will give them a $4,500 \ngift from the Federal Government.\n  Is this what we want to do? I don't think so. I just don't think it \nis a wise use of the limited funding we have. It probably will \nstimulate the economy; sure. I have no doubt about that. But is it \nstimulating the economy for lower income people whom I think we also \nought to be stimulating in terms of their economic situation too?\n  So, again, that is the essence of the amendment. I think the program \nworks. It is good, but it should be appropriately targeted to Americans \nof modest incomes and modest means. They tend to drive older vehicles. \nThey need those cars to get to work, to take their kids to afterschool \nactivities, to get to the doctors, and if they live in rural areas such \nas Iowa and places like that, they depend on that car for their life. \nSo I think it makes good sense to offer a car purchase rebate. I am not \nopposed to the program. I think it works. But I just think it ought to \nbe better targeted.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, before the Senator from Iowa leaves the \nfloor, if the Senator from Iowa has no further speakers on his \namendment or wishes to speak any further, I am prepared on our behalf \nto yield all the time on our side if he would like to yield the time on \nhis side so we can move the process on, and if the Senator would like \nto ask for the yeas and nays right now before I seek to offer my \namendment, I am happy to stand by for that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, I am not sure who is controlling time, but \nI wish to speak on the bill and on the amendment at the same time.\n  Is there a time limit on the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is a total of 30 minutes on the \namendment, equally divided.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I am asking a parliamentary inquiry: Is there a time limit \non the bill?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I thank the Presiding Officer. I wish to speak on the \nbill. I would ask, who is controlling time in opposition to the \namendment? I wish to speak on the bill.\n  Mr. President, I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, it has been brought to my attention that \nthere is a mistake in drafting part of this amendment. Quite frankly, \nit does read that a voucher may only be issued under the program to an \nindividual ``who filed a return of Federal income tax for taxable year \nbeginning in 2008.''\n  There are some low-income people who don't file income tax returns, \nso there is a little bit of a problem in the drafting. I still remain \ncommitted to somehow working this out. It now looks as though even some \npeople who make just over the minimum wage would not be allowed to go \nin, and those are the people I am trying to get to more than anybody \nelse, those who are making a very low income but probably don't file an \nincome tax return because they are low income.\n  I believe there are ways of getting over this. But the way the \namendment is drafted, it can only go to an individual who filed a \nFederal income tax\n\n[[Page S8948]]\n\nreturn. That raises some troubling questions. I am also told that, \nunder the agreement we have now, I cannot offer another amendment. In \nother words, amendments are now limited. I have a problem, because it \nis not what I intended to do. It is a drafting error. I apologize for \nthat. I will continue to try to work on it and see if I can do \nsomething at some point. I remain committed to having an income cap on \nthis program.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, let me say \nthat he raises a good point about his amendment. I don't think it would \nbe a difficult matter to drop that provision, or modify that provision, \nso that it would not preclude someone who had not filed an income tax \nreturn from being eligible for this particular program.\n  If the Senator wishes to modify his amendment to that effect, there \nwould be no objection on our side. However, there would be objection to \nsimply dropping the amendment, because too many people on our side are \nin agreement with the concept, and this is pursuant to a unanimous \nconsent agreement.\n  Again, if the Senator wishes to modify the amendment, there would be \nno objection to that, although we would want to see the language, \nobviously.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside my \namendment and that we move on to other amendments. We will bring this \namendment up later. I ask unanimous consent that the time we have be \nreserved and that we come back to this amendment after the others have \nbeen disposed of.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 2301, As Modified\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I call up my amendment No. 2301, which is at \nthe desk, and I ask unanimous consent that Senators Bennett, Roberts, \nand Snowe be added as cosponsors, and I also ask that the amendment be \nmodified with the changes at the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report the amendment, as modified.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Arizona [Mr. Kyl], for himself, Mr. \n     Bennett, Mr. Roberts, and Ms. Snowe, proposes an amendment \n     numbered 2301, as modified.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of the \namendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. STATUS REPORT AND REIMBURSEMENT OF UNFUNDED \n                   OBLIGATIONS.\n\n       The Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Act of 2009 \n     (title XIII of Public Law 111-32) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c)(1)(A), by striking ``November 1, \n     2009'' and inserting ``August 8, 2009'';\n       (2) in subsection (g)--\n       (A) by amending paragraph (1) to read as follows:\n       ``(1) Database.--The Secretary shall maintain, and update \n     each business day, a database that contains--\n       ``(A) the vehicle identification numbers of--\n       ``(i) all new fuel efficient vehicles purchased or leased \n     under the Program; and\n       ``(ii) all eligible trade-in vehicles disposed of under the \n     Program; and\n       ``(B) the amount of money--\n       ``(i) obligated by the Federal Government for payment of \n     vouchers issued under the Program; and\n       ``(ii) remaining to be obligated for such payments from the \n     amount appropriated for such purpose.''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3) Supplemental report.--No amounts may be obligated for \n     the Program beyond the amounts appropriated under subsection \n     (j) until after the Secretary submits a report to the \n     committees referred to in paragraph (2) that--\n       ``(A) evaluates the fuel efficiency standards of--\n       ``(i) the eligible trade-in vehicles traded in under the \n     Program; and\n       ``(ii) the new fuel efficient automobiles purchased under \n     the Program; and\n       ``(B) details the administration of the Program, including \n     the method used by the Department of Transportation--\n       ``(i) to track the amount obligated by the Federal \n     Government for payment of vouchers issued under the Program; \n     and\n       ``(ii) to determine the amount of appropriated funds \n     remaining to be obligated under the Program.''; and\n       (3) in subsection (j)--\n       (A) by striking ``There is hereby appropriated'' and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(3) In general.--There is appropriated''; and\n       (B) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(2) Reimbursement of unfunded transactions.--In addition \n     to the amount appropriated under paragraph (1), there shall \n     be made available for the Program, from amounts appropriated \n     under the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 \n     (Public Law 111-5) for the Department of Transportation and \n     not otherwise obligated, an amount equal to the amount by \n     which the dollar value of all of the vouchers issued under \n     the Program during the period described in subsection \n     (c)(1)(A) exceeds $1,000,000,000.''.\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, when Congress rushed the so-called Cash for \nClunkers Program to passage as part of the fiscal year 2009 \nsupplemental appropriations bill, it had little time to consider how \nthe program would work. Although the program is well-intentioned, many \nhave criticized its efficiency and questioned the ability of the \nDepartment of Transportation to manage its application.\n  The program has only been running for a couple of weeks, but DOT is \nalready saying the $1 billion appropriated for the program has likely \nbeen spent. But nobody really knows. Yet this bill would appropriate an \nadditional $2 billion.\n  My view is that before we jump to spend another $2 billion of \ntaxpayers' hard-earned money, we need to call a time out--clear all of \nthe transactions that qualify, see how much it costs, and evaluate how \nmuch more, if any, we want to spend. If we appropriate more, we \ncertainly should establish a tracking system to know how much the \ngovernment is committed to pay each day so that we will know when to \ncut the program off before we again run out of money. In short, this \ncrash program must be properly restructured now if it is to be \ncontinued.\n  There have been multiple complaints from dealers who have had trouble \nwith the program. Some dealers haven't received their registration \ninformation, and some have had trouble accessing the system to submit \ntransactions. This information is concerning because, if true, DOT \npresumably doesn't have an accurate count of how many transactions \ndealers have made compared to how much money is left in the Cash for \nClunkers Program. In fact, it is my understanding that the National \nAutomobile Dealers Association estimated that at least 200,000 deals \nhave been completed but not yet successfully submitted to the \nDepartment of Transportation.\n  The confusion at DOT is evident. On Thursday, July 30, less than 1 \nweek after DOT started to accept dealers' transactions, DOT told \nCongress that the program was suspended because the $1 billion had been \nexhausted. The next day, DOT said the program was not suspended and \ntransactions could continue. On Sunday, August 2, Secretary LaHood was \non C-SPAN's ``The Newsmakers'' and first stated that the entire $1 \nbillion hadn't been spent. However, later in the interview, he said \nthat the administration would only honor deals made through Tuesday, \nAugust 4, unless the Senate approves this bill. He then said, in the \nsame interview, that DOT estimates there is only enough money to cover \ndeals made through this week. The process is anything but accurate. \nDealers should not have to bear the risk that deals they made in good \nfaith won't be honored.\n  It is not only dealers who should be concerned about whether the \ngovernment has accurate data needed to wind down the program before the \nfunding runs out. Secretary LaHood recently said that the government \nwill make ``a good-faith effort'' to reimburse all deals that are in \nthe ``pipeline.'' But without appropriated money, he cannot make any \ncommitment. Statements of the Secretary are not binding promises. \nConsumers are also entitled to certainty. That is why we need a timeout \nto assess where we are and redo the process to be fully transparent and \naccurate.\n  Specifically, my amendment would terminate the program as of August \n7, 2009, at 11:59 p.m. to give a date certain to dealers and consumers \nto avoid any further confusion about whether all\n\n[[Page S8949]]\n\ndealer transactions will be honored. It would delay new funding for the \nCash for Clunkers Program beyond the $1 billion already appropriated, \nexcept for such sums needed to meet all obligations through August 7 \nthat may exceed $1 billion, which would be paid for by using \nunobligated stimulus funding designated for DOT. This addresses the \nconcern that some dealers will be on the hook for deals that have not \ncleared before the program runs out of money. DOT currently has no \nmechanism in place to efficiently cut off transactions once the \nappropriated threshold is reached.\n  My amendment would require DOT to submit a detailed report to \nCongress, before any new appropriations are made, that evaluates the \nmethodology it used to track the daily obligations incurred under the \nprogram versus reimbursements sent to the dealers. The reporting \nrequirement would ensure that Congress can evaluate what changes have \nto be made to more efficiently disburse any future money allocated to \nthe program and, importantly, be able to track the disbursements and \nobligations to ensure the latter do not exceed the funding available. \nTo this end, my amendment would add a requirement that if future \nappropriations are made, DOT must track daily the number of \ntransactions made and money left to be obligated for reimbursement to \nthe dealers. Again, this would ensure that the DOT is working with the \nmost up-to-date information so that no consumer or dealer would enter \ninto a transaction if funding is already exhausted.\n  Some have questioned whether the Cash for Clunkers Program is \nencouraging consumers to purchase or lease fuel-efficient vehicles. On \nJune 11, two of my colleagues even submitted an opinion piece in the \nWall Street Journal that indicated the Cash for Clunkers Program was \n``bad policy'' and ``would create handouts for Hummers.'' The report \nwould also evaluate the fuel efficiency standards of the automobiles \ntraded in and the new automobiles leased or purchased. Obviously, \nshould we want to modify the terms of the legislation to meet some of \nthe concerns expressed by the colleagues I mentioned, that could be \ndone at that time.\n  I am very familiar about what happens to program extensions that are \nrushed through without any oversight. In 2000, the Arizona State \nlegislature passed a well-intentioned law, much like cash for clunkers, \nwhich provided a tax credit for purchasers to buy vehicles converted to \nrun on propane or compressed natural gas. The program was originally \nestimated to cost $5 million. However, lawmakers continued the call for \nthe expansion of the program based on consumer demand. Before long, \nthat small $5 million pricetag ballooned up to a $600 million budget \nliability. It was stopped in time to avoid the State from bankrupting \nitself.\n  I am concerned that we are putting American taxpayers in a similar \nposition. If the additional $2 billion is simply appropriated for this \nprogram, will DOT come back to Congress in September and argue that we \nmust extend the program yet again? Maybe there would have been more \nmoney committed than the $2 billion, as may be the situation now. \nAren't we required to apply some metrics, in other words, to evaluate \nthe benefits against the cost to taxpayers? I don't have to remind \neverybody how Congress views temporary programs. Former President \nReagan used to describe them by saying, ``There's nothing more \npermanent than a temporary government program.'' That could well be the \ncase here if we don't step back and evaluate the program, and if we \ndon't ensure that any future funding for such a program is done in a \nmore efficient manner than this particular program is today.\n  As I said, auto dealers are hardly the only business that would be \nhappy to receive government assistance. So evaluating it at this \njuncture is very important, lest we make the same mistake in the \nfuture.\n  We rushed cash for clunkers once. I suggest that we should not make \nthe same mistake again. I urge my colleagues, therefore, to support my \namendment when the appropriate time comes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona controls 8 additional \nminutes, and there is 15 minutes in opposition.\n  Who yields time to the Senator?\n  Mr. KYL. I am happy to yield time to my colleague.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise in support of the Kyl amendment. I \nremind my colleagues how this all happened. In June, the House ``air \ndropped'' $1 billion for a Cash for Clunkers Program into a conference \nreport, which had nothing to do with clunkers, accompanying a $105 \nbillion war supplemental spending bill and sent it over to the Senate. \nDespite the fact that my colleagues on the other side had advocated a \nnew rule in the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act in 2007 to \nallow a procedural vote to strip air drops from conference bills, when \nsuch a vote was presented, it was voted to keep this clunker of a \nprovision.\n  I hope one of my colleagues will propose a ``cash for golf clubs'' \nproposal. I have had many calls from people who have old golf clubs, \nand they would like to have cash for them. We know that it is an \nimportant national sport and it is an important part of our economy. I \nhope we will be taking up a ``cash for golf clubs'' provision pretty \nsoon.\n  We are spending $3 billion to subsidize car purchases, some of them \nfrom automotive companies we own. We own Chrysler and General Motors. \nWe own them, and we are going to give them money. So maybe it will come \nback to us.\n  The Wall Street Journal editorializes:\n\n       This is crackpot economics. The subsidy won't add to net \n     national wealth, since it merely transfers money to one \n     taxpayer's pocket from somebody else's, and merely pays that \n     taxpayer to destroy a perfectly serviceable asset in return \n     for something he might have bought anyway.\n\n  Here we had it stuck into a supplemental appropriations bill that had \nnothing to do with automobiles. So now we find that people like free \nmoney. They like free money. Yes, we all like free money. So the \nprogram has gone out of control.\n  We have no idea, as Senator Kyl has said, how much money is being \nspent, how much is being obligated. So rather than stop and see what \nthe story is here, let's spend $2 billion more. At some point, this \nkind of thing has to stop. The national debt has climbed to $11.6 \ntrillion. If we are under the impression--if anybody is under the \nimpression--it is going to be taken out of the stimulus package, the \nchairman of the Appropriations Committee in the House 2 days ago said: \nDon't worry, we will add an additional $2 billion. Don't worry, it \nwould not be taken out of the program that the money is there for; that \nmoney will be ``replenished.'' Do you know what replenishing means? It \nmeans $2 billion more of taxpayers' dollars. Everybody in Congress now \nis patting themselves on the back.\n  The program has also been a success, I might add, for foreign auto \nmanufacturers. Four of the five top-selling cars in the program are \nmade by foreign automakers, according to the Department of \nTransportation, and a success for Citibank that managed the voucher \nprogram, which has received $45 billion in Federal aid, and, yes, for \nthe 184,000 Americans who have received up to $4,500 toward the \npurchase of a new car, except for the other 290-some million who will \nnot take advantage of this program who will be paying the bill.\n  I urge adoption of the Kyl amendment. At least we should pause and \nsee where we are.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). Who yields time?\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, if nobody is seeking time in opposition, \nI suggest on this amendment that all time be yielded back, if the \nSenator from Arizona is agreeable.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, at this time, I object. I think at some \npoint we will be able to yield back much of the time, but at this time, \nwe need to talk with our Members to make sure Members have had a chance \nto say their piece.\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, would it be in order to ask for the yeas \nand nays, and when the time is yielded back, we can set the vote?\n\n[[Page S8950]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is in order to ask for the yeas and nays.\n  Mr. KYL. I ask for the yeas and nays on the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2302\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask further proceedings on this \namendment be set aside and I be allowed to call up amendment No. 2302.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from New Hampshire [Mr. Gregg] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2302.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To protect the generations of tomorrow from paying for new \n                              cars today)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. AMENDMENT TO THE 2010 BUDGET RESOLUTION.\n\n       S. Con. Res. 13 (111th Congress) is amended--\n       (1) in section 101--\n       (A) in paragraph (2), strike the amount for fiscal year \n     2010 and insert ``$2,890,499,000,000'';\n       (B) in paragraph (3)--\n       (i) strike the amount for fiscal year 2011 and insert \n     ``$2,969,592,000,000''; and\n       (ii) strike the amount for fiscal year 2012 and insert \n     ``$2,882,053,000,000''; and\n       (2) in section 401(b), by striking paragraph (2) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(2) for fiscal year 2010, $1,085,285,000,000 in new \n     budget authority and $1,307,200,000,000 in outlays;''.\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, the senior Senator from Arizona alluded \nto the fact that basically this bill is unpaid for--$2 billion. There \nis a figleaf representation that the money in this bill is somehow \nbeing taken out of another account, and, therefore, it is offset--the \naccount being the Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Program under the \nstimulus package. But that is a total fraud--a total fraud.\n  This is the ultimate bait and switch because, as the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona pointed out, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee \nin the House, for whom I have a lot of respect and I think his \nforthrightness is refreshing, quite honestly, said on the floor of the \nHouse, when he was asked the question: What is going to happen to the \nfact that $2 billion has now been taken out of the Renewable Energy \nLoan Guarantee Program, what is going to happen to the loan guarantee \nprogram? Congressman Obey said:\n\n       If the gentleman would yield, I share the gentleman's view \n     that the Renewable Energy Loan Guarantee Program is of vital \n     importance to creating a new, green economy. We have talked \n     with the White House. We have talked with the Speaker and I \n     want to assure you--\n\n  This is the chairman of the Appropriations Committee; when he assures \nyou, you can be assured it is for sure--\n\n     and I want to assure you that all of us certainly have every \n     intention of restoring these funds.\n\n  They are doubling down on the debt. It is bad enough--this should be \ncalled the ``debt for clunkers'' bill to begin with because basically \nwhat we are doing is creating debt for our children. We are suggesting, \nwe are proposing, we are allowing $4,500, $1 billion, now $3 billion \nout the door to buy cars today, but the bill to pay those cars is going \nto come due on our children and our grandchildren as they have to pay \nthe debt off, which this is going to go to increase.\n  This is nothing more than a program which is being funded entirely by \ndebt and an increase in the Federal debt, as Congressman Obey \nforthrightly stated when he said: We are going to find the $2 billion \nwe took out of this account, and we are going to refill that $2 \nbillion, which they will have to borrow to do. Everybody knows that.\n  I don't happen to support the program, but I at least would like to \nhave some integrity in this process, and I would like to have the \nprogram paid for. If we are going to represent to the American people \nthat this program is paid for, let's pay for it. So my amendment does \nthat. That is all it does. It creates a mechanism to make sure we are \nnot going to replenish an account we allegedly took the money out of in \norder to pay for this account.\n  The way I have set this up, it does not have to necessarily affect \nthe loan guarantee program. In fact, it is not specifically the loan \nguarantee program at all what I have done. What I am suggesting we do \nis that next year, in order to make sure this program is paid for, we \nreduce what is known as the 302(a) allocation cap by $2 billion. That \nway we can be reasonably confident that before this money can be spent \ntwice, there will have to be a vote, a 60-vote point of order brought \nagainst it on the floor of the Senate, and people will have to \nforthrightly say: Oh, we are actually borrowing from our children to do \nthis. Or alternatively and refreshingly, we will not borrow from our \nchildren to do this; we will actually pay for it by reducing the 302(a) \nallocation cap.\n  It is an attempt to bring some integrity to the process, some honesty \nto the process, and actually pay for the program we allege we are \npaying for rather than use this gamesmanship, which is the ultimate \nbait and switch of saying we are going to pay for it today from funds \nwe are taking out of the account tomorrow, and then we are going to \nrefund that account tomorrow so we end up borrowing the money from our \nchildren. In this case, it would be twice because we had to borrow the \nmoney on the stimulus to begin with. That is all it does. It tries to \nput a little integrity into the process and make the pay-fors for this \nprogram honest and straightforward and reasonably real. Nothing is real \naround here when it comes to money and paying for things, but hopefully \nit would be more substantive and more substantial relative to the \nintegrity of the process than under the proposal as it is presently \ndrafted.\n  On the underlying program, though, I do have to make this point \nbecause it is an interesting point, not made by me, but I want to \nparaphrase it. It was made by the editors at the Web site Edmunds. \nEdmunds is an automobile Web site where you can get an evaluation of \ncars, sort of like consumer reports on cars. They will tell you how \nmuch your car is worth. They will tell you what the rating on your car \nis. They have a valuation of your car. They are totally independent. \nThey have no dog in this fight.\n  They looked at this program and said: Something is wrong here. We \nhave $4,500 per car being the amount that is reimbursed to people. You \ncan buy about 220,000 cars, $4,500 a car. Their point was that over the \ntime period this bill has been in place, in the typical course of \nbusiness, 200,000 cars would have been turned in, old mileage, used \ncars that would have been turned in anyway. If there was no \nrepossession, no ``debt for clunkers'' program, 200,000 cars would have \nbeen turned in to purchase new cars during this same timeframe. That is \ntheir estimate, and they are professionals. They look at it in a \ntotally independent way. That was their estimate.\n  So the incremental increase in the number of cars that are being \nturned in under this program is about 20,000 to 22,000 cars. That does \nnot work out to $4,500 a car; that is costing the American taxpayers \nabout $45,000 a car to get those extra 22,000 cars off the road. \nRidiculous.\n  The program has so many inconsistencies about it, but the ultimate \ninconsistency is we are borrowing from our kids to pay this. If this \nbill passes, we will have added $3 billion to the debt of our children. \nIt is not appropriate. It is certainly not appropriate to spend it to \nbuy a car today and pay for it 10, 15 years from now and have our \nchildren have to pay for it 10, 15 years from now by adding to the debt \nof this Nation.\n  My amendment attempts to address that issue by trying to enforce the \npay-fors in this bill by reducing the 302(a) allocation next year.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I wish to speak and have my time \nallocated to the Kyl amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I wish to speak both to the Kyl \namendment and to the Gregg amendment, but\n\n[[Page S8951]]\n\nlet me indicate first to my friend from New Hampshire, we are not \ntalking about sales that would have happened anyway. If anybody looks \nat the numbers of what has been happening in this country, we have had \ncapacity to build 17 million vehicles in this country, 9 million of \nthem sold in the last year, which is why we are seeing the automobile \nindustry in the state that it is.\n  The reality is, this is a program that has been working. Consumers \nbelieve it is working, small businesspeople believe it is working, \npeople who make steel and aluminum and advertisers and everyone who is \ninvolved in the larger economic impact of the auto industry believes it \nis working. That is why we need to pass this bill, as the House did.\n  As a general statement, I say everyone knows if any amendment is \nadopted, this program will fall. This program will be killed if any \namendment is adopted. So we should start from that premise right now \nand then go to the merits. The reality is, if any amendment is adopted, \nthe program will die. Those opposing the CARS Program are offering \namendments hoping at least one of them will be adopted so the program \nwill be killed.\n  With regard to the amendment of my friend from New Hampshire, first, \nlet me say this. The bill is already deficit neutral. The $2 billion \ninvolved is completely offset with funds already appropriated under the \nRecovery Act. In a way, Senator Gregg's amendment is actually making us \npay for this twice, which does not make any sense at all.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle who are constantly \nbashing the recovery package for not delivering immediate results \nshould be jumping for joy. There has been nothing more immediate, \nnothing more temporary, nothing more timely than the CARS Program.\n  The reality is that after only a week and a half into the program, we \nare back asking that the additional money we had originally asked for \nin the beginning be appropriated because this has worked.\n  I urge a strong ``no'' vote on the Gregg amendment.\n  As to the Kyl amendment, I also urge we oppose this amendment that \nwould set an end date for this Saturday, effectively ending, again, one \nof the most important and successful stimulus we have had. It would be \na hit to the economy, to the environment, and to consumer confidence \njust as it is starting to improve.\n\n  Many of the oversight goals Senator Kyl is seeking to achieve, NTHSA \nalready has the authority to do and they are already working on. NTHSA \nis already maintaining a database and is working to make it as timely \nand up to date as possible.\n  The original legislation also requires a report on the program that \nwill cover many of the details that are in the Kyl amendment. The \nlegislation also adds the requirement of a GAO study that will review \nthe administration of the program. DOT has made several modifications \nto its online system to streamline the transactions and to speed up the \nprocesses. They have conducted field hearings, informal surveys; they \nhave worked with dealers, and they have doubled the number of staff \nthey have had. They have worked to refine and to deal with the \nimmediate concerns because of how quickly the response came in.\n  So I would just urge that we vote no on the Kyl amendment, no on the \nGregg amendment, and no on any other amendment that will kill the most \neffective stimulus we have passed this year.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I rise to speak in opposition to this \namendment No. 2302 that is being offered by my distinguished colleague \nand friend from New Hampshire.\n  Madam President, at the beginning of this Congress, just about every \nMember in this Chamber approached me and my colleague from Mississippi, \nSenator Cochran, and indicated that we had to fix the legislative and \nappropriations process.\n  Senator Cochran and I have taken that challenge very seriously, and \nwe are on the path of doing just that. In the course of 7 months, we \nhave enacted into law the Recovery Act and closed the books on the \n110th Congress with the enactment of the omnibus and supplemental \nappropriations bills. In looking forward to fiscal year 2010, we have \nreported out of the Appropriations Committee 11 of 12 appropriations \nbills, and the Senate has passed four of them.\n  There are 2 months remaining before the start of the 2010 fiscal \nyear, and to state it very bluntly, Madam President, this amendment \nwill wreak havoc on both the work that has already been accomplished \nand the work that still needs to be accomplished. A vote for an \namendment that cuts $2 billion from our 2010 budget allocation at this \nlate date--and let me remind everyone in this Chamber that we are \noperating within an allocation that is $10 billion below the \nPresident's budget request--is a vote against getting our \nappropriations process back to regular order.\n  The Appropriations Committee has spent many months reviewing agency \nrequests and drafting bills to reflect those needs within the \nlimitations of the budget allocation set by the Budget Committee. To \ncut that budget allocation further after the fiscal year 2010 bills \nhave been reported out of the committee would require significant cuts \nto the remaining bills that have yet to receive floor consideration. \nMadam President, that is fiscally irresponsible and simply \nunacceptable.\n  My good friend, the Senator from New Hampshire, has indicated this \namendment is needed to pay for the CARS program now and not in the \nfuture. I would like to note that the authors of the underlying bill \nare already paying for this program by reallocating funding that was \nprovided in the stimulus bill. This program is paid for at this moment.\n  Further, in general, the budget allocation for fiscal year 2010 \ndiscretionary spending reflected the fact that an economic recovery \npackage for the next 2 years had just been enacted. This was one of the \nprimary reasons for agreeing to an allocation that is $10 billion below \nthe President's request. Consequently, taking discretionary funding \nfrom fiscal year 2010 to pay for a program that is being funded out of \nthe Recovery Act is the equivalent of double accounting.\n  Madam President, the amendment is unnecessary for the purposes of \npaying for the CARS program, and it is harmful for the purposes of \ngetting our appropriations process back to the regular order. So, \ntherefore, I urge my colleagues to vote against the amendment.\n  I thank the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2301\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, how much time is remaining in opposition \nto the Kyl amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Eleven minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to use that \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, we will soon vote on whether to extend \nthe Cash for Clunkers Program. Rarely has this body passed legislation \nthat has so clearly and quickly met our goals than when it approved the \nfirst installment of money for this program earlier this summer. The \nprogram offers rebates of $3,500 to $4,500 to consumers who trade in \nold inefficient vehicles for new cars and trucks with higher mileage. \nThousands of consumers who hope to take advantage now wonder whether \nthey will have the opportunity.\n  It is important to understand the context in which we originally \napproved this program. Amid the most severe downturn since the Great \nDepression, auto sales everywhere plummeted--in the United States and \naround the globe, foreign manufacturers and U.S.-based companies alike. \nIn the U.S. market, month after month automakers have reported sales \nthat have fallen 40 percent or more from a year ago. This unprecedented \ndecline has harmed not only the hard-working autoworkers in my home \nState and other States, but auto suppliers, auto dealers, and small \nbusinesses in every community in this Nation. Because the auto industry \nrepresents such a large share of this Nation's overall economic \nactivity, as long as this sales decline continues, it will weigh down \nour economy, frustrating attempts to lift us out of recession.\n  In establishing this program, we did not establish a course. We \nfollowed a\n\n[[Page S8952]]\n\npath that had already been laid out by other nations. In Germany, \nFrance, Japan, and other nations, governments recognized the danger to \ntheir own auto industries in this time of economic crisis and they \nacted. Germany's Government established its own version of cash for \nclunkers, and in June car sales were up 40 percent over the same period \na year ago. Other nations saw similar impressive increases.\n  After just a few days, our efforts have borne impressive results. \nThis week Ford reported its sales increased in July from a year ago, \nthe first year-over-year increase reported this year by any automaker. \nOther carmakers, foreign and domestic, saw smaller declines than in \nprevious months. The impact has been so striking that one private \neconomist has raised his estimate for economic growth in the third \nquarter of this year by more than 50 percent based solely on the \nsuccess of cash for clunkers.\n  This program accomplished what it was intended to accomplish. In just \na few days, a quarter of a million Americans traded in their old car \nfor a new model using the credits available from this program. That is \na quarter of a million American families who have more fuel-efficient \ntransportation, a quarter of a million transactions that will pump new \nmoney into local economies, and an incalculable boost to this Nation's \nstruggling auto industry.\n  The program has made significant improvements in the fuel efficiency \nof our Nation's vehicle fleet. According to data from the National \nHighway Traffic Safety Administration, consumers using this program are \nbuying new vehicles with an average 63 percent improvement in fuel \neconomy over their trade-ins. More than four out of every five vehicles \ntraded in are trucks; nearly three out of five new vehicles are cars. \nThe average mileage improvement of 9.6 miles per gallon is more than \ndouble the program's minimum and far greater than expected.\n\n  In short, cash for clunkers has exceeded earlier projections in its \nability to get older cars off the road and their damaging emissions out \nof our skies. Seldom have we had an opportunity to do more for our \nenvironment than we do today. Reinforcing and extending this program \nwill get replaced hundreds of thousands more of these environmental \nclunkers with highly efficient new vehicles.\n  Some Members have proposed changes to the program by amendments. Some \namendments are pending, or will be introduced, that are not related to \nthis program. These may be well intended amendments, but it is vitally \nimportant to keep in mind the need for immediate action. The House of \nRepresentatives has sent us a bill that will keep the program running. \nAny amendments--any amendments--that the Senate approves will send the \nlegislation back to the House of Representatives where action will be \ndelayed until the House reconvenes in September. So any amendment that \nis adopted here is the death knell for this program. It would have to \nend immediately if an amendment is adopted because of the uncertainty \nover whether funds remain and to what extent. This program is designed \nto be a one-time stimulus, not a stop-and-start deal, which would make \nit more complex and confusing.\n  This situation is not new. We had a similar situation just a week or \nso ago. When the Senate passed a bill to restore funding to the highway \ntrust fund, an amendment pending to that bill would have prevented the \nFederal Government from cutting $8.7 billion in transportation funding \nfrom several States, including my home State of Michigan. Normally, it \nwould have been a simple decision to vote for that amendment to avoid \nthose cuts. Michigan is in desperate need, and that amendment would \nseemingly protect hundreds of millions of dollars for my State. Yet I \nvoted against the amendment. I did so because of the time-sensitive \nnature of the underlying bill. And many others in this body voted \nagainst an amendment for that same reason.\n  The highway trust fund was on the verge of running out of money, and \nthe bill that we were voting on restored funding to keep it solvent \nthrough September. With the House of Representatives about to adjourn a \nweek or so ago, any Senate amendment to that bill would have required \nthat it be sent back to the House of Representatives, likely killing \nthe bill. I, and many others here, decided not to risk letting the \nhighway trust fund run out of funds. So what did we do? We voted for \nthe bill, but we voted against an amendment, even though that amendment \nwould have helped our States. What we did instead is we pledged to seek \npassage of that amendment at a later date to a different legislative \nvehicle. I opposed every amendment to that bill, as did a majority of \nour colleagues.\n  That is the situation we are in now. If we want this program to \ncontinue, we have but one choice. We have to vote for it, but we also \nmust vote against all of the amendments that are pending to it, even \nthough those amendments may be attractive standing on their own and in \nordinary circumstances. It is going to be difficult for some to vote \nagainst these amendments. I understand that. But the issue is going to \nbe, do you want the Cash for Clunkers Program to continue? If any \namendment passes, it is the end of that program.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2304\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside and that Coburn amendment No. 2304 be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2304.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent that the amendment be considered \nas read.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n   (Purpose: To provide assistance to charities and families in need)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION ___. ASSISTANCE TO CHARITIES AND FAMILIES IN NEED.\n\n       Section 1302 of the Supplemental Appropriations Act, 2009 \n     (Public Law 111-32; 123 Stat. 1909; 49 U.S.C. 32901 note) is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)(2)(B), by inserting ``or for donation \n     to a charity''; and\n       (2) in subsection (c)(2)--\n       (A) in subparagraph (A), strike ``For each'' and insert \n     ``Except as provided in subparagraph (C), for each'';\n       (B) by redesignating subparagraph (C) as subparagraph (D); \n     and\n       (C) by inserting after paragraph (B) the following:\n       ``(C) Donation to charity.--For each eligible trade-in \n     vehicle surrendered to a dealer under the Program, the dealer \n     may dispose of such vehicle by donating such vehicle to--\n       ``(i) an organization that--\n\n       ``(I) is described in section 501(c)(3) of the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 and exempt from tax under section 501(a) \n     of such Code, including educational institutions, health care \n     providers, and housing assistance providers described in such \n     section; and\n       ``(II) certifies to the Secretary that the donated vehicle \n     will be used by the organization to further its exempt \n     purpose or function, including to provide transportation of \n     individuals for health care services, education, employment, \n     general use, or other purpose relating to the provision of \n     assistance to those in need, including sales to raise \n     financial support for the organization; or\n\n       ``(ii) a family that does not have sufficient income to \n     afford, but can demonstrate a need for, an automobile.''.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, it is interesting to note what we just \nheard from the Senator from Michigan about how we can't fix this \nprogram--admitting that there are several things wrong with it--because \nthe House is out of town and we have to pass it. So we are going to do \nthe wrong thing for the right reason.\n  I have not heard from a dealer in my State that is not for this \nprogram. There is no question it is stimulatory. There is no question, \nhowever, that the stimulation is one based on time of sales, not on \ntrue total stimulation to our economy. What we are doing is stimulating \nfuture sales to be bought at this time. But, more importantly, we have \ntwo untoward disadvantages that this program is causing which is \nactually hurting the poorest and the weakest and those of color in this \ncountry.\n  When we wrote this amendment, we went to the Finance Committee. We \nwere told it was not going to score.\n\n[[Page S8953]]\n\nThen when we got to the Joint Economic Committee, they scored this \namendment as costing $90 million, but what they did not take into \nconsideration is that if these cars were actually given to charities or \nto people who did not have a car, it scored exactly the same. In \nessence, there is no net score with the bill.\n  The fact is, with this program--because we are destroying half a \nbillion dollars worth of real assets so far in this program and we are \ngoing to destroy $1.2 to $1.3 billion worth of real assets, real cars \nthat charities could really use to give to real people who do not have \ntransportation--we are taking that away. In our tough economic times \nright now, charities' income is down about 30 percent across the board \nwhile the demands on the charitable organizations are up. We all \nrecognize that charities use the contributions of automobiles to then \nturn around to sell and fund a lot of charities.\n  What this amendment does is allow the vehicles that are traded in to \nbe donated to poor families or to charities. Why destroy a perfectly \ngood car that somebody in a rural area who cannot get access to health \ncare now because they don't have transportation--why destroy that \nmechanism of opportunity?\n  I understand there probably will not be the votes for this amendment. \nBut to say we are going to take a perfectly good automobile that \nsomebody less fortunate could utilize for years for transportation \npurposes, that will elevate them economically, and instead we are going \nto destroy it, we are going to destroy the opportunity for somebody \nless fortunate to have that automobile. This program is working for two \ngroups of people: it is working for the auto industry and their \ndealers, and it is working for anybody who qualifies and uses the Cash \nfor Clunkers Program. But it is not working for everybody else. This is \na small minority of Americans who are going to benefit for a specific \nindustry.\n  I heard the Senator from Arizona raise the question: Why not golf \nclubs? Why not dishwashers? Why not washing machines? Why not boats? \nWhy not RVs? Why not other industries that also were on their backs, \nnot having the same benefit?\n  I also would note that several organizations, a couple from which we \nreceived endorsements--the Military Order of the Purple Heart and \nLutheran Charities throughout America endorse it.\n  I thought I would raise one other point; that is, this amendment is \nsignificantly environmentally friendly. A recent ABC News story on the \nclunkers quoted the following:\n\n       Believe it or not, even some environmentalists are against \n     the new law. They point out it will end the lives of \n     perfectly serviceable vehicles with years of life left. One \n     way to be green is to get a more carbon friendly car. Another \n     way to be green is to recycle or buy a used car. It takes 113 \n     billion Btus to build a Toyota Prius. You have to drive that \n     car 46,000 miles before you are even on the carbon footprint.\n\n  If you take the same car and give that car to somebody in need, you \nenhance their economic condition and you do not create another 113 \nbillion Btus of energy.\n  Hybrids get great mileage, we talked about that, but in terms of net-\nnet, in terms of being green--we hear that all the time. If we want to \ndo what is most efficient from an environmentally safe standpoint, this \namendment does it. You still have the Cash for Clunkers Program, but \nwhat you do is turn around and use the cars by giving them to \ncharitable organizations or families who need them. If we were to do \nthat, especially if we are going to increase this program $2 billion \nadditionally, you are going to save $1 billion worth of net assets that \nwe can transfer to those less fortunate in this country. For that, the \ntax consequences will be $90 million, which is exactly the same tax \nconsequences we would have had on these cars had we not had a cash for \nclunkers program.\n  It is crazy, in this country, to intentionally destroy perfectly good \nautomobiles. It is nuts. It is not rational. Yet we have a program and \nwe are already doing it. In Oklahoma we had a car that was traded in \nthat had 10,000 miles on it. They destroyed the engine on the car under \nthis program. Granted, it had poor gas mileage, but that was \ntransportation to somebody who was poor, transportation to somebody who \ndid not have transportation.\n  We have been debating health care around here for 6 months. The \nbiggest limitation on access to health care in rural and poor \ncommunities is transportation, and we are going to take away an \nopportunity to give many of those people transportation. We are going \nto take it away. The schizophrenia of Washington continues to amaze me, \nand the lack of common sense that is associated with what we do.\n  I will make one final note. The reason this bill has problems, the \nreason the Transportation Department is having trouble with it is it \nnever went through a committee, never had multiple hearings, had not \nhad an oversight on what we were going to do, and it was done in such a \nshort period of time that we did not even allow the Transportation \nDepartment an effective amount of time to set it up so it would be \neffective and not wasteful.\n  If you hear any complaints from the dealers, it is they don't know \nwhere they stand on whether they are going to get paid. They have no \nclue right now because even though they filed paperwork, getting that \nmoney to them--what we are seeing is a lot of problems with unhappy \ncustomers right now at the dealers because the Transportation \nDepartment cannot be efficient in administering this program.\n  I conclude by noting that if this is the standard under which we are \ngoing to reenergize our economy, then we ought to apply the same \nstandard to every other industry. If we do, we will not be bankrupt in \n11 years, we are going to be bankrupt next year.\n  I want our auto companies to succeed. There is no question there are \nstimulatory benefits to what we are doing, but it is at a great cost. \nAs the Senator from New Hampshire noted, the net-net cost is $45,000 \nper net car that would not have been traded in. It is foolhardy.\n  I hope Members of the body will consider this amendment. I know they \nhave been instructed to not consider it.\n  I will reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I appreciate the concerns the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma has raised. One question I would have is, if the \namendment is adopted, would he in fact support a continuation of the \nprogram? Because he certainly made a number of other arguments in \nopposition, which I appreciate. I know those arguments as well. But I \nthink, given all those arguments, this really is about trying to stop \nthe program.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment. It would absolutely \nderail what has been the most effective stimulus to date for us. It is \nabout jobs, it is about helping small businesses.\n  With the concerns initially raised, some of the bureaucratic concerns \ninitially--I have to tell you that NHTSA has been working fast and \nfuriously in solving those problems. The National Association of \nDealers strongly supports continuing this. I do not think they would if \nthey believed it was not effective as a program.\n  Let me talk about the amendment specifically. It may be well \nintended, but there is no environmental benefit if the old vehicle is \nnot scrapped--No. 1. The temporary CARS Program is specifically \ndesigned to maximize gas savings for consumers. In fact, so far the \naverage savings is about $1,000, and for people in my State, that is a \nlot of money right now when you are pinching pennies and trying to keep \nthings going in your household. That has been an extremely important \npart of this.\n  It is important to talk about the fact that this is a very limited \nprogram. It is very limited in scope. The funding extension will enable \na replacement of less than .3 percent of the 250 million vehicles on \nthe road. It does not compete with charities. The amendment is \nunnecessary because people can donate the value of the voucher to \ncharity, if they want to. In fact, the voucher amount surpasses the \nvalue of the vehicle, so charities could actually receive more funds \nthrough a donation of the voucher, if someone wished to do that.\n\n  Also, the program, because it is temporary, does not affect long-term \ndonations. In fact, we have met and worked with charities, discussed \nthese issues,\n\n[[Page S8954]]\n\nbecause I strongly support the programs that have donations of \nautomobiles to charities for the very reasons the Senator from Oklahoma \ntalked about.\n  The reality is that there have been trends against donating cars in \nrecent years. It is not because of the CARS Program, I have to \nindicate; it is because of a tax treatment change that was made under \nthe Republican majority back in 2004 that has been a problem. If we \nwant help the charities with automobiles, we would fix the tax \ntreatment that was passed as part of the tax changes that were made \nunder the Republican majority.\n  Also, many charities have indicated to us that they have not seen a \ndrop in donations due to the program. What is most interesting is that \nwe talked to some who have said they have actually seen an increase due \nto the heightened awareness of car recycling, particularly in owners \nwho, after researching, find out they really do not qualify for the \nCARS Program but they are still looking to take advantage in some way \nof the deals that are out there on these great new vehicles, made in \nAmerica. I hope people are going to be doing everything with their \nvoucher to buy an American-made vehicle. The temporary program really \nhas given people the opportunity to go out and shop and take a look at \nwhat is out there.\n  Pat Jessup, the president of Cars 4 Causes, has said that, ``oddly \nenough,'' car donations are up this month. Oddly enough, car donations \nare up this month. She adds:\n\n       In fact, because of the increase in donations, Cars 4 \n     Causes has staffed up to handle the in-coming calls.\n\n  What a nice byproduct of all the awareness right now, of the \npossibilities going out and buying a new vehicle.\n  To continue quoting her:\n\n       Once the conversation about trading in or trading up or \n     donating a car gets going the car owner begins researching \n     possibilities, looking into tax deductions versus cash for \n     the trade-in. Also, some have found their car does not \n     qualify for the Cash for Clunkers Program, but while \n     researching they discover the tax advantages of donating a \n     vehicle. Then they call us.\n\n  I appreciate the concerns that have been raised, but, in fact, this \nprogram--raising awareness about the cars that are now available, the \nnew or more fuel-efficient automobiles that are available in car \ndealerships all across the country, the ability to use the Cash for \nClunkers Program, we are now seeing that other great programs where \nvehicles are donated to charities have actually gone up.\n  For that, among many other reasons, particularly because this \namendment would kill the CARS Program, I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nfour news articles published in the last week about how cash for \nclunkers has negatively impacted charities. This comes from the North-\nWest Cable News, Denver Post, Fox News, and nbc4.com.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            News Quotes on How Clunkers Is Hurting Charities\n\n\n                          northwest cable news\n\n       ``Cash for Clunkers'' hurting charities--\n       Some say the popular ``Cash for Clunkers'' program is \n     taking cash out of the hands of local charities.\n       Animal Services of Thurston County depends on donations of \n     up to $20,000 a year from Northwest Charity Donation Service. \n     It's a service that relies on donated cars. But since the \n     ``Clunkers'' program began, the source of funding is drying \n     up.\n       ``It's probably been at least a 40 to 50 percent drop in \n     donations that people can choose to go to a charity of their \n     choice from the area,'' said Thomas Jones, of Northwest \n     Charity Donation Service.\n       Charities are also concerned that, as more cars end up at \n     salvage yards, there will be fewer inexpensive used cars will \n     be available for working families.\n\n\n                              denver post\n\n       Charities fear pinch from ``clunkers'' program--\n       Area charities reliant on car donations for funding say the \n     government's ``cash for clunkers'' program might hurt them.\n       ``If the government is going to give them a chunk of change \n     for their clunker, then we're concerned that they're not \n     going to come to us any longer,'' said Meaghan Carabello of \n     Goodwill Industries Denver.\n       Last year, Goodwill and Cars Helping Charities, the third \n     party that takes in the donations and sells them, took in \n     1,900 and 3,000 donated cars, respectively.\n       For Goodwill, that translated to about $220,000 in revenue.\n\n\n                              foxnews.com\n\n       ``Cash for Clunkers'' puts the brakes on donations--\n       Riteway Charity Services in Sun Valley, Calif. turns \n     thousands of donated cars into money for local food banks, \n     homeless shelters and Boys and Girls clubs. They say the \n     recession put a dent in donations; they're down 30 percent \n     from last year.\n       Now the car rebate program has really put the brakes on, \n     leaving charities third in line. Charities can offer a tax \n     write-off as little as $500 next spring. But that just can't \n     compete with the program handing car buyers rebates of \n     between $3,500 and $4,500 for trading in their gas-guzzlers \n     for new, higher-mileage models.\n       The latest IRS figures show 300,000 cars were donated in \n     2005. And while the program may be a shot in the arm for \n     dealers, charities that rely on donated cars say Uncle Sam \n     has put them on life support.\n\n\n                               nbc4i.com\n\n       Cash for Clunkers could impact local charities--\n       Charitable groups count on the money they make from donated \n     cars to help fund their programs. Now, the groups are afraid \n     that donations are going to dry up.\n       Officials at Goodwill said they are worried that the Cash \n     for Clunkers program will make people choose cash over \n     charity and close the door on an opportunity to bring in \n     money for local programs.\n       ``When you pull 250,000 cars off the streets, maybe more, \n     there are cars that could end up in our lots and help low-\n     income buyers,'' Knowlton said.\n       ``Every single car is an opportunity. We love every car,'' \n     Hartley said.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I could be a whole lot more comfortable \nwith this bill if you told me there was not another one coming in a \nmonth. But the fact is, what we are doing is buying forward sales. \nEvery economist says that. Eighty percent of the sales that come in \nunder cash for clunkers--we are just moving up sales that were going to \nbe there anyway. There is nothing wrong with that as long as we say \nthere comes a point in time we are not going to do that.\n  I wonder if my distinguished colleague from Michigan would commit to \nthe body that we are not going to see another one of these bills in 2 \nmonths, 3 months, 4 months, or 5 months, we are going to subsidize the \npurchase of automobiles by stealing from our children in this country-- \nregardless of the economic benefit for one particular industry. Is \nthere an answer to that question? The fact that there is not an answer \nto the question means it is not going to stop with this one. As soon as \nthis next program stops, and as soon as we run through the money, the \nsales are going to go right back down.\n\n  Then our option is going to be: Well, we have to do another one and \nanother one because we are buying forward sales.\n  What we need is the health of the economy. I do not deny we need to \ninject the proper amount of fiscal stimulus, true fiscal stimulus, not \na government transfer payment, which is 60 percent of the stimulus bill \nthat was passed, but it is an interesting question: When does it stop?\n  If we are going to do it for automobiles, and let's say automobiles \nget healthy but the appliance industry does not, are we going to do it \nfor the appliance industry? How much more can we afford to borrow from \nour kids? Those are legitimate questions that need to be addressed.\n  I understand the depth and breadth of the difficulties the States in \nthe upper Midwest are feeling from this recession and especially the \nimpact on the automobile companies. I want to be cooperative. I want to \nsee them come out.\n  But it would certainly give us much less indigestion if we knew there \nwas truly going to be an end and not another of these Cash for Clunkers \nPrograms when the sales dribble right back down because all we did was \nstimulate forward sales into this sales period.\n  With that, I reserve the reminder of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. First, let my thank my friend from Oklahoma for raising \nsome of these questions which are entitled to be debated. We are not \nalone in having a Cash for Clunkers Program. Other countries, including \nGermany, have had these programs. So we are not designing something \nfrom scratch. All auto-producing countries that I know of in the world \nare fighting to have an\n\n[[Page S8955]]\n\nauto industry come out at the end of this recession.\n  Unless we take action in a number of ways, that is not going to \nhappen. So the Cash for Clunkers Program is based on a similar type of \nprogram in other countries, including Germany, where it has been very \nsuccessful.\n  It is not my intent--to answer the other part of his question--it is \nsurely not my intent that this program continue beyond this extension. \nNo one can give an assurance as to what is going to happen in the \nfuture with this body or other Members of this body or, indeed, with \nmyself. But it is not my intent that this be a continued program beyond \nthis extension. The reason it was so essential that we have this \nextension is it was such a successful program. It sold out so quickly, \nwe think our success actually overwhelmed us.\n  I don't believe, as the Senator from Oklahoma does, that people were \nbuying forward. I think maybe the opposite happened. By the way, I \nthink people may have been waiting until there was this kind of \nincentive because people are in desperate economic shape. Perhaps some \nof the people who knew there was going to be such a program may have \nheld back in buying a vehicle.\n  But also the other prong of this program, besides the economic boost \nit gives to the economy overall, is the environmental part. That is the \npart which the Senator's amendment does not address. It is intended to \nget clunkers off the road, not just to get an economic stimulus into \nthe auto area for sales of vehicles that benefit not just producers but \ncar dealers and suppliers, but there is also a huge environmental \nbenefit which has not only proven itself, but done much better than \nanybody could have expected.\n  That is ignored by the Senator's amendment, because keeping those \ncars on the road, as the Senator would do, denies the environmental \nbenefit of the Cash for Clunkers Program. That is another reason I \nwould oppose the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. COBURN. Is it not true that the average plants were down for 10 \nweeks?\n  Mr. LEVIN. I do not know the number.\n  Mr. COBURN. Maybe 10 weeks. I know Chrysler was down longer than \nthat. The fact is, when I drive by the auto dealers, and when I check \nthe statistics with NHTSA, inventories are low.\n  So we are going to put $2 billion back out, when inventories are at \nhalf the level on the car lots of what they normally are. So if, in \nfact, you pass this, you might ought to spread it out over a period of \ntime so the factories can get the cars to the dealers because that is a \nsignificant worrisome part on a lot of my dealers--that if you bring it \nback now, and you bring it back, we are not going to have the cars to \nsell them.\n  I did make a note before, I say to the chairman. He is my chairman. I \nget along with him great. I have great admiration for him. I am glad \nOklahoma does not have any car manufacturing plants right now. I can \ntell you that. But I did make a point that it takes 153 billion BTUs to \nmake a Toyota Prius. You have to drive that car, on average, 2 years \nbefore you are ever at break-even.\n  So if you take a used car--and this program does not apply to used \ncars, right? It applies only to new cars. If you take a used car and \ncompare it to a car of similar size, you are at least 2\\1/2\\ years \nbefore you ever get the first benefit, in terms of green, 2\\1/2\\ years.\n  So we may see a difference in those, but in terms of BTUs consumed, \nit is 2\\1/2\\ years before you see the first change in terms of carbon \nfootprint under this program. Ultimately, I would admit to you there is \na carbon benefit to it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. In response to the Senator, I think that same point is \ntrue with the purchase of any new car.\n  Mr. COBURN. Yes, it is true.\n  Mr. LEVIN. But the faster we get the more fuel-efficient cars, the \nbetter environmental impact we are going to have, even though there is \nthat time period, obviously, when there is a carbon footprint that \nresults from the production of the new car.\n  But you get to that 2\\1/2\\ years faster then if you buy that new car \nnow than if you buy it a year from now or 2 years from now.\n  Mr. COBURN. Well, 2 years from now, it is going to have 4 or 5 miles \nbetter mileage.\n  Mr. LEVIN. It may. We do not know that.\n  Mr. COBURN. I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Alabama is recognized.\n  Mr. SHELBY. Madam President, 1 week after commencing the $1 billion \nCash for Clunkers Program, it is so popular that it has used up all its \nfunds.\n  Could it be that through this program, which entices car buyers with \nup to $4,500 to trade in their old cars, the government has finally \ndevised a smart way to stimulate the economy?\n  In a word, no.\n  Instead, the Federal Government has sent another $1 billion of \ntaxpayer funds into the economic abyss with $2 billion of taxpayers' \nfunds to follow.\n  It has robbed Peter to pay Paul, to give a kickback to the automotive \nindustry.\n  Advocates of the Cash for Clunkers Program state the additional $2 \nbillion in funding is necessary because the program is such a great \nsuccess.\n  Of course it is. Who does not want free money?\n  The Cash for Clunkers Program is simply another bailout to prop up a \nstruggling industry wrapped in the political guise of an \nenvironmentally friendly program.\n  While I agree that there are benefits to getting older, less fuel-\nefficient vehicles off the road, do not be fooled. That is not even \nwhat this program accomplishes.\n  Let me explain.\n  Under the Cash for Clunkers Program, it does not matter how big a \ndifference in gas mileage there is between the car you are trading in \nand the car you are buying.\n  The trade-in must only meet the 18 miles per gallon requirement to be \nconsidered a clunker.\n  After that, environmental concerns end.\n  As a result, under the Cash for Clunkers Program, replacing an 18 \nmiles per gallon vehicle with one that offers 22 miles per gallon gets \na subsidy.\n  But you do not receive any Federal funds if you replace a 19 miles \nper gallon vehicle with one that gets 40 miles per gallon.\n  If improving gas mileage is the goal, then a sliding scale that \nadjusted the subsidy with the difference in gas mileage between old and \nnew cars would seem reasonable.\n  Or if reducing emissions from older cars is the objective, the \nsubsidy could be larger for trading in older vehicles.\n  The Cash for Clunkers Program does not do either.\n  So, if there are no significant environmental benefits, then the goal \nmust be to help stimulate the economy.\n  Yet the program has done little to actually stimulate the economy.\n  Many of the individuals taking advantage of the program's subsidies \nare not new car buyers spurred by this incentive package, but instead \nthose who put their purchase on hold waiting for the program to launch.\n  Simply put, these buyers would have bought the car anyway.\n  Edumunds.com, a noted online site for car sales, stated this number \ncould be over 100,000 car buyers.\n  Further, Edmunds also published an analysis showing that in any given \nmonth, 60,000 to 70,000 ``clunker-like'' deals happen with no \ngovernment program in place.\n  Therefore, the 200,000 deals the government was originally prepared \nto fund through the Cash for Clunkers Program were likely the natural \n``clunker'' trade-in rate.\n  This program squeezed months of normal activity into just a few days.\n  When the backlog is met, interest in the program will fade, and the \nfacade of economic benefit will disappear.\n  The Cash for Clunkers Program is a shell game of transferring wealth \nfrom the pockets of one taxpayer to another.\n  We should call it what it really is, another billion dollar auto \nbailout.\n  This program is little more than a clunker itself.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2303\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent to call up Vitter amendment No. \n2303 to the pending legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n\n[[Page S8956]]\n\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 2303.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n\n                           amendment no. 2303\n\n(Purpose: To provide for a date certain for termination of the Troubled \n                         Asset Relief Program)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. TERMINATION OF TARP.\n\n       Section 120 of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of \n     2008 (12 U.S.C. 5230) is amended--\n       (1) by striking subsection (b); and\n       (2) by striking ``(a) Termination.--''.\n\n  Mr. VITTER. I urge bipartisan support of the Vitter amendment. It is \nvery simple and straightforward but important. It ends the TARP bailout \nprogram on a date certain, the date certain originally set out, which \nis December 31 of this year.\n  Under the TARP bailout legislation, the program is supposed to end on \nthat date. However, there was some fine print. The fine print said the \nTreasury Secretary unilaterally can say: No, we need to extend it. On \nhis own, with no additional vote of Congress, he can extend it until \nOctober 3, 2010.\n  I think any such extension would be absolutely contrary to the best \ninterests of the Nation, and I believe we should act and simply take \nthat extension authority back and wind down the program and end the \nprogram, the bailout, in an orderly way on the original intended date \nof December 31 of this year.\n  I think we should do this for three clear reasons. First of all, the \nbiggest reason is simply the TARP bailout program was rushed through \nCongress in what was described as an impending and indeed a cataclysmic \ncrisis. We were told by several experts certainly, including the \nTreasury Secretary and the Chairman of the Federal Reserve, that the \nfinancial system was in imminent danger of collapsing. I am not \nexaggerating. I am simply repeating their statements from last fall.\n  So Congress, certainly over my objection, passed the TARP bailout \nprogram in that atmosphere of absolute crisis. Well, we may disagree \nabout where we are getting toward recovery and what we see for the next \nyear. But I think we can all agree that imminent collapse, if it was \never before us, is not before us now; that huge so-called cataclysmic \ncrisis, if it was ever a threat, has passed. So the whole rationale for \nthe extraordinary $700 billion TARP bailout program, that crisis, has \nclearly passed.\n  Again, I am not saying we are out of this recession. I am not saying \nwe are not in tough economic times. I am not saying we do not have a \nlot further to go in recovery. I am saying no one believes the world \nfinancial system is in imminent danger of collapse or will be, \nthankfully, anytime soon.\n  Clearly, the entire rationale for such an extraordinary and \nunprecedented use of government power and intervention and the use of \n$700 billion of taxpayer funds, that rationale has passed.\n  Reason No. 2 is that the TARP bailout, in practice, has become \nnothing more than a political slush fund and has been used in many \ndifferent ways, never as it was originally designed.\n  Of course, we all heard, when it was originally proposed, that it was \na toxic asset purchase program; it would be used for one purpose and \none purpose only--for the government to buy toxic assets to get them \noff the balance sheets of troubled financial institutions. That was the \nsum and substance, 100 percent of the original design and rationale. As \nwe all know, it never was used in that way. Literally within a few \nweeks of Congress passing the program last fall, it morphed completely. \nWe weren't going to use it to buy toxic assets anymore. Then it morphed \ninto an equity investment program for the largest banks that were \ndeemed too big to fail. That, of course, has been carried out to the \ntune of not just $700 billion but trillions of dollars, as this money \nis constantly reprocessed.\n\n  Next TARP was morphed again and used as a slush fund to bail out two \nauto companies. Specifically, the administration--at the time, the Bush \nadministration--said: No, TARP is not about manufacturers, auto \ncompanies, at all. It is not about that. It is about financial \ninstitutions. Nevertheless, it was morphed again, used as a slush fund \nto bail out two auto companies. And there are many different, smaller \nprograms which have been devised and funded out of the TARP bailout \nslush fund.\n  TARP has been consistently used by the government for whatever \ndifferent purpose, whatever new bright idea the administration--first, \nthe Bush administration and now the Obama administration--decides is a \ngood thing to do. It has truly become a slush fund, open-ended, no \nlimits, that the administration can use pretty much however it wants. \nThere doesn't seem to be any real or meaningful limitation. So far the \noriginal $700 billion program has grown to reach $3 trillion. That is \nbecause some money is paid out. It is paid back in. It is reprocessed.\n  According to SIGTARP, the group that monitors this, the total \nfinancial exposure of TARP and TARP-related programs, when we look at \nall of the myriad activities, may reach $3 trillion.\n  Third and finally, the third important reason we should establish \nthis date certain to wind down the TARP bailout slush fund is that from \nthe very beginning, TARP has not been transparent. It has been very \nopaque. It has been ripe for fraud. Unfortunately, there are numerous \npieces of evidence and media accounts to bear this out. For instance, \non July 21, Neil Barofsky, special inspector general for the TARP \nprogram, issued a quarterly report to Congress. In it, he said: As of \nJune 30, there are 35 ongoing criminal and civil investigations about \nmisuses of money; Federal felony charges against Gordon Grigg, FTC \naction against misleading use of MakingHomeAffordable.gov, and on and \non.\n  In its quarterly report issued in July, SIGTARP said that the \nTreasury ``has repeatedly failed to adopt recommendations that SIGTARP \nbelieves are essential to providing basic transparency and fulfill \nTreasury's stated commitment to implement TARP `with the highest degree \nof accountability and transparency possible.' ''\n  Specifically, SIGTARP had four key recommendations, and they have not \nbeen implemented in any meaningful way.\n  The Vitter amendment is very simple, very straightforward. Let's \nabide by the original end date for the TARP bailout fund--December 31 \nof this year. Let's take back the unilateral authority the Secretary of \nthe Treasury now has to extend that to October 3 of 2010, for three \nsimple reasons: No. 1, there is no impending crisis anymore; No. 2, \nTARP has been used as a slush fund for everything under the Sun except \nthe original purpose of buying troubled assets; and No. 3, TARP has \nnever been transparent, open, and aboveboard. It is rife with fraud and \nmisuse, unfortunately, documented by criminal prosecutions, IG reports \nand the like.\n  I urge my colleagues, Democrats and Republicans, to support this \nreasonable amendment.\n  I retain the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2306\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I want to address this amendment for a \nmoment, and I want to set the stage for the amendment. This amendment \nwas first offered by myself and others in January of 2008. It is an \namendment that would provide a $15,000 income tax credit to a family \nthat purchases and occupies as their home any single-family dwelling in \nthe United States, regardless of their age, their income, or their \nState. Six months later, in the middle of 2008, the Finance Committee \ndid pass a $7,500 tax credit which was an interest-free loan, trying to \nincentivize first-time home buyers to come to the market. But because \nit was a loan, it didn't do anything. So in December of last year, we \nchanged it to an $8,000 tax credit for only first-time home buyers with \nincomes less than $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for couples.\n  It has worked. In fact, if we look at sales figures from January \nthrough through July, we will find that entry-level housing, that \nhousing under $180 to $200,000, has actually begun to recover. But if \nwe examine the marketplace, we find terrible numbers, such as the \nfollowing: 47 percent of all the homes in the United States of America \nare worth less than what is owed upon them. That is a tragedy. Worst of \nall,\n\n[[Page S8958]]\n\nin the month of June, 57 percent of all sales in America were \nforeclosures or short sales; 43 percent were arm's-length sales. The \nhousing market continues to flounder. Values continue to decline, and \nequities continue to dissipate.\n  This amendment is added to the cash for clunkers bill for a very \nimportant reason. As Senators Stabenow and Levin will tell us, the up-\nto-$4,500 incentive to buy a new, fuel-efficient car by trading in an \nold gas-guzzling car worked. It worked so well that in 1 week the money \ndisappeared.\n  That demonstrates what I have known all my life. Positive incentives \ncause positive results. The problem is, though, it was not the \nautomobile market that disappeared first in America. It was the \ncollapse of housing in the last quarter of 2007, which accelerated in \nearly 2008, which pulled away the equity, reduced the amount of credit \nfolks had and caused car loans to go bad and people to not buy cars. \nThe only way we will ever turn the U.S. economy around is to return the \nbiggest engine of the U.S. economy and that is the construction \nindustry and single-family construction and single-family homes.\n  Right now we are stagnant. The problem is not with first-time buyers. \nIt is with move-up buyers. It is the fellow who has transferred from \nAtlanta, GA to Hartford, CT who can't sell the house in Atlanta because \nthere is no buyer for it and can't buy a house in Connecticut because \nhe doesn't have the equity out of Atlanta. This tax credit does not \ntake other people's tax money and give it to you to buy a house. It \ngives you a credit against the taxes that you owe. Rather than buying a \ndepreciable asset such as a car, you are buying an appreciable asset \nsuch as real estate. It has a multiplier effect.\n  When we offered this amendment last year, it was estimated by one \neconomist that it would create 700,000 sales in one year and 685,000 \njobs. If there is anything America needs, it is just that. So just as \ncash for clunkers has demonstrated that positive rewards can cause \npositive actions on behalf of the consumer, so too would the tax credit \ndo the same.\n  By the way, the cost of this credit is estimated by CBO at $34.2 \nbillion. In January of 2008, they said that is too much money. Since \nthen, we have spent $85 billion on AIG, $700 billion on TARP, $787 \nbillion on a stimulus, and we are still floundering; and $34 billion \nsounds like a pretty cheap price to address what is the principle \nproblem in the economy. This amendment says it is paid for. The \nSecretary of the Treasury is authorized to transfer from the stimulus \nmoney to the Internal Revenue Service the claims to cover the tax \ncredits filed by homeowners when they pay their taxes for the houses \nthey have purchased.\n  Finally and most importantly, there is a rude awakening coming in \nAmerica, and it is coming on November 30, 2009. That is when the \nexisting tax credit for first-time home buyers goes away. The last \nincentive for an arm's-length sale will have disappeared. If we think \nwe have economic difficulties now, wait until that happens. But with \nthis amendment, we take, from the date of its passage 1 year ahead, \nwhich would be sometime in August of next year, a $15,000 nonmeans-\ntested credit to replace the $8,000 means-tested credit.\n  If the economists are right--not me--it will do the one thing the \nU.S. economy desperately needs. It will generate a legitimate housing \nmarket. Values will stabilize. We will reflate in the value of homes. \nPeople will buy more cars because of that than they will because of \ncash for clunkers. So we want to take the evidence of the success of \nthis program, take what we already know has worked in a means-tested \nmanner in first-time home buyers, and apply it to every American, \nbecause every American is suffering in this economy. Every American \ndeserves us to look for positive incentives to bring the economy back, \nrestore their equity, improve their value, and return us to a vibrant \neconomy. I hope the men and women of the Senate will adopt this \namendment.\n  To those who are going to say, we can't do it because the House is \ngone, I ask this question: If we were talking about health care and one \nbody had passed it, the House would be back here in a New York minute. \nThey could come back in a hurry, and we know it.\n  Restoring our economy is important. Recovering the equity of our \nhomes is important. Repaying the American people for the dissipation of \nour marketplace is important. The home buyers tax credit will do it. I \nurge my colleagues to vote yes on the Isakson amendment.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2303\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise to address the Vitter amendment. \nThe Senator from Louisiana has offered an amendment that would end the \nso-called TARP program on December 31 of this year and remove the \nSecretary of the Treasury's discretion to extend the deadline until \nOctober of next year. I can understand why that might be a popular \nidea, but I think it is important to point out that we are far from \nbeing out of the woods in terms of the economic difficulties we face. \nMembers don't need to hear that from me. We still have about 20,000 \npeople a day losing their jobs. We have around 10,000 people a day \ngetting foreclosure notices on their homes. We know there is still an \nemerging problem with commercial real estate that has yet to be \naddressed. It is looming out there and demanding some attention. The \nhousing market is stagnant, even though there have been Herculean \nefforts offered by our colleague from Georgia, who just spoke, for \nfirst-time home buyers on which I joined him to provide some incentives \nfor people to move forward, including his most recent proposal. Losses \non bank balance sheets are increasing still despite the fact that there \nare very positive signs.\n  I don't deny that, in fact, there seems to be an improvement, an ever \nso slight improvement in the right direction. But at this juncture, \nanyone who can say there is no longer any reason for us to take what \nfunds remain within the TARP program, this is not adding to the \nfunds. This is merely a question of whether the program ought to be \nterminated at the end of this year or extended for about 7 or 8 months \ninto next year.\n\n  I urge my colleagues not to, at this juncture--without anyone being \nclairvoyant--anyone who sits here and tells you there is no longer any \nneed for this, I do not think is listening very carefully or watching \nvery carefully what is occurring in the economy.\n  So while we would all like the crisis to be behind us, and we would \nall like to stand here and say there is no longer going to be any need \nfor any of these additional funds within the TARP program as they \nexist, I do not know of any one of us who could say with certainty what \nthe future holds.\n  I believe it is very important we have this authority extended beyond \nthe 31st of December into October of next year to give us the \nopportunity to respond, should we need to, with some additional support \nto various sectors of our economy that could help us avoid what we have \navoided so far; and that is, a deepening and further economic crisis.\n  With that, when the vote occurs on the Vitter amendment, offered by \nour colleague from Louisiana, I would urge our colleagues to reject \nthis amendment, not because we do not want to end the program--we do--\nnot because we are in favor of more resources going to TARP. That would \nbe a hard vote. This merely says: Does the program get to extend beyond \nthe 31st of December of this year? There is no request here for \nadditional funding--merely having the funds that exist and to extend it \nfor another 8 or 10 months to give us the opportunity to respond, \nshould the facts require it.\n  I do not think we want to look back, in January or February, and have \nto go back through reigniting or starting all over again another \nprogram, given the difficulties I think we would face trying to achieve \nthat result. It is better to keep the program that has been in place \nand has been working and which has made a difference over these past \nmany months than to abandon the program at this juncture when the \nprogram very well may be needed.\n  With those thoughts in mind, I would urge our colleagues at the \nappropriate time to reject this amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S8959]]\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I also rise in opposition to the \nVitter amendment.\n  First of all, this amendment, as my distinguished colleague has \nindicated, would limit the government's options in dealing with the \nfinancial crisis by prohibiting and restricting the extension \nauthority. It would take away a very important option at this time that \nwe should be retaining and, frankly, send the wrong signals to the \nmarkets when our markets are so fragile.\n  At a time when we are beginning to see small signs of improvement, \nsmall signs--and we will not see real signs until people have jobs and \nare working again--but restricting the administration's ability to \nstabilize the financial markets is dangerous and it is \ncounterproductive to our economic growth.\n  Unfortunately, this amendment would actually undercut one of the most \neffective programs to help the economy we have seen. We know, as we \nhave said before, if there are any amendments that are adopted, then \nthis effectively kills the CARS Program.\n  So for a multitude of reasons, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this \nparticular amendment.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, will my colleague yield for a moment?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I inquired--and I appreciate the Senator's \ncomments--I inquired how much in resources are remaining in the TARP \nprogram. I suspect it is a question where my colleagues would like to \nknow what remains or what has come back. As a result of a number of \nfinancial institutions having paid the money back, I am now told we \nhave something around $170 billion left in the TARP program or that is \nwhat remains of the $700 billion. There is every anticipation there \nwill be resources continuing to flow back in.\n  So I want to provide some assurance to our colleagues that I do not \nsee any circumstance in which, at this juncture, there would be a \nrequest for additional TARP funds. I think that is probably on people's \nminds. So by extending the program into October of next year, it is \nvery important my colleagues understand we are not asking for any \nadditional funds. The funds that are in the program and that will come \nback could be used--hopefully will not need to be used--for any \nemergency that occurs after December 31. But there are adequate \nresources there that should make it unnecessary for this body to come \nback and to seek additional funds in the TARP program. I think it is an \nimportant point to make for our colleagues.\n  Madam President, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, it was my great pleasure to yield and \nit is a very important point to raise and I appreciate the \ndistinguished chairman of the Banking Committee for his comments, as he \nhas led us on so many of these issues to bring us out of an incredibly \ndifficult economic situation for the country.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2306\n\n  Madam President, I also wish to speak, briefly, on the Isakson \namendment, which I happen to support. At other times, in other places, \nI absolutely agree we need to continue to jump-start the housing \nmarket. I think we have seen that the $8,000 first-time home buyer tax \ncredit has been a positive. I support expanding that.\n  When we look at what families choose to purchase, what their biggest \npurchases are, for most families it is their home and it is their \nautomobile. We have actually modeled the CARS Program after the same \nkind of argument that caused the Congress and the President to support \nthe stimulus, the $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit. I think we \nought to seriously look at ways to expand that, and I very much \nappreciate the leadership of the Senator from Georgia on this issue.\n  But the reality is, if we were to adopt this amendment to help those \nwho are interested in buying a home, we would hurt people who need to \nbuy an automobile and the stimulus that has worked so well, so quickly, \nin the CARS Program.\n  So I would ask for a ``no'' vote on this particular amendment simply \nbecause, at this point in time, we know what this is all about. Let's \nface it. We know what is happening here. Those who are opposed to the \nunderlying bill, to the CARS Program, know if there are any amendments \nthat are adopted, then the entire program will be ended. It will be \ndone.\n  We are hearing from auto dealers all across the country, as well as \nconsumers, as well as those who provide the materials for automobiles--\nwe have heard from the steel industry, we have heard from the aluminum \nindustry, we have heard from those who benefited from advertising, we \nhave heard from all those in the long line of people who benefit from \nthe auto industry and manufacturing in this country--that this has \nworked in stimulating the economy, getting people back into showrooms.\n  Even if people do not qualify for the program, they get back into the \nshowroom, and they look around at these great automobiles. I should \nsay, a lot of them are made in Michigan. We look for those. But the \nreality is, there are great automobiles that are out there now, and \npeople are taking this time to go in and to shop and buy automobiles, \neven if they are not part of the program.\n  So we are hearing from dealers all across the country talking about \nthe success of this program. It is something for consumers, something \npeople can see that is tangible. It is not just a debate about what \nmight happen sometime in the future, but it is about right here, right \nnow, how do we help consumers?\n  The added benefit, as we know, is that because we said you need to \nbuy a more fuel-efficient vehicle, we are seeing, in fact, the fuel \neconomy go up, savings go up. We are told right now the average vehicle \nthat is being turned in gets a little bit above 15 miles per gallon; \nand people are buying vehicles that are getting a little under 25 miles \nper gallon. That is about $1,000 back in somebody's pocket saved on \ngasoline. And, boy, wouldn't we all like to have $1,000 back in our \npockets right now as a result of a stimulus program that supports \npeople's efforts to get into a more fuel-efficient vehicle? This has \nbeen a winner on every front.\n\n  We know, at this point in time--after the quick action in the House \nof Representatives last Friday when it became clear the initial funding \nwas going to be running out--we have known since then, with the House \ngone, the opportunity to continue this program depends upon our \nwillingness to step up and support the House bill without changes. We \nall know that.\n  I would challenge anyone offering an amendment, if their amendment is \npassed, does that mean we have their vote on the underlying bill? \nBecause that would be a great concern of mine. At the moment, I think \nwhat we have are ideas that are good and ideas that are not that are \nbeing offered. But everybody knows, in the end, any amendment that is \nadopted, no matter how well intended--and I know there are well-\nintended efforts, good ideas, good ideas such as the Isakson amendment, \nwhich in another venue I have supported and will support--but right \nnow, on this bill, if we make any changes, we are saying to every small \nbusiness dealer, every dealer across the country: We don't care whether \nthis has worked, we don't care whether this is effective, we don't want \nto support you, and we don't want to continue it. We are saying the \nsame thing to consumers. We are saying the same thing to those who care \ndesperately about the auto industry and manufacturing in this country.\n  So I am very hopeful we will reject all the amendments that are in \nfront of us. On those I support, in terms of the substance, I look \nforward to working with colleagues in the future, to come back in other \nways to put forward these ideas. There are certainly very good ideas \nthat have been put forward, as well as ideas that I do not believe are \npositive.\n  But right now the only question in front of us is: Do you support the \nCARS Program? Do you support the small business dealers across this \ncountry? Do you believe this economic stimulus should be continued--an \neconomic stimulus that has worked so well?\n  I have to say, in closing, I have said before, my father and my \ngrandfather were auto dealers back in the days of Oldsmobile, which \ndates me. But I know what it was like growing up in a small town where \nthis dealership was so important in terms of employment, in terms of \nsupporting the community,\n\n[[Page S8960]]\n\nand all that was going on. I know how hard they worked.\n  My first job was washing cars on the car lot. I understand all that \ngoes into a family-owned business and how much our dealers care about \ntheir community, about their business, about their employees. This is \nabout them. This is about supporting people who support their \ncommunities, who create jobs, who have had a very, very, very tough \ntime in this economy.\n  Here we have the great opportunity to support something, not based on \nfaith, not based on some intellectual argument but based on the fact it \nis working. So I would urge all my colleagues to vote no on the \namendments and to join us in extending, as we go into the August \nrecess, a very important and effective stimulus for the American \neconomy.\n  Thank you very much, Madam President.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, how much time is left in opposition to \nthe Isakson amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. A full 15 minutes.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent--I am not sure \nwho controls the time in opposition--that I be allowed to use 3 minutes \nof that time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, the Isakson amendment is an example of an \namendment which is not only well intended but an amendment that I \nhappen to favor and have favored on a number of occasions on this \nfloor.\n  One of the problems, though, is it is very clear we have a choice \nbefore us. We are either going to have an extension of the Cash for \nClunkers Program, with passage of the House bill without any changes in \nit, or it is going to die. Passage of the Isakson amendment is not only \nwell intended, but as good an amendment as it is, it will defeat both. \nWe cannot get the Isakson amendment passed into law by adopting it \nhere. It would be added to a bill which is going to go nowhere except \nto a House which has been adjourned. And we cannot keep this Cash for \nClunkers Program going unless we adopt the House bill today.\n  If we leave without adopting the House bill or amending the House \nbill, it is the end of the most successful program we have seen in the \nstimulus package. That is the choice. So adopting the Isakson amendment \ndoes not get us where Senator Isakson wants us to get, and it destroys \nthe Cash for Clunkers Program extension.\n  It has been a highly successful program, probably the most successful \nof any of the stimulus packages, at least to date. We are put in a \nposition--a number of us--of voting against these amendments, \namendments, for instance, as well intended as is the Harkin \namendment. Voting against an amendment such as that is difficult, we \nknow that, but we did it a week ago. We had to do it when the highway \ntrust fund came up. We had to vote against an amendment which most of \nus, I believe, favored, which would have produced money for our States, \nin order to have a bill passed without any amendment so that we could \nget it done because the House was about to adjourn. So we were put in \nthat position. It is not unusual around here that we are put in this \nposition. It is a fact of life around here. It is not hard to explain \nback home why we had to do this.\n\n  So if we favor the cash for clunkers extension, we have to vote \nagainst every amendment. There cannot be a change. There cannot be a \nperiod, a comma, a word, a paragraph changed in the House bill. If \nthere is, it is the death knell for this very successful program.\n  So I hope we will vote against all amendments. Some of them are very \ndifficult to vote against. Some of the amendments we may have voted for \nbefore, including the Isakson amendment. Some like the amendment of \nSenator Harkin, which is such a well-intended amendment. It has other \ncomplications to it, by the way, which would require it being modified, \nI believe, if it were going to have the effect that is intended, which \nwould require regulations to be adopted, and that would take so long in \nany event that holding up the cash for clunkers bill for that to happen \nwould also be the death knell for this bill that is so valuable.\n  So I yield the floor.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I would just let all Senators know that \nwe are working to probably move to the votes fairly shortly, as soon as \nwe get a unanimous consent agreement. So at this time I would suggest \nthe absence of a quorum.\n  Mr. GREGG addressed the Chair.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Senator withhold her request?\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I withhold.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to include \nadditional cosponsors to my amendment: Senator Alexander, Senator \nCorker, Senator Cornyn, and Senator Enzi.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote \nsequence with respect to the pending amendments be the following, and \ncommence once this agreement is entered, with no further debate except \nas specified below:\n  Harkin amendment No. 2300, Kyl amendment No. 2301, Gregg amendment \nNo. 2302, Coburn amendment No. 2304, Vitter amendment No. 2303, and \nIsakson amendment No. 2306; that the previous order with respect to 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided and controlled in the usual form, \nprior to each vote, and vote time limitation, after the first vote \nremaining in effect; further that upon disposition of the pending \namendments, the bill, as amended, if amended, be read a third time, and \nthe Senate proceed to vote on passage of the bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 2300\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I believe the pending amendment is the \nHarkin amendment, and he has 1 minute.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I have an amendment to my amendment that \nI send to the desk. I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed to make a \nmodification to my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. LEVIN. Reserving the right to object, and I will object for \nreasons I have discussed with Senator Harkin, any amendment to this \nbill will end the bill. It is a death knell for the bill. The \nmodification also would have another delay even if it didn't kill the \nbill, even if it were passed and the House were able to adopt it. It \nrequires regulations to be adopted which would take time. It would be a \nstopping and starting of the program. It would create a great deal of \nconfusion.\n  This is an extremely well-intended amendment. I give Senator Harkin a \nlot of credit for what he is aiming to do, but it cannot achieve its \npurpose the way it is drafted. The way it would be modified would take \na significant period of time to be modified. It would result in a stop-\nand-start situation of the Cash for Clunkers Program. So, reluctantly, \nI object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  The Senator has 1 minute on his amendment.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, in good faith last year, I tried to get \nthis in the bill and it didn't work. I tried it again with this \namendment. I was informed there was a problem with it, which I \nrecognized. I tried to again in good faith offer a modification to it. \nMy friend from Michigan is right; it does require some determinations \nby the Secretary which probably would take some time. I am not certain \nthat is all that much of a reason to not allow it.\n\n[[Page S8961]]\n\n  I still believe there should be an income cap. But the way the \namendment is now drafted, quite frankly, I couldn't even support it \nbecause it didn't do what I originally wanted to do. There was an error \nin drafting. I tried to amend it. I can't seem to get the job done \nbecause of the time constraint. There was an action on my amendment; \ntherefore under the rules, I have to have consent to get it modified.

Madam President, I believe the Kyl amendment is in \norder.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Who yields time?\n  Mr. KYL. Madam President, automobile dealers view this program a \nlittle like ``A Tale of Two Cities''--the best of times and the worst \nof times. They are selling more cars, but they don't know if they are \ngoing to get paid from the Cash for Clunkers Program because there has \nbeen no ability to track the sales. As a result, we don't know whether \nwe spent $1 billion, less than $1 billion, or more than $1 billion.\n  My amendment simply calls a timeout. It says if the amount of money \nexceeds $1 billion, then appropriate the amount of money that is needed \nto pay the obligations on the deals that have already been made and \nqualified. Then set up a process to track the money in such a way that \nwe can tell whether we have exceeded the next appropriated amount.\n  That is the essence of the amendment. It asks for a study to \ndetermine whether there should be one other change; namely, a change to \nthe particular fuel standard we are applying to the cars. Some believe \nit should be a slightly higher fuel standard.\n  I hope my amendment will be adopted to call a timeout, pay the \nobligations we have already made, and determine a method to track the \nmoney in the future so that if we do this again, we know exactly how \nmuch we have spent, the dealers can get paid, and the customers have \nthe assurance that their deal can go through.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time in opposition?\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I urge a ``no'' vote on this \namendment. This will stop this incredibly successful stimulus on \nSaturday. It will say to the 160,000 dealers all across this country \nthat we are not willing to support something that has brought people \ninto their showrooms. Whether qualifying for the CARS Program or not, \npeople are coming in and buying automobiles. We are talking about a \nstimulus. We are talking about jobs. We are talking about moving the \neconomy forward.\n  We all know if this amendment is adopted, or if any amendment is \nadopted the CARS Program will be ended. For those of us who believe it \nmakes sense for consumers, for business, for the economy, I ask for a \n``no'' vote.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, have the yeas and nays been ordered on \nthis amendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. They have.\n  The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Is there any time remaining in opposition?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President I believe that the Gregg amendment is in \norder.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Gregg amendment is the pending \nquestion.\n  The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, I don't happen to agree with this \nproposal, but what I certainly don't agree with--and I assume most of \nmy colleagues don't agree with--is that we should be paying for this by \nputting the debt on our children's backs. Yet that is exactly what is \ngoing to happen.\n  The chairman of the Appropriations Committee in the House has been \nvery forthright. He said he spoke to the White House, he spoke to the \nSpeaker, and he said the funds with which this program is being funded \nwere taken out of the stimulus, and what he is going to do is replenish \nthe stimulus. So we are essentially going to borrow twice to do this \nprogram, and both times we are borrowing from our kids.\n  My amendment simply enforces our ability to actually pay for this \nprogram, which is what we should do--No fig leaves, just a real \nexercise in actually paying for a program, rather than passing the bill \non to our kids, as we seem to do around here so regularly. I hope \npeople would vote for this amendment.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, this amendment would have an across-the-\nboard cut to the appropriations bill of $2 billion, including \nappropriations bills that have already passed. It is a recipe for chaos \nin the appropriations process. The pay-for is in the bill for this $2 \nbillion package.\n  In addition to all of that, any amendment to this bill will kill the \nprogram. So if you want to kill the program as well as create havoc in \nthe appropriations process, then you will vote for the Gregg amendment; \notherwise, you will vote no.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, I believe the Coburn amendment is the \nnext in order.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, this is a simple amendment. Rather than \nthrow great cars away, give them to poor people. One of the biggest \nproblems we have with rural health care and health care associated with \nour citizens of color in this country is the fact that they do not have \ntransportation to get their health care.\n  Under this bill, already we will destroy $500 million worth of good \nautomobiles. As we pass this bill we are going to destroy another $1 \nbillion worth of automobiles.\n  It would seem to me, since the charitable organizations are so good \nat utilizing these cars and we have such a need, especially with the \neconomic downturn we have, that we ought not be throwing them away and \nruining them. What we ought to be doing is giving them to those who \nhave greater need than those who are turning them back.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Michigan is \nrecognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Madam President, I again ask for a ``no'' vote. This \nwill kill the program. I think it is important to know, we have worked \nclosely with charities on this particular bill. We had some very \ninteresting comments come back. We have been told that some of the \ncharities are actually seeing increases in their own donations due to \nthe heightened awareness of car recycling.\n  To quote Pat Jessup, president of Cars 4 Causes, she has said, \n``oddly enough,'' car donations are up this month. ``In fact,'' she \nadds, ``because of the increase in donations, Cars 4 Causes has staffed \nup to handle the incoming calls.''\n  They indicated when people look, if they do not qualify for the Cash \nfor Clunkers Program, they are going on to discover the tax advantages \nof donating a vehicle. Then they are calling them.\n  This is a short-term stimulus. It is not affecting very important \ncharities. I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Washington is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Madam President, I raise a point of order that the \npending amendment violates section 201 of S. Con.

There will now be 2 minutes equally divided \nprior to a vote on the Vitter amendment No. 2303.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Mr. President, this amendment is very simple. It simply \nsays the TARP bailout fund will end when we originally said it would \nend: December 31 of this year. Under the original TARP bill, the \nTreasury Secretary has the authority to extend it another almost full \nyear, until October of 2010. We would take that authority away. We \nwould retain that responsibility and say we will wind down the TARP \nbailout fund at the end of this year.\n  Clearly, the crisis, the imminent collapse of the financial system, \nhas passed and is not before us. If we are serious about the bailout \nbeing temporary, being necessary because of truly unusual \ncircumstances, if we are serious about that, we will vote yes on this \namendment and end TARP at the end of this year in an orderly way.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, this amendment would terminate the program \nat the end of this year. While there are certainly very positive signs \nthat the economy is improving, all of us are painfully aware of how \nmuch further we have to travel before the economy is truly back on its \nfeet. The foreclosure rate and the unemployment rate are still \ntroubling.\n  This is not a request for additional money. There is about $170 \nbillion left in the TARP program. It would be premature and unwise for \nus to terminate a program without knowing yet that we have actually \ncome out of difficult times. I urge colleagues to reject this \namendment. What this does is sustain the program beyond December 31 of \nthis year into October of next year. Then, hopefully, we won't need \nthese resources. Hopefully, we won't have to use another nickel of this \nmoney. But I don't think we want to come back in February and March and \nall of a sudden have to restart a program such as this because we \nhaven't achieved all the success we would like in getting our economy \nback on its feet.\n  I say respectfully to my friend from Louisiana, I urge colleagues to \nreject the Vitter amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. VITTER. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

There is 2 minutes of \ndebate divided equally on the amendment.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Georgia.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, very simply, this is the amendment to \nhelp our economy recover. The Senator from Washington, the Senator from \nConnecticut, the chairman of the Banking Committee, are cosponsors of \nthe main bill. It provides a $15,000 tax credit for the purchase of any \nhome in America during the next 12 months. It will make the difference. \nIt does not do anything to the base bill.\n  For those who would say we cannot do it because the House is gone, we \ncan do anything if we want to. It is time we address the central core \nissue to our economy: the housing market.\n  I urge all my friends to support the Isakson amendment to provide the \n$15,000 tax credit.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, this is another well-intended amendment. It \nis an amendment, indeed, that many of us have voted for in a slightly \ndifferent form in a different place. However, it would represent the \ndeath knell for this program. So if you believe the Cash for Clunkers \nProgram is a successful program and should be extended, this amendment \nneeds to be defeated and raised at a different point.\n  We will not get the Isakson amendment into law by adopting it. All we \nwill do is stop the Cash for Clunkers Program from continuing. That \nseems to me to be the choice, which is a fundamental one. I hope we \ndefeat the Isakson amendment.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Mr. LEVIN.

On this vote, the yeas are 60, the nays are \n37. Three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and sworn having voted in \nthe affirmative, the motion is agreed to.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. Mr. President, I rise in support of the passage of the \nCar, Allowance Rebate System, CARS, commonly referred to as Cash for \nClunkers. CARS provides both a direct and indirect economic benefit to \nthe State of Ohio by supporting the manufacturing of automobiles, \nautomotive parts suppliers, and auto dealers, as well as the many \nbusinesses that support these companies. This program is providing \nvaluable jobs and much needed revenue--a direct stimulus--to the State. \nFurthermore, Ohio car buyers responded positively and Ohio has been one \nof the top recipients under the CARS program. That is why I am asking \nmy colleagues to reject amendments that would prevent the program from \noperating until September when the House of Representatives is \nscheduled to reconvene. If the Senate adopts even one amendment, the \nbill will be on hold until the mid-September. In some instances, if \nthese same amendments were considered as stand-alone legislation or as \namendments to other legislation, I may have supported them, but because \nthese amendments hold hostage the continuation of the CARS I will \noppose anything that would keep the Senate from transferring these \nfunds.\n  The Senate's decision to continue funding the cash for clunkers \nprogram will allow consumers to purchase new cars, delivering a real \neconomic stimulus to our Sates. As evidenced by the extraordinary \nresponse to the program thus far, this is a win-win. It provides much \nneeded jobs and resources to our states and promotes fuel efficient \ncars to benefit our environment, reducing our dependence on foreign \noil. I am thankful the additional $2 billion for this program is being \ntaken from the already-enacted stimulus bill, which I voted against \nearlier this year. Unfortunately, programs that would provide real \nstimulus like cash for clunkers and robust highway and infrastructure \ninvestments were not part of the original stimulus package. These types \nof direct tangible investments provide not only jobs through dealers, \nmanufacturers, and auto suppliers, but usable assets for taxpayers. I \nam hopeful that this program will continue to provide much-needed \nrelief to the Ohio's automotive manufacturers.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, auto jobs form the backbone of American \nmanufacturing, especially in the Midwest. Millions of Americans, and in \nmy home--state of Missouri more than 200,000 workers, depend on the \nauto industry for their livelihoods.\n  Unfortunately all of those jobs were at risk when the big three \ndomestic auto companies almost went completely under.\n  Recognizing the importance of this industry to our economy and \nmillions of workers, the government acted to protect these auto jobs.\n  One of those actions was to pass the Cash for Clunkers Program. I \nsupported this program because I thought it would help save thousands \nof jobs at auto dealers, parts plant, and assembly plants.\n  Also, this program was designed to help consumers with the cost of \nmore fuel-efficient cars and, ultimately, in the long-term benefit the \nenvironment with reduced exhaust emissions.\n  This is one government program that has actually exceeded everyone's \nexpectation.\n  Folks in Missouri and across the Nation have been flocking to once \nrather empty car lots.\n  In fact, there were tens of thousands of new car purchases made \nthrough the program after only a week.\n\n[[Page S8965]]\n\n  Cash for Clunkers has given a much needed jump-start to dealers and \nthe auto industry that have been suffering with the worst car sales in \nrecent history.\n  This program has benefitted consumers who would otherwise not be able \nto afford a new vehicle and has boosted small business dealers in rural \nand small communities across Missouri and the country.\n  It is not to say that the program, like most government-run programs, \nhas had an entirely smooth ride. I have heard from Missouri auto \ndealers who have been frustrated by government redtape, which has \nstalled some sales and created confusion among dealers and car buyers.\n  This uncertainty has rightfully caused some heartburn for dealers who \nare required under the program to provide funding up front for the \nconsumers and then must receive approval from the government before \nthey receive reimbursement. Redtape and delays due to inadequate \ngovernment resources to administer the program have left many dealers \nwondering if they will be left holding the bag.\n  I have been disappointed and dismayed to learn that the Department of \nTransportation does not know how many commitments have been made and \npaid for by dealers. Thus, we cannot even be sure that the existing \nprogram will have enough money the meet the commitments.\n  Under the legislation passed by the House, cash for clunkers would be \nextended and provided an additional $2 billion by using unspent funds \nfrom the so-called stimulus bill.\n  I say so-called because so far it has only stimulated the growth of \nthe deficit and the growth of government employment. Taking $2 billion \nfrom that program is the best way to see we get a boost to the economy, \nnow, when we need it.\n  Fully offsetting additional funding to extend the program is a \ncritical requirement to ensure that we are not adding to the growing \nFederal deficit.\n  I am very concerned about potential shell-games being reported in the \nmedia about Democratic leadership plans to backfill the stimulus bill \nin future appropriations.\n  To be clear, my support for extending cash for clunkers is contingent \nupon the program not adding to our deficit and that it be temporary, \nnot a bottomless pit for taxpayers.\n  The purpose of cash for clunkers was to jump-start the auto industry \nand provide immediate and temporary help to get consumers back on car \nlots, not to provide a long-term subsidy to the industry and, thus I \nwill not be supporting continued cash for clunkers.\n  While cash for clunkers has provided a simulative jolt to get people \nonto car lots again, we cannot hang our hats on this program and expect \nto have a lasting recovery. I remain concerned about the credit \nmarkets, continuing job losses, and the rising likelihood of higher \ntaxes and larger deficits under the spending plans proposed the, \nadministration.\n  Nevertheless, as a supporter of the initial $1 billion provided to \ncash for clunkers to jump-start the struggling auto industry, I believe \nthat the program should be extended one last time as long as it is \nfunded with unspent stimulus funds to ensure dealers are not on the \nhook for the cost of the rebates due to the government's management \nfailures.\n  This program was meant to jump-start, not subsidize, auto sales, so I \nsupport a one-time extension.\n  Also, it is critical that the Obama administration make sure that \nbureaucratic hiccups don't turn this program into a nightmare for our \ndealers and consumers.\n  The bottom line is that an extension paid for with unused stimulus \ndollars makes sense this one time since this program seems to have \nworked better then the misnamed Recovery Act.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to support this bill, which \nwill provide additional funding to the popular Consumer Assistance to \nRecycle and Save or CARS program. While not perfect, CARS has \nencouraged Americans to trade in their older and less fuel-efficient \nvehicles while boosting new car sales and helping to revive local \neconomies in Wisconsin and around the country, something that is sorely \nneeded in these difficult economic times.\n  CARS began almost 2 weeks ago and in that time, interest in CARS has \nfar exceeded most initial expectations for the program. Despite some \nproblems with implementation of the program, it should be temporarily \nextended to help ensure that Americans who still want to participate in \nthe program can do so, and that deals which have already been made in \nreliance on the program can go through. At the same time, I hope the \nDepartment of Transportation will listen to the concerns from car \ndealers and consumers and make improvements to help ensure CARS \noperates more smoothly in the coming weeks.\n  I am pleased that the Department of Transportation has fixed one \nproblem it created in implementing CARS. When Congress created the CARS \nprogram earlier this year, it fully intended to ensure that consumers \nacross the country who are in compliance with the statute's \nrequirements, including provisions related to car insurance, be allowed \nto participate in the CARS program. The Transportation Department \nissued a final rule almost 2 weeks ago that set the guidelines for the \nCARS program. This rule included a requirement that individuals who \nwanted to trade in their vehicles had to demonstrate proof of car \ninsurance for at least one year prior to the trade-in, a provision that \nconflicted with statutory language stating that a trade-in vehicle be \n``continuously insured consistent with the applicable State law.'' \nCurrently, Wisconsin and New Hampshire do not require individuals to \npurchase car insurance and it was estimated that Transportation's rule \nwould have affected up to 15 percent of Wisconsin drivers who legally \ndid not have car insurance, but were in full compliance with Wisconsin \nState laws.\n  I wrote to the Department of Transportation and spoke with Secretary \nLaHood to urge the Department to correct its misinterpretation of the \nCARS statutory language. I am pleased to have been joined in the effort \nby members of the Wisconsin and New Hampshire delegations as well as \nsome of the lead authors of the Cash for Clunkers program including \nSenator Stabenow and Representative Dingell. The Department listened to \nour concerns and, last week, it announced that it had reexamined the \nstatutory language of CARS and concluded that the initial rule it had \nissued unfairly penalized Wisconsin drivers who were in compliance with \nWisconsin law. The Transportation Department further announced that \ntrade-in vehicles in Wisconsin would be exempt from the 1-year \ninsurance requirement thereby ensuring that Wisconsinites who meet the \nlaw's other eligibility requirements can participate in the CARS \nprogram. While all Wisconsin drivers will be required to have car \ninsurance beginning in June 2010, this action by the Transportation \nDepartment is a sensible fix for Wisconsinites who are in compliance \nwith state law and who seek to participate in this temporary program.\n  Even with a number of Wisconsinites erroneously excluded from the \nprogram initially and some technical difficulties, as of August 5, \nseveral thousand Wisconsinites had participated in the program and \ndealers are expected to receive reimbursements for over $24 million \nthat they have credited to Wisconsinites buying new cars under this \nprogram. On a per capita basis, this level of requested vouchers places \nWisconsin fifth amongst all the States. Demand for the program remains \nstrong in Wisconsin and across the country and will soon completely \noutstrip the supply of vouchers currently available, which is why we \nneed to act to provide additional funding.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish today to support providing an \nadditional $2 billion to allow for the extension of the car allowance \nrebate system, CARS, otherwise known as cash for clunkers.\n  During the original debate on the cash for clunkers concept in the \nAppropriations Committee, proponents of the program promised that it \nwould have two major benefits. The first was that it would replace \nolder, less fuel-efficient cars with new models that are more fuel-\nefficient, thus helping the environment and decreasing our dependence \non imported oil. The second was that it would provide a much needed \nboost to plummeting auto sales in the United States.\n  The good news is that we now have hard data we can use to evaluate\n\n[[Page S8966]]\n\nwhether the program has lived up to its proponent's promises. And the \nvery good news is that clearly, it has. In fact, the program has \nexceeded expectations.\n  Based on approximately 184,000 dealer transactions that have so far \nbeen recorded by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, \nNHTSA, we know the following:\n  CARS transactions are generating a 60-percent increase in vehicle \nfuel economy. The average of the vehicles being turned in have a fuel \neconomy rating of 15.8 miles per gallon, while the average of the \nvehicles being sold have a fuel economy rating of 25.3 miles per \ngallon. This means the average CARS transaction is leading to an \nincrease in fuel efficiency of 9.5 miles per gallon. I think we can all \nagree that is a very significant improvement. How significant? The \nsavings in gas purchases alone are estimated to be $700 a year for the \ntypical consumer. Clearly, the CARS program has lived up to its promise \nto put more fuel-efficient cars on the road.\n  As for the second promise--that this program would provide a much \nneeded boost to automobile sales in the U.S.--the Washington Post \nreported the following on August 4: ``U.S. auto sales rose to their \nhighest levels of the year in July as consumers rushed to trade in \nolder vehicles under a government incentive program that has become so \npopular it is in danger of running out of money. Automakers issued \ntheir sales reports Monday, raising hope that the sagging auto industry \nis headed for a recovery, although some analysts cautioned that a \nturnaround would still be slow. Ford said its sales were up 2.4 percent \nover the same period a year ago, its first monthly increase in two \nyears. The automaker attributed much of the gain to the Cash for \nClunkers program, which allows consumers to receive rebates for turning \nin older cars for more fuel-efficient models.''\n  There can be no doubt that the CARS program is succeeding beyond \nexpectations. In fact, the program has been such a hit with the \nAmerican people that it has run out of funding much sooner than \nanticipated. The President has proposed, the House has passed, and I \nfully support, the reprogramming of $2 billion in Recovery Act funding \nto enable the extension of the CARS program.\n  With this extension, we can continue to put more fuel-efficient \nautomobiles on the road, which reduces pollution and our reliance on \nimported oil, and we can continue to provide a much needed boost to the \nauto industry, which helps the broader economy and saves jobs. At a \ntime when our economy is in need of a jump-start, cash for clunkers is \nan undeniable success. I urge my colleagues to join me in providing the \nadditional funding needed to continue this worthy program.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would like to make some observations \nabout the Consumer Assistance to Recycle and Save Program, more \ncommonly known as cash for clunkers.\n  When Congress first passed this program in June, I evaluated the \nmerits and the arguments and chose to support it, because I believed it \nwould provide a prompt shot in the arm to our ailing economy. I \ncontinue to believe that the program's goals of reducing the \nenvironmental impact of automobiles on the road and producing economic \nstimulus are good ones.\n  However as we debate whether to infuse this program with another $2 \nbillion I would urge that we be patient and wait until all the facts \nare in, before rushing forward with a tripling of the program's overall \ncost. Significant claims have been made about the average increased \nfuel economy and resulting financial savings that will result from car \npurchases made through the program. The administration has used these \nclaims to push for the program's expansion, yet Federal agencies have \nnot yet made available--to the American people and to the Congress--the \nappropriate data to support these claims.\n  If you have picked up a newspaper in the past few weeks, the sudden \npopularity of the program is clear. Newspaper headlines have \nconsistently noted the program is rapidly running out of money and that \ncar purchases are well above where they were at this time last year. In \nmy own State of Vermont, car dealers have reported having difficulty \nkeeping up with demand for new cars that meet the program's \nrequirements. But while we know that cars are moving off sales lots and \nonto the road, we have yet to receive enough details about the current \nsales data to know the true story of whether this program is working as \nintended.\n  Recent reports on the program have indicated that funding was about \nto run out, yet the number of actual car sales through the program was \nfar lower than the program allowed for. Further, many dealers have \nnoted that hundreds of thousands of dollars in program vouchers from \nthe government have yet to be paid. If this is in fact the case, we \nshould demand that the management of this program be ironed out before \npumping billions more into it. Are we sure that this the best way to \nspend $2 billion right now, if it is to be spent? There are many worthy \nand pressing purposes to which such significant sums could be \nallocated.\n  Positive indications about the direction of the economy are emerging. \nToday we learned that the number of Americans filing for unemployment \ndropped to its lowest level since January. The Cash for Clunkers \nProgram may prove to be a factor in helping our country emerge from \nthis recession, and I certainly hope that is the case.\n  But the public release of information about this car rebate program \nis necessary to ensure that both the Congress and the American people \ncan make well-informed judgments about the merits of continuing this \nprogram in these economically challenging times. If the administration \nis unwilling or unable to provide this information before the Senate \nvotes on additional funding, I will be unable to support the program's \nexpansion.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on passage of H.R. 3435.\n  The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we have one more vote. I appreciate \neveryone's cooperation. We have accomplished a great deal this whole \nwork period. This week has really been a productive one. I appreciate \neveryone's help. The Republican leader and I have worked hard to get it \nto this point on Thursday night at 8 o'clock. That is hard to \ncomprehend.\n  We will come back after the break and have a vote Tuesday evening. We \nwill keep people posted as to what is going to happen. We are going to \nmove to appropriations bills as quickly as we can, and we have other \nthings to do throughout the work period. I hope everybody has a great \nwork period at home.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Republican leader is recognized.\n  Mr. McCONNELL.

Mr. President, I rise, along with my colleague from \nGeorgia, to commemorate the life of a good man and a great American, \nFrank Norton.\n  Frank's years of service to this country ended recently with his \nuntimely death. But it is fitting we remember Frank on the Senate \nfloor, a place where he served this body, as well as service to our \ncountry in years prior to that.\n  Frank died a resident of St. Simons Island, GA, a place he called \nhome, even though he was a native of nearby Waycross, GA.\n  Frank graduated from Emory University in 1966, and it was his \nintention to go to law school. Unfortunately, the Army intervened. He \nwas drafted, wound up going to Officer Candidate School, and not long \nafter that became an Army Ranger instructor. He then headed to Vietnam. \nWhile he was in Vietnam, he served in one of the most dangerous jobs in \nthe Army, which was a Ranger reconnaissance platoon leader. For his \nservice and bravery, Frank earned some nine medals, including the \nPurple Heart and three Bronze Stars for Valor in combat.\n  Frank went on to serve in assignments at Fort Benning and Fort \nStewart, GA, as well as in Korea and Germany. But it is his \ncongressional assignments that some of my colleagues will remember him \nfor. He came to head the Army liaison office in both the House and the \nSenate.\n  At the time of his retirement in 1993 as a colonel, Frank was the \nprincipal Deputy to the Secretary of the Army for U.S. Senate Liaison. \nHe was the only Army officer to serve in that position in both the \nHouse and the Senate.\n  But Frank's service to country did not end there. In 1993, my \npredecessor, Senator Sam Nunn, appointed Frank to serve as a staffer on \nthe Senate Armed Services Committee. This was a point in time when this \nNation had to go through its first major base closure and realignment \nprocess. Frank headed up that process from an Armed Services Committee \nstandpoint and did an outstanding job.\n  After a later career in government relations, Frank devoted his time \nto his family farm, to charities, and to community service in Waycross, \nBrunswick, and St. Simons. Frank loved art, the symphony, and classical \nmusic, which is hard to believe for a guy who was as robust and \npersonal and such a great retired Army colonel as Frank was.\n  His lovely wife Carol and his young son Lee are going to miss him. \nCertainly, I am going to miss him. We honor him tonight.\n  I yield for my colleague from Georgia, Senator Isakson.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I am honored to rise with Senator \nChambliss to pay tribute to a great Georgian and a great friend to the \nUnited States of America and a great veteran of the U.S. Army.\n  COL Frank Norton was quite an extraordinary man. As Senator Chambliss \nmentioned, upon graduation he went to Vietnam, and in Vietnam he took \none of the most dangerous missions of all and did it superbly. He was \ndecorated nine times. He returned here and throughout his career served \nin the Congress, the Senate, and served the people of the United States \nin many ways.\n  Frank Norton is a very unique individual. When he left military \nservice and left service to the House and Senate liaison committees, he \nformed a partnership with his old friend Bob Hurt from Georgia. They \nformed a firm called Hurt and Norton, and they were quite a team; \nalways jovial, always hard working, always on target, always delivering \nfor their clients, and their clients were always the State of Georgia.\n  Our biggest economic asset in Georgia is our port of Savannah, and \nthey represented the port. Our coastline is one of the most valuable \nareas of Georgia, and they represented our coastline. And most \nimportantly of all, in the critical days of Fort Stewart, they \nrepresented Fort Stewart and the Hinesville community to see to it that \nthe needs of our soldiers were met and the needs of the city of \nHinesville, which hosted the soldiers, were met as well.\n  Frank died on the tennis court with his young son Lee. Tonight I send \nmy regrets to his wife Carol, to Lee, and to all his family. But I also \nsend my praise, my praise for a great Georgian, a great American, who \nsacrificed in so many ways for this country. May he now rest in peace \nlooking down on all of us from heaven.\n  I yield back my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8967-3", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8967]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           SIGNING AUTHORITY\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN.

REED\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise once again to speak about one of \nour great Federal employees. Whenever I enter this Chamber, I cannot \nhelp but admire the inspirational works of art that adorn it. Above the \nmain entrances rest marble reliefs depicting the three virtues of \nCourage, Wisdom, and Patriotism.\n  Our Federal employees embody all three of these qualities, though my \nfocus today will be on patriotism. The marble relief representing \npatriotism, which sits atop the lintel of the door to my right, shows a \nman setting aside his plow to take up the sword. This image recalls the \nparallel stories of Lucius Cincinnatus and George Washington, two \nfarmer citizens who set aside their daily work in order to defend the \npeople's liberty.\n  In the history of democracy, the sword and plow have come to \nsymbolize this dichotomy. Traditionally, the sword features most \nprominently as the metaphor for patriotism. However, I would argue that \nthe plow is just as much a symbol of patriotism as the sword. The plow \nrepresents a citizen's daily contribution to society over the course of \nmany years. The highlight of the Cincinnatus story, from which our \nrevolutionary forebears drew inspiration, is that he returned without \nfanfare to his plow when the war was finished.\n\n[[Page S8968]]\n\n  The great statesman Adlai Stevenson once said:\n\n       Patriotism is not short, frenzied outbursts of emotion, but \n     the tranquil and steady dedication of a lifetime.\n\n  I think it is fitting to speak about patriotism as symbolized by a \nplow, because the Federal employee I wish to recognize this week has \nworked in the Department of Agriculture for over 35 years. Pearlie Reed \nwas raised on a farm in the rural town of Heth, AR, where he was the \nninth of eighteen children. He worked hard to attend the State \nUniversity of Pine Bluff, which was especially challenging for an \nAfrican-American man in the South during the struggles of the Civil \nRights movement.\n  Nonetheless, Pearlie received his degree, and he joined the USDA in \n1968 as a student intern for the Soil Conservation Service. In the \nyears that followed, Pearlie rose steadily in the Soil Conservation \nService from an entry-level soil conservator to district \nconservationist, to deputy state conservationist, and he was eventually \nappointed as the state conservationist for Maryland in 1985. He served \nin that position for 4 years, after which he became the state \nconservationist for California.\n  As his career advanced, Pearlie also received a master's degree in \npublic administration from American University. The Soil and \nConservation Service was eventually transformed into the Natural \nResources Conservation Service or NRCS. From 1994 to 1998, Pearlie \nserved as associate chief, and his last year on the job also served as \nActing Assistant Secretary of Agriculture for Administration.\n  In 1998, Pearlie was promoted to chief of the NRCS, and he held the \nposition until 2002 when he was named Regional Conservationist for the \nWestern United States. In that role, Pearlie was in charge of all \nnatural resource conservation efforts by the Federal Government in 10 \nStates and the Pacific Basin area.\n  Pearlie has said that one of his proudest moments in his career came \nwhen he was asked to lead the Agriculture Department's task force on \ncivil rights in the 1990s. He led a team that issued a report \ncontaining 37 recommendations on how to ensure that the Department is a \nwelcoming place for minorities. Pearlie briefed President Clinton \npersonally, and the President issued an order that all 37 of his \nrecommendations be implemented.\n  Pearlie retired from the USDA in 2003, but just this year Secretary \nVilsack called him out of retirement and asked President Obama to \nappoint him as Assistant Secretary of Administration, the position he \nbriefly held in an acting capacity 10 years ago. Pearlie was confirmed \nby the Senate on May 12, and he is now back at work for the farmers and \nranchers of America.\n  One of his former colleagues said once that:\n\n       If you look up the term ``public service'' in the \n     dictionary, you'd likely see a picture of Pearlie Reed right \n     next to it.\n\n  Over the course of his long career, Pearlie has received the \nDistinguished Presidential Rank Award, the George Washington Carver \nPublic Service Hall of Fame Award, and the USDA's Civil Plow Honor \nAward, among others.\n  Pearlie exemplifies the kind of patriotism Stevenson spoke about--the \npatriotism of steady work and perseverance represented by Cincinnatus's \nplow.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in honoring Pearlie Reed's \ndistinguished service and that of all Federal employees working in \nagricultural development, resource conservation, and rural advancement.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8968-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8968-S8975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           HEALTH CARE REFORM\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to speak, if I can, for a few minutes \nthis evening on the health care bill. I suppose today or tomorrow will \nbe the last time before we return in September to address the issue of \nhealth care reform, and I thought it might be worthwhile this evening--\nin the waning hours--to give our colleagues and others who are \ninterested an idea of where we are in this debate and what options have \nbeen proposed.\n  As many have heard us say already, the committee for which I have \nbeen hired as sort of a pinch-hitter for Senator Kennedy--the Health, \nEducation, Labor and Pensions Committee, on which I am proud to serve--\nand I must say once again, with deep regret, that the chairman, Senator \nTed Kennedy from Massachusetts, has not been able to be with us over \nthe last number of weeks. I will tell you this. He is watching very \ncarefully every meeting and markup and gathering that occurs, because \nhe has invested so much of his public life and career to trying to \nreform the health care system of our Nation. So I was asked to step in \nfor him, temporarily, until he gets back on his feet and can join us in \nthis effort.\n  We have spent a long time over the last number of weeks and months on \nthis debate. We have spent a tremendous amount of time in the \ncommittee, even a lot of time before the actual markup in preparing for \nthe legislation. So this evening I wish to talk about sort of where we \nare with that bill, what is in that bill in very practical terms, and \nhow it would affect individuals.\n  I also want to give my colleagues some opportunity to appreciate what \nwill happen while we are away for 5 weeks in terms of those who will \nlose their insurance, as they will, between now and September. I have \nmade the point over and over again that 14,000 people a day in our \nNation lose health care coverage. Those are terrible numbers. They are \nmore significant in some States than in others, but there is that \nerosion of coverage every day.\n  As long as nothing happens, as long as no health care crisis affects \nthem or their families, they may be able to survive all of that until \nthey find a job or find some other means by which they can afford \nhealth care coverage. If, unfortunately, they are caught--as so many \nare--with that unexpected accident, that unexpected health care crisis, \nthat unexpected diagnosis of a major health care problem while they are \nin that period without coverage, the implications can be staggering, \nand not just because they lack the coverage that might allow them to \ntake care of that emergency accident or injury. But if they are \ndiagnosed with something in the absence of a health care plan, under \nthe present circumstances, there is very little likelihood that they \nare going to be able to get a health care plan that will be within \ntheir means to afford it because they will have that preexisting \ncondition once the diagnosis occurs. So the health care costs go right \nup through the ceiling.\n\n  So again, 14,000 a day, as we gather here, find themselves in that \nshape. I thought it might be worthwhile to get graphic about this, \nbecause by the end of the August recess, when we return, 756,000 of our \nfellow citizens will have lost their health insurance--while we are \naway over the next 4 or 5 weeks--and that is a staggering number.\n  Some may find a means to get it back. Some may have a spouse who gets \na job that provides coverage. But those are the numbers if you take \nevery day the loss of health care coverage.\n  My patient here, with these numbers, you can see the thermometer is \nnow exploding. He is even having some beads of perspiration here \nbecause he is now worried that he or his family could be caught in that \nfree fall, without the means to protect themselves against economic \nruin. It could happen.\n  So as we begin a short discussion this evening of where we are, I \nthought it might be important to share with my colleagues that while we \nleave with the full confidence of a very good health care plan as \nMembers of Congress, that should an accident, a diagnosis, a problem \noccur to any one of us--while we don't want that to happen--there is no \nlikelihood we are going to be put in economic difficulty because of it. \nCertainly we will probably get good care because of who we are, what we \ndo, but no worry about the sort of economic ruin that this crowd of \n756,000 Americans may face if they are caught in a similar situation.\n  I have hope that all my colleagues have a good recess, that they will \nget around their States and districts. I also hope they will get an \nannual physical this year, as I hope everyone does. We provide an \nopportunity, under our health care plan, to do that at little or no \ncost. That is how I discovered earlier this summer, in June, that I \nhave early stage prostate cancer, and I will\n\n[[Page S8969]]\n\nbe going through a procedure in the next few weeks to deal with that \nmatter, and I am confident, since I caught it in this early stage, that \nI will come out fine. I have had a chance to talk to people who have \ngone through this or had a family member and I know about the various \noptions that are available. It is early stage. It hasn't metastasized. \nI am not going to be in tough shape. I believe I am going to come out \nof this fine. But that is what you get when you get an annual physical. \nYou find out these things.\n  There are people who, of course, don't do that. We even have had \ncolleagues who didn't. A wonderful man I served with in this body for \nmany years by the name of Spark Matsunaga from Hawaii did not discover \nit early enough, and he lost his life to prostate cancer. Almost 30,000 \npeople in our country die every year of prostate cancer. In many \ninstances, if not most, it is because it wasn't diagnosed early enough. \nIt is very slow growing. There is ample time to respond to it, but you \nneed to find out about it.\n  So when you get that physical, and I hope each of my colleagues \nremembers that if they do that and they find out they have a health \nissue, or if something happens in an accident to them, or if anybody in \ntheir family suffers a health crisis, they will be able to focus their \nattention on getting well because there is absolutely no risk that any \nMember of the Congress, or the millions of Federal employees who have \nthe options--more than 20 of them each year, by the way--to choose what \nplan serves us best--no risk they will lose their economic security \nbecause they got sick or they had a bad diagnosis or they got hurt. \nBecause as I said a moment ago, we all have great health insurance and \nwe are not going to lose it any time soon.\n  But tens of millions of Americans have insurance that does not allow \nthem to get the care they need. It is not just the uninsured; it is \npeople with insurance I want to focus on this evening--people who have \ninsurance when they need it, with the doctor of their choice, and while \nwe are gone, nearly half a million of them will lose that coverage.\n  I understand we are all going to be patient on this effort of health \ncare reform. It takes time to get it right. I acknowledge that. But 70 \nyears is long enough. That is how long we have gone in our Nation \nwithout addressing in a holistic way the health care issues that must \nbe addressed.\n  By the time we return from our recess, the number of Americans, I \npointed out, who will have lost health insurance since our committee, \nthe Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, passed the \nAffordable Health Choices Act more than 3 weeks ago, will be over \nthree-quarters of a million people.\n  While a bill that will improve the quality and affordability of \nhealth care for every American sits waiting for action, as I said, \n756,000 of our fellow citizens are going to lose that insurance before \nwe come back from our recess.\n  Let me take a moment and show my colleagues what that means in their \nStates. I have broken this down State by State so you get some idea of \nwhat the implications are because sometimes these numbers can be \ndaunting. It may be hard for people to see this, but I have broken it \ndown. I will run it down very quickly.\n  Alabama, 5,760 people will lose their health insurance over the next \n5 weeks; Alaska, 640; Arizona, 8,960; Arkansas, 2,560; California, \n70,080 people will lose their health care coverage before we reconvene \nin early September; Colorado, 3,200.\n  I know the Presiding Officer has been working hard on this issue. I \ncommend him for this effort. I know he will be meeting with a lot of \nhis constituents. In fact, Colorado and Connecticut lose the same \nnumber of people, 3,200 as well.\n  In Delaware, 960; in Florida, 27,200; Georgia, 13,760; Hawaii, 1,600; \nIdaho, 2,240; Illinois, 8,640; Indiana, 15,360 will lose health care \ncoverage; Iowa, 2,240; Kansas, about the same number. In Kentucky it is \n7,360; Louisiana, 5,760; Maine, 2,240 lose health care coverage; in \nMaryland, 7,360; Massachusetts, over 13,000 people, close to 14,000 \npeople will lose health care coverage over the next 5 weeks; Michigan, \n19,840; Minnesota, 6,080; Mississippi, 4,160; Missouri, 6,720; Montana, \n960 people; Nebraska, 1,280; Nevada, over 7,000 people will lose health \ncare coverage; New Hampshire, 960; New Jersey, 20,800 people will lose \nhealth care coverage; New Mexico, 2,560; New York, 38,080 people will \nbe dropped from the health care rolls; North Carolina, over 16,000; \nNorth Dakota, 320; Ohio, 12,480; Oklahoma, 1,600; Oregon, 8,640; \nPennsylvania, 16,320 people; Rhode Island--our colleague, Sheldon \nWhitehouse is here from Rhode Island. He was such a valuable resource \nin our HELP Committee over the last number of weeks, and I commend him \nfor his contribution, he and Jack Reed both making significant \ncontributions to our Affordable Health Choices Act. South Carolina, \nover 10,000 people will lose their health care coverage, South Dakota, \n960; Tennessee, 12,800; Texas, 15,040; Utah, 3,840; Vermont, 960; \nVirginia, 10,560 people; in West Virginia, 960; Wisconsin, 7,360; \nWyoming, 320.\n  I apologize for taking that time but sometimes you mention 14,000 and \nwe don't break it down State by State. These are the projected losses \nin terms of health care coverage. They will not have the same degree of \nsecurity that we do during the next 5 weeks.\n  When we leave here, I, of course, hope none of us suffer any kind of \na diagnosis or any kind of an accident, but as I said a moment ago, as \npainful as that may be, none of us will suffer the pain of wondering \nwhether you can afford to have your child covered, your spouse covered, \nor have the means to take care of yourself if something happens.\n  The people in these numbers, hopefully, will never have that problem, \nbut if they do it is a major catastrophe. Roughly 65 percent of all \nbankruptcies in the last year have been caused because of a medical \ncrisis--about 65 percent of all bankruptcies. Your first thought might \nbe, as mine was, that is probably the uninsured who ended up in that \nshape. They didn't have insurance, they ended up with a serious problem \nand got drained of whatever few assets they had left and took the \nbankruptcy act to get out of trouble.\n  Mr. President, 75 percent of the people who were affected by \nbankruptcy as a result of the health care crisis have insurance; three \nout of four people who have insurance had ended up in bankruptcy. It \nwas not the uninsured, it was the insured.\n  This evening--I know they are always out there marketing this idea \nthat this bill we are talking about is not designed to help the \ninsured, only the uninsured. Nothing could be further from the truth. \nOur major efforts are to try to bring down the costs of the insured. \nMany have such high deductibles and out-of-pocket deductibles they \nnever get to engage their insurance policies.\n  At any rate, these are the numbers. I think it is important for my \ncolleagues to look at it.\n  To my colleagues, think about constituents you are going to see over \nthe recess facing these problems. Imagine a small business owner paying \n$1,000 a month on premiums with a $6,000 deductible. It is not an \nuncommon event for small businesses. Imagine this small businessman \ntelling you that his insurance company dropped his daughter's coverage \nwhen their doctor suggested surgery to remove noncancerous tumors, \nforcing him to get a separate, more expensive policy for her.\n  It doesn't have to be this way. These facts happen all the time. \nUnder our bill, under the bill we passed 3 weeks ago, this small \nbusiness owner would be able to choose an affordable plan that he or \nshe could rely on, wouldn't be denied coverage for the preexisting \ncondition of their daughter, and that coverage would not be taken away \nonce the policy is issued. That is the difference between the status \nquo, as it is today, and what we propose in our legislation we spent so \nmuch time crafting.\n  Imagine, if you would, a small business owner who offers health \ncoverage to his 20 employees. He is paying about 60 percent of the cost \nof the premiums but unable to afford family coverage. Imagine that \nsmall business owner telling you that one of his employees have left \nfor a job that provides family coverage.\n  It doesn't have to happen. In fact, this case is one I am very \nfamiliar with. This was the case of a small employer in Hartford, CT, \nwho employs not 20 people but about 10, and very loyal employees. I \nthink most of them have been there 20 years. He had an\n\n[[Page S8970]]\n\nemployee the other day literally almost in tears, if not in tears, \nannouncing to his employer that he had to leave because his wife, who \nhad the health care coverage, lost her job. So they were without health \ninsurance.\n  He then went and took a job that paid 30 percent less than the job he \nhad for more than 20 years in order to get the coverage. That would not \nhappen under our bill. That does not have to happen. That family, if \nyou will, small business, would be able to find affordable coverage for \ntheir employees using the same strong bargaining power and broad risk \npooling that large businesses enjoy.\n  This is one of the major problems for small business. The average \nsmall business pays 18 percent more in premiums than large businesses--\n18 percent more--and they get a lot less coverage as a result of it \nbecause they don't have the opportunity to pool as much, come together. \nOur bill gives that small businessperson the same access, the same \nopportunity to that gateway, that place where these policies exist that \nthey can shop for and determine what is best for them--what they can \nafford and what they want to have for their employees. That does not \nexist today. Unless we change the law, that small business operator is \ngoing to be faced with rising premium costs and less and less coverage \nfor their employees. We change that. We fix that. That is important for \npeople, I think.\n  Let me mention a third scenario. Imagine a single mother, self-\nemployed, paying more than she can comfortably afford for an insurance \nplan--not uncommon--that has high copays and a high deductible, not \nuncommon at all. Imagine her telling you she rarely sees a doctor for \npreventive screenings for herself or well-child visits for her son \nbecause her plan doesn't cover those visits.\n  It doesn't have to be that way. Under our proposal this single mother \nwould be able to find a plan that she can afford that covers important \npreventive care items at little or no cost. Our bill provides \npreventive screenings like mammograms or annual physicals at little or \nno cost. That is in the affordable health choices bill. That idea of \nmaking sure she is going to be OK, that her child is getting those \nvaccinations and so forth that they need--that is covered by our \nproposal.\n  Our bill would ban discriminatory pricing based on gender because \nthat ban does not exist today. There can be a huge differential. If you \nare a woman getting health care coverage, you often pay a lot more than \nmen do. Our bill eliminates insurance rating based on gender entirely. \nMen and women are treated equally going in, in terms of their health \ncare coverage. If we do not change the law, those policies do not \nchange. The inequity goes on.\n  Mary, in this case, wouldn't have to pay more than others her age in \nher area would, rather than just paying more because of gender.\n  Finally, imagine a woman who bought the best coverage she could \nafford based on monthly premiums because she knew going without \ninsurance was a bad idea. Imagine her telling you she was just \ndiagnosed with breast cancer at the age of 25, and only then realized \nher policy was inadequate. Imagine her telling you she now has more \nthan $40,000 in medical debt.\n  Under our bill, this young woman would be able to stay under her \nparents' coverage through her 26th birthday, what we call the young \ninvincibles, between the age of 21, when you are dropped from your \nparents coverage, and you are on your own. That is a very significant \npercentage of our population. A lot can happen. This woman was \ndiagnosed with breast cancer late. But had she been in the same \ncircumstances physically, with the adoption of our legislation she \nwould have qualified for that young adults coverage, which is very \nreasonable in cost, or stay under her parents' plan until she was 26 \nand never have to worry about being denied because of a preexisting \ncondition, which of course now she has. Having been diagnosed with \nbreast cancer, those premiums for that woman will go through the \nceiling, even as young as she is, because she has that preexisting \ncondition.\n  We asked our colleagues to imagine these cases because they are so \nincredibly common. These are not extraordinary cases. They are rather \nroutine in many cases. We will see people in these situations--I know \nmy colleagues will, during the break we are on, real people who can \nsuffer by our inaction.\n  Let me take a minute, if I can, to talk about what health reform \nmeans in my State of Connecticut as well. In the last month, an \ninsurance company in my State proposed to raise rates by 32 percent on \npeople buying insurance in the individual market. This news was \nshocking, given the debate going on at the Federal level, but the \ncompany went ahead with the proposed rate hike for Connecticut \nfamilies. Today I received word that the Connecticut Insurance \nDepartment went ahead and approved a modification to the company's \nproposal that will raise the premiums for the residents of my State by \nup to 20 percent--a 20-percent increase.\n  I don't know many people in Connecticut who got a 20-percent pay \nraise in the last year. I suspect very few. People are going to \nstruggle because of the rate hike. People are going to struggle across \nthe Nation, of course, until we take action because the rates continue \nto go up.\n  Consider, if you will, what has happened in the last few years: an \n86-percent increase in premiums, in rates since 1996. In my State they \nhave gone up about 46 percent in 6 years, and that was before the news \nof this latest company increase.\n  We have a bill--again, that would reduce the cost for Americans, the \nAffordable Health Choices Act, which we adopted in our committee, which \nin fact addresses this very issue. I want to encourage all my \ncolleagues to spend a little time looking at the bill we wrote over \nthis August break.\n  I will take just a minute this evening to talk about how costs would \nbe lowered under our proposal. Many ask the question: How do you lower \ncosts? I will use my own State as an example.\n  According to America's Health Insurance Plans, which is the trade \nassociation for the health insurance industry, in Connecticut in 2007, \nthe average monthly premium on the individual market for single \ncoverage was $277 and the average monthly premium on the individual \nmarket for family coverage was $646.\n  I ask unanimous consent to be able to proceed for an additional 10 \nminutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. DODD. Those are the numbers: monthly payment, individual market, \n$277; family premiums, family market, $646. Keep those numbers in mind, \nif you will. These numbers were for 2007. I presume in 2009 they have \ngone up a bit, but those are the latest numbers I could find from this \ntrade association. They reflect what an individual making about \n$21,000, on average, paid in 2007. That is a lower income individual, \nbut there are a lot of people who have incomes at that level working in \nour country. You try to pick up the cost of $277, or $646 a month with \nan income like that. You know the outcome. You are not going to be able \nto afford it. You could not come near it.\n  Under our legislation, a low-income worker at $21,000 would now pay \n$20 a month in health care premiums for individuals.\n  That is $277 a month under the status quo, $20 a month under the \nAffordable Health Choice Act--from $277 to $20. That person now--even \nat $21,000, that $20 a month becomes very affordable health care. That \nis a person who would now be able to shop for a plan in the insurance \ngateway and could have options in choosing health care to allow them to \nstay out the hospital, stay healthier, be able to keep working, take \ncare of their family. That is the difference. That is the real \ndifference.\n  For family coverage, a family of four who makes two times the Federal \npoverty level--approximately $44,000 a year--pays $646 each month for \nfamily coverage, as I mentioned earlier in my statement. Under our \nbill, that family would now pay $40 a month for their health care \npremiums; that is $646 under the status quo, $40 a month under the \nAffordable Health Choices Act.\n  When people say it does not make any difference, you are not bringing \ndown costs, you tell that to that individual making around $21,000 a \nyear or that family making $45,000 a year. That is a significant \nreduction in their health care premiums. That is the real\n\n[[Page S8971]]\n\ndifference between the status quo and what our legislation offers. That \nis affordable coverage.\n  What is not captured in the numbers under the status quo is the fact \nthat that family in Connecticut has no guarantee they will even be \noffered a policy. For that matter, they have no guarantee, if they are \nissued the policy, they will not see it cancelled or rescinded because \nthey file a claim. And they have no guarantee that policy will be \nrenewed the following year. Our bill changes all of that. Connecticut \nfamilies and families across the country can at long last be assured \nthey will be able to choose among quality, affordable health care \nplans.\n  Before my colleagues depart, let me say this: Let's come back to work \nhere in September, come back ready to offer our thoughts and \nsuggestions and constructive criticism. We are going to pass a bill \nthis fall, and we are going to do it with the help of any Senator \nwilling to contribute and be a part of the solution. But we are not \ngoing to continue to wait for the sake of waiting until the politics \nget right.\n  Between adjournment tonight and when we return around September 5 or \n6, there are 756,000 people who will fall into the category of the \nuninsured. These are insured people. We ought to be doing everything we \ncan reasonably and thoughtfully to put the brakes on this kind of \nhemorrhaging that is occurring in our country. It is bad for \nindividuals and their families, and it is bad for the economy of our \nNation. It is shameful that the wealthiest Nation on the face of this \nEarth takes the insured population of our Nation and puts them at such \nrisk, and their families, wiping them out, as happens too often with \nfinancial ruin.\n  We have coverage. We are fortunate to have it. We ought to be able to \ndo everything in our power to see to it that every American, regardless \nof their economic status, ought not to play roulette with their future \nand that of their families because they lack the economic security that \nothers who are more fortunate financially have. That is not right. \nHealth care ought not to be a choice only for those who can afford it, \ndecent health care by the accident of birth. That you are born into a \nfamily who lacks the economic means should not place your child in a \ndifferent situation than mine or someone else's because of those \ncircumstances. That is not America. That is not America in the 21st \ncentury. We ought to be able to do better than that.\n  The demagogues out there, chirping away about government-run health \ncare or socialized medicine--that is baloney from top to bottom, and \nthey ought to be ashamed of themselves. In a nation as strong as we \nare, we place this many insured people at risk because we do not have \nthe courage to stand up and do what needs to be done.\n  In our proposal we have crafted, we spent a lot of time working at it \nto provide relief and support on wellness and prevention and quality of \ncare and to bring those costs down to the point I have described here \nthis evening. Again, there may be other ideas and other ways of doing \nthis. We think we have done a good job with our bill. But I wanted \npeople across the country to know there are ideas out there.\n  There were 23 of us who worked on that bill. We spent 5 weeks, 60 \nhours, 23 sessions--the longest markup of a bill in the history of that \ncommittee and, we are told by some, maybe the longest markup in the \nhistory of the Senate on a single bill. We had 800 amendments filed, \nand 300 were actually considered. Some 160 amendments of my friends on \nthe Republican side were agreed to and included in our bill, making it \na better bill and a stronger bill. I welcomed their participation. But \nhere we are, 3 weeks later, still stymied, unable to come together and \nshape a bill that would provide the relief so many people seek in our \ncountry.\n  I thank my colleagues for their efforts, particularly grateful to \nSenator Harkin, who did a terrific job on the prevention parts of our \nbill; Senator Mikulski, who wrote the quality provisions; Senator Jeff \nBingaman, who worked on coverage issues; Senator Patty Murray, who \nworked on the workforce issues in the bill; and people such as Senator \nSheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, who joined our committee and did a \nfabulous job with Kay Hagan, our new colleague from North Carolina, \nalong with Sherrod Brown of Ohio, to shape the public option that is \nincluded in our bill, which I am certain my friend from Rhode Island \nmay describe in some detail this evening about what we have done. This \nwas so creative that the Blue Dogs on the House side adopted our \nproposal on the public option as part of the House-passed bill. Of \ncourse, Jack Reed and Bernie Sanders, as well as Jeff Merkley on our \ncommittee and Bob Casey did a great job in helping us shape the \nlegislation. I thank all of the members of the committee.\n  I thank Mike Enzi, my colleague from Wyoming, the ranking Republican \nmember, along with his colleagues on the Republican side. They did not \nvote for the bill in the end. I regret that. But they made \ncontributions that made it a stronger and better bill.\n  But let's come back in September and get the job done. That is why we \nare here this evening in the closing hours of our session here before \nthis break begins, so that we can highlight this most important issue \nthat the President has committed his administration to, and that I \nbelieve the overwhelmingly majority of Americans--when you get sick at \nhome and your child is in trouble, you do not wake up and wonder what \nparty you belong to or what your political leanings are; what you want \nto know is, Do we have a plan that covers this? Is someone going to see \nmy child or my spouse? Are they going to get good care? Am I not going \nto go into economic ruin from this? You do not wonder whether you are \nin a blue State or red State or what political party is in power. What \nyou want to know is, Does anybody give a darn, and are they doing \nanything about it? I am in trouble, my family is in trouble, and are \nyou helping us out to get us back on our feet? And that is what we \ntried to do in this legislation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Let me thank Chairman Dodd for his leadership and for \nhis remarks. He said he would give us a discussion of where we are, and \nhe has done a wonderful job of showing how this bill will improve the \nlives of regular Americans in a very concrete way, including \nparticularly Americans who have insurance.\n  To supplement his discussion of where we are, I wanted to give a \nquick discussion of where we have been because the trajectory of where \nwe have been to where we are tells us something about where we are \ngoing. And everybody in this country, insured or uninsured, should have \nsome real concern about where we are going in health care in this \ncountry if we do not act.\n  The year I was born was 1955, and this was the headline from the New \nYork Times in 1955. It is hard to read the little part here; I will \nread it to you. It says:\n\n       The Problem of Cost. Millions of Americans cannot afford to \n     pay the costs of medical care, and they are not protected by \n     adequate health insurance.\n\n  That was 1955. This section says:\n\n       In human terms, this meant that the American had to scrap \n     his budget, dig into savings or go into debt, to pay some \n     $7.5 billion for doctors, hospitals, dentists, nurses, and \n     the myriad physical accessories of medical care.\n\n  That was 1955, when the Nation's medical bill ran over $10 billion. \nThey were horrified to say over $10 billion. It is now over $2.5 \ntrillion.\n  So that is the year I was born. We were already bemoaning the state \nof America's health care system.\n  This is 1979. I had just gotten out of college. And the HEW Secretary \nsaid: Health cost called unjustified. HEW Secretary Patricia Roberts \nsaid: The quality of American health care does not justify its price \ntag of more than $200 billion a year. Still bemoaning the health care \nproblems, still not getting anything done about it.\n  Now, 1988. This was the year my wife became pregnant with our first \nchild. And here it is. Prospects: Soaring health care costs. Joseph \nCalifano said--he was the former Secretary of Health and Welfare--``The \naverage jump in premiums could hit 30 percent in 1989.'' But at the \nsame time, we are getting less for it.\n  Chairman Dodd just talked about a 20-percent jump in his State \nrecently. You think this was happening today? It is from 1988, 20 years \nago. The more\n\n[[Page S8972]]\n\nthings change in health care, the more they stay the same.\n  Here is 1992. Health care costs increasing at more than twice the \nrate of wages have made benefits so expensive it would be surprising if \ncompanies were not responding. ``Health care costs dampening hiring.'' \nAnd they dampen wages, as we have seen, and increasingly businesses are \nhaving to avoid health care because they cannot keep up with that cost. \nThat from 1992.\n  So we took those stories and we put them together on this chart. This \nshows the increases in America's spending on health care in each of \nthose years, starting back the year I was born, that first story, 1955, \nthen 1979, then 1987, then 1992, then 2009. It increased from $12 \nbillion, which seemed like a big number then, to $200 billion, to over \nhalf a trillion dollars, to $850 billion, nearly a trillion, and now \n$2.5 trillion.\n  Look how much it has bumped from 1992 to 2009. This, my friends and \ncolleagues, is what is called a trajectory. It is going to keep going \nif we do not do anything about it.\n  The latest estimates for my home State of Rhode Island are that in \n2016, which is not too far from now, in 2016, probably about this far \nup on the graph, $26,000 a year is what a family will have to pay for \nfamily coverage--more than $26,000 a year. That means if you are a \ncomfortably earning hard-working individual pulling down a salary of \n$52,000, half of your income, pretax income, goes out the door for \nhealth care before you start anything else. That is not sustainable. \nThat is why we talk about Thelma and Louise instead of Harry and \nLouise. That is why we need to change the direction of our health care \nsystem, not just for the uninsured but for everyone so that all \nAmericans can have a secure health care future. No American will have a \nsecure health care future if this trajectory is allowed to continue.\n  So if you are out there asking, How would a change in the direction \nof our health care system help me, think of Thelma and Louise headed \noff the cliff because that is what the American health care system is \nlike right now. The cliff is coming, and we are all in the car \ntogether, and together we have to solve this problem. Because we have \nto solve it together, it is very disappointing that so many of our \nfriends on the other side have refused to participate in this \nconversation and have reverted to labels and name calling: socialized \nmedicine, government mandates--things that have nothing to do with our \nlegislation but are designed to scare people and to provoke those who \nhave not sat down and read the bill and do not know better. It is \nunfortunate.\n  What does it measure up against? Let me show you a couple of other \nthings. We have had a lot of talk in recent days about the stimulus \nplan and how effective that has been--a $787 billion stimulus. There it \nis, that $0.88 trillion is the stimulus for all of the barking and \nmoaning we have had about how much that cost this country. That is what \nit is. The $8.9 trillion is what George Bush ran up in debt for this \ncountry during his Presidency.\n  Three-quarters of the debt this country bears, George Bush ran up \nduring his Presidency. It was an orgy of fair-weather borrowing. When \nwe didn't need to go into debt to protect our economy, when things were \nhumming along, that is what he did, $9 trillion. Here is our unfunded \nMedicare liability, $38 trillion. We don't have $38 trillion now. \nUnless we do something about this cost, we are truly going off the \ncliff in that car with Thelma and Louise, following that trajectory of \ncost I showed.\n  It is not all going for health care that makes everybody better. It \nis going to a lot of other things. Here is one thing it is going to. \nInsurance industry profits. Have you noticed your wages going up a lot \nin the last couple years? For a decade, from 1999 to 2009, wage growth \nhas been 29 percent. That is less than 3 percent a year and way less \nthan 3 percent a year compounded. That is what wage growth has been \nlike. If you don't feel like your wages have gone up much in the last \ndecade, you are right. They haven't. For many Americans, wages flat-\nlined for a decade. How about your insurance premiums? Did they flat-\nline? No, sir. The insurance premiums went through the roof, increased \n120 percent, more than doubled in one decade. That is the steep curve I \nshowed you, 120 percent. How about insurance industry profits? Up 428 \npercent in the same period that wages were up 29 percent. So there is \nsomething we can do something about.\n  On insurance, so many Americans are uninsured, it is worth taking a \nlook at this. We have all used and heard the figure about 46, 47 \nmillion Americans who are uninsured. That is the people who are \nuninsured at any given minute. As I stand here at this desk right now, \nout there in America there are about 47 million people who are \nuninsured. But some people gain insurance and some people lose \ninsurance. Over the course of a year, the number of people who lose \ntheir insurance, whose families lose their insurance, is nearly 87 \nmillion. If you started on the east coast and moved your way west, and \nwhen you got to the Mississippi and you started into Minnesota, Iowa, \nMissouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana and you took the population of every \nsingle State west of that all the way to California, the population of \nall these States is about 87 million, to give you an idea of how many \nAmericans lose their health insurance and have to go without it at a \npoint during the year.\n  Then there are catastrophic levels of waste in our health care \nsystem. Our former Treasury Secretary, a Republican, knowledgeable \nabout this, ran the Pittsburgh Regional Health Initiative for years. He \nsaid $1 trillion of annual waste is associated with process failures. \nHe has calculated $1 trillion a year of waste in our health care \nsystem.\n  The Lewin Group is a group many people talk about here. They are \ndescribed on the Senate floor as the gold standard in health care \ninformation. Sources of potential excess costs: Excess costs from \nincentives to overuse services, from poor care management and lifestyle \nfactors, excess costs due to competition and regulatory problems, \nexcess costs due to transactional inefficiencies; $151 billion here, \n$519 billion here, $135 billion here, $203 billion here. As we say in \nWashington, a billion here and a billion there, and pretty soon it \nstarts to add up. This adds up to over $1 trillion in waste in \ncongruence with what the former Treasury Secretary said.\n  It is not just newspapers that are saying it. It is also President \nObama's own Council of Economic Advisers. Their report on July 9 said \nthat:\n\n       Efficiency improvements in the U.S. health care system \n     potentially could free up resources equal to 5 percent of \n     U.S. GDP which is above $700 billion a year.\n\n  They also noted:\n\n       [It] should be possible to cut total health expenditures by \n     about 30 percent without worsening outcomes . . . [which] \n     would again suggest that savings on the order of 5 percent of \n     GDP could be feasible.\n\n  Again, two calculations coming to the same point, savings of over \n$700 billion a year.\n  That is one of the things we are trying to do. In addition to family-\nby-family improvements, small business-by-small business improvements, \nindividual-by-individual improvements that Chairman Dodd has wrought \nthrough this bill, we are also trying to turn around a health care \nsystem that has been out of control, that has not been reformed for my \nentire lifetime. So that now is our moment, and it is on a trajectory \nthat will break this country if we don't do something about it. We \nsimply cannot continue a cost curve such as this that is already at \n$2.5 trillion and is accelerating northward. We can't be competitive \nwith our international competitors in trade if we do this. We can't \nsustain our families if we do this. We simply cannot keep this \ngovernment fiscally solvent if we do it. We have to turn the car before \nit gets to the cliff. If we can't do that, then shame on us.\n  I think we need to be in this together. One of the ways we will do \nthis is through a public plan. A public plan is important because there \nare a number of ways in which you change those cost curves. You don't \nhave to take services away from people because of all that waste. What \nyou have to do is deal with the waste. You build in electronic health \nrecords for every American so the efficiencies that other industries \nhave enjoyed from the computer revolution finally hit health care \nwhich, according to the Economist, has the worst information \ninfrastructure of any American industry except mining--the mining \nindustry and then\n\n[[Page S8973]]\n\nhealth care. Huge improvements and huge savings from that.\n  Quality improvements can save money. It has been demonstrated over \nand over again, as in Senator Stabenow and Senator Levin's home State \nof Michigan. They did quality improvements in intensive care units. In \n15 months, they saved $150 million and 1,500 lives, and it wasn't even \nin all the intensive care units. It was just in one State. It was that \none kind of quality improvement program, just in intensive care units. \nSo huge gains to be made from quality improvements.\n  Prevention. Senator Harkin spoke the other day about what can be \ngained from preventing particularly conditions that arise from \ndiabetes. Enormous savings, if we can focus on all that.\n  Transparency and improved administrative efficiency so doctors and \ninsurers aren't fighting all the time. We can do all those things, but \nsomebody has to lead. The question for us is, can we trust the private \ninsurance companies to lead in all those areas. If you look back, you \nsee they never have. We are way behind where we should be. They are not \nleading. It will take a competitive public option to pick up those \nissues and run with them and show what we can do.\n  I will close with this. One of the things we are hearing is you can't \npossibly have a public option. It is a line in the sand. The very \ndistinguished ranking member of the HELP Committee has said it is \nintolerable to have a public option. It simply would not work. It can't \nhappen. There are two ways we get health insurance in this country. One \nis through a private health insurance provider. The other is through \nworkers' compensation, which the business community runs in order to \nprotect itself against the injuries and illnesses and diseases and \ncatastrophic harms that can happen to people at work and that they have \nto protect themselves against. All across America, there are State \nfunds, public options that deliver health care insurance, State by \nState, over and over again. So when the ranking member goes home to his \nState of Wyoming, not only is a public option for delivering health \ninsurance not anathema, it is what he goes home to.\n  He goes home to a single-payer public option for health care, one his \nbusiness community appears perfectly satisfied with and he appears \nperfectly satisfied with.\n  Their Presidential candidate, John McCain, goes home to Arizona to a \npublic plan with 56 percent market share. It competes in a lively \nworkers' compensation health insurance market. The distinguished \nminority leader goes home to Kentucky, and in Kentucky his business \ncommunity enjoys a public option for workers' compensation health \ninsurance. So we should be able, in the spirit of coming together in \nthe face of this national emergency, to put aside the old notion that a \npublic option simply can't exist, can't happen. It happens in nearly \nhalf our States. It is supported by the business communities in those \nStates. It delivers care efficiently, and none of the Republican \nSenators from those States have, to my knowledge, ever complained about \nit in that context.\n  I will conclude with that. I think we are at a turning point, and it \nis important, as we go, that we remember this is a long struggle we \nhave been on. My entire lifetime, since 1955, it has gotten \ndramatically worse, and the rate at which it has been getting worse is \nincreasing. It is worsening. We have to do something about it now--for \neverybody in this country, for businesses large and small, and for \npeople and families, insured and uninsured, and we are pledged to do \nthat.\n  I thank the very distinguished chairman and yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I thank our colleague from Rhode Island. He \nhas been very eloquent in talking about the historical framework of \nthis debate, going back, even predating the 1950s, when we determined \nthe need for a national health plan in this Nation, not only to deliver \nhealth care to people but also to deal with the economic problems \nassociated with health care costs. I thought it might be worthwhile to \ninvite my colleague to share some additional thoughts on this view. \nToday, as I am told, we are spending about 17 percent of the gross \ndomestic product on health care costs. I am told, by those who are \neconomists looking at this, that if we don't alter anything but merely \nsort of stumble along, that percentage of our gross domestic product \nwill jump from 17 percent to 34 percent of the gross domestic product, \nwhich is a staggering amount when we consider how expensive that would \nbe and the result, in practical terms, to the very premium costs the \nSenator from Rhode Island has identified.\n  I also talked the other day to a leading businessman in our country, \nthe former chief executive officer of Pitney Bowes, a well-known, \nestablished company, headquartered in my home State of Connecticut but \nhas facilities in many States across the country. It employs thousands \nof people. The former CEO is a man named Mike Critelli. He is no longer \nthe CEO, but he was the CEO who was responsible for bringing a wellness \nplan to Pitney Bowes. I think my numbers are pretty accurate on this \npoint. I think their premium reduction, as a result of putting a \nwellness plan in place there, reduced those costs by around 30 or 40 \npercent. They decided to alter the lifestyles of their employees by \noffering them incentives--the opportunity to reduce weight, quit \nsmoking, improve diets, all these things.\n  Talking to Mike Critelli, he did it because, one, he thought it was \nthe right thing to do. Certainly, improving the quality of the health \nof your employees is a decent thing to do. But Mike Critelli also \npointed out to me that in addition to being the decent thing to do, it \nwas a very sound practice for business. Very simply, he said: If I \ncould increase the productivity of my workers, which is the critical \nelement, if the United States is going to compete in the 21st century, \nif wage rates are not going to drop down to Third or Fourth World \ncountry levels, we are going to have higher wage rates. We are going to \nhave higher costs to produce our products.\n  The one advantage we bring over third-rate and fourth-rate nations \nthat don't pay as much for employment is the productivity of the \nAmerican worker, which historically has exceeded that of almost any \nother worker anywhere in the world.\n  Mike Critelli's point is that having a good wellness plan in place \nincreases the productivity of that worker, and that is our edge in a \nglobal economy. So we need to start thinking in these terms.\n  I hear people in the business community say we can't afford to do \nthis. We can't afford not to do it. You can't have 34 percent of your \ngross domestic product be consumed with health care costs.\n  Our advantage is productivity. As Mike Critelli points out, if your \nworkers are sick, if they are obese, if they have diabetes, if they \nhave chronic illnesses at a young age, as many do today, then the \nability of that worker to produce those products and services is going \nto be curtailed and we suffer.\n  So there needs to be some lights turned on for some in the business \ncommunity about this debate. Some are having sort of a Pavlov's dog \nresponse to it. If you mention health care reform, they reach back \ndecades to the age-old bromides and responses to this issue without \nthinking about what this means in the 21st century, freeing up the \nability of workers to produce better products in a highly competitive \nmarketplace.\n  Let me mention one other thing I do not think we have talked about. \nForty-four years ago from last week, Lyndon Johnson signed Medicare \ninto law. Last week was Medicare's birthday. Medicare was signed into \nlaw 44 years ago, in 1965. Obviously, that was a great benefit to \npeople over the age of 65, and what a difference it made. It took that \npopulation, which was the poorest sector of our population, the \nelderly, and put them on a standard of living that allowed them to lead \ndecent lives after productive years of working.\n  So with prescription drugs, doctors visits, and the like, put aside \nthe problems today with Medicare we know exist and we have to deal \nwith, it did something else I do not think we have paid enough \nattention to. It was a source of relief and stability to a family. \nBecause all of a sudden those parents--which a younger generation had \nto put aside resources to provide for that crisis that was inevitably \ngoing to happen to those aging parents--became less of a burden because \nMedicare existed. The cost of prescription drugs,\n\n[[Page S8974]]\n\nthe visits to the doctor, the hospitalizations--all of a sudden, \nmagically, 44 years ago from last week, a good part of that burden was \nlifted off the shoulders of the children of Medicare recipients.\n  And it unleashed a level of investment that allowed our economy to \nprosper and grow. For other reasons too, but not the least of which, \nall of a sudden, there was that security in a family. They were not \ngoing to face financial ruin because, all of a sudden, their parents \nhad a crisis they were going to have to pay for out of their pockets.\n  I do not know if there are any economic models that examined that, \nbut I do not think we attribute enough of Medicare's success to the \ncontribution it made to the overall economy of our Nation 44 years ago \nbecause of that stability and certainty and security in a family, where \nyour parents--that aging population--at least had a safety net that \nwould protect them against that financial ruin that can befall a \nfamily.\n  I think we are missing a point in this debate in that what people are \nreally worried about is that lack of certainty, that lack of stability. \nPeople are socking away money today because: If I lose my job, if I end \nup with a preexisting condition, if we move, I could lose my health \ncare coverage, and all of a sudden my kids, my wife, myself are put in \nthe danger of economic ruin. That uncertainty, that lack of stability, \nthat lack of security has a negative impact on the consumer choices \npeople make. I might like to buy that second car. We may need it but--\ndo you know what--756,000 people are going to lose their health \ninsurance in the next 5 weeks. I might be one of them. And if something \nhappens, how do I pay for that problem? So--do you know what--we are \ngoing to delay that purchase or this other thing we might have done \nbecause I don't have the stability, the certainty, and the security \nthere is a safety net there. Lord forbid a crisis hits my family.\n  So while there is the comparison between Medicare's recent birthday \n44 years ago and what we are trying to achieve--we are thinking about \nit in a very small context: How much does that doctor visit cost? How \nmuch is that prescription drug? There are benefits to this that exceed \nthe parameters of what we are trying to achieve because of the \ninvestments we are making that I think have a larger impact on the \noverall economy of our Nation.\n  So I wanted to say to my colleague from Rhode Island, by talking \nabout these rising costs--and no end in sight, by the way--unless we \nfind some way to put the brakes on all of this and begin to reduce the \nproblems--how do you do that? If all of a sudden you have a child who \nis getting good dental care at an early age, that child is less likely \nto have a problem as they get older. If we can convince children and \nfamilies to eat better because we make the incentives to do so--3,500 \nchildren today started smoking in the United States, and 3,500 start \nsmoking every single day. And every single year, 400,000 people die \nbecause of tobacco-related illnesses--400,000 die--not to mention the \nnumber of people who have lifelong illnesses and die prematurely.\n  Of the 3,500 who start smoking today, 1,000 become addicted. You do \nnot have to have a Ph.D. in medicine to know that if you are a user of \ntobacco products, you are consuming a product with 50 carcinogens in \neach cigarette.\n  Here we know if we can begin to change that lifestyle, which we have \ndone, by the way--and, again, I thank my colleagues because, for the \nfirst time in 50 years since the Surgeon General pointed out that \ntobacco could kill you, only a few weeks ago we did what we have never \nbeen able to do before: Tobacco marketing, sales, and production are \nnow under the control of the Food and Drug Administration. By the way, \nthe Food and Drug Administration regulates mascara, lipstick, and pet \nfood. But we could not get the Food and Drug Administration to regulate \ntobacco products. Now that has changed as a result of the actions of \nthis Congress.\n  But that is an example of what I am talking about. If we can stop a \nchild from smoking, then that child grows up with a far greater \nlikelihood they are going to reach retirement age in far better shape, \nwhich means far less usage of that Medicare dollar and that hospital or \nthat doctor's visit. So you may not see the benefits of some of this \nimmediately but over the longer term we will. And that is bending that \ncurve. We are all talking about bending that curve of cost. We can do \nthat making these kinds of investments.\n  I am told only 2 percent of hospitals in this country have complete \nelectronic medical records--2 percent. Yet we know that we lose about \n100,000 people a year from medical errors in the United States. It is \nthe fourth leading killer of Americans. Electronic medical records \nreduce those numbers significantly because you have clarity in the \nrecords, you have portability of those records as people move around, \nyou have the opportunity to determine what other conditions a patient \nmay have, and you avoid the kinds of errors that produce the tragedy of \na lost life. That savings alone in lives and dollars, we are told by \nsome, could be as much as $500 billion. Electronic medical records--\nthat one issue--could produce those kinds of savings and results.\n  So when we have these debates and people talk about these things in \nsuch simplistic terms, without understanding the larger economic \nimplications--and if we do not, the numbers our friend from Rhode \nIsland have shown us, if history is any indicator of where we are \ngoing, those numbers will continue to skyrocket and skyrocket to the \npoint that it will bankrupt and break this country financially.\n  What an indictment of a generation: Faced with a reality and the \npredictability of a situation, we are spending days around here with \nthe inability to come together and make the tough, hard decisions the \nAmerican people have elected us to do. That is the tragedy in some \nways. I respect the fact we need a break and people are going home, but \nit is so troubling to me we are going to do this at a time and leave \nthese issues hanging in the balance.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, will the Senator yield for a moment?\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be happy to yield to my colleague.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I want to respond to what the Senator \nwas saying, that this trajectory is very likely to continue. Every \nsignal and every prediction is it is going to continue and we will hit \nthat 35 percent, spending a third of our entire economy just on health \ncare, and that really does break our country. It is a terrible \nindictment of our generation if we allow it to happen.\n\n  But we also have a great opportunity here, which the chairman has \nalso pointed out. As you know, over and over again, as the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer knows, over and over again, in \nlegislation, we are asked to make hard choices between two things, and \nif you go one way, you cannot go the other. Economists would call it a \nzero sum game. You cannot have both. There is no win-win.\n  This is a situation where there is a win-win. As the distinguished \nchairman pointed out, we are spending 17 percent of our gross domestic \nproduct on health care in this country. It is the worst record, the \nhighest expenditure, of any country in the world. Most other developed \nnations spend 8 or 9 percent. That is the average of the European Union \nof their gross domestic product on their health care.\n  For that exaggerated expenditure, what do we get? Lousy health \noutcomes. We are way behind our developed competitor nations in \nobesity. We have far higher rates of obesity in our country. We are way \nbehind in child mortality. We have far greater rates of child mortality \nin the United States than there are in our developed nations with which \nwe compete. There is far greater longevity in those countries than \nours. Americans do not live as long as people in our competitor \nnations, the developed ones, and a lot of it has to do with our health \ncare system.\n  So by bending that curve, by investing in prevention, by improving \nthe quality by investing in electronic health records, by eliminating \nthose medical errors, we accomplish two things at once. We improve the \nhealth statistics of our Nation, we have people who live long, we have \nless babies who die in childbirth, we have a thinner and less obese and \nless ill nation, and we lower the costs, and we do it together.\n  So it should be something we could agree on, on both sides of the \naisle, but, unfortunately, these old canards about socialized medicine \nand how we\n\n[[Page S8975]]\n\ncould not possibly have a public option--except for the fact we already \nhave it in half our States, including our own; but we are not going to \ntalk about that right now, we are just going to say we could never have \nit--that is the quality of the debate, when we have this huge win-win \nin front of us.\n  I hope everybody has a chance to sort of think about this over the \nbreak when we are gone and that we can come back with a new spirit of \nbipartisanship to really address this problem, seize that win-win, \nchange the cost curve down, and solve this problem for the American \npeople.\n  I will make one last point.\n  We have misled the public a little bit in our discussion, and we have \ndone so because of the Congressional Budget Office and its professional \ncapabilities. The Congressional Budget Office is very good at \npredicting what costs are going to be. So everybody has heard that our \nbill might be $600 billion, that the Finance bill might be $900 \nbillion. They see the costs and they say: Well, how could you possibly \nbe talking about savings when all we hear about are costs? All CBO can \nsay about savings is that--and this is a quote--large reductions in \nhealth care costs are possible--large reductions. But they cannot \nquantify it. They cannot give us a number. And they have told us why \nthey cannot give us that number.\n  They cannot give us that number because we can give the Obama \nadministration, here in Congress, the tools to solve this problem. We \nalready passed the electronic health records legislation. If, God \nwilling, we pass the chairman's legislation from the HELP Committee, \nthey will have the tools to improve the quality and turn the curve. \nThey will have the tools to improve prevention and turn the curve. They \nwill have the tools to reduce the unnecessary, wasteful administrative \nfighting between doctors and hospitals and insurance companies, that \ntry not to pay them. That whole fight can disappear or at least shrink \na lot, and that will help turn the curve.\n  But CBO cannot predict how effectively the Obama administration will \ndo that. Like any CEO, the President of the United States and his staff \nare going to have to manage this problem, and that is where the savings \nwill come. So people should not be misled that there are not real \nsavings possible. Not only are they possible, they are mandatory. We \nhave to turn this curve, and we have to do it dramatically. We can do \nit because we could drop our GDP expenditure of this by 50 percent and \nstill have health care as good, if not better, than all of our \ncompetitor nations: France, New Zealand, Canada, England, Holland--all \nthese countries--Japan. We can do it.\n  The promise is out there. We should not let the CBO scoring fool the \npublic. That is my last point.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I will relieve the \ndistinguished Presiding Officer so he can speak as the Senator from \nColorado.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will do the same. And, again, my thanks to \nSheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. He has just been a stellar advocate \nof the kind of change we need.\n  I know the Presiding Officer, as well, as a new Member of this body, \nhas spent an inordinate amount of time on these questions, as well, in \nhis own State and has listened to people in Colorado talk about this \nissue and what we can do together to get it right. I welcome his \nparticipation immensely as well.\n  I wish all of my colleagues a very healthy and safe break in the \nmonth of August, as I do for all Americans. But I hope my colleagues \nwill keep in mind, I did not recite these numbers to put anyone on the \nspot. But sometimes we need to talk about numbers that are real to \npeople, and these are real numbers that will potentially affect many of \nour fellow citizens. So we need to come back here with a renewed \ncommitment to get this done.\n  We have the capability. We have good people here who care, I know, \nabout these issues. And none of these decisions we can make are going \nto necessarily predict with absolute certainty that everything is going \nto work as well as we hope they would. But you have to begin. And we \nhave to take a chance and work forward and hope these ideas we put on \nthe table work. And to the extent they do not, you modify and change \nit, as will certainly be the case in the years ahead. But inaction, \njust saying no, is unacceptable. The answer ``no'' to health care ought \nto be rejected by every citizen in this country. This is a difficult \nproblem, but being too difficult is an excuse that history will never \nforgive us for. It will never tolerate that excuse: This was too hard \nto do. When you think about previous generations and hard choices and \ndifficult decisions, we wouldn't be here today if those generations had \nquit because it was too hard. We are here today because they made hard \nchoices, they made the difficult decisions, and we have no less of a \nresponsibility as a generation to do it on this issue. This is hard and \nit is difficult, but that will never be an acceptable answer to future \ngenerations if we bankrupt our country because we couldn't figure out \nhow to solve this problem.\n\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8975-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8975]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        COMMENDING RICHARD BAKER\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about a man who has \nbeen serving the U.S. Senate for almost 35 years. Now that is how I and \nmany other Senators may begin remarks about a colleague who is \nretiring. My remarks today are indeed about a colleague but not about a \nfellow Senator. These remarks are about Senate Historian Richard Baker, \nan important member of the Senate community who has made the Senate a \nbetter institution during his tenure.\n  Remarkably, until 1975 the U.S. Senate did not have a Historical \nOffice charged with preserving the institutional memory of this great \nbody. Dick Baker is the original and only Director and the Chief \nHistorian for the past 34 years. Under his leadership, the Historical \nOffice of the Senate has worked to recover, catalogue and preserve the \nhistory of the Senate.\n  Building this office from the ground up required Dick Baker and his \nteam to collect and maintain records on current and former Senators, \nrecord oral histories, document important precedents, statistics and \nSenate activities. And as a photographer I must point out that this \nwork included the cataloging and preservation of a huge trove of \nSenate-related photographs.\n  From the beginning, Dick Baker knew his responsibility at the \nHistorical Office was not only to preserve the history of the Senate \nbut to make it more accessible. That included providing access to \nrecords for members, staff, media and scholarly researchers. He exposed \nmore of the Senate and its rich history to the general public through \nexhibits in the office buildings, presenting materials via the Web and \nworking with C-SPAN to incorporate Senate history into its programming. \nAnd as an author, Dick Baker disseminated information with his \npublications on Senate history, including a biography of the former \nSenator from New Mexico, Clinton P. Anderson.\n  His greatest impact on me, however, and I believe the Senate as a \nwhole, has been his placing of our work here in proper context. Most \nSenators and I look forward to the historical ``minutes'' that he \npresents at the opening of many of our caucus lunches. He has also been \naccessible to me and other Senators in providing presentations of the \nSenate history at many different venues. My staff and I thoroughly \nenjoyed a presentation he provided to us on the history of the Vermont \nSenate delegation. His alacrity and care for describing Senate history \nhas reminded all of us about the significance of our work here.\n  As much as visitors feel the weight of history when they enter this \nbuilding, it is no less important for those of us who represent them to \nbe well aware of the 200-year history of the Senate. It is important to \nremember that although great men and women preceded us, and even \ngreater ones will undoubtedly follow, our words and actions will \ncontinue to echo through these halls long after we are gone. Dick has \nreminded us of that regularly, and for that we thank him and wish him \nwell.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8975-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8975-S8976]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         COMMENDING RON EDMONDS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is fitting that we in the Senate take \nnote of the retirement of Ron Edmonds of the Associated Press, a \nveteran news photographer who has long and superbly documented public \nlife in the Nation's Capital, including here on Capitol Hill.\n\n[[Page S8976]]\n\n  If by chance we have not seen Ron himself over the years on the White \nHouse driveway or in the Senate's hearing rooms and hallways, we all \nsurely recognize his work. His images, in the parlance of \nphotographers, have bracketed the history of our era, from marches on \nWashington, to the attack on President Reagan's life--a photograph for \nwhich Ron Edmonds was awarded a Pulitzer Prize for spot news \nphotography.\n  By now he has covered the White House for 28 years and captured the \nnews in images of so many Presidents. He entered the world of \nphotography in the day of celluloid film and concluded his career after \nhaving helped usher in the age of digital news photography.\n  I am grateful to have known Ron during his long career. I wish him \nand his family our congratulations and our best wishes.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record Ron Edmonds' \nfarewell message to his AP associates.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                   Retirement Message of Ron Edmonds\n\n                               July 2009\n\n       After twenty-eight years of covering the White House for \n     the Associated Press, I have decided to retire and spend some \n     time with my family. I know you usually hear this excuse from \n     politicians who have just been caught with their hands in the \n     cookie jar or with a high-priced companion; but, in this \n     instance, spending time with my family is my true reason, ok \n     maybe a little fishing as well.\n       I have had one of the most fantastic jobs in the world. It \n     has allowed me to work with some of the greatest journalists \n     in the world and to make images of some of the biggest events \n     in the last thirty years. I hope that in some small way, I \n     have helped the Associated Press maintain its prominence as \n     the number-one news organization.\n       I will never forget the experiences that I have been \n     allowed to take part in: such as, walking through the \n     Forbidden City in China or walking around Red Square with \n     Ronald Reagan; ducking behind an inadequate rock in the \n     Iranian desert as Iraqi artillery shells exploded around us; \n     or, more pleasantly, drinking lemonade with King Hussein and \n     Queen Noor at their summer home in Aqaba, Jordan; and boating \n     down the Nile and strolling through the Valley of the Kings \n     in Egypt with then-Vice President Bush.\n       I have spent many sleepless nights mulling over this \n     decision. It is difficult to leave my many friends here and \n     around the world at the Associated Press. But I have great \n     hopes for a continued bright future for the AP.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize the Bove family \nof Burlington, VT, on receiving a prestigious honor from the National \nAssociation of Specialty Food Trades. In particular, I congratulate \nMark Bove, President of Bove's, and his brother Rick, on receiving the \nGold Sofi Award in the Outstanding Pasta, Rice and Grain category.\n  Bove's Restaurant opened on Pearl Street in Burlington in 1941 and \nhas been a local favorite for generations. Marcelle and I enjoyed many \nof Bove's Italian specialties while we were dating. I was a student at \nSaint Michael's College, and Marcelle at the Jeanne Mance School of \nNursing. To this day, Bove's continues to be a favorite among college \nstudents, and many return to the restaurant as alumni during their \nreunion weekends.\n  Much to our delight, Mark Bove began bottling his family's \noutstanding sauces for sale in grocery stores and now also sells Bove's \nspecialties, including meatballs and lasagna, at retail sites around \nour country. When I come home from a long day in the Senate, I am \ndelighted that Marcelle and I can still enjoy a dinner from Bove's, \njust as we did as students years ago. We have also enjoyed sharing \ntheir great dishes with other Senators and their staff at the annual \nTaste of Vermont in Washington.\n  Once again, I congratulate the Bove family for this high honor. I ask \nunanimous consent to have a copy of a July 6 article from the \nBurlington Free Press printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n             [From the Burlington Free Press, July 6, 2009]\n\n             Business Monday: Bove's Wins Gold for Lasagna\n\n       Bove's famous frozen lasagna has been awarded the National \n     Association of Specialty Food Trades' prestigious Gold Sofi \n     Award in the Outstanding Pasta, Rice and Grain Category.\n       The all-natural, hand crafted lasagna is a frozen version \n     of the popular classic served at Bove's cafe on Pearl Street \n     in Burlington.\n       A year ago Mark Bove, president and sauceboy, introduced \n     the world to his family's recipe on The Food Network's \n     ``Throwdown with Bobby Flay,'' soon followed by an appearance \n     on ``The Today Show,'' where Bove prepared his lasagna for \n     Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford.

Mr. President, I rise today to honor and pay tribute to my \ngood friend and colleague an extraordinary public servant and tireless \nadvocate for the people of his cherished State of Minnesota, Senator \nNorm Coleman. I want to express my most sincere gratitude for his \nlongtime friendship and my enormous admiration for him and his \nimpressive litany of accomplishments. And although I am saddened by his \ndeparture from this esteemed Chamber, I know with utmost certainty that \nSenator Coleman's exceptional contributions to Minnesotans and the \nAmerican people will continue well into the future.\n  I am proud to say that Senator Coleman and I served together over his \n6 remarkable years in the Senate, and I would like especially to \nexpress my immense gratitude for his pivotal role on the Committee on \nSmall Business and Entrepreneurship over that span of time, where I \nserved first as chair and now as ranking member. Senator Coleman was \nalways a reasoned and passionate voice on the committee, and his \nindelible impact is indisputable. Whether it was our work together on \nThe Small Business Health Fairness Act of 2005, The Small Business \nDisaster Response and Loan Improvements Act of 2006, or a number of \nother measures and issues, Senator Coleman, true to the founding \ntradition of the U.S. Senate, continually addressed the concerns of his \nconstituents, while at the same time making the best decisions for this \nNation.\n  And I especially well recall our joining forces over the winter of \n2006 when natural gas and home heating oil prices had skyrocketed in \nMaine, Minnesota, and numerous other cold weather States, turning a \ncrucial problem of years past into an urgent crisis that required \nimmediate congressional attention. With the level of funding allocated \nin the budget, states could not maintain the Low-Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, LIHEAP, an initiative I have long championed which \nprovides vital funding to our country's low-income families and \nelderly.\n  Recognizing both the plight of Minnesotans and all affected Americans \nfrom the beginning of this crisis, Senator Coleman and I, among others, \nbattled to shed light on this emergency early by calling for the \npassage of a bill to provide additional LIHEAP funding to states. \nSenator Coleman was an instrumental catalyst in our successful effort \nto pass this bill to the benefit of countless Minnesotans, Mainers, and \nother untold Americans across this land. And for that, I will be \nforever grateful!\n\n[[Page S8977]]\n\n  With a career in public service of more than 30 years, begun in 1976 \nwhen he was chief prosecutor for the Minnesota Attorney General's \noffice, Senator Coleman possessed an unfailing determination to \nadvocate on behalf of the people of Minnesota that has never faltered \nor waned. Prosecuting cases around the State while further developing a \ngrowing concern for community issues, Senator Coleman was eventually \nnamed Minnesota State solicitor general. And his outstanding trajectory \nof leadership was just taking off, for it was then--in 1993--that Norm \nbecame mayor of St. Paul, during which time, with his hallmark \noptimism, he steered the course of the capital city through a \ntransformational revitalization effort.\n  And so, it came as no surprise that Norm Coleman, after he was sworn \nin as a U.S. Senator, hit the ground running. And let me say from the \noutset, Senator Coleman's was a welcomed voice in an era of increasing \npartisanship, especially at a time when ideology has been held in \ngreater value by many of our Nation's elected officials than service to \nthe American people, when too often the slogans and sound bytes of \ncampaigning never stop, and the governing all too frequently never \nbegins, and where public disenchantment with politics runs high. \nSenator Coleman's desire to look beyond this regrettable status quo, \nembracing instead the long-held tenets of collaboration and \ncooperation, could not have been more central as our chamber sought to \nenact laws to genuinely improve the lives of Americans.\n  As I reflect on my friend's illustrious tenure in the Senate, I \ncannot help but recall in instance after instance on imperative matters \nof far-reaching consequence how Senator Coleman was able to transcend \nparty politics and seek solutions and results for the betterment of his \nState and country. For example, Senator Coleman, along with Senators \nDurbin and Lincoln, was a leading proponent, supporting The Small \nBusiness Health Options Program Act or The SHOP Act which would once \nand for all finally level the playing field for American small \nbusinesses and the self-employed and allow them to pool together \nnationally to receive a host of new, affordable, and quality coverage \noptions.\n  Norm, like the rest of us, understood all too well that health \ninsurance market reform and coverage policies in The SHOP Act must be \nincluded in broader health reform legislation. We will miss his voice \nas the health care debate moves forward and as we strive to build a \nconsensus on landmark, health care legislation. But make no mistake, \nSenator Coleman was integral in helping lay the foundation for \nachieving meaningful and sustainable health care reform.\n  Placing his country and constituents above political expediency, \nSenator Coleman and I joined together in support of passage and \neventual enactment of The Fair Equity Act, bipartisan legislation aimed \nat increasing pay equity in America and protecting victims of wage \ndiscrimination into law. We have labored to extend key, renewable \nenergy tax credits to expand the indispensable State Children's Health \nInsurance Program or S-CHIP. We stood side by side in the fight to \nallow Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices, and we joined together \nto help block proposed cuts in Medicaid. I want to thank Norm, who has \ntruly been a stalwart soldier in arms, for his resolve and will on a \ncross-section of issues that have defined his term in the Senate as a \nmodel of governance that ought to be more prevalent.\n  In that vein, I cannot convey enough what a privilege it was to serve \nin the Republican Main Street Partnership with Senator Coleman--an \norganization that my husband, Jock, formerly chaired. Founded in 1998 \nto promote thoughtful leadership in the Republican Party and to join \nwith individuals, organizations, and institutions that share centrist \nvalues, the partnership has unfortunately witnessed a decline in our \nranks in recent years. But the message and impact of the organization \nare intrinsically connected to our capacity to truly achieve \nbipartisanship and garner results on behalf of those who elected us, \nand Senator Coleman embodied that ethos with integrity and distinction.\n  In fact, Senator Coleman characterized the Main Street's message well \nwhen he said, ``this isn't about marching to a single tune. This is \nabout being able to listen and work with like-minded colleagues, bring \nthose perspectives, and hopefully play a role in the resolution of \nthings that bottom line are good for the people of Minnesota.'' Well, \nhis actions not only aided Minnesotans, but also Mainers and Americans \nof every stripe and background across this great land.\n  And yet, despite all of his exemplary achievements, his greatest \naccomplishment is undeniably his wonderful family and the love and \ndevotion he has for his wife Laurie, and their two children, Jacob and \nSarah. So, it is with a profound honor that I join with his family, and \nhis many friends, in praising Norm for his tireless stewardship of the \ncommon good and phenomenal commitment to public service, and for a \ntenure that enfolds his legacy into the rich, longstanding Senate \ntradition of Minnesota.\n  And so to my colleague and good friend, Norm, let me say, you have \nbeen a shining example of bipartisanship and comity that transcends \npolitics, and you will be sorely missed. As you embark on this next \nchapter and as you consider your next endeavors be they public or \nprivate, I urge you, in the immortal words of the poet Alfred Lord \nTennyson, ``to strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.''\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I join my colleagues in appreciation and \nadmiration of Senator Norm Coleman. Norm has been a faithful public \nservant to the people of Minnesota, a principled leader, and a good \nfriend. He made a difference here in Washington, and I feel privileged \nto have served with him in the U.S. Senate.\n  Norm and Laurie arrived in Washington at the same time as Sandy and \nme. We experienced many of the same challenges and adjustments that \nfreshman Senators face, and we encouraged each other by facing them \ntogether. Norm and I found we shared a common approach to solving \nproblems, and partnered to advance legislation whenever we could.\n  Norm said his best ideas came from the people of Minnesota, and they \ncan be proud of what he achieved in Washington. Norm supported \nconservation programs to protect his State's lakes, rivers, and \nwoodlands. He had a real heart for children, especially those suffering \nfrom cancer or waiting to be adopted into loving homes. He was a \nchampion of private-sector initiatives in alternative energy, including \nclean coal, wind power, and biomass technologies. Norm exposed fraud at \nthe United Nations, waste in the Medicare Program, and tax evasion by \ndefense contractors. Norm voted to put John Roberts and Samuel Alito on \nthe U.S. Supreme Court. Norm consistently supported our troops in Iraq \nand Afghanistan and he believed in their mission.\n  Some of my strongest memories of Norm were formed during our trip to \nIraq in January of 2008, about a year after President Bush announced \nour surge of forces there. Norm had joined many Senators in supporting \nthe surge, despite the political risk that support entailed. He \nunderstood that the strategy and leadership of GEN David Petraeus was \nAmerica's best chance to succeed in Iraq.\n  Norm and I, along with Senator Johnny Isakson, visited Baghdad \ntogether. We had dinner with General Petraeus and Ambassador Ryan \nCrocker, and discussed how we could facilitate political reconciliation \nin Iraq. We met with General Ray Odierno to discuss the new mission of \npopulation security, as well as the progress they were seeing in \nreducing violence and U.S. casualties. We toured a marketplace in \nwestern Baghdad, where U.S. and Iraqi forces had helped bring back \nshopkeepers and their customers by driving out insurgents and \nterrorists.\n  During our visit, I got to see the Norm Coleman that Minnesotans know \nvery well. At Maverick Security Station in Baghdad, I saw Norm honor \ntroops who hailed from the Twin Cities and throughout his State. At a \nmeeting with Iraqi civilian leaders, I saw him offer encouragement to \nSunnis, Shias, and Kurds working to build a free and democratic nation \nin the heart of the Middle East. And wherever we traveled, I saw his \neasygoing manner, his wry sense of humor, and his appreciation of the \nhonor bestowed on him by his fellow Minnesotans.\n  Norm ran a tough race for reelection last fall, a race that lasted \nfar longer\n\n[[Page S8978]]\n\nthan the Minnesota winter. He mounted a legal challenge based on a \nclear principle: no Minnesotan should be disenfranchised. As chairman \nof the National Republican Senatorial Committee, I was proud to support \nNorm as he pursued his case in the courts. And once the courts had \nspoken, I respected the grace with which he conceded the race, and the \noptimism he has shown for his own future, and that of our country.\n  Norm accomplished much in Washington, but I think he remains proudest \nof what he achieved closer to home. After Minnesota's hockey team moved \nto my home state of Texas back in 1993, Mayor Norm Coleman of St. Paul \nled the effort to bring the National Hockey League back to the Twin \nCities. Since the first puck dropped in 2000, the Minnesota Wild have \nsold out every game they have played, and every fan owes a debt of \nthanks to Norm Coleman.\n  I too am thankful for Norm Coleman, because he set a good example for \nall of us. He never let public service go to his head. He always put \nhis faith and family first. He fought hard to keep his seat, but never \nfailed to keep his cool.\n  I wish Norm and Laurie the very best, as their journey together \ncontinues.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8978-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8978]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            PROTECTING TENANTS AT FORECLOSURE IMPLEMENTATION\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, for too long, tenants have been the innocent \nvictims of the foreclosure crisis. Countless tenants across the country \nhave been forced to leave their homes simply because their landlords \nwere unable to pay their mortgages. Too often, these tenants had no \nidea that the property was even under foreclosure until the authorities \narrived at their door to inform them that they must vacate the property \nimmediately.\n  I was pleased to work with Senator Kerry to include the Protecting \nTenants at Foreclosure Act of 2009 in the recently enacted Helping \nFamilies Save their Homes Act. This new law protects tenants facing \nevictions due to foreclosure by ensuring they can remain in their homes \nfor the length of the lease or, at the least, receive sufficient notice \nand time to relocate their families and lives to a new home. The full \nSenate approved the bill on May 6, 2009, and President Obama signed it \ninto law on May 20, 2009.\n  These protections are so important that my colleague Senator Kerry \nand I want to ensure that families and mortgage holders know their \nrights and obligations under the law.\n  Under the new law, all bona fide tenants who began renting prior to \ntransfer of title by foreclosure of their rental property must be given \nat least 90 days' notice before being required to vacate the property. \nIn addition, these bona fide tenants are allowed to remain in place for \nthe remainder of any leases entered into prior to the transfer of title \nby foreclosure. These leases may be terminated earlier only if the \nproperty is transferred to someone who intends to reside in the \nproperty and only if the tenants are given at least 90 days' notice of \nthe fact of such sale. Successors in interest to properties with \nsection 8 housing choice voucher tenants automatically assume the \nobligations of the former owner under the housing assistance payments \ncontract.\n  These basic protections are the law for tenants in every State, \nunless States have laws or practices that provide greater protections. \nI want to ask Senator Kerry, the original author of the act, if I have \ncorrectly expressed the intent of this legislation.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I was pleased to work with Senator Dodd to \nenact this legislation to help tenants affected by foreclosures.\n  No one in the Senate has worked harder to fight against the scourge \nof foreclosures than Chairman Dodd. As a former member of the Senate \nBanking Committee, I know Chairman Dodd has tirelessly fought to assist \nlow and moderate-income families and to help tenants who need \nprotections from foreclosures or unscrupulous landlords. Without his \nefforts, families in Connecticut and across the Nation would not have \naccess to critically needed protections and many more American families \nwould be facing foreclosure.\n  I agree with Chairman Dodd that it is important that persons and \nentities acquiring properties by foreclosure follow the law, and that \ntenant families obtain the benefits the law was intended to provide.\n  I also agree with Chairman Dodd's statement of the intent of the \nlegislation. As the chairman stated, the law was intended to provide \nall bona fide tenants, who began renting prior to transfer of title by \nforeclosure of their rental property, be given at least 90 days' notice \nbefore being required to vacate the property. In addition, these bona \nfide tenants are allowed to remain in place for the remainder of any \nleases entered into prior to the transfer of title by foreclosure. \nThese leases may be terminated earlier only if the property is \ntransferred to someone who intends to reside in the property and only \nif the tenants are given at least 90 days' notice of the fact of such \nsale. Successors in interest to properties with section 8 housing \nchoice voucher tenants automatically assume the obligations of the \nformer owner under the Housing Assistance Payments contract.\n  Both the Federal Reserve and the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment have acted quickly to issue notifications to the entities \nthat they regulate describing the law in the same way. Their \nnotifications stated how regulated institutions are expected to comply \nwith the terms of the act. These regulatory actions are crucial for the \nproper implementation of the act because foreclosing entities, who \noften wind up owning the properties after the foreclosure, have a \nresponsibility to obey the law. Families in these precarious \ncircumstances should not be forced individually to assert their rights \nunder the law.\n  Mr. DODD. I agree with Senator Kerry. Again, I thank the Senator for \nbringing the original legislation forward and working with me to enact \nit. I look forward to working with Senator Kerry and all my colleagues \nto ensure that families' rights under the law are known and protected.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8978-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8978-S8979]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             DROUGHT RELIEF\n\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I speak on behalf of the farmers and \nranchers of Texas. Like millions of Americans in other States, Texans \nlove the land. From the hill country to the river valleys--from the \npanhandle to the gulf coast--our land helps define who we are.\n  And for many Texans, the land is their livelihood. One in seven jobs \nin our State is tied to agriculture. We lead the Nation in several crop \nand livestock industries--including the production of cattle and \ncotton. Texas farmers and ranchers help feed and clothe Americans in \nevery State--and in dozens of countries around the world.\n  Our farmers and ranchers are tough people--and they are seeing tough \ntimes. Central and south Texas is experiencing some of the driest \nconditions in the country today. Seventy counties in our State are \nexperiencing extreme or exceptional drought--the two worst \nclassifications made by the USDA. These areas represent 42.5 million \nacres--about 25 percent of Texas--and nearly equal to the total land \narea of New England.\n  The drought has severely impacted Texas farmers and ranchers. \nAccording to one recent study, economic losses will reach $3.6 billion \nby the end of this year--a little less than $1 billion in livestock \nlosses--and the rest in crop losses.\n  A few weeks ago, I met with some ranchers and farmers in San Angelo, \nTX. They shared with me how drought conditions were devastating \nproduction--even as the recession weakened demand. They also asked me a \nquestion: Where was the money Washington promised to help them through \nthese tough times?\n  Their question is the same question I am asking today: Where is the \nmoney Congress authorized last year for the Supplemental Revenue \nAssurance Program?\n  The SURE Program was included in the farm bill we passed in June of \n2008. It received broad bipartisan support. It created a trust fund of \nabout $3 billion a year to help farmers and ranchers during tough \ntimes.\n  Yet despite becoming law more than a year ago, the SURE Program has \nstill not been implemented by the USDA. Not a single farmer or rancher \nhas received any assistance from the trust fund so far. No payments had \neven been\n\n[[Page S8979]]\n\nplanned before December of this year--as it is the lowest of five \npriorities within USDA's disaster assistance program.\n  On July 16, I wrote Secretary Vilsack. I asked him to tell me when \nour farmers and ranchers can expect to receive the assistance Congress \nauthorized for them. I also cosponsored Senator Hutchison's amendment \nto the Agriculture appropriations bill, which expresses the sense of \nthe Senate that USDA should expedite the drought relief we approved \nlast year.\n  This week, I spoke to Secretary Vilsack as he was traveling in Kenya. \nHe told me that the SURE Program should be finalized by September, \nwhich is encouraging news. He also said that the Department's \nantiquated record-keeping, as well as new demands imposed on USDA in \nthe stimulus bill, have prevented this program from being finalized \nsooner.\n  Nevertheless, Mr. President, I am frustrated that we are discussing \nmore money for cash for clunkers--when we should be asking: Where's the \ncash for crops? Where's the relief for ranchers?\n  Other Senators may be asking a third question: Why should I care? I \ncan think of two reasons.\n  First, Texas isn't the only State susceptible to drought conditions. \nThe Lone Star State is experiencing the worst of it now, but many other \nStates in the South and West could experience similar conditions in the \nfuture. The SURE Program was created for farmers and ranchers in all of \nour States--so we all have a stake in seeing this program implemented \nquickly and successfully.\n  Second, the implementation challenges of this program should be on \nour minds as we consider expanding or creating new programs. Mr. \nPresident, the SURE Program isn't a complicated program. It is a fairly \nstraightforward disaster assistance initiative. This shouldn't be a \nheavy lift for the Federal bureaucracy.\n  Yet if a simple program like this takes a year or more to get off the \nground--Senators really should pause and take a deep breath before we \ncreate a vast new Federal bureaucracy to run a complicated cap-and-\ntrade scheme, take control over one-sixth of our economy in the name of \nhealth care reform, or dump more taxpayers' dollars into the Cash for \nClunkers Program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8979-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8979-S8980]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PSORIASIS AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today to bring attention to the \nserious, debilitating, chronic diseases of psoriasis and psoriatic \narthritis. August is Psoriasis Awareness Month, and I urge you to \nsupport S. 571, the Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research, Cure, \nand Care Act for 2009--important legislation that I have cosponsored \nwith my colleagues.\n  This legislation will fill important gaps in psoriasis and psoriatic \narthritis data collection and research, and is an important step in \nproviding relief to the as many as 7.5 million Americans that the \nNational Institutes of Health, NIH, estimates suffer from these non-\ncontagious, genetic autoimmune diseases.\n  Psoriasis is the most prevalent autoimmune disease, yet is widely \nmisunderstood, minimized, and undertreated. Between 10 and 30 percent \nof people with psoriasis also develop psoriatic arthritis, which causes \npain, stiffness and swelling in and around the joints. Without \ntreatment, psoriatic arthritis can be disabling. Of serious concern is \nthat people with psoriasis are at elevated risk for myriad co-\nmorbidities, including but not limited to, heart disease, diabetes, \nobesity, and mental health conditions. Psoriasis and psoriatic \narthritis impose significant burdens on individuals and society. \nPsoriasis alone is estimated to cost the Nation 56 million hours of \nlost work and between $2 billion and $3 billion annually.\n  The Psoriasis and Psoriatic Arthritis Research, Cure, and Care Act \nwould help combat the pain, suffering, and stigma of psoriasis and \npsoriatic arthritis by expanding psoriasis research conducted by the \nNIH and strengthening patient data collection on these diseases by \nestablishing a national psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis patient \nregistry through the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The \nbill also directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to convene \na summit to discuss issues and opportunities in psoriasis and psoriatic \narthritis research. Finally, the bill calls upon the Institute of \nMedicine to conduct a study and issue a report on recommendations with \nrespect to access to care for people with psoriasis and psoriatic \narthritis. Taken together, these efforts will help reduce and prevent \nsuffering from these conditions.\n  I would like to take a moment to recognize Paula Blount, a National \nPsoriasis Foundation volunteer whose 6-year-old daughter Hannah has \npsoriasis. While this disease is physically painful, for a child, the \nemotional pain can be just as debilitating. In the summer months, \nlittle Hannah endured many stares and rude remarks at the public pool. \nHer psoriasis was particularly bad, covering a large portion of her \nsmall body. Paula eventually bought a pool for the backyard so her \ndaughter could swim at home without being teased and embarrassed. It is \nimportant that we do all we can to work with groups like the National \nPsoriasis Foundation to raise awareness about the disease and to fight \nthe stigma that this serious autoimmune disease is just a case of ``dry \nskin.''\n  In my home State of Oregon there are over 89,000 of my constituents \nliving with psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. I encourage my \ncolleagues to meet with psoriasis patients in your States to learn more \nabout psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, and work to reduce the \nmisconceptions surrounding these conditions. I further urge you to join \nwith me and other colleagues in supporting people with psoriasis by \ncosponsoring S. 571.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President. I ask unanimous consent that the letter \ndated August 6, 2009, from Consumers Federation of America, et al., be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n         Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, \n           Consumers Union, National Consumer Law Center, U.S. \n           Public Interest Research Group,\n                                                   August 6, 2009.\n     Re Deceptive Loan Check Elimination Act.\n\n     Hon. Jeff Merkley,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Merkley: We congratulate you on introducing \n     legislation to protect consumers from the risks of credit \n     marketed via unsolicited checks that can be signed and \n     deposited, obligating consumers to repay high cost loans. The \n     Deceptive Loan Check Elimination Act fills a gap in \n     protections against mailing unsolicited credit devices that \n     has existed since Congress prohibited banks from mailing live \n     credit cards to consumers in the 1970's.\n       Checks mailed as part of credit solicitations represent the \n     loan principal, not just a credit line. Once these checks are \n     ``cashed,'' the borrower becomes obligated for a relatively \n     large debt generally at a high interest rate and prohibitive \n     terms. This marketing device poses significant costs on \n     consumers, given identity theft and its repercussions. First, \n     consumers are harmed if these checks are cashed by someone \n     other than the named borrower. Given the ease with which \n     incoming mail can be stolen from mail boxes or diverted by \n     others in a household, marketing by unauthorized live check \n     loans is a risk to consumers who did not request credit. The \n     cost to consumers includes the time and money spent \n     correcting credit reports and notifying lenders about \n     fraudulently arranged debt as well as reduced credit scores \n     until the fraudulent item is corrected, which can take \n     months. Second, live loan checks present a ``free money'' \n     temptation for consumers struggling to make ends meet, who \n     may not have the ability to pay back the check loan.\n       No device that extends credit and obligates borrowers \n     should be sent without express request from consumers. It is \n     high time that Congress complete the job started over thirty \n     years ago to prohibit creditors from mailing out live credit \n     devices to consumers who did not request them and that can be \n     used to obligate consumers and damage credit ratings.\n       We look forward to working with you as this bill moves \n     through the legislative process. Please contact Jean Ann Fox, \n     CFA.\n           Sincerely,\n     Jean Ann Fox,\n       Consumer Federation of America.\n     Chi Chi Wu,\n       National Consumer Law Center (on behalf of its low income \n     clients).\n     Linda Sherry,\n       Consumer Action.\n     Edmund Mierzwinski,\n       U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n     Pamela Banks,\n       Consumers Union.\n\n[[Page S8980]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8980-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8980-S8981]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                                 YEMEN\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Obama administration has rightly \nfocused much of its attention not on Iraq but on the region of the \nworld that most threatens our national security--the Pakistan-\nAfghanistan region. This was long overdue. The lost time has greatly \ndamaged our national security and left us with fewer options in South \nAsia. I continue to be concerned, however, that the escalation of our \nmilitary efforts in Afghanistan could further destabilize Pakistan, \nwhere the leadership of al-Qaida and Afghan Taliban operate and where \nPakistani Taliban elements are seeking to extend their reach. I \nexpressed these concerns, among other places, at a hearing of the \nSenate Foreign Relations Committee to Ambassador Richard Holbrooke, the \nadministration's envoy to the region. Ambassador Holbrooke conceded \nthat the concern was real and that, while the administration was aware \nof the risk, they could not rule out these unintended consequences. \nTestifying before the same committee a week later, Admiral Mullen made \nsimilar comments.\n  The war in Afghanistan is inextricably linked to the al-Qaida safe \nhaven in the FATA and the Afghan Taliban safe haven in Balochistan, as \nwell as to the current conflict in the Northwest Frontier Province and \nto the rest of Pakistan. It is not the same war throughout the region \nand it would be a mistake to perceive a monolithic enemy. But we need \nto consider the consequences of our actions and those of our partners \nthroughout the region.\n  Last year, I made a trip to Peshawar in the Northwest Frontier \nProvince. There I met the province's leadership, as well as the \nextraordinary Americans working in our consulate there. During and \nafter my trip, I expressed concern about the impact of deals made \nbetween the government and the Pakistani Taliban. Tragically, however, \nthe situation in the NWFP got worse. Increasing violence in Peshawar \nincluded the killing of USAID employees and an attack on our top \ndiplomat there. And the Pakistani Taliban's reach into Swat became \nbroader and more radical, further threatening our national security and \nthat of Pakistan. These advances must be permanently rolled back, just \nas safe havens in the FATA cannot be allowed to stand.\n  But it is not enough for us to throw our support behind the Pakistani \nmilitary incursions. This is a critical moment in which it matters how \nPakistan seeks to reassert its control. The displacement of over 2 \nmillion civilians, delays in assistance to and the return of the \ndisplaced, and a failure to ensure coordinated and accountable \ncivilian-led security to the people all pose serious risks. Internal \nconflicts fuel terrorist recruitment and can create new safe havens. So \nwhile we have a clear interest in the success of one side--the \nPakistani Government--we also have a clear interest in how this \nconflict is waged and how it is resolved.\n  At the same time, we must focus more attention beyond the safe havens \nand instability in South Asia, particularly on Yemen and Somalia. The \nthreat from al-Qaida affiliates in those countries, as well as from al \nShebaab, is increasing. Weak states, chronic instability, vast \nungoverned areas, and unresolved local tensions have created almost \nideal safe havens in which terrorists can recruit and operate. They \nhave also attracted foreign fighters including, in the case of Somalia, \nAmericans. Al-Qaida's long tentacles reach into these countries, and \nour efforts to track individual operatives are critical, just as they \nare in Pakistan. But, while we should aggressively pursue al-Qaida \nleaders, we will not achieve our long-term strategic goals if we think \nabout counterterrorism primarily as a manhunt or if we assume there is \na finite number of terrorists in the world. Conditions in places such \nas Yemen and Somalia create and attract new ones. That is why press \nstories suggesting that operatives from Pakistan are relocating, while \ntroubling, ignore the larger strategic picture. Because of conditions \non the ground, al-Qaida affiliates in Yemen and Somalia are perfectly \ncapable of expanding their reach and capabilities on their own. And the \nbest way to stop them is to address head-on the reasons--frequently \nunique to the countries in which they are operating--for their success.\n  The threats to our national security in Yemen are serious and are \ngetting worse. News last month about the murder of as many as nine \nhostages in Yemen, which Yemeni officials have linked to groups \naffiliated with al-Qaida, is a reminder of the increasing violence \nthere. As in Peshawar, our diplomats have been in the crosshairs, with \nthe attack last September on our Embassy in Sana'a. And, as our State \nDepartment has warned, al-Qaida in Yemen's recruitment remains strong, \nand its tactics indicate high levels of training, coordination, and \nsophistication. Any serious effort against al-Qaida in Yemen will \nrequire the engagement of the government, whose capabilities and \ncommitment are extremely weak. Yemen is a fragile state whose \ngovernment has limited control outside the capital. It is also \ndistracted from the counterterrorism effort by two other sources of \ndomestic instability--the al-Houthi rebellion in the north and tensions \nwith a southern region with which Sana'a was united less than 20 years \nago. In other words, counterterrorism is hampered by weak governance \nand by internal conflicts that would not appear on the surface to \nthreaten our interests. Our only choice, then, is to develop a \ncomprehensive policy toward Yemen that places counterterrorism within a \nbroader framework that promotes internal stability, economic \ndevelopment, transparency, accountability, and the rule of law.\n  And we must do this while considering the obstacles to repatriating \nthe approximately 100 Yemeni detainees currently detained at Guantanamo \nBay. I have spoken out about security gaps in Yemen, particularly with \nregard to the escape from detention of a terrorist operative \nresponsible for the attack on the USS Cole. I support the closing of \nGuantanamo, but with so many of its detainees hailing from Yemen, we \nneed to take an honest look at the weaknesses in Sana'a's justice and \nsecurity systems and consider whether there is anything we can do about \nthem.\n  Instability in Yemen is, of course, directly linked to conflict in \nthe Horn of Africa. Earlier this year, the pirate attack on a U.S. \nvessel briefly raised awareness of maritime insecurity fostered by a \nlack of effective governance and insufficient naval capacity on both \nsides of the Gulf of Aden. This problem continues, even when it is not \non the front pages, and is both a symptom and a driver of overall \ninstability in the region. Meanwhile, refugees from the conflict in \nSomalia are fleeing to Yemen. According to a recent U.N. report, thirty \n30,000 have crossed the Gulf of Aden this year with thousands more \npreparing to do so. The human cost to this exodus, as well as the \npotentially destabilizing affects, demand our attention. Finally, Yemen \nis linked to the Horn of Africa through arms trafficking that violates \nthe U.N. embargo on Somalia and fuels the conflict there.\n  The threat in northern Somalia is, or should be, more apparent now \nthan ever. Last October, terrorists attacked in Somaliland and \nPuntland. These are regions--and regional governments--for which we \nhave little in the way of policy. I am not arguing that we recognize \ntheir independence, but it is in our national interest to engage them--\ndiplomatically and economically--and to promote stability there. I have \nspoken frequently, and for years, about the need for a comprehensive \npolicy for the Horn of Africa. Serious attention to the unique \nconditions in Somaliland and Puntland must be part of that policy.\n  Meanwhile, the raging conflict in central and southern Somalia is \nworse than ever, as a beleaguered transitional government fights a \nstrengthened al Shebaab and allied militias. Foreign fighters have come \nto Somalia to fight alongside al Shebaab, including Americans, one of \nwhom was implicated in the October terrorist attacks. Al-Qaida in East \nAfrica thrives on the instability and has even expanded its support \nnetwork south, into parts of Kenya. Yet for far too long, our policy \ntoward Somalia has been fragmented or nonexistent. Our counterterrorism \napproach has been primarily tactical and has failed to confront the \nreasons why Somalia is not just a safe haven for al-Qaida in East \nAfrica but a recruiting ground for increasing numbers of fighters--\nSomali and foreign--who are drawn to a conflict that is fueled by local \nand regional forces. That is why a comprehensive policy must include a \nserious, high-level commitment\n\n[[Page S8981]]\n\nto a sustainable and inclusive peace and why all elements of the U.S. \nGovernment need to work together toward common goals.\n  As in Yemen, the key to a successful strategy is the recognition that \ndestabilizing factors in the region are linked to threats to the United \nStates. Thus, separatism in the Ogaden or Somali region of Ethiopia, \nthe ongoing Ethiopian-Eritrean border disputes, and the ways in which \nthese tensions motivate the policies of these countries toward Somalia \nmust factor into our broader regional strategy. This is complex, to be \nsure. But we simply have no other choice--we must recognize the \ncomplexity, understand it, and devise policies that address it.\n  This administration has a historic opportunity. And there are \nindications that lessons are being learned. The Director of the \nNational Counterterrorism Center--whom the President rightly kept on \nfrom the previous administration--recently said the following:\n\n       This is a global struggle for al-Qaida, but if we think \n     about it too much as a global struggle and fail to identify \n     the local events that are truly motivating people to join \n     what they view as a global struggle, we will really miss the \n     boat. We have to try to disaggregate al-Qaida into the \n     localized units that largely make up the organization and \n     attack those local issues that have motivated these \n     individuals to see their future destiny through a global \n     jihad banner.\n\n  This is the strategic framework that we have been waiting for, and it \nis encouraging.\n  But statements such as these are only the beginning. To effectively \nfight the threat from al-Qaida and its affiliates, we have to change \nthe way our government is structured and how it operates.\n  First, we need better intelligence. Recent reforms to our \nintelligence community have focused on tactical intelligence--on \n``connecting the dots.'' We have not tackled the gaps in strategic \nintelligence. We need to improve the intelligence that relates directly \nto al-Qaida affiliates--where they find safe haven and why. But we also \nneed better intelligence on the local conflicts and other conditions \nthat impede or complicate our counterterrorism efforts. And we need \nbetter intelligence on regions of the world in which the increasing \nmarginalization of communities, resentments against local government, \nor simmering ethnic or tribal tensions can result in new safe havens, \nnew pools for terrorist recruiting, or simply distractions for one of \nour counterterrorism partners.\n  Second, we need to fully integrate our intelligence community with \nall the ways in which our government, particularly the State \nDepartment, openly collects, reports, and analyzes information. This \nintegration, which was the goal of legislation that I introduced in the \nlast Congress with Senator Hagel and that twice has won approval from \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, is a critical component of strategic \ncounterterrorism. Without it, we will never understand the conditions \naround the world--most of them apparent to experienced diplomats--that \nallow al-Qaida affiliates to operate, nor will we be able to respond \neffectively.\n  Third, this integration of clandestine intelligence community \nactivities and open information gathering must include the allocation \nof real resources to the right people. This is fundamental. We can no \nlonger afford to have budget requests driven by the equities and \ninfluence of individual agencies, rather than interagency strategies. \nAnd while Congress should do its part, real reform must be internalized \nby the executive branch.\n  Fourth, we need to recognize that when whole countries or regions are \noff limits to our diplomats, we have a national security problem. We \nknow that regional tensions in Yemen, clan conflicts in Somalia, and \nviolent extremism in Pakistan all contribute to the overall terrorism \nthreat. But if our diplomats can't get there, not only will we never \ntruly understand what is going on, we won't be able to engage with the \nlocal populations. In some cases, we can and should establish new \nembassy posts. For years, I have pushed for such an initiative in \nnorthern Nigeria, a region where clashes between security forces and \nextremists have taken hundreds of lives in recent weeks. In some cases, \nthe security concerns are prohibitive. But there, we cannot just turn \nour backs; our absence doesn't make the threats go away. Instead, we \nshould develop policies that focus on helping to reestablish security, \nfor the sake of the local populations as well as for our own interests.\n  Fifth, we need strong, sustained policies aimed directly at resolving \nconflicts that allow al-Qaida affiliates to operate and recruit. These \npolicies must be sophisticated and informed. We have suffered from a \ntendency to view the world in terms of extremists versus moderates, \ngood guys versus bad guys. These are blinders that prevent us from \nunderstanding, on their own terms, complex conflicts such as the ones \nin Yemen or Somalia or, to inject two other examples, Mali and Nigeria. \nThey have also led us to prioritize tactical operations--DOD strikes in \nSomalia, for example--without full consideration of their strategic \nimpact. Conversely, we have viewed regional conflicts as obscure and \nunimportant, relegating them to small State Department teams with few \nresources and limited influence outside the Department. This must \nchange. Policy needs to be driven by the real national security \ninterests we have in these countries and regions, and our policies need \nto be supported by all elements of the U.S. Government. That includes a \nreal recognition that, sometimes, policies that promote economic \ndevelopment and the rule of law really are critical to our \ncounterterrorism efforts, and they need real resources and support from \nthe whole of our government.\n  Mr. President, after 7 years of an administration that believed it \ncould fight terrorism by simply identifying and destroying enemies, we \nnow have an opportunity to take a more effective, comprehensive, long-\nterm approach. The President, in his speech in Cairo, reached out to \nMuslims around the world. The Director of the NCTC has stressed the \nneed to address local conditions in the global struggle against al-\nQaida's affiliates. The Secretary of State has committed to aggressive \ndiplomacy around the world. And the Secretary of Defense has \nacknowledged the need to increase the role and resources of other \nagencies and departments. Now, however, the real work begins. Changing \nthe way the government, and Congress, for that matter, understands and \nresponds to the national security threats facing us will not be easy. \nBut we have no time to wait.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8981-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8981-S8982]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 45TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE WILDERNESS ACT\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, as founder of the Senate Wilderness and \nPublic Lands Caucus, I led a Senate resolution commemorating the \nupcoming 45th anniversary of the Wilderness Act of 1964. I am delighted \nthe Senate passed this resolution last night, and am very pleased that \nSenator McCain joined me in leading this effort. I also thank our other \ncolleagues for their support as cosponsors: Senators Lamar Alexander, \nEvan Bayh, Michael Bennet, Barbara Boxer, Sam Brownback, Ronald Burris, \nRobert Byrd, Maria Cantwell, Benjamin Cardin, Susan Collins, Chris \nDodd, Dick Durbin, Dianne Feinstein, Judd Gregg, John Kerry, Joe \nLieberman, Robert Menendez, Jeff Merkley, Patty Murray, Mark Udall, Tom \nUdall, George Voinovich and Ron Wyden.\n  This Wilderness Act was signed into law on September 3, 1964, by \nPresident Lyndon B. Johnson, 7 years after the first wilderness bill \nwas introduced by Senator Hubert H. Humphrey of Minnesota. The final \nbill, sponsored by Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico, passed the \nSenate by a vote of 73-12 on April 9, 1963, and passed the House of \nRepresentatives by a vote of 373-1 on July 30, 1964.\n  The Wilderness Act of 1964 established a National Wilderness \nPreservation System ``to secure for the American people of present and \nfuture generations the benefits of an enduring resource of \nwilderness.'' The law gives Congress the authority to designate \nwilderness areas, and directs the federal land management agencies to \nreview the lands under their responsibility for their wilderness \npotential.\n  Under the Wilderness Act, wilderness is defined as ``an area of \nundeveloped federal land retaining its primeval character and influence \nwhich generally appears to have been affected primarily by the forces \nof nature, with the imprint of man's work substantially unnoticeable.'' \nThe creation of a\n\n[[Page S8982]]\n\nnational wilderness system marked an innovation in the American \nconservation movement--wilderness would be a place where our \n``management strategy'' would be to leave lands essentially \nundeveloped.\n  The original Wilderness Act established 9.1 million acres of Forest \nService land in 54 wilderness areas. The support for wilderness has \ncontinued through the 111th Congress with the creation of 52 new \nwilderness areas in the Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009. \nToday, the wilderness system is comprised of over 109 million acres in \nover 750 wilderness areas, across 44 States, and administered by 4 \nFederal agencies: the Forest Service in the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture, and the Bureau of Land Management, the Fish and Wildlife \nService, and the National Park Service in the Department of the \nInterior.\n  As we in this body know well, the passage and enactment of the \nWilderness Act was a remarkable accomplishment that required steady, \nbipartisan commitment, institutional support, and strong leadership. \nThe U.S. Senate was instrumental in shaping this very important law, \nand this anniversary gives us the opportunity to recognize this role.\n  As a Senator from Wisconsin, I feel a special bond with this issue. \nThe concept of wilderness is inextricably linked with Wisconsin. \nWisconsin has produced great wilderness thinkers and leaders in the \nwilderness movement such as Senator Gaylord Nelson and the writer and \nconservationist Aldo Leopold, whose ``A Sand County Almanac'' helped to \ngalvanize the environmental movement. Also notable is Sierra Club \nfounder John Muir, whose birthday is the day before Earth Day. \nWisconsin also produced Sigurd Olson, one of the founders of The \nWilderness Society.\n  I am privileged to hold the Senate seat held by Gaylord Nelson, a man \nfor whom I have the greatest admiration and respect. He is a well-known \nand widely respected former Senator and former two-term Governor of \nWisconsin, and the founder of Earth Day. In his later years, he devoted \nhis time to the protection of wilderness by serving as a counselor to \nThe Wilderness Society--an activity which was quite appropriate for \nsomeone who was also a cosponsor, along with former Senator Proxmire, \nof the bill that became the Wilderness Act.\n  The testimony at congressional hearings and the discussion of the \nbill in the press of the day reveals Wisconsin's crucial role in the \nlong and continuing American debate about our wild places, and in the \ndevelopment of the Wilderness Act. The names and ideas of John Muir, \nSigurd Olson, and, especially, Aldo Leopold, appear time and time again \nin the legislative history.\n  Senator Clinton Anderson of New Mexico, chairman of what was then \ncalled the Committee on Interior and Insular Affairs, stated that his \nsupport of the wilderness system was the direct result of discussions \nhe had held almost forty years before with Leopold, who was then in the \nSouthwest with the Forest Service. It was Leopold who, while with the \nForest Service, advocated the creation of a primitive area in the Gila \nNational Forest in New Mexico in 1923. The Gila Primitive Area formally \nbecame part of the wilderness system when the Wilderness Act became \nlaw.\n  In a statement in favor of the Wilderness Act in the New York Times, \nthen-Secretary of the Interior Stewart Udall discussed ecology and what \nhe called ``a land ethic'' and referred to Leopold as the instigator of \nthe modern wilderness movement. At a Senate hearing in 1961, David \nBrower of the Sierra Club went so far as to claim that ``no man who \nreads Leopold with an open mind will ever again, with a clear \nconscience, be able to step up and testify against the wilderness \nbill.'' For others, the ideas of Olson and Muir--particularly the idea \nthat preserving wilderness is a way for us to better understand our \ncountry's history and the frontier experience--provided a justification \nfor the wilderness system.\n  I would like to remind colleagues of the words of Aldo Leopold in his \n1949 book, ``A Sand County Almanac.'' He said, ``The outstanding \nscientific discovery of the twentieth century is not the television, or \nradio, but rather the complexity of the land organism. Only those who \nknow the most about it can appreciate how little is known about it.''\n  We still have much to learn, but this anniversary of the Wilderness \nAct reminds us how far we have come and how the commitment to public \nlands that the Senate and the Congress demonstrated 45 years ago \ncontinues to benefit all Americans.\n  I would like to recognize the following organizations for their \nefforts to continue protecting our wild places: American Rivers, Alaska \nWilderness League, Campaign for America's Wilderness, Earthjustice, \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Pew Environment Group, Republicans \nfor Environmental Protection, Sierra Club, Southern Utah Wilderness \nAlliance, and The Wilderness Society.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8982-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8982-S8983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          WOMEN'S EQUALITY DAY\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL. Mr. President, in observance of the upcoming Women's \nEquality Day on August 26, 2009, I wish to pay tribute to the women \nsoldiers and civilians of the U.S. Army who serve and defend our great \ncountry each day--whether in garrison communities here in the United \nStates, like at Ft. Leonard Wood in my native Missouri, or on the front \nlines of battle in places like Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places \naround the world.\n  Although women did not receive equal treatment or recognition while \nserving in the military during the Civil War or the wars of the 20th \ncentury, they now serve in many roles and capacities in the Active, \nGuard and Reserve components and perform equally as well as their male \ncounterparts. Today's Army fighting women are critical to the success \nof the Army's mission, and their sacrifice on the battlefield \ndemonstrates a clear call to duty that transcends any supposed gender \nlimitations.\n  One such example of this bravery is Silver Star recipient SPC Monica \nBrown, who, when her convoy was attacked while on patrol in \nAfghanistan, disregarded a hail of enemy fire that threatened her own \nlife and jumped into action in her role as a medic to pull wounded \nsoldiers to safety and render lifesaving aid to them. I also think \nabout the heroic actions of SGT Leigh Ann Hester, another Silver Star \nrecipient and military police platoon leader. When Sergeant Hester and \nher fellow soldiers were ambushed south of Baghdad, she bravely led her \nunit through an insurgent ``kill zone'' and into a flanking position to \nassault the enemy with fire, killing three insurgents herself.\n  These acts of selflessness are also mirrored in the spirit of \nvolunteerism and commitment that Army civilian women exhibit as they \ndeploy to combat zones wherever the Army needs them. Like their male \ncounterparts, these women are serving honorably and selflessly as \narchitects, doctors, nurses, lawyers, structural engineers, \nlogisticians, and in scores of other occupational specialties. And like \nour military women, they do justice to the millions of women who \npreceded them in history to fight for equal rights for women in \nAmerica.\n  As we celebrate the great accomplishments of women in the military on \nWomen's Equality Day, it is imperative that our Nation and leaders \ncontinue to evaluate additional opportunities for military service by \nwomen. While women have achieved and contributed so much to the Army \nand the overall military mission, some barriers still exist.\n  I look forward to a day when more combat aviation and ground \noccupational specialties will be open to women, for instance. I look \nforward to a day when there will be more women in the general officer \nranks to accompany my good friend GEN Ann Dunwoody, the Army's first \nand only female four-star general in its entire 234-year history. Our \nmilitary and government must never slow its commitment to giving women \nthe access to the full range of opportunities that the military has to \noffer. In doing so, I am confident that these few remaining barriers \nwill fall.\n  I strongly encourage my fellow members to honor Women's Equality Day \non August 26 by thanking the military and civilian women of the U.S. \nArmy and their families of their States for their commitment, bravery \nand unflinching support to our great Nation.\n\n[[Page S8983]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8983-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                      NATIONAL HEALTH CENTER WEEK\n\n  Mr. JOHNSON. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the week of \nAugust 9, 2009, as National Health Center Week. National health centers \nprovide care to 18 million people a year throughout the United States, \nthrough services at Community, Migrant, Homeless and Public Housing \nHealth Center delivery sites. I wish to take the opportunity in a week \ndedicated to these sites to promote awareness on the expansive role \nthey play in the health care of some of our Nation's most underserved \ncitizens. It is important to recognize that at a time when health care \ncosts have increased considerably across the country, these health \ncenters have continued to serve an increasing number of patients \nwithout compromising the quality of care.\n  The Community Health Center Program, which operates in communities \nthat are designated as medically underserved, has played a particularly \nimportant role as a health safety net provider in my State of South \nDakota. Significant barriers limit access to quality health care for \nthousands of South Dakotans. The successful efforts of our State's \ncommunity health centers have helped reduce many of these barriers by \nproviding quality care to our State's low-income citizens. These health \ncenters provide onsite dental, pharmaceutical, mental health, and \nsubstance abuse services that are often hard to come by in rural \ncommunities. In South Dakota, more than 50,000 patients received care \nin 2007, 40 percent of whom were uninsured and an additional 25 percent \nwere covered under Medicaid.\n  I strongly support this model of health care delivery and commend the \nhard work of those in South Dakota and across the Nation in providing \naccessible, high-quality health care to those most in need.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8983-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               WIPA AND PABSS REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2009\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, I urge the Senate to pass by unanimous \nconsent the WIPA and PABSS Reauthorization Act of 2009--H.R. 3325--\nwhich was passed recently by the House of Representatives. The bill \nwill extend, for 1 year, two programs that provide important assistance \nfor Social Security and supplemental security income, SSI, disability \nbeneficiaries who would like to return to work.\n  Both of these programs were included in the Ticket to Work and Work \nIncentives Improvement Act of 1999, which passed Congress with \nbipartisan support. Under the Work Incentives Planning and Assistance, \nWIPA, program, the Social Security Administration, SSA, funds \ncommunity-based organizations to provide personalized assistance to \nSocial Security and SSI disability beneficiaries who want to work, by \nhelping these beneficiaries understand SSA's complex work incentive \npolicies and the effect that working will have on their benefits. This \nprogram can help to reduce the fears many beneficiaries have about \nattempting to return to work.\n  Under the Protection and Advocacy for Beneficiaries of Social \nSecurity, PABSS, Program, SSA awards grants to protection and advocacy \nsystems to provide legal advocacy services that beneficiaries need to \nsecure, maintain, or regain employment. The PABSS Program also provides \nbeneficiaries with information and advice about obtaining vocational \nrehabilitation and employment services.\n  The Finance Committee and other committees in Congress have received \ntestimony from disability advocates and other stakeholders about the \nimportance of these programs to increasing employment among disability \nbeneficiaries.\n  The Social Security Administration is currently authorized to spend \n$23 million annually from its administrative budget to fund the WIPA \nProgram, and $7 million annually to fund the PABSS Program. However, \nthe authorization for both programs expires on September 30, 2009.\n  This bill will extend the WIPA and PABSS Programs for 1 year, with no \nchanges, while the relevant committees in Congress consider a longer \nterm reauthorization. This 1-year extension will ensure that these \nprograms can continue to provide disability beneficiaries with the \nassistance they need to return to work.\n  I thank my colleagues for their support for temporarily extending \nthese important programs.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8983-3", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8983]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              SNAKE HEADWATERS WILD AND SCENIC DESIGNATION\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I wish to speak on the Craig Thomas \nSnake Headwaters Legacy Act of 2008.\n  Shortly before Craig Thomas passed away, he introduced legislation, \nS. 1281, to protect the Snake River headwaters. His goal was to \ndesignate hundreds of miles of river in northwest Wyoming as wild and \nscenic. At the time, Senator Thomas stated that this designation would \nbe a ``badge of honor'' for these rivers.\n  On May 15, 2007, the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources \nSubcommittee on National Parks held a hearing on S. 1281. Senator \nThomas invited Jack Dennis, a world renowned fly fisherman, to testify \nin support of the bill.\n  During his testimony Jack Dennis eloquently made the case for wild \nand scenic designation stating ``Without hesitation, the rivers and \nstreams of the Snake River Headwaters are the most stunningly beautiful \nin the world.'' Jack further testified that ``To walk these rivers and \nhear the music of the rivers, to see beavers swimming out of the lodge, \nto watch an elk come down to the river to drink at sunrise--these \nrivers touch all our souls.''\n  On Sunday, August 9, 2009, I will be participating in a community \nevent in Jackson Hole, WY, to officially designate the Snake River \nheadwaters as wild and scenic. I will be joining Susan Thomas, Jack \nDennis, and hundreds of grassroots organizations and individuals who \nnever gave up.\n  Like so many others, the river touched Craig's soul. This coming \nSunday, we will finish the task Craig Thomas started. It is a \nremarkable accomplishment--388 miles of river dedicated as wild and \nscenic, 388 miles of pristine water that will be protected for the \nenjoyment of future generations.\n  What an honor indeed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8983-4", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8983-S8984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  SENATE EMPLOYEES' CHILD CARE CENTER\n\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the Senate \nEmployees' Child Care Center for 25 years of service.\n  The Senate Employees' Child Care Center opened its doors on February \n27, 1984, as the first childcare center on Capitol Hill. Its successful \nopening is attributed to the dedication and hard work of Senate \nMembers, employees, and their families.\n  The center has grown, much like the children and Senate families it \nhas served. On opening day, the center had 27 children enrolled from \nthe ages of 18 months to 5 years. By comparison, the center today has \ngrown to a full enrollment of 68 children from the ages of 10 weeks to \n5 years.\n  The center first opened in what was known as the Immigration Building \nand is now the Capitol Police headquarters. As it outgrew that space, a \nnew facility was constructed nearby. Enrollment and growth continued, \nnecessitating the construction of a new facility in December of 1999.\n  While many things have changed over the past 25 years, such as the \nlocation, number of children served, and the faces of teachers and \nfamilies, one constant is this: the Senate Employees' Child Care Center \nremains a first-class facility. Families continue to appreciate the \ncomfort of knowing their children are in a safe and enriching \neducational environment. In fact, many families refer to the Center as \na ``school'' rather than a daycare facility.\n  We and our staffs strive for excellence. The Senate Employees' Child \nCare Center does the same. In 1989, it became the first center in \nWashington, DC, to achieve accreditation from the National Association \nfor the Education of Young Children, NAEYC. This accreditation is the \n``gold standard'' for early childhood education, and the center has \nmaintained it continuously since 1989.\n  As in the early days, families with children enrolled in the center \nare encouraged to be involved in its daily operations. Many families \nspend their lunch hours doing ``nap duty,'' others\n\n[[Page S8984]]\n\nserve on the Board of Directors, and others assist with special \nclassroom projects. Parental involvement fosters a cooperative \nenvironment and further contributes to the center's excellence.\n  The greatest asset of the Senate Employees' Child Care Center is its \nteachers. One of the original teachers, Phyllis Green, continues to \nprovide lessons that will serve children well throughout their lives. \nShe is one of many dedicated professionals who connect with both \nchildren and parents in very special ways.\n  I offer my congratulations to the Senate Employees' Child Care Center \non achieving this milestone and best wishes for many more years of \nservice.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I rise to join my colleague Senator \nBennett to recognize the 25th anniversary of the Senate Employees' \nChild Care Center's founding and to congratulate the SECCC on its many \nyears of service to the Senate.\n  The original families and those who have followed share many memories \nof their experiences with the SECCC. They recall the development of a \nplayground in what is now Senate Parking Lot 19; the center's role in \nthe creation of the congressional holiday ornaments; the day the \nchildren watched as the sculpture Mountains and Clouds was installed in \nthe Hart atrium; and the annual Fourth of July parade, with the \nchildren dressed in red, white and blue as they march from the child \ncare center to the Hart Office Building. Most important, they speak of \nthe growth and development of their children.\n  The Senate is well served by the Senate Employees' Child Care Center \nand the staff members who work there. I want to thank the center for \nits 25 years of service to the Senate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8984-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            BASEBALL HALL OF FAME INDUCTEE JAMES EDWARD RICE\n\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, today I ask the Senate to join me in \nrecognizing James Edward Rice on the occasion of his induction into the \nNational Baseball Hall of Fame on July 26, 2009. Mr. Rice is a superior \nathlete who has made his home State of South Carolina very proud.\n  Mr. Rice was elected in this, his 15th and final year on the Baseball \nWriters Association of America, BBWAA, election ballot, with 76.4 \npercent of the vote. He becomes the third player in Hall of Fame \nhistory to be elected by the BBWAA in his final year of eligibility, \nand he is certainly deserving of this honor.\n  Jim Rice spent his entire 16-year big league career playing with the \nBoston Red Sox. Fenway Park was his second home, and he certainly gave \nthe Red Sox organization and fans plenty to cheer about. Mr. Rice \nplayed his first game for the club in late 1974, and his career took \noff shortly thereafter. In 1975 he ended the season as runner-up for \nRookie of the Year, second to his own teammate Fred Lynn. After \novercoming injuries, Mr. Rice finally settled in and was selected as \nthe American League Most Valuable Player, MVP, in 1978, and throughout \nthe rest of his career he finished in the top five of the MVP selection \nfive other times.\n  An Anderson, SC, native, Mr. Rice, or ``Ed'' as he was known growing \nup, found himself in a challenging time of social change. After the \npublic schools were integrated shortly before his senior year of high \nschool, he was sent into a new environment where, according to \nAlexander Edelman with the Baseball Biography Project, his ``engaging \npersonality and gentle charm won over most . . . and helped ease the \nracial tension that accompanied integration.'' He quickly made quite an \nimpact in the athletic arena as a member of the football, basketball, \nand baseball teams. He was an all-State kick returner, defensive back, \nand wide receiver. But it was his prowess on the baseball diamond that \ncaught the most attention, and he was drafted in the first round of the \namateur entry draft at only 18 years old.\n  Mr. Rice was an incredible asset to the Boston Red Sox, but perhaps \nhis most memorable moment with the team had nothing to do with his \nabilities on the field. On August 7, 1982 Jonathan Keane, a 4-year-old \nboy attending his first game in Fenway Park, was sitting along the \nfirst base line when he was struck in the head with a line drive foul \nball. Alarmed that no one was reacting quickly enough, Jim Rice leapt \nfrom the dugout and into the stands. Instinctively he picked up the \nunconscious boy and, cradling him, ran straight to the clubhouse where \nthe trainer and ambulance were waiting. Tom Keane, Jonathan's father \nwho was with him that day, recalled the event and noted, ``In times \nlike that, you really see the quality of the character of the people \ninvolved. Jim Rice is a really humble guy. He doesn't want to take \ncredit for doing anything out of the ordinary . . . I think that's an \nunderstatement of what he did that day. He may very well have saved my \nson's life.''\n  Jim Rice played his final game with the Boston Red Sox on August 3, \n1989, but returned to the organization from 1995 through 2000 as a \nhitting coach. On November 1, 1995 he was inducted into the Red Sox \nHall of Fame in its inaugural class. His plaque can be viewed at Fenway \nPark along with two of his Silver Slugger awards. In 1999, Sports \nIllustrated honored him as the ninth best athlete of the 20th Century \nto come out of South Carolina. And in 2001 he was inducted into the Ted \nWilliams Hitters Hall of Fame.\n  Mr. Rice and his wife Corine now reside in Andover, MA, where they \nhave raised their two daughters Carissa and Chancey. And though he is \nnot permanently in South Carolina, his presence is still felt in \nAnderson through a community center named in his honor, the Jim Ed Rice \nCenter.\n  I ask that the Senate join me in honoring him for his impressive \nathletic career and newest honor as an inductee into the National \nBaseball Hall of Fame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8984-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8984-S8985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING THE 437TH AIRLIFT WING\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, Senator Graham joins me today to \ncongratulate the men and women of the 437th Airlift Wing stationed at \nCharleston Air Force Base, SC, for their outstanding service in \ndefending our Nation and for their great achievements at the Air \nForce's Air Mobility Command Rodeo Competition.\n  It is been 8 years since the attacks of 9/11, and the record of \ncontinuous operations for the 437th is an inspiration to us all. \nShortly after the attacks, Charleston leapt into action, dropping \nhumanitarian aid into Afghanistan only hours after bombers began \npounding al-Qaida and Taliban insurgents. Later, when we put boots on \nthe ground, the 437th led the first-ever C-17 combat dirt landing in \nthe barren wilderness of Afghanistan to establish a critical forward \noperating base. Since then, Team Charleston has led the airlift of \nMRAPS to protect our troops in Iraq and Afghanistan and performed some \nof the largest training exercises in Air Mobility Command. Over the \nyears, they have delivered a staggering 1.3 billion pounds of cargo to \nsupport our troops and provide relief for friends and allies around the \nworld.\n  However, when the 437th is not saving lives and delivering freedom, \nthey are winning awards and bringing home trophies. We are especially \nproud of the 437th's accomplishments at the 2009 Air Mobility Command \nRodeo Competition. The 437th competed with more than 100 teams and \n2,500 people from the United States Air Force and allied nations. They \nled the C-17 aircrew competition and finished first in two out of three \ncompetitions, earning trophies for ``Best C-17 Air Refueling Crew'' and \n``Best Short Field Landing Crew.'' Furthermore, Team Charleston \ncontinued their distinguished record of world-class maintenance and \nadded ``Best C-17 Preflight Team'' to their long list of awards. These \nare impressive achievements that bring great credit upon the 437th.\n  We recognize the outstanding achievements of Rodeo team members CPTs \nRobert Lowe, Joseph Beal and Jonathan Magill; MSgt Ricky Clark; \nTechnical Sergeants Harold Bordeaux, Paul Eaton, and Richard Pate; \nSSgts Jessy Martin, Brian Parmerter, Hector Schunior, Nicholas White, \nJohn Paull, and Veronica Bankey; Senior Airmen Dennis Adams and Joshua \nRamalia; and Airman First Class Daniel Jones.\n  I know the Wing is especially proud of the Rodeo team, but on behalf \nof the people in Charleston, the State of South Carolina, and our great \ncountry, Senator Graham and I salute the outstanding work of the 437th.\n\n[[Page S8985]]\n\n  We are amazed by their stories and humbled by the immense burdens \nthey have shouldered. Their dedication, and their families' sacrifices \nare an inspiration, and our country owes them a debt of gratitude for \ntheir patriotic service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8985-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    AFGHAN NATIONAL SECURITY FORCES\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, we have embarked on a new course in \nAfghanistan. The plan has 21,000 troops and trainers engaged primarily \nin clearing the Taliban in Kandahar and Helmand provinces. We know from \ncounterinsurgency doctrine that we must now hold the areas that have \nbeen cleared.\n  I speak today on the need for expanding the Afghan National Army and \nPolice. They must do the holding of those areas taken by our forces so \nthat we can build a capable, accountable, and effective Afghan \nGovernment. The August 20 elections will be a crucial milestone in \nAfghanistan's democratic development, and the international community \nstands with the Afghan people as they exercise their freedom to cast \nvotes at more than 7,000 polling stations.\n  Safeguarding the election is a test for the Afghan security forces, \nwhich are leading efforts to secure the polling stations per the plans \nof the Afghanistan Elections Commission. At the same time, the United \nStates and other international partners will continue to support Afghan \nforces. We have increased troop levels this summer, in part, to help \nthe Afghan National Army and Police prepare for the election.\n  As we send an additional 21,000 troops and trainers and hundreds of \ncivilians into Afghanistan, we must do everything in our power to \nprotect these brave men and women in a hostile environment. We must be \neffective and efficient in clearing and holding against insurgents. And \nwe must ensure we have the necessary civilian resources to build a \nsecure and stable environment, in which Afghans can sustain rule of law \nand promote good governance.\n  These goals are critical to our shared counterinsurgency mission. \nSuccess will not be easy or without a great cost or burden. It will \ncontinue to require patience, determination, and an enduring American \ncommitment.\n  As GEN Stanley McChrystal affirmed when he assumed command of \nAmerican and International Security Assistance Force, or ISAF, troops \nin Afghanistan, ``the Afghan people are at the center of our mission. \nIn reality, they are the mission. We must protect them from violence, \nwhatever its nature.'' The Afghan people are at the heart of our \noperations, and the first principle of protecting the population in \ncounterinsurgency is building a strong indigenous security force that \ncan assume control and take the lead.\n  Our military, civilian, and political leadership agree that enhancing \nthe capacity and capability of the Afghan National Army and Afghan \nNational Police is key to an eventual U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. \nBefore we move in this direction, however, we must consider what \nadditional resources are required to help the ANA and ANP become self-\nsufficient.\n  Current estimates indicate the Afghan Army is one fourth of the size \nof the Iraqi Army, where the ongoing insurgency now pales in comparison \nto Taliban-led violence in Afghanistan. This is woefully inadequate if \nwe hope to meet Afghanistan's short-term and long-term security \nrequirements. The same can be said for the Afghan police, which \nprovides the essential services of border security, law enforcement, \ncoordinating counternarcotics, and serving as a paramilitary force.\n  The Afghan National Army and Police must work in tandem on \ncounterinsurgency--one cannot succeed without the other--with the army \n``clearing'' the land of insurgents, and the police ``holding'' to \nensure stability. Progress in ``building'' economic development and \ngovernance cannot be sustained until the security forces succeed in \ntheir mission.\n  Current plans to expand the Afghan National Army to 135,000 and the \nAfghan National Police to 80,000 by 2011 represent a positive step in \nthe right direction but still fall short of the necessary requirements. \nThese numbers are insufficient for the Afghans to independently \nmaintain security and establish rule of law in the long-run, and \ntherefore should be considered critical milestones, but not ceilings, \nfor the training mission.\n  According to the Army/Marine Corps Counterinsurgency Manual drafted \nby General Petraeus in 2006, the requisite number of security forces \nshould not be defined by the number of insurgents. Rather, the size of \nhost nation security forces should be commensurate with the size of the \npopulation. This closely parallels the methodology used to calculate \nthe adequate size for peacekeeping operations, which are determined by \nthe number of inhabitants. Counterinsurgency doctrine, as delineated by \nGeneral Petraeus, recommends a minimum target ratio of 20 \ncounterinsurgents for every 1,000 residents.\n  According to this ratio, in order to secure Afghanistan--a country of \nmore than 33 million--a minimum of 600,000 security forces are needed, \nwhich includes the army and police. Current targets for the ANA and ANP \nbarely reach 40 percent of this minimum requirement. It is clear that \nthese numbers should be increased, and this is why I support doubling \nthe target number for the ANA from 135,000 to 250,000, and increasing \nthe ANP from 80,000 to 150,000.\n  As Secretary Gates has outlined, we must better prepare to fight the \nwars we are in, and recognize that that irregular warfare is not just a \nshort-term challenge. Rather, it is a long-term reality that requires a \nrealignment of both military strategy and spending. And as we continue \nto engage in counterinsurgency, we must recognize those elements of our \nstrategy which are essential to our mission. Chief among them remains \nbuilding the indigenous capacity of the host nation security forces.\n  It is in this regard that I strongly urge my colleagues to join me in \nsupporting an increase in the size of the Afghan national security \nforces. While this may require additional trainers, troops, and \nresources in the short run, it is the only way to ensure the long-run \nstability of Afghanistan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8985-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8985-S8986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    WYOMING'S WORLD WAR II MEMORIAL\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President. I wish today to talk about a special \ngroup of people who live and work with us, side by side in our \nhometowns across America. The terrible days of the Second World War \nproduced an entire generation of men and women who answered the call to \nduty to defend freedom and defeat tyranny in far off lands across both \noceans. They left their homes and families, endured great trials, and \ngave so much of themselves for so many of us in the most difficult of \ncircumstances.\n  These brave men and women served in our Nation's darkest hour. And \nthen they came back home. They went back to work, to school, bought \nhomes, raised families, and continued to build our Nation. Today they \nare our friends and neighbors, our parents and grandparents, our fellow \nAmericans. And we owe them such a tremendous debt of gratitude.\n  Mr. President, on August 15, 2009, the State of Wyoming will dedicate \nits World War II Memorial at the Wyoming Veterans Memorial Park in \nCody, WY. And I am honored to be here on the floor of the Senate to \npersonally give thanks to the many men and women and their families who \nmade such great sacrifices on our behalf during the terrible days of \nWorld War II.\n  The memorial being dedicated and the ceremony itself required a major \ncommitment on the part of those who worked to successfully complete the \nproject. This includes veterans, their families, friends, admirers, and \nall of the people of Wyoming whose hard work and generous contributions \nmade this memorial possible.\n  The Wyoming World War II Memorial is a fitting tribute to all those \nof the Greatest Generation who gave so much for our country. It is \nbecause of them that we all live our lives in freedom and are able to \nexercise the rights guaranteed to us in our Constitution every day. We \nare the grateful beneficiaries of their sacrifices.\n  My father was a veteran of World War II. He fought in the Battle of \nthe Bulge. My wife Bobbi's father was in both World War II and Korea. \nMy dad always told me that I should thank\n\n[[Page S8986]]\n\nGod every day that I live in America and how fortunate I was. He was \nright. This is the greatest country on Earth. And it is because of the \nbrave actions of so many of our fellow countrymen.\n  The Wyoming Congressional delegation had the privilege of greeting a \ngroup of Wyoming's World War II veterans on the National Mall this \nspring. They made the Wyoming Honor Flight trip to Washington from \nWyoming to visit the World War II Memorial. Wyoming's World War II \nveterans are heroes in every sense of the word. They quite literally \nsaved the world. Let Wyoming's new memorial be a monument of our \nendless thanks for all they have secured for us. All of Wyoming, and \nindeed America, says thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8986-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        COMMENDING SALLY HUNTER\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \ndistinguished service of an outstanding Texan, Sally Hunter. Ms. Hunter \nis the recipient of the 2009 Preserve America Elementary History \nTeacher of the Year for Texas. This award recognizes outstanding \nAmerican history teachers from elementary school through high school, \nas well as the crucial importance of American history education. One \nteacher from each State is chosen from thousands of exceptional \nteachers to receive this prestigious award.\n  For almost 30 years, Sally Hunter has served the students of Texas as \nan instructor, mentor, and friend. Through recognizing and cultivating \nuntapped potential within students, she has inspired countless youth to \nbe men and women of character, vision and dedication.\n  Ms. Hunter began serving students as an elementary teacher in Austin \nISD in 1980, and has taught fourth grade since 1995. Since that time, \nshe has positively impacted the lives of thousands of students by \nmaking history personal for them. In keeping with her great love of \nTexas history, Ms. Hunter has traced her very own family back to the \n1850s when they were neighbors of Sam Houston. Ms. Hunter continues to \nencourage and foster the same love of research and history in her own \nstudents so that they may learn more about their own family history.\n  Just 2 days after the fire that destroyed the Governor's Mansion in \nAustin, Ms. Hunter began to write the curriculum This House is Your \nHouse in order to ensure that students would learn about the richness \nof the mansion's history.

Mr. President, today is the 100th birthday of a \nvery special Iowan and a wonderful friend, Ethel Schwengel. One century \nago today, Ethel was born on her parents' family farm near Purdin, MO. \nThis is a bit premature, but I should also note that we are on the cusp \nof yet another remarkable milestone. On August 15, Ethel and her family \nwill celebrate the 78th anniversary of her marriage to the late \nFrederic Schwengel, who represented Iowa in the United States House of \nRepresentatives from 1955 to 1965 and from 1967 to 1973.\n  The Schwengels married in Unionville, MO, in 1931, and moved to \nDavenport, IA, in 1937. There, Ethel worked as an educator, and was \nactive in many civic organizations, including Girl Scouts and the YWCA.\n  When her husband served in the Iowa House of Representatives from \n1944 to 1954, and later during his long service in the U.S. House, \nEthel became a respected and beloved presence in her own right.\n  Ethel was always actively engaged in her husband's campaigns. \nMeanwhile, on the home front, she was a strong stabilizing influence in \nthe Schwengel household during his inevitably frequent absences. She \nwas a tireless and gracious hostess, often responding to last-minute \ncalls from her husband to set additional places at the table for \ncolleagues and visitors.\n  During their years in the Nation's Capital, the Schwengels hosted \n``Washington Week'' for an Iowa State University professor and two of \nhis students, one of whom was a very young and green Tom Harkin. I will \nnever forget their kindness and hospitality during that very eventful \nweek.\n  Ethel joined in her husband's passion for collecting antiques as well \nas Abraham Lincoln memorabilia, which she displayed beautifully in the \nSchwengel house. Another highlight of their home was the Ethel's \ngarden, which featured her prized tomatoes and Fred's beloved rhubarb--\nand little bit of Iowa right in suburban Washington. Ethel was \nespecially proud of her dazzling display of azaleas each spring.\n  Across more than six decades of marriage, Ethel and Fred Schwengel \nwere blessed with a large extended family. They raised two children, \nFrank and Dorothy. Moreover, immediately after marrying, their \nhousehold became home to Fred's brother Forrest and sister Helene. \nLater, Fred's widowed mother joined the household, as did Ethel's \nmother.\n  Following the Second World War, the Schwengels opened their home in \nDavenport to 11 displaced persons from Poland, helping them to learn \nEnglish, find jobs, and become U.S. citizens.\n  In 1966, their grandson, Robert Schwengel, joined the household. When \nhe left for college in 1979, it was the first time in 48 years of \nmarriage that Ethel and Fred Schwengel were without extended family \nmembers in their home.\n  After Congressman Schwengel retired in 1973, he and Ethel continued \nto make their home in Arlington, VA. Mr. Schwengel helped to found the \nU.S. Capitol Historical Society in 1962, and headed that organization \nas its president until his death in 1993. Ethel remains a strong \nchampion of the Historical Society and a member of its Honorary Board \nof Trustees. Their grandson, Dr. Robert Schwengel of Providence, RI, is \na member of the society's active Board of Trustees, and their son-in-\nlaw, Neale Cosby, is its treasurer as well as a trustee.\n  Since that summer many years ago, when the Schwengels took me into \ntheir home for a very memorable ``Washington Week,'' Ethel has been a \nvery dear friend.\n  I am pleased to note that, for the big celebration today, she will be \njoined by family members and friends at her current residence in \nArlington. In addition, there will be a reunion picnic on Saturday at \nher daughter and son-in-law's home at Mason Neck, VA. Ethel will be \njoined at these celebrations by her sister, Florence, age 98; her \nchildren and their spouses; five grandsons and spouses; nine great \ngrandchildren; one niece; two nephews; and four great nephews. Clearly, \nthis is a woman of great wealth--the kind of wealth that really \nmatters.\n  I congratulate Ethel Schwengel on this great milestone. She has \nbrought light into the lives of so many of us in Iowa and here in the \nWashington area. One hundred years since its birth, that light \ncontinues to shine with a very special radiance.\n  Happy birthday, Ethel!\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8986-3", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8986-S8987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  50TH ANNIVERSARY OF TROUT UNLIMITED\n\n Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, it is with great pride that I pay \ntribute to Trout Unlimited, a national conservation organization \nestablished in my home State of Michigan. This exceptional organization \nwas founded in 1959 on the banks of the Au Sable River, near Grayling, \nMI, by 16 concerned Michigan anglers. These anglers, who met in the \nhome of George Griffith, sought to ensure the continued and long term \nhealth of trout, their habitat, and the sport of angling. Today, Trout \nUnlimited boasts more than 150,000 members\n\n[[Page S8987]]\n\nin approximately 400 chapters throughout the United States, including \n23 chapters in Michigan.\n  The founders of Trout Unlimited, or TU, were united by their love of \ntrout fishing and by their growing discontent with the State of \nMichigan's practice of stocking its waters with hatchery-raised fish. \nDriven by the belief that Michigan's trout streams could produce fish \nfar superior in both size and fight to these ``cookie cutter trout,'' \nin 1962-63, TU prepared its first policy statement on wild trout, which \npersuaded the Michigan Department of Natural Resources to curtail \n``put-and-take'' trout stocking and to start managing for wild trout \nand healthy habitat. Buoyed by this success, anglers subsequently \nfounded TU chapters in Illinois, Wisconsin, New York, and Pennsylvania \nwith the mission of conserving, protecting and restoring North \nAmerica's coldwater fisheries and their watersheds.\n  Indispensible to the success and strength of Trout Unlimited are the \nthousands of dedicated members and volunteers. TU members have spent \ncountless hours restoring trout and salmon habitat, and some of the \nmost visible effects have been on hundreds of watersheds nationwide. In \naddition, these members have provided the knowledge and leadership \nnecessary to improve environmental policy on the local, state and \nnational level and to carry out TU's ambitious conservation agenda.\n  Many have contributed significantly to the success of Trout Unlimited \nover the past fifty years. Trout Unlimited has been an important, \nvigilant and effective advocate for coldwater resources in Michigan and \nacross the country. I know my colleagues join me in offering gratitude \nand appreciation to Trout Unlimited for a job well done. Protecting our \nnatural resources and waterways for future generations is a noble \nendeavor, and I look forward to another 50 years of responsible \nenvironmental stewardship.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8987-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8987-S8989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               REMEMBERING REBECCA JANE DALTON WEINBERGER\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I wish to pay tribute to a \ngreat fellow Mainer and a wonderful friend who passed away recently--\nRebecca Jane Dalton Weinberger. Today, I would like to take a few \nmoments to offer a few reflections of my own on Jane's life, as well as \ninclude some of the thoughts that her exceptional son, Caspar \nWeinberger, Jr., has shared regarding his beloved mother--and I will \nask that Mr. Weinberger's statements upon Jane's passing be printed in \nthe Record in their entirety.\n  Born in Milford, ME, Jane was a notable figure in our State. A writer \nand publisher of outstanding children's stories, a tireless community \nvolunteer, a woman who in 1942 met--on a troop ship bound for \nAustralia--a man then referred to as U.S. Army CAPT Caspar W. \nWeinberger, who would become her husband for 63 years not to mention \nSecretary of Defense under President Ronald Reagan!--and above all, an \nextraordinary mother, grandmother, and great-grandmother Jane \nWeinberger was truly beloved by many and will be profoundly missed by \nall of us who were fortunate to know her.\n  Inseparable throughout their 63 years of marriage, Jane and Caspar \nare indisputably now reunited--together once again--their rightful \nstate of being given all that they meant to each other not only in love \nbut in life, and all of its trials and triumphs. Jane and Cap were \npassionately devoted to one another--each drawing strength and \ninspiration from the other's indomitable spirit. In fact, her son tells \nof how, and I quote, ``it was my mother who . . . almost literally \npushed him into his first political campaign as the Republican \ncandidate for the State Assembly from San Francisco's 21st Assembly \nDistrict . . . she did all the campaign things: running the campaign \noffice, calling on potential voters, handing out bumper stickers and \nposters. Jane was a great organizer, and innovator.'' And, I would add \nthat they both served as each other's closest confidante and friend--as \nwell as being husband and wife.\n  And it was Jane who did Caspar the tremendous favor of introducing \nhim to the great State of Maine. Of course, since Jane was a native \nMainer through-and-through, as I mentioned at the memorial service for \nCap Weinberger in 2006, many back home still referred to him as \n``Jane's husband!'' After all, as anyone familiar with Maine \nunderstands, you can never get ``top billing'' unless you were actually \nborn there--even if you were pivotal in the downfall of the Soviet \nUnion and the end of the Cold War!\n  And Jane was a force of nature in her own right. In the words of \nCaspar Weinberger, Jr., ``My mother . . . helped her family hold \ntogether and prosper often under the most trying conditions that can \nonly be truly understood by those who achieve fame and the scrutiny \nwhich go with holding high office in America. She was down to earth and \nsensible, and she was also a woman of great dignity, beauty and courage \n. . . She was instrumental in helping her husband win elective office . \n. . and later (was) a well-known and admired Washington, DC hostess, \nwhile Cap was serving in cabinet positions to three different U.S. \npresidents throughout the 1970's and 80's.''\n  Jane was not only unfailingly dedicated to her family--raising her \nsons, Caspar and Arlin--but also to her community and the world around \nher. Again, to quote Mr. Weinberger, she was ``certainly civically \nminded--she was a volunteer in many an organization for the poor and \nneedy.'' She ``volunteered for many civic duties and charities and \nwriting children's stories,'' and was a former chairwoman of the Folger \nShakespeare Library in Washington, DC; served on the board of Amherst \nCollege in Massachusetts; and for many years served on the Board at \nJackson Laboratories in Bar Harbor. As Cap Weinberger, Jr. wrote, she \nbelieved ``that it was most important to contribute to their good \nefforts in attempting to defeat cancer in every form once and for \nall.''\n  Once the Weinbergers had arrived back in Maine after their years in \nWashington, Jane also started a publishing business she had long \nenvisioned, which was chiefly focused on children's books and which she \nran for more than 20 years with more then 120 titles. And her company \ncame to be acknowledged, as her son put it, as ``not the biggest but \namong the very best.''\n  On a more personal note, certainly, my husband Jock McKernan--Maine's \nformer Governor--and I have deeply treasured our friendship with Jane \nand Cap. Every time we drive by the home they cherished on Somes Sound, \ncalled ``Windswept House'' in Mount Desert, ME, I am reminded of the \n80th birthday party that Jane threw for Cap. And what a wonderful night \nthat was--under the stars of a spectacular Maine summer sky--with \nSecretary Colin Powell and so many others joining in the festivities \nand the laughter. In Caspar Weinberger, Jr.'s words.\n\n       She arranged for a startling and magnificent round of \n     fireworks in his honor. Strangely, twelve years later on the \n     night before her passing, my wife and I witnessed another \n     stunning display of fireworks put on just across the inlet to \n     Somes Sound by a neighbor celebrating a wedding or other \n     special event. While these lights were not really designed in \n     her honor, to us it was highly symbolic, as if her time of \n     respect had come and was recognized. In my view, as well it \n     should have been, for she was most definitely the power that \n     guided my father to the heights of American government.\n\n  Mr. President, Jane Weinberger achieved her own formidable heights \nthroughout her remarkable lifetime, and we have truly lost a leading \nlight in Maine. My profound sympathies go out to Caspar and Arlin as \nwell as Jane's sister, Virginia, and her three grandchildren and five \ngreat-grandchildren at this most difficult of times. Jane will always \nbe in the hearts of those whose lives she touched so deeply.\n  Mr. President, I ask to have printed in the Record Mr. Weinberger's \nstatements to which I referred.\n  The information follows:\n\n                 Mrs. Caspar W. (Jane) Weinberger Dies\n\n       Jane Dalton Weinberger, 91, wife of former President Ronald \n     Reagan's Secretary of Defense, the late Caspar W. Weinberger, \n     died last night, July 12, 2009 in Bar Harbor, Maine. For the \n     last six months, she had been in declining health and was \n     living in a nursing home near her home known as ``Windswept \n     House'' in Somesville, Maine on Mount Desert Island.\n       Born Rebecca Jane Dalton in Milford, Maine, on March 29, \n     1918, Mrs. Weinberger became an Army nurse at the outbreak of \n     World War II. While aboard a troop ship headed to Australia \n     in 1942, she met her husband-to-be, U.S. Army Captain Caspar \n     W.\n\n[[Page S8988]]\n\n     Weinberger. They were married in Sydney and remained together \n     for 63 years until Caspar's death in late March, 2006.\n       While Cap (as Caspar was widely known) pursued a career \n     first as a San Francisco, California lawyer and then a public \n     statesman, Jane dedicated herself to raising a family, \n     volunteering for many civic duties and charities and writing \n     children's stories. She was instrumental in helping her \n     husband win elective office as a California assemblyman in \n     the 1950's and later as a well-known and admired Washington, \n     D.C. hostess, while Cap was serving in cabinet positions to \n     three different U.S. presidents throughout the 1970's and \n     80's.\n       She was a former chairwoman of the Folger Shakespeare \n     Library in Washington and served also on the boards of \n     Amherst College in Massachusetts and the Jackson Laboratory \n     in Bar Harbor, ME. In her early years she was a volunteer at \n     St. Luke's Hospital in the San Francisco Bay Area, and a \n     member of that city's venerable Century Club.\n       After leaving government service in 1987, Cap and Jane \n     retired to their summer home, Windswept House in Mt. Desert, \n     ME. Cap went on to be the Publisher of Forbes Magazine and \n     then became Chairman of the Forbes Group. Jane started and \n     operated her own book publishing house, Windswept House \n     Publishers, for the next twenty years, producing over 100 \n     titles of mostly children's books.\n       Jane and Caspar had two children: daughter Arlin \n     Weinberger, now residing in Marin County, California and son \n     Caspar Jr., presently residing with his wife in Mt. Desert, \n     ME. Jane also leaves her sister, Virginia Garceau of Brewer, \n     ME, daughter-in-law Mavis, three grandchildren, Louise \n     Murray, James Weinberger, Rebecca Werber, and five great \n     grandsons.\n       ``My mother was a wonderful woman who helped her family \n     hold together and prosper often under the most trying \n     conditions that can only be truly understood by those who \n     achieve fame and the scrutiny which go with holding high \n     office in America. She was down-to-earth and sensible, and \n     she was also a woman of great dignity, beauty and courage. \n     She was a wonderful hostess, gave great parties and donated \n     much of her time to helping others in San Francisco, \n     Washington, D.C. and Maine. She was always a loving wife to \n     her husband before his passing in 2006. All of her family \n     will miss her very much, but are glad that she has finally \n     reached a lasting peace,'' her son Caspar Weinberger, Jr. \n     said today.\n       In line with her wishes, there will be no formal services \n     for Jane; her ashes will be scattered on the gardens she \n     loved and tended at her Windswept House. The family asks that \n     in lieu of flowers and cards, donations be made to the \n     Weinberger Foundation, the family non-profit organization, at \n     P.O. Box 860, Mt. Desert, ME 04660.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               Rebecca Jane Dalton Weinberger (1918-2009)\n\n       Dear Editor, I write this letter today with a heavy heart, \n     but also with a sense of pride and certain knowledge that now \n     the journey of my dear parents is finally complete. Rebecca \n     Jane Dalton Weinberger, wife of the late great American \n     statesman, and my father, Caspar W. Weinberger, died late \n     last night, Sunday July 12, at Sonogee Nursing Home in Bar \n     Harbor. The cause was a massive stroke coupled with extreme \n     old age.\n       First and foremost, she was my mother. For all my life, I \n     was close to her and we felt a camaraderie shared by being in \n     the orbit, as well as in the shadow, of a highly famous man. \n     Rebecca Jane Dalton Weinberger was a very strong and yet a \n     most down-to-earth lady of Maine. She was born in Milford, \n     near Old Town, on March 29, 1918. Although she was not into \n     astrology, I am, and believe me my mother was definitely an \n     Aries through and through. By which I mean she was of a fiery \n     temperament, extremely sure of herself, of what was right and \n     what was wrong, but also innovative in spirit and in \n     practice. Aries is the first sign of the Zodiac, symbolizing \n     the initial spark of light and fire. Jane was a good mother, \n     a fine cook, and certainly civically minded: she was a \n     volunteer in many an organization for the poor and needy.\n       What is it with these special New England genetics that \n     seem to breed so many naturally long-living Maine people? I \n     don't really know; perhaps it is just a real love of life \n     regardless of its pain or pleasure, of which my mother surely \n     knew both. Jane was a gardener but that was the limit of her \n     outdoor exercise. She did enjoy swimming, but hardly on any \n     regular body-building schedule. She drank a lot of wine, and \n     heavier spirits when she was younger, although she always \n     controlled herself with not even a suspicion of intoxication, \n     although I am sure on many occasions she was happily drunk. \n     Nevertheless, she still managed always to look elegant and at \n     ease even under the worst of circumstances and she lived to \n     be over ninety-one years old. Given all that she went through \n     in Cap's last years of suffering (he was on dialysis for \n     three years) especially at his passing in the spring of 2006, \n     it is amazing that she still had most of her wits until the \n     very end. She out-lived her husband by three years and she \n     was a great lady to be around.\n       From what I know of her early history, my mother found \n     herself born into a quasi-indigent and somewhat dysfunctional \n     family--her father simply left home one day when she was \n     about eight years old and never came back. But Jane did not \n     quit. By early adulthood she had a nursing degree from the \n     Summerville Nursing Academy and World War II was calling for \n     her services. She was sworn in as a Second Lieutenant U.S. \n     Army nurse in 1941 and soon was transferred to the Pacific \n     theater. On her way aboard a ship to care for soldiers in \n     Australia, she met her life-mate. She told me the story once \n     of how a girl friend had said ``Oh, you married some \n     soldier,'' to which my mother responded ``Yes, some \n     soldier!''\n       And, indeed Army Lieutenant, soon to be Captain Caspar \n     ``Cap'' Weinberger was that and more. A lifetime public \n     servant, he was a California assemblyman who went on to serve \n     in many U.S. cabinet posts and eventually became President \n     Ronald Reagan's Secretary of Defense. Cap and Jane married in \n     Australia in 1942. My sister arrived first in 1943, while I \n     waited until 1947. Through circumstance--once married and \n     pregnant, Jane was sent by the Army, per regulations, back to \n     the States--my sister, Arlin, was born in Old Town, Maine, \n     while I became a child, like my father, of the West Coast, a \n     native San Franciscan. Actually, we lived first in Sausalito, \n     California, across the Bay from San Francisco. In 1949, we \n     moved to the city, living in what is now known as the Pacific \n     Heights neighborhood. My father was a law clerk in the city \n     and then eventually a young lawyer in a corporate law firm.\n       My father was generally shy and not very forthcoming in \n     those days, but he was also bored with the law. In High \n     School he had been fascinated by the U.S. Congressional \n     Record, and the daily transcript of Congress in action. \n     Today, he would have been known as a ``wonk,'' a bookish and \n     slightly withdrawn man. Nevertheless, he had served as \n     Student Body President at San Francisco's Polytechnic High, \n     located right next to the old Kezar Stadium in Golden Gate \n     Park. Then he had gone on to Harvard and the Harvard Law \n     School. Yet, it was my mother who warmed him up to, and then \n     almost literally pushed him into his first political campaign \n     as the Republican candidate for the State Assembly from San \n     Francisco's 21st Assembly District. It was victorious and he \n     served three consecutive two-year terms.\n       She did all the campaign things: running the campaign \n     office, calling on potential voters, handing out bumper \n     stickers and posters. Jane was a great organizer, and \n     innovator. She could make stuff out of nothing, and she was a \n     good writer as well. She was regularly published in the \n     smaller publications of the day and one of her stories was \n     called ``Lemon Drop,'' about an elephant, as I recall, and it \n     was republished many times while winning many awards.\n       In my elementary and high school days in California, Jane \n     was always active with volunteer groups, especially the St. \n     Luke's Hospital Auxiliary. She was a member of the Century \n     Club of San Francisco. I often drove her to meetings at the \n     Club's lovely mansion near the California Street Cable Car \n     line.\n       Well, boys miss their mothers. I am no longer a boy, of \n     course, although inside I still feel like one, but I shall \n     always feel for my mother and all she went through in the \n     world of politics and government. It was a great journey, \n     with lots of excitement, many highs, but also many lows. Such \n     is the nature of most lives, but my parents' existences were \n     perhaps grander, perhaps more intense than most.\n       Jane became the Chairwoman of the Folger Library, the great \n     Shakespeare monument and treasure trove of things English, in \n     Washington, D.C. She hosted so many fine parties for pretty \n     much the entire nation's ``A-list'' of actors, politicians, \n     scientists, professors, etc. and I was happy to be in \n     attendance at many of these events, with my lovely wife of \n     many years, Mavis. We met many of the world's most \n     recognizable characters simply because of my parent's \n     associations and as such we were most privileged indeed.\n       When she left Washington, moving with Cap back to Maine, \n     Jane started a business she had dreamed of running all her \n     life: Windswept House Publishers, a largely children's book \n     publishing house which she ran for over twenty years right \n     from her own home in Somesville on MDI. With over 120 titles, \n     her little company became recognized throughout New England \n     as ``not the biggest but among the very best,'' as more than \n     one reviewer attested.\n       For many years, Jane served on the Board at the Jackson Lab \n     in Bar Harbor believing that it was most important to \n     contribute to their good efforts in attempting to defeat \n     cancer in every form once and for all. Today, the Weinberger \n     Foundation which I started when Cap died continues to \n     contribute to the Lab in the hope that the goal Jane and so \n     many others dreamed about may one day be reached.\n       On Cap's 80th birthday, August 18, 1997, Jane hosted a \n     major celebration at Windswept. Many dignitaries, friends and \n     family attended. She arranged for a startling and magnificent \n     round of fireworks in his honor. Strangely, twelve years \n     later on the night before her passing, my wife and I \n     witnessed another stunning display of fireworks put on just \n     across the inlet to Somes Sound by a neighbor celebrating a \n     wedding or other special event. While these lights were not \n     really designed in her honor, to us it was highly symbolic, \n     as if her time of respect had come and was recognized. In my \n     view, as well it should have been, for she was most \n     definitely the power that guided my father to the heights of \n     American government.\n\n[[Page S8989]]\n\n       In addition to my sister, Arlin, and me, Jane leaves one \n     sister, Virginia Garceau. Jane had three grandchildren, my \n     nephew, James, and my two daughters, Louise and Rebecca. She \n     left this life knowing also that she had five great \n     grandsons, Timothy, David, George, Douglas Caspar and \n     Charles. In a very strange twist of fate, Jane's ten-year old \n     thoroughbred Golden Retriever, ``Brandy,'' died of a sudden \n     stroke last Tuesday, July 7, right on the Full Moon. In my \n     view, his death meant that he will be there for Jane in her \n     spiritual journey beyond this life. Wow! Jane had a wonderful \n     long life, perhaps rewarded for all her service by a just God \n     or perhaps simply by the sense of firm resolve and purpose \n     she brought to everything she did; most likely it was by a \n     combination of both.\n       But primarily, as is most important to me, Rebecca Jane \n     Dalton Weinberger was my mother. I loved her dearly and I \n     shall miss her very much. But I am happy too for her, as at \n     long last she can leave this weary Earth and perhaps re-join \n     her husband of 63 years. Thank you, Jane for giving me not \n     just life but a wonderful life. Indeed, though it was hardly \n     your nature, may you now rest most peacefully.\n                                        Caspar W.

Mr. President, with summer in full swing, I wish \ntoday to recognize a small family-run Maine business that has been \noutfitting customers with all of their outdoor needs for over 70 years. \nThe Kittery Trading Post, located in Maine's southernmost town of \nKittery, offers outdoor enthusiasts a shopping experience that is \nnearly as enjoyable as their outdoor activities.\n  The Kittery Trading Post holds a special place in the hearts of \nMainers and tourists alike as it is one of the first visible landmarks \nupon entrance into our State from New Hampshire. The Trading Post was \nestablished by Philip Adams in 1938 and began small as a one-room, 360 \nsquare-foot retail location cohabitating with a gas station. Mr. Adams \ninitially started his business by swapping gas for pelts, supplies for \ncars, and beef for ammunition. While the Trading Post has grown and \nmuch has changed over the years, it remains a family-owned and operated \nbusiness to this day.\n  In 1961 Phillip Adams sold the trading post to his 21-year-old son, \nKevin. Under Kevin's leadership, the Kittery Trading Post was voted \nIndependent Specialty Retailer of the Year in 1979 by the United State \nSporting Goods Industry. Kevin operated the company until his \nretirement in 1986, when the reins were passed on to Gary, Phillip, \nKevin F., and Kim Adams. During this period, the Trading Post was \npresented with the Governor's Award for Business Excellence in 1995, a \ncelebrated honor given to businesses that make generous contributions \nin the areas of community, employment, and service.\n  Phillip and Gary retired in 1999 and 2001 respectively, leaving the \nfamily business under the able leadership of Kevin F. and Kim. In 2001, \nthe Trading Post earned yet another prestigious and coveted award, when \nthe Maine Merchants Association named the Kittery Trading Post the \nRetailer of the Year.\n  Since its inception, the Kittery Trading Post has grown \nexponentially, resulting in its current size of 90,000 square feet of \nretail space. Spread out across three spacious levels, each area \ncontaining products appealing to a variety of customers, including \nquality and affordable provisions for hunting and archery, camping and \ntravel, food and lodging, and fishing and marine activity, among \nothers. The camping, rock climbing, water and winter sports divisions \nreside on the upper floor. Below that is the largest shooting sports \ndepartment in New England, including over 3,000 used firearms in stock. \nAnd on the lower level is Kittery Trading Post's expansive fishing \nsection.\n  In addition to the retail space, the Trading Post has two off-site \nwarehouses, providing the firm with an additional 94,000 square feet of \nspace to help increase the distribution of its products and keep up \nwith the demands of online customers via the company's user-friendly \nwebsite. The Kittery Trading Post offers free shipping on orders over \n$50, and also assures each customer that if they are not completely \nsatisfied with their purchase they may return it for a full refund or \nreplacement.\n  As a vibrant and active member of the local community, the Kittery \nTrading Post hosts a variety of seminars and events throughout the \nyear. These events include weekly community bicycle rides, fly fishing \nlessons for children, and classes for gun owners on firearm reloading \nsafety.\n  Over the course of its lengthy history, the Kittery Trading Post has \nexpanded into a singular name in Southern Maine's outdoor sports \noutfitting arena. A true Maine gem, the Trading Post is an impressive \ndestination for the amateur and the experienced outdoorsman alike. I \ncommend everyone at the Kittery Trading Post for their exceptional work \nin providing quality and friendly service to tens of thousands of \nvisitors each year, and wish them continued success for future \ndecades.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8989-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8989]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      COMMENDING EDWIN C. PETRANEK\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I thank an American veteran \nfor his valiant service to our country in the Advanced European Theater \nof Operation during World War II. Edwin C. Petranek was born September \n9, 1916, in White River, SD. After graduating from the University of \nSouth Dakota in 1942, he was commissioned second lieutenant with the \nROTC program and assigned to the 34th Infantry Division. Ed then went \non to serve in Africa, Italy, and France until 1945 as a member of the \n1st Battalion, Company A and B, 143rd Infantry, 36th Division as \nplatoon leader.\n  Ed was eventually made first lieutenant, and his division took part \nin breaking the German defenses around Rome and in the invasion of \nsouthern France. He was wounded four times in the line of duty and \nreturned to combat again and again. Ed left the European theater only \nafter shattering his hip and being fitted with a full body cast.\n  Ed recovered and received a medical discharge in 1946 but stayed in \nthe Army Reserves for 10 additional years, during which he returned to \nSouth Dakota and completed a master's degree. Upon receiving an \nhonorable discharge in 1956, Ed continued to serve in a civilian \ncapacity as an educator and coach. Here his commitment to excellence \nremained evident as he earned induction into the South Dakota Athletic \nDirector Hall of Fame.\n  Both at home and abroad, the perseverance exhibited by South Dakota's \nown Ed Petranek remains an example to us all. This man has been awarded \nthe Silver Star, a Purple Heart with three oak leaf clusters, a Bronze \nStar with cluster for meritorious service, and many other honors. Ed \nwas also presented the French Legion of Honor. Today we have the chance \nto thank him for his dedication and to reflect on the true meaning of \nservice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8989-3", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8989-S8990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COMMENDING LIEUTENANT COLONEL (RETIRED) WALTER PAUL\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I acknowledge the \nretirement of LTC (Ret.) Walter Paul, of the Colorado Army National \nGuard, and to recognize him for his distinguished public service as the \nresource manager and legislative director of the Colorado Department of \nMilitary and Veterans Affairs from 1999-2009.\n  Walter Paul was born in Vienna, Austria, and raised in the state of \nVictoria, Australia. He received a BS in chemistry from the University \nof Wisconsin in 1971. After college, he entered the U.S. Army as an \nartillery officer and served on active duty in Oklahoma, California, \nand Germany. He left active duty in 1978 but remained committed to his \nservice by joining the California Army National Guard. When he moved \nhis family--his wife Anna and two daughters--to Colorado in 1979, he \ntransferred to the Colorado Army National Guard. As an artillery \nofficer in the Colorado Army National Guard, he commanded the 2nd \nBattalion 157th Field Artillery in Colorado Springs.\n  As a traditional guardsman, Lieutenant Colonel Paul served as a \nmember of the Guard on weekends while maintaining a business career \nduring the week. He worked for Honeywell Semiconductor Division in \nColorado Springs as a military program manager. In 1986, he earned his \nMBA from the University of Colorado at Colorado Springs, UCCS, and for \n13 years, he taught part time at the UCCS Business\n\n[[Page S8990]]\n\nSchool. Lieutenant Colonel Paul also served as the chairman of the \nboard of directors for St. Mary's High School in Colorado Springs, from \nwhich both of his daughters graduated.\n  In 1999, Lieutenant Colonel Paul was hired as resource manager and \nlegislative director for the Colorado Department of Military and \nVeterans Affairs. In that role, he was responsible for the department's \nState budget, purchasing and contracting, and State tuition assistance, \nand he coordinated all the State and Federal legislation that impacts \nthe Colorado National Guard, veterans in Colorado, as well as the \nColorado Civil Air Patrol. After 10 years working for the Department, \nLieutenant Colonel Paul retired earlier this summer. His daughters are \nnow married, and he and Anna, his wife of 39 years, live in Colorado \nSprings.\n  I first met Lieutenant Colonel Paul in 1999 in my first year in \noffice as a Member of the House of Representatives from Colorado's \nSecond District. Over the years, he and his colleague Colonel (Ret.) \nWilliam ``Robby'' Robinson worked very closely with my office on issues \nimportant to the Guard in Colorado, and helped me and my staff \nunderstand the critical role the Guard plays in times of peace and war. \nIt was clear that this wasn't ``just'' a job for Lieutenant Colonel \nPaul--he was dedicated to his work and to the Guard, he was always \navailable when my office needed his assistance, and his cheerful \ndemeanor made him a joy to work with.\n  LTC Walter Paul has tirelessly supported our Nation's men and women \nin uniform. He is a patriot whose distinctive accomplishments reflect \ngreat credit upon him, the State of Colorado, and the Nation. I hope my \ncolleagues will join me not only in recognizing his past \naccomplishments, but also in wishing him all the best in his future \npursuits.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8990-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        COMMENDING COLONEL (RETIRED) WILLIAM L. ROBINSON (ROBBY)\n\n Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I recognize and \npay tribute to COL (Ret.) William ``Robby'' Robinson, who was \ncommissioned as an infantry officer in 1968 through the U.S. Military \nAcademy and who will retire next month after 13 years working for \nColorado's Department of Military and Veterans Affairs. We owe him a \ndebt of gratitude for his contributions to our Nation.\n  Colonel Robinson's civilian education includes a bachelor of science \nfrom West Point and a master's degree in public administration from \nHarvard University. His professional military education includes the \ninfantry officer basic and advanced courses, Ranger, Airborne, \nJumpmaster and Pathfinder schools at Fort Benning, GA; the College of \nNaval Command and Staff in Rhode Island; and the Army War College in \nPennsylvania as the USCINCPAC Fellow.\n  His assignments have included the 82nd Airborne Division at Fort \nBragg, NC; 173rd Airborne Brigade, Vietnam; A Company, 1st Battalion \n502nd Infantry, 101st Airborne Division, Vietnam; 75th Infantry, \nRanger, 101st Airborne Division, Vietnam; Logistics Plans Officer and \nDivision Training Officer in the 24th Infantry Division at Fort \nStewart, Georgia; and Task Force Commander of 2nd Battalion 8th \nInfantry in the 4th Infantry Division at Fort Carson, CO.\n  Among Colonel Robinson's awards and decorations are the Defense \nSuperior Service Medal, the Legion of Merit, Purple Heart, Bronze Star, \neight Air Medals, two Defense Meritorious Service Medals, and three \nMeritorious Service Medals.\n  Colonel Robinson has also served as an instructor of political \nsciences at West Point; Aide de Camp to the U.S. Representative to the \nNATO Military Committee in Brussels, Belgium; speechwriter for the \nCommander in Chief, U.S. Pacific Command; chief of strategy at \nUSCINCPAC in Hawaii; and as Fifth U.S. Army senior active duty adviser \nto the Colorado Army National Guard.\n  He retired from active duty in June 1996 and became the resource \nmanager and legislative liaison for Colorado's Department of Military \nAffairs. In 1999, he began serving as deputy director of the Department \nof Military and Veterans Affairs. He will retire next month, after 13 \nyears with the department.\n  It was in his capacity as deputy director that I first met Colonel \nRobinson, when he and the department's legislative director, LTC (Ret.) \nWalter Paul, visited my office in my first year as a Member of the \nHouse of Representatives from Colorado's Second District. Over the \nyears, Colonel Robinson and Lieutenant Colonel Paul worked very closely \nwith my office on issues important to the Guard in Colorado, and helped \nme and my staff understand the critical role the Guard plays in times \nof peace and war.\n  Colonel Robinson is a man of integrity, whose counsel is widely \nsought. In his years of service, he has demonstrated his deep \ncommitment to our Guard members, our veterans, and their families. \nRetirement will allow him to spend more time with his wife Cathy, who \nis program director for Elbert County Social Services, their daughter \nMeredith, a veterinarian in Wheat Ridge, and their son Will, a student \nat the University of Colorado, Denver. But we will miss him and will \ncontinue to seek his counsel.\n  I know all my colleagues join me in saluting COL (Ret.) William \n``Robby'' Robinson for his many years of truly outstanding service to \nthe United States Army, the Colorado National Guard, our veterans, and \nour Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8990-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8990-3", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8990]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8990-4", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S8990-S8991]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n              Enrolled Bills and Joint Resolutions Signed\n\n  At 5:51 p.m., a message from Ms. Niland, one of its reading clerks, \nannounced that the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Hoyer) has signed the \nfollowing enrolled bills and joint resolutions:\n\n       H.R. 774.

A concurrent resolution adopted by the Legislature \n     of the State of Texas urging Congress to make eradication of \n     the fever tick in South Texas a priority and continue to \n     provide appropriate funding and resources for this effort; to \n     the Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n\n                  House Concurrent Resolution No. 120\n\n       Whereas, south Texas is on the front line of the battle \n     against the fever tick, a pest that threatens to inflict \n     catastrophic losses on the beef industry should it continue \n     to spread beyond a permanent quarantine zone established \n     along the Rio Grande in 1943; and\n       Whereas, historically, the fever tick ranged across the \n     entire southeastern United States, reaching as far north as \n     Maryland and Pennsylvania; the tick can carry and transmit a \n     parasite that causes cattle tick fever, which kills up to 90 \n     percent of infected cattle; in 1893, the Texas Animal Health \n     Commission was founded to fight this scourge, and in 1907 the \n     United States Department of Agriculture established the \n     National Cattle Fever Tick Eradication Program; by then, the \n     tick had already caused direct and indirect economic losses \n     estimated to equal more than $1 billion in today's dollars; \n     and\n       Whereas, the eradication program had successfully contained \n     the fever tick to an 852-square-mile quarantine zone by 1943; \n     the tick was never eliminated in Mexico, however, and \n     personnel from the USDA Tick Force have maintained a high \n     level of vigilance to fight continuous reintroduction; after \n     the pest was detected beyond the zone in 2007, five temporary \n     preventive quarantine areas were established, covering more \n     than one million acres in Starr, Zapata, Jim Hogg, Maverick, \n     Dimmit, and Webb Counties; and\n       Whereas, in March 2008, the Texas Department of Agriculture \n     requested some $13 million to fight the spread of fever \n     ticks; the USDA released $5.2 million, and in January 2009 it \n     committed another $4.9 million in emergency funds, but \n     sustained funding over the long term is essential; moreover, \n     the National Fever Tick Eradication Strategic Plan, developed \n     and approved by the USDA in 2006, has never been implemented \n     and funded, and Dr. Bob Hillman, the state veterinarian and \n     executive director of the Texas Animal Health Commission, has \n     warned that fever ticks are a national livestock threat that \n     requires an all-out assault; and\n       Whereas, the fever tick has gained substantial ground in \n     this state, but the Texas Department of Agriculture, the \n     Texas Animal Health Commission, and the USDA Tick Force \n     continue working diligently with cattle owners to save a key \n     component of the Lone Star State's agricultural economy and \n     prevent the battlefront from extending to other states; if \n     the fever tick is not contained, the cost to the cattle \n     industry could easily approach $1 billion a year and lead to \n     rising food costs for consumers; now, therefore, be it\n\n[[Page S8992]]\n\n       Resolved, That the 81st Legislature of the State of Texas \n     hereby memorialize the Congress of the United States to make \n     eradication of the fever tick in South Texas a priority and \n     continue to provide appropriate funding and resources for \n     this effort; and, be it, further\n       Resolved, That the Texas secretary of state forward \n     official copies of this resolution to the president of the \n     United States, to the speaker of the house of representatives \n     and the president of the senate of the United States \n     Congress, and to all members of the Texas delegation to \n     Congress with the request that this resolution be officially \n     entered in the Congressional Record as a memorial to the \n     Congress of the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S8992-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S8992]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REPORTS OF COMMITTEES\n\n  The following reports of committees were submitted:\n\n       By Mr. ROCKEFELLER, from the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation, without amendment:\n       S. 859.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nthe same tax treatment for both commercial and noncommercial investors \nin oil and natural gas and related commodities, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, businesses like airlines, trucking \ncompanies, and heating oil distributors buy and sell oil and futures \ncontracts because they need to do so to run their day-to-day business \nand hedge their risk against wild swings in oil prices like consumers \nsaw last year.\n  But there are also buyers and sellers in the market--financial \nspeculators--who are simply there to try to make a quick dollar on oil \nas an investment strategy. The explosion of speculators into the \nmarketplace has distorted the oil and gas market and driven up the \nprice of oil for everybody. When commercial businesses see fuel prices \ngo up, they try to consume less. But when speculators see prices go up, \nthey buy more and keep driving up demand. This distorts the normal \nsupply-demand balance of the markets and digs a huge financial hole for \naverage Americans.\n  In 2000, speculative trading in the oil futures markets accounted for \n37 percent of crude oil trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. By \nlast summer when prices were approaching $150 a barrel, that number had \ngrown to more than 70 percent. I do not think that is a coincidence.\n  There are a lot of proposals around to fix the regulatory system to \nprevent trading abuses. Oregon's economy really suffered from abusive \nenergy trading by Enron, and I am all for closing trading loopholes. \nBut my bill is aimed at something different. It is aimed at the giant \nfinancial bubble that has been created by people who are simply chasing \nspeculative profits in the commodities markets and creating artificial \ndemand that is driving up prices.\n  The legislation I am introducing today--Stop Tax-breaks for Oil \nProfiteering, STOP, Act of 2009--will let some of the air out of this \nspeculative balloon and help create a level playing field among \ncompanies participating in the commodity markets.\n  Under the tax code, commercial traders, those who truly need to buy, \nsell and hedge their purchases of oil, pay taxes on whatever profits \nthey make on trading at the same rates as ordinary income. Speculators \nget a much better deal from the TAX CODE. Some, such as pension funds \nor endowments, do not pay any tax whatsoever when they profit on their \noil or futures investments. Others, like hedge or index funds can get \nlower tax rates by treating some of their trading profits as capital \ngains. Clearly, the deck is stacked against the businesses who really \nbuy and use oil. That means it is also stacked against the consumer who \nneeds the services and products those businesses provide.\n  My proposal removes incentives in the tax code that make such \ninvestments attractive to both tax-exempt and tax-paying investors. It \nalso makes everyone in the United States who is buying and selling oil \nand gas or futures contracts play by essentially the same tax rules \nacross the board. Tax-paying entities would lose the ability to treat \nany of these investments as capital gains and be subject to comparable \ntax treatment on oil and gas investments as airlines or trucking \ncompanies or fuel distributors or other businesses that truly need to \nbe in these markets.\n  Tax-exempt entities, like pension funds, would be required to pay \n``unrelated-business-income-tax'' on their oil and gas trading gains. \nUBTI already exists as a well-established tax obligation for income \nthat is not directly related to the tax exempt purpose of the \norganization. UBTI was created precisely to keep tax exempt \norganizations from competing unfairly with taxpaying businesses, which \nis what they are doing when they enter the commodity markets solely for \ninvestment income purposes. The bill also includes provisions that \nwould prevent tax exempt organizations from investing in off-shore \nfunds to try to avoid the new UBTI tax.\n  By focusing on tax fairness, my bill would realign the profit \nincentives that are currently attracting non-commercial actors to the \nmarkets. If speculators are truly in the markets and are wrecking havoc \nwith oil and gas prices, this bill will do away with their tax \nsubsidies and cause many to leave. It deflates the speculative balloon \nof artificially inflated profits that has made this investment arena so \nattractive.\n\n[[Page S8998]]\n\n  If speculators are not a problem, then this bill will help prove the \ntheory that the wild swings in oil prices of the past year truly can be \nblamed on supply and demand.\n  The bill would only cover the oil and natural gas markets, and \nrelated products like gasoline and diesel fuel, and be in effect for \nthe next 4 years. However, after 3 years, it would require the Treasury \nDepartment to issue a report analyzing the impact of these changes on \nthese markets, making recommendations on what changes to make.\n  Other proposals on oil speculation focus on regulation of the market \nor limiting the amounts of oil traders could purchase. These approaches \nare ``top down'' efforts to prevent trading abuses and financial \ninvestors from swamping the market. This bill approaches the problem \nfrom the bottom line up. Willy Sutton, the bank robber was asked why he \nrobbed banks, to which he is said to have replied, ``It's where the \nmoney is.'' That is why this bill focuses on the flow of financial \ninvestment funds into the oil and gas markets, it's where the \nspeculation is.\n  In these tough economic times, I believe consumers need protection \nfrom people who try to game the system to pad their own pockets. By \nputting an end to the imbalances in the tax code that currently feed \noil profiteers, the STOP Act will be good for American businesses and \nconsumers. I hope my colleagues will join me in protecting our economy \nand leveling the playing field in the oil and gas markets by voting in \nfavor of the STOP Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1588\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe incentives for the production of biodiesel; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleague, \nSenator Grassley, and introduce an important piece of legislation that \nwill modernize the tax incentive for domestic biodiesel production. The \nBiodiesel Tax Incentive Reform and Extension Act of 2009 will provide \npredictability to investors, to producers, and to researchers so we can \nmove forward and continue to displace imported fossil fuels with low \ncarbon, renewable biodiesel that is produced here in the United States.\n  Last year, we all saw the devastating effects that $140 per barrel \noil had on our economy and our constituents. For economic reasons, \nnational security reasons, and environmental reasons, we cannot allow \nourselves to remain dependent on foreign oil. We have to redouble our \nefforts to deploy alternative fuels that can be produced in the United \nStates and that can help us address the growing crisis of climate \nchange.\n  Biodiesel is a diesel replacement fuel that is produced from \nvegetable oils, animal fats and waste oils. It is refined to meet a \ncommercial fuel specification that is readily accepted in the \nmarketplace. Typically biodiesel is blended with conventional diesel \nfuel, and it is not necessary to modify a vehicle's engine to use the \nfuel.\n  There are compelling public policy benefits associated with the \nproduction and use of biodiesel. It is an extremely efficient fuel that \ncan be produced domestically so we do not have to rely on imported \nfuel. Biodiesel creates 3.2 units of energy for every unit of fuel that \nis required to produce the fuel and the 690 million gallons of \nbiodiesel produced in the U.S. in 2008 displaced 38.1 million barrels \nof petroleum.\n  Replacing fossil fuel use with biodiesel also can play a constructive \nrole in addressing the issue of climate change. When compared to \nconventional diesel fuel, pure biodiesel reduces direct carbon \nlifecycle emissions by 78 percent, which in 2008 was the equivalent of \nremoving 980,000 passenger vehicles from the road.\n  Congress first enacted a tax incentive for biodiesel in 2004 and \nsince that time, this tax credit has helped encourage the production \nand use of this alternative fuel. U.S. production of biodiesel \nincreased from 25 million gallons in 2004 to 690 million gallons last \nyear, and the industry has built the commercial scale production \ncapacity. There currently are 176 plants in operation with the capacity \nto produce more than 2.61 billion gallons of biodiesel.\n  The 39 new plants that are either under construction or being \nexpanded would add nearly 849.9 million gallons of production capacity. \nWe have to be sure these plans for expansion go forward. Unfortunately, \nlimited access to capital, uncertainty surrounding the Federal \ncommitment to biodiesel, and the current state of the economy threaten \nto undermine the progress the U.S. biodiesel industry has made to build \nthe production capacity and infrastructure needed to aggressively \ndisplace petroleum diesel fuel with renewable, low-carbon biodiesel. \nRight now, less than one-third of the industry's facilities are \ncurrently producing fuel.\n  The 51,893 jobs that are currently supported by the U.S. biodiesel \nindustry show there is real job growth potential in this industry. Much \nof that job growth and economic activity will happen in our rural \ncommunities who continue to be hard hit right now.\n  The current law tax credit will expire at the end of this year and \nCongress must act or we will threaten the future of this promising \ndomestic industry. The National Biodiesel Board estimates that if \nCongress does not provide some predictability to the industry, U.S. \nproduction will likely fall from 690 million gallons in 2008 to 300-350 \nmillion gallons in 2009. This could cost the U.S. economy more than \n29,000 jobs. These are not jobs we can afford to lose.\n  In addition to the looming expiration, the current structure of the \ntax credit has administrative problems and is subject to abuse that \nmakes it difficult to ensure that that only qualified fuel benefits \nfrom the incentive. We owe it to taxpayers to make sure that we are \ngetting the results we want from the tax incentives we enact so in \naddition to extending the tax credit we need to make the structural \nchanges that Sen. Grassley and I are proposing today.\n  The centerpiece of the bill is changing the incentive from a blender \ncredit to a production tax credit so that we focus the benefits of the \nincentive on building the domestic production industry. Under current \nlaw, the credit was targeted at the blending of biodiesel with \npetroleum diesel. While this was helpful in getting us to the point we \nare now, it is time we move even farther in the direction of promoting \nthe production of petroleum fuel alternatives.\n  In addition, the legislation we are introducing today will simplify \nadministration of the incentive for both taxpayers and the Internal \nRevenue Service, IRS, and will eliminate any remaining opportunity for \nabuse of the tax credit through schemes like ``splash and dash'' in \nwhich oil companies add a few drops of biodiesel to their petroleum \ndiesel just to qualify for the tax credits.\n  Under our bill, the $1 per gallon tax credit will be provided for the \nproduction of biodiesel, renewable diesel and aviation jet fuel that \ncomplies with established fuel standards and Clean Air Act \nrequirements.\n  For small producers, those with an annual production capacity of less \nthan 60 million gallons, we increase the $1 to $1.10 for the first 15 \nmillion gallons of biodiesel produced.\n  We simplify the definition of biodiesel so that we encourage \nproduction\n\n[[Page S9000]]\n\nfrom any biomass-based feedstock or recycled oils and fats. Hopefully \nthis will unleash even more research and commercialization of \nalternative fuel sources.\n  The bill also simplifies the coordination between the income tax \ncredit and the excise tax liability to, again, tighten up compliance \nand reduce administrative burdens on taxpayers. Most importantly, our \nbill would extend this tax credit for 5 years, giving needed financial \npredictability to the industry.\n  I thank Senator Grassley for joining with me on this bill and look \nforward to working with our colleagues on the Finance Committee to \nadopt this worthwhile, commonsense proposal that is consistent with \nsound energy and sound tax policy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1589\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, to \nestablish the Health Technology Program in the United States Agency for \nInternational Development to research and develop technologies to \nimprove global health, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nForeign Relations.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, for a child in a developing country, very \nsimple tools, like safe injection technologies for vaccination, can \nmean the difference between life and death. But the fact is that many \ncountries are simply unable to afford such critical health \ntechnologies. Research has given us many promising early-stage \ntechnologies that could make a difference, but tragically, in many \ncases the promise of such technologies goes unrealized.\n  I know that it is sometimes tempting to think of global health as a \ndistant goal, far removed from the lives of everyday Americans. But, as \nthe emergence of new pandemic threats such as H1N1 flu reminds us, \nglobal health is public health--and it affects Americans right here at \nhome. It is impossible to pick up a paper today, watch TV, or use the \ninternet without realizing that we are more connected than ever before \nto people around the world.\n  As I speak with scientists and leaders in my State, they are excited \nabout finding new ways to tackle tough global health problems. I hear \nthe same enthusiasm when I speak with young people who are passionate \nabout helping others. Of course, this growing support for global health \ncan be seen not only in my home state, but throughout our country, in \nour universities and in community organizations. I know that many of my \ncolleagues in the Senate are dedicated, tireless advocates for global \nhealth. Last year, the Congress demonstrated its strong commitment by \nreauthorizing the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, PEPFAR, a \nhuge victory for global health and a strong foundation for future \nefforts.\n  In May, President Obama announced a new, comprehensive global health \nstrategy, renewing the longstanding U.S. commitment to global health \nand building on the successes of programs begun during the Bush \nadministration like PEPFAR and the President's Malaria Initiative, \nprograms that have saved countless lives. President Obama has called \nfor us to continue these efforts and to focus on improving the health \nof mothers and children and strengthening health systems in developing \ncountries.\n  Developing countries urgently need technologies that will work for \ntheir health care systems, technologies that are easy-to-use, \nculturally appropriate, and above all affordable.\n  Today I am introducing the 21st Century Global Health Technology Act \nto support these goals by applying our country's traditional strengths \nin research, innovation, and entrepreneurship to global health. My bill \nwill encourage the development of appropriate global health \ntechnologies by authorizing efforts at the US Agency for International \nDevelopment, USAID, to make sure that promising health technologies are \nnot left to sit on the shelf, but instead are developed and delivered \nto those in need.\n  Developing global health technologies is not easy or glamorous and \nthe financial incentives for business\n\n[[Page S9002]]\n\nare few. But for many years, the USAID has supported global health \ntechnology development through an innovative model that encourages the \npublic, non-profit, and private sectors to work together.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill because the USAID has a \nlong and inspiring track record of success in technology development. \nFor example, the USAID's HealthTech program meets a wide range of needs \nfrom developing tools to rapidly diagnose infectious diseases to \ndesigning safe delivery kits that keep mothers and newborns healthy. \nWorking with non-profit and commercial-sector partners, HealthTech has \ninvestigated over 100 technologies, licensed or transferred 21 life-\nsaving technologies designed for use in low-resource settings, and \nmoved 10 technologies into global use.\n  The HealthTech program helps the USAID leverage Federal money to \nencourage the private sector to become involved in the fight to improve \nglobal health. In an average year, HealthTech matches the USAID's \nfunding with cash and in-kind contributions from the private sector. \nThe average ratio of private sector investment to USAID funding in \nHealthTech-developed technologies that have reached commercialization \nis about 9 to 1. It's a win-win model that increases the number of \naffordable global health technologies and provides new opportunities \nfor U.S. companies.\n  Technology development at the USAID is a smart investment. However, \nthe agency's technology development efforts currently are not \nauthorized, so funding is often uncertain. That uncertainty prevents \nthe USAID from pursuing many promising technologies. My bill will \nprovide $5 million per year over 5 years to support technology \ndevelopment at the USAID--a small, but steady source of funding that \nwill bring greater stability to technology development efforts and \nencourage more private sector partners to get involved.\n  Investing in global health technology is the right thing for the \nU.S., for our companies, for our bright young people who are pursuing \ncareers in global health, and for our security since our well-being is \nlinked to our ability to prevent global pandemics and to reach out to \npeople around the world. But, most importantly, investing in global \nhealth and in affordable health technologies will save millions of \nlives. It is simply the right thing to do.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1591\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish a Federal Board of Certification to \nenhance the transparency, credibility, and stability of financial \nmarkets, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, \nand Urban Affairs.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise today to reintroduce legislation \nthat will increase the trustworthiness of our Nation's mortgage \nsecurity market by creating the Federal Board of Certification for \nmortgage securities. I would like to thank Senator Cardin for \ncosponsoring this vital measure.\n  The necessity of enacting last fall's Troubled Asset Relief Program, \nalong with the collapse of Lehman Brothers,\n\n[[Page S9003]]\n\nand the bailouts of American International Group, Fannie Mae, Freddie \nMac, and Bear Stearns, combined with the huge losses suffered \nthroughout the financial industry, demonstrates a catastrophic failure \nto accurately assess the dangers of imprudently made subprime mortgages \nto the American public and our financial markets. In hindsight, it \nappears that it was the inability to gauge risk in mortgage-backed \nsecurities that caused much of this financial turmoil. For markets to \noperate properly, it is imperative that they have effective metrics for \ncalculating the level of risk securities pose to investors.\n  The secondary mortgage market has been a largely unregulated \nplayground where poorly underwritten, low-quality loans were sold as \nhigh-quality investment products. Although mortgage-backed securities \ncan be a positive market force, which increases the available pool of \ncredit for borrowers, without an accurate picture of the risk involved \nin each mortgage security, buyers have no idea whether they are \npurchasing a high-risk investment or a safe, secure investment. The \nlegislation that I am reintroducing today would work to curb the \nexcesses of the secondary market, combat future attempts at deception, \nand protect investors by making scrutinized mortgage investments more \nreliable and trustworthy.\n  The inability of major corporations to properly assess the risk of \nthe mortgage securities they were trading is a problem whose effects \nhave not been confined to Wall Street. To put it simply: when big banks \nsneeze, the rest of America gets a cold. This year, more than $1 \ntrillion of the subprime mortgages originated during the housing boom \nwill reset to higher interest rates.\n  In my home State of Maine, we are struggling with falling home prices \nand a record number of foreclosures. During the first half of 2009 \nalone, there were 1,696 filings in Maine, a number putting the State on \npace to surpass the 2,851 foreclosure filings registered in 2008. \nMoreover, some Maine borrowers, with rising monthly payments, are \nunable to refinance out of their predatory loans. Small business \nowners, many already hurt by the economic downturn, are also finding \ncredit tight. Finally, despite gains in recent weeks, the poor economic \nclimate caused by the subprime credit crunch has also roiled the stock \nmarket, causing Americans to lose billions in their IRAs and retirement \nfunds.\n  We must address crisis and make sure it never happens again. Turning \nto specifics, my bill creates the Federal Board of Certification, which \nwould certify that the mortgages within a security instrument meet the \nunderlying standards they claim in regards to documentation, loan to \nvalue ratios, debt service to income ratios, and borrowers' credit \nstandards. The purpose of the certification process is to increase the \ntransparency, predictability, and reliability of securitized mortgage \nproducts. Certification would aid in creating settled investor \nexpectations and increase transparency by ensuring that the mortgages \nwithin a mortgage security conform to the claims made by the mortgage \nproduct's sellers.\n  The proposed Federal Board of Certification would not override any \ncurrent regulations and would not in any way stifle any attempts by \nprivate business to rate mortgage securities. This legislation would, \nhowever, create incentives for improving industry rating practices. \nOpen publication of the Board's certification criteria would augment \nthe efforts of private ratings agencies by providing incentives for \nincreased transparency in the ratings process. The Board's \ncertification would also serve as a check on the industry to ensure \nthat ratings agencies carefully scrutinize the content of mortgage \nproducts before issuing evaluations of mortgage backed securities.\n  Significantly, the Federal Board of Certification would also be \nvoluntary and funded by an excise tax. Users could choose to pay the \ncosts for the Board to rate their security, or they could elect not to \nsubmit their product to the Board.\n  We must quickly restore confidence in mortgage securities if we are \nto stabilize our housing markets. To do so, we must certify the quality \nand content of our mortgage securities to enable housing markets to \ngenerate liquidity and spur lending. This is why it is urgent to create \nthe Federal Board of Certification for mortgage securities. This \nlegislation would create a ``good housekeeping seal of approval'' for \nthe mortgage security industry and certify that the mortgage products \nare in fact what they claim to be. Accordingly, I call on Congress to \ntake up and pass this commonsense legislation as expeditiously as \npossible, particularly as part of a comprehensive overhaul of our \nfinancial markets that Congress must consider in short order to ensure \nthat the calamitous events of the past year are never again repeated.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1592\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

The Federal Board of Certification is not liable \n     for any actions taken in reliance on such judgment of \n     risk.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. MERKLEY:\n  S. 1595. A bill to amend the Truth in Lending Act to prohibit the \ndistribution of any check or other negotiable instrument as part of a \nsolicitation by a creditor for an extension of credit, to limit the \nliability of consumers in conjunction with such solicitations, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, in recent years, consumer credit has gone \nfrom providing convenience and short-term financing to a game of tricks \nand traps that strips families of hard earned resources and locks the \nmiddle class into a vicious cycle of debt. Today, I introduce \nlegislation to end one of those deceptive practices--the unsolicited \nmailing of ``live'' loan checks.\n  Deceptive loan checks have afflicted consumers, especially seniors, \nfor far too long. In these schemes, financial institutions send \nunsuspecting customers checks made out to them for some amount. \nCustomers often assume that their financial institutions have sent \nrefunds or some other business-related sum and unknowingly deposit the \nchecks. However, fine print on these checks actually makes them high-\ncost loans.\n  Bank regulators have failed for years to rein in these deceptive \nproducts. In Oregon, one of my elderly constituents--a veteran of the \nKorean war--ended up in a subprime mortgage because he unknowingly \ndeposited a deceptive loan check that he never requested. Sadly, \ninstead of being able to cancel the loan, he was pushed into rolling \nthis unwanted loan into his mortgage, which was then transformed from a \nsafe, fixed rate mortgage that had nearly been paid off, into a brand \nnew, subprime mortgage. As this case shows, deceptive products and \npractices lead our consumers into dangerous, high cost debt. If \nindividuals wish to take out high cost loans, they should have every \nright to do so, but financial institutions should make those \ntransactions plain and straightforward, not tricky and deceptive.\n  To address this situation, I am introducing the Deceptive Loan Check \nElimination Act. Under the act, financial institutions would be \nprohibited from sending a ``live'' loan check unless the consumer \nrequested such a check in writing. Consumers would not be liable for \nany debt incurred in violation of the act. This common sense solution \nprotects consumers without constricting credit for those who want it. \nThe legislation is endorsed by Consumer Action, Consumers Federation of \nAmerica, Consumers Union, the National Consumer Law Center, on behalf \nof its low income clients, and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group.\n  I am hopeful that the Senate will act quickly to address this \nproblem. In addition, the next step in restoring a fair playing field \nfor working families is to move ahead quickly to create the Consumer \nFinancial Protection Agency, a body with the authority to review and \nregulate financial tricks and traps like ``live'' loan checks.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in this and future efforts to restore \nhonesty and plain dealing to our consumer credit markets.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mrs. BOXER:\n  S. 1596. A bill to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to acquire \nthe Gold Hill Ranch in Coloma, California; to the Committee on Energy \nand Natural Resources.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I rise to discuss the Gold Hill-Wakamatsu \nPreservation Act. This legislation would authorize the Bureau of Land \nManagement to acquire and manage the Gold Hill Ranch near Coloma, \nCalifornia. This site was the location of the Wakamatsu Tea and Silk \nColony from 1869 to 1871, recognized by the State of California and \nJapanese American Citizens League as the first Japanese settlement in \nthe United States.\n  After Commodore William Perry opened Japanese ports to U.S. trade, \nthe weakness of Japan's shoguns was exposed, leading to a revolution \nand return to imperial rule under the Meiji emperor. In 1869, seven \nJapanese individuals and a European expatriate fled the turmoil in \nJapan and sailed across the Pacific to San Francisco aboard a side \nwheeler called the ``China.'' The group made their way eastwards and \npurchased land in Gold Hill. Within 2 years, the colony grew to 22 \nJapanese settlers and began producing traditional Japanese crops such \nas tea, silk, rice, and bamboo. The Japanese colonists and surrounding \ncommunity\n\n[[Page S9005]]\n\nlearned about each others' culture and agricultural techniques. Local \nand San Francisco newspapers wrote about the colony, and the settlers \nbegan to receive acceptance in American society.\n  Unfortunately, the colony was short-lived--drought and financial \nproblems forced the group to disperse and settle throughout California \nbeginning in 1871. The Veerkamp family, which owned neighboring lands, \npurchased the property in 1875. Despite the short history of the \ncolony, it was an important milestone that helped bridge Japanese and \nAmerican cultures and paved the way for large-scale emigration of \nJapanese settlers to the United States. It also contributed to major \nJapanese influences on the agricultural economy of California.\n  Many of the original structures on the site remain intact, including \na farmhouse, the grave of a young girl named Okei, numerous artifacts, \nand agricultural plantings. Japanese-Americans and other visitors come \nto see the site and place offerings on Okei's grave. As a testament to \nthe cultural exchanges that occurred at this site, the Gold Trail \nMiddle School, located on an in-holding carved out of this site, now \nmaintains an exchange program with a sister school in Wakamatsu, Japan. \nGovernor Reagan recognized the property as a State historic site in \n1969, and the site is currently being considered for listing on the \nNational Register of Historic Places.\n  The 272-acre ranch encompassing the original colony site has been \npassed down for generations through the Veerkamp family. Thanks to the \nhard work of the American River Conservancy and Wakamatsu Gold Hill \nColony Foundation as well as the generous accommodation of the Veerkamp \nfamily, the site has been preserved for visitors to come and learn \nabout the history of the Wakamatsu colonists and Japanese-American \nculture. The site provides multiple other benefits, including wildlife \nhabitat, open space with hiking trails and picnic areas, and grazing \nand pastureland. The family and non-profit partners agree that federal \nacquisition would help guarantee that the site's cultural history, \nagricultural character, and open space are permanently preserved for \ngenerations to come. The Bureau of Land Management is well-suited to \nmanage this site since it has an excellent relationship with the local \ncommunity and manages several other sites nearby.\n  This project is supported by the Japanese American Citizens League, \nthe National Japanese American Historical Society, the Consul General \nof Japan, the Governor of Fukishima Prefecture and the Mayor of \nWakamatsu in Japan, People-to-People International, the El Dorado \nCounty Board of Supervisors, the El Dorado County Chamber of Commerce, \nnumerous elected officials including Assemblyman Ted Gaines, who \nrepresents this district, and numerous other members of the local \ncommunity.\n  The significance of this site for Japanese Americans has been \ncompared to the significance of the Mayflower journey and Plymouth Rock \nlanding for European Americans. This site is testament to Japanese \nhistory, California's agricultural economy, and the American tradition \nof bringing together people of diverse cultures in the common pursuit \nof freedom and prosperity. I look forward to working with my Senate \ncolleagues to move this legislation and preserve the story of the \nWakamatsu colonists for future generations.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself, Mr. Chambliss, and Mr. Pryor):\n  S. 1599. A bill to amend title 36, United States Code, to include in \nthe Federal charter of the Reserve Officers Association leadership \npositions newly added in its constitution and bylaws; to the Committee \non Armed Services.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to introduce the \nReserve Officers Association Modernization Act of 2009. I want to thank \nSenators Chambliss and Pryor for joining me to introduce this \nlegislation. As the cochairs of the United States Senate Reserve \nCaucus, Senators Chambliss and Pryor have worked hard for the brave men \nand women of the United States Reserves.\n  Over the past decade, our country has relied on the National Guard \nand Reserves more than at any other time in recent history. The Guard \nand Reserves provide an invaluable contribution to our Nation's \nmilitary, our national security, and disaster relief efforts. In recent \nyears the National Guard and Reserves have demonstrated their position \nas a keystone to our military operations, particularly in Iraq and \nAfghanistan, and stepped forward repeatedly to answer the call-to-duty \nat a tempo not seen in decades. At the same time, the support from the \nGuard and Reserves for homeland duties has been at an all time high. \nThe Guard and Reserves have provided crucial support to our Governors \nand States during natural disasters such as the aftermath of Hurricane \nKatrina. In addition, they have assumed additional roles in homeland \nsecurity as our country has adopted new policies following the attacks \nof September 11, 2001. This new era for the Guard and Reserves prompted \nCongress and the Department of Defense to review many existing and but \noutdated policies.\n  The 95-member U.S. Senate National Guard Caucus, which I cochair \nalong with Senator Bond, plays an integral role in the review and \nimplementation of new policies. I have worked closely with groups like \nthe Reserve Officers Association, ROA, to ensure that the National \nGuard and Reserves have access to more affordable health care, a \ngreater influence in the military, adequate training facilities and \nsupplies, and shorter troop deployments in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Since its founding in 1922, the ROA has worked on behalf of the \nNational Guard and Reserves and their families. For over 85 years, ROA \nhas remained committed to its original mission, to ``support and \npromote the development and execution of a military policy for the \nUnited States that will provide adequate National security.'' The \nReserve Officers Association represents the Reserve Components officers \nfor the Army, Air Force, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast Guard, the Air and \nArmy National Guard, Public Health Service, and the officers of the \nNational Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n  This legislation would update the Reserve Officers Association's \nFederal Charter to reflect two recent changes in the organization. \nFirst, it would add the position of ``president elect'' to its \nconstitution and bylaws. Second, it would expand the ROA from only \nthree national executive committee members to include three \nrepresentatives from each of the seven branches of the uniformed \nservices. The Reserve Officers Association's charter has not been \nmodified since 1998 and this legislation would update it to correctly \nreflect the current operation of the organization and enable ROA to \ncontinue its good work.\n  The Reserve Officers Association has provided a voice to the men and \nwomen that serve our country in the National Guard and Reserves. I urge \nSenators on both sides of the aisle to show their support for the brave \nmembers of the National Guard and Reserves by enacting this legislation \nswiftly.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1599\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Reserve Officers Association \n     Modernization Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. INCLUSION OF NEW LEADERSHIP POSITIONS IN THE FEDERAL \n                   CHARTER OF THE RESERVE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION.\n\n       (a) National Executive Committee.--Section 190104(b)(2) of \n     title 36, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``the president elect,'' after ``the \n     president,'';\n       (2) by inserting ``a minimum of'' before ``3 national \n     executive committee members,''; and\n       (3) by striking ``except the executive director,'' and \n     inserting ``except the president elect and the executive \n     director,''.\n       (b) Officers.--Section 190104(c) of such title is amended--\n       (1) in paragraph (1)--\n       (A) by inserting ``a president elect,'' after ``a \n     president,'';\n       (B) by inserting ``a minimum of'' before ``3 national \n     executive committee members,'';\n       (C) by striking ``a surgeon, a chaplain, a historian, a \n     public relations officer,''; and\n       (D) by striking ``as decided at the national convention'' \n     and inserting ``specified in the constitution of the \n     corporation''; and\n       (2) in paragraph (2)--\n       (A) by inserting ``and take office'' after ``be elected'' ; \n     and\n\n[[Page S9006]]\n\n       (B) by striking ``and the national public relations \n     officer,'' and inserting ``the judge advocate, and any other \n     national officers specified in the constitution of the \n     corporation,''.\n       (c) Vacancies.--Section 190104(d)(1) of such title is \n     amended by striking ``president and last past president,'' \n     and inserting ``president, president elect, and last past \n     president,''.\n       (d) Records and Inspection.--Section 190109(a)(2) of such \n     title is amended by striking ``national council;'' and \n     inserting ``other national entities of the corporation;''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. UDALL of Colorado:\n  S. 1601. A bill to provide for the release of water from the \nmarketable yield pool of water stored in the Ruedi Reservoir for the \nbenefit of endangered fish habitat in the Colorado River, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing along \nwith my friend and colleague, Senator Bennet, the Ruedi Reservoir Water \nAllocation for Recovery of Endangered Fish Act. This bill will help \naddress endangered fish issues in the Colorado River on Colorado's \nwestern slope by allowing the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation to release the \nremaining un-marketed water in Ruedi Reservoir for recovery purposes.\n  The Ruedi Reservoir is a component of the Fryingpan-Arkansas Project, \na U.S. Bureau of Reclamation project, located on the Fryingpan River in \nwestern Colorado. The primary purposes of Ruedi are to provide storage \nof replacement water that allows out-of-priority diversions by the \nproject to Colorado's east slope, and to provide marketable water for \nColorado's west slope uses. A little more than one-third of Ruedi's \nmarketable yield is currently under contract with limited prospects for \nforeseeable future contracting.\n  In 1999, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, FWS, issued a \nprogrammatic biological opinion, PBO, for a critical reach of the \nColorado River in Colorado related to recovery efforts for four fish \nspecies listed as endangered under the Endangered Species Act, ESA. The \nPBO provides ESA compliance for five Reclamation projects: the \nFryingpan-Arkansas Project, including Ruedi Reservoir, the Colorado-Big \nThompson Project, the Colbran Project, the Grand Valley Project, and \nthe Silt Project.\n  The PBO also provides ESA compliance for all existing non-federal \nwater projects and water users of the Colorado River upstream of the \nGunnison River depleting approximately 1 million acre-feet per year and \nfor 120,000 acre-feet per year of new depletions. As part of the PBO, \nColorado water users agreed to provide 10,825 acre-feet per year for \nfish recovery from interim water sources until 2010, by which time \npermanent sources of water must be identified and agreements completed \nbetween water users and the FWS to provide the permanent source or \nsources of water.\n  Water users have identified the required permanent sources of water \nfor endangered fish. Half of the 10,825 acre-feet per year requirement \nwill be met from converting a historical agricultural water right and \nhalf from uncontracted, unobligated Ruedi Reservoir water. Reclamation \nhas initiated NEPA compliance on Federal actions related to providing \n10,825 acre-feet per year for endangered fish. This bill provides that \nthe NEPA process be completed before authorizing Reclamation to apply \nthe marketable yield to ESA benefits.\n  In regards to costs, the reimbursable capital costs for the Ruedi \nReservoir were assigned separately in the authorizing legislation to \neast and west slope beneficiaries of the project. The east slope's \nobligation of $7.6 million was assigned to Southeastern Colorado Water \nConservancy District under a conventional Reclamation master contract \nfor the 28,000 acre-feet replacement pool. The obligation to repay \nRuedi Reservoir's $9.3 million cost was assigned to the marketable \nyield for the west slope's benefit, and this was to be re-paid by water \ncontracts from this pool for west slope uses. There is no traditional, \nmaster contract with a west slope project ``sponsor'' for this portion \nof the project's cost recovery. A little more than one-third of the \navailable marketable yield pool is currently under contract. Given that \nthere are limited prospects for foreseeable future contracting, \npermanent assignment of 5,412.5 acre-feet of water for endangered fish \nrecovery is prudent and appropriate.\n  To effectuate this new arrangement, the bill would amend Public Law \n106-392 to permanently assign 5,412.5 acre-feet of water in Ruedi \nReservoir from the west slope's marketable yield pool to endangered \nfish recovery and associated cost reallocation to non-reimbursable \npurposes. In so doing, the bill would accomplish a number of goals such \nas ensure continued ESA compliance for all east and west slope Colorado \nRiver main stem water users upstream of the Gunnison River, provide \nwater from Ruedi Reservoir at affordable rates for potential future \ncontracting, and provide consistency with long-standing Congressional \npolicy and Reclamation law that water dedicated to fish and wildlife \npurposes from Reclamation projects is a non-reimbursable cost. The bill \nwould also ensure compliance with Colorado law regarding the purposes \nof Ruedi Reservoir, namely that the marketable yield pool is available \nfor the benefit of west slope water users by providing ESA compliance \nfor uses of this water.\n  As with most issues related to water in the west, and especially in \nColorado, one facility like the Ruedi Reservoir can affect many \ninterests and values. This bill would provide mutual benefits to water \nusers throughout the Colorado River. It is an example where we can \nreach consensus to continue to provide needed water to communities \nwhile also preserving fish species.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1601\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 10, United States Code, to ensure that \nexcess oil and gas lease revenues are distributed in accordance with \nthe Mineral Leasing Act, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nArmed Services.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, today I am introducing a \nrevised version of the Naval Oil Shale Reserve Mineral Royalty Revenue \nAllocation Act that I previously introduced on August 4, 2009. This \nbill is the same as the one I previously introduced, but it corrects an \nerror regarding the allocation of outstanding mineral royalties to four \ncounties in Colorado instead of two--those four counties being \nGarfield, Rio Blanco, Mesa and Moffat. This revised version also makes \nit clear that the mineral royalty allocated to these four counties \nwould not affect the normal allocations to those counties under the \n``payment in lieu of taxes'' program. In all other respects, the bill \nand its purposes remain the same. It is a bill designed to release \nmineral royalty receipts to Colorado where the receipts were generated \nfrom gas development within this reserve on the western slope near \nRifle, Colorado.\n  By way of background, in 1997, Congress transferred the federal Naval \nOil Shale Reserve lands in western Colorado from the U.S. Department of \nEnergy, DOE, to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management, BLM, and directed \nthe BLM to begin leasing the oil and gas resources under these lands. \nThe Transfer Act also directed that the royalties recouped from this \nleasing program be set aside and the state portion not disbursed to \nColorado until the Interior Department and the DOE certified that \nenough money from the royalty receipts accrued to satisfy two purposes.\n  The first was to provide funding to clean up the Anvil Points site on \nthese lands. Anvil Points was an oil shale research facility that \noperated within the Naval Oil Shale Reserve for about 40 years. The \nfacility was operated by DOE at one point, and private industry \nperformed research there under contract. Waste material was produced at \nthis facility from oil shale mining and processing. That waste \naccumulated in a pile of about 300,000 cubic yards of spent oil shale \nand other material--including arsenic and other heavy metals--which \nrests on slopes below the facility.\n  The second purpose was for the reimbursement of certain costs related \nto the transfer.\n  Following the transfer to the BLM, this area experienced significant \nnatural gas leasing and, as a result, significant royalty revenue was \ngenerated.\n  On August 8, 2008, the DOI and DOE certified that adequate funds had \naccrued to accomplish the goals of cleanup and cost reimbursement and \nsubsequently allocated all royalty revenue generated after this date \naccording to the Mineral Leasing Act, which establishes that Colorado \nreceive a proportionate share.\n  However, considerably more revenue accrued than was necessary to \naccomplish the cleanup and cost reimbursement goals. This bill would \ndirect that this additional royalty revenue be allocated to Colorado \naccording to the formulas and processes established for the \ndisbursement of federal mineral royalties under the Mineral Leasing \nAct.\n  The bill also directs that the Colorado share of this remaining \nroyalty revenue be allocated to the four Counties directly impacted by \noil and gas leasing on the Naval Oil Shale Reserve lands--specifically, \nGarfield, Rio Blanco, Mesa, and Moffat Counties. Finally, this bill \nmakes it clear that these royalty payments shall not affect the funds \nthat these Counties normally receive under the ``payment in lieu of \ntaxes''--or PILT--program.\n  Based on figures provided by the BLM, there remains approximately $17 \nmillion in these accounts for Colorado's royalty revenue share. This \nbill would make Colorado whole and provide it with its rightful share \nof the remaining royalty revenue to address critical local needs and \nimpacts from the very leasing that produced the royalty revenue.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1602\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. TREATMENT OF OIL SHALE RESERVE RECEIPTS.\n\n       Section 7439(f) of title 10, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(3)(A) The moneys deposited in the Treasury under \n     paragraph (1) that exceed the amounts described in \n     subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (2) shall be \n     transferred by the Secretary of the Treasury in accordance \n     with section 35 of the Mineral Leasing Act (30 U.S.C. 191) to \n     the State of Colorado for use in accordance with subparagraph \n     (B).\n       ``(B)(i) Of the amounts to be distributed under \n     subparagraph (A), the Secretary of the Treasury shall \n     transfer--\n       ``(I) 40 percent to Garfield County, Colorado;\n       ``(II) 40 percent to Rio Blanco County, Colorado;\n       ``(III) 10 percent to Moffat County, Colorado; and\n       ``(IV) 10 percent to Mesa County, Colorado.\n       ``(ii) The amounts provided to the counties under clause \n     (i) shall be used by the counties, or any cities or political \n     subdivisions within the counties to which the funds are \n     transferred by the counties, to mitigate the effects of oil \n     and gas development activities within the affected counties, \n     cities, or political subdivisions.\n       ``(iii) Amounts provided to the counties under clause (i) \n     shall not be considered for the purpose of calculating \n     payments for the counties under chapter 69 of title 31, \n     United States Code.''.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mr. Durbin, and Mr. Sessions):\n  S. 1606. A bill to require foreign manufacturers of products imported \ninto the United States to establish registered agents in the United \nStates who are authorized to accept service of process against such \nmanufacturers, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. I rise to speak in support of the Foreign \nManufacturers Legal Accountability Act of 2009, which I am introducing \ntoday with the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, Senator \nSessions, and Senator Durbin. This bipartisan bill is an important step \nin protecting American consumers and businesses from injuries caused by \ndefective products manufactured outside the United States. Those \nproducts hurt American consumers--they lead to serious injuries, and \neven death--and they hurt the American businesses that must deal with \nangry customers, product recalls, and unusable inventory.\n  The list of recent examples of Americans injured by defective foreign \nproducts is shocking. Last year, a contaminated blood thinner from a \nforeign manufacturer caused severe medical reactions and contributed to \nnumerous deaths. In 2006, a foreign-made, lead-tainted charm bracelet \nclaimed the life of a 4-year-old. The autopsy demonstrated that the \ncharm was 99 percent lead, 1,650 times more than the 0.06 percent lead \nlimit specified in enforcement guidelines for children's jewelry. \nImported food products from seafood to honey have been contaminated \nwith unthinkable chemicals, including veterinary drugs banned in \ndomestic production, potentially harmful antibiotics, and unapproved \nfood additives. Sixty million packages of pet food contaminated with \ntainted wheat gluten have been recalled in the last two years. \nSubstandard tires have failed, leading to fatalities. Most recently, \ndefective drywall imported from China has been found to contain \nexcessively high levels of sulfur, causing houses to smell like rotten \neggs, corroding copper wiring, and making expensive appliances fail. \nThousands of homes may be affected.\n  At a hearing that I chaired in May, the Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts explored the legal hurdles \nfacing consumers who are injured by defective foreign products and by \nbusinesses that find that their foreign partners refuse to honor their \ncontracts. These hurdles allow foreign manufacturers to continue to \ninjure American businesses and consumers, and also put American \nmanufacturers at a competitive disadvantage since they allow foreign \nmanufacturers to offer cheaper products that do not comply with \nAmerican safety requirements. Two major hurdles to proper \naccountability are the inability to serve\n\n[[Page S9008]]\n\nprocess on the foreign manufacturer and the ability of that foreign \nmanufacturer, even if served, to evade the jurisdiction of American \ncourts. As the witnesses testified at the hearing, legislation that \naddresses these issues is necessary and appropriate. The Foreign \nManufacturers Legal Accountability Act addresses both concerns.\n  The first problem, the inability to serve process on a manufacturer, \nessentially means that it is difficult for an American to give a \nforeign manufacturer the documents necessary to give it the legally \nrequired notice that it is the subject of a lawsuit. This sounds like a \nsimple step, and it should be. Unfortunately, however, it is very hard \nto serve process on foreign companies abroad. As witnesses explained at \nthe hearing in May, service abroad is complicated by the Hague \nConvention on the Service Abroad of Judicial and Extra Judicial \nDocuments in Civil and Commercial Matters, to which the United States \nis a signatory. Under that convention, a complaint must be translated \ninto the foreign language, transmitted to the Central Authority in the \nforeign country, and then delivered according to the rules of service \nin the home country of the defendant. This can cause months and even \nyears of delay, not to mention great expense for Americans.\n  The Foreign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act will allow \nAmericans to overcome that procedural hurdle by serving legal papers \ninside the United States on registered agents of foreign manufacturers. \nThe bill requires the heads of federal government agencies such as the \nFood and Drug Administration to pass regulations requiring that foreign \nmanufacturers of products regulated by their agencies register an agent \nwho will accept service of process. It allows regulators to exclude \nmanufacturers who only import a minimal amount of products into the \nUnited States. It imposes a minimal burden on foreign manufacturers, \nsince they would only have to appoint one agent to accept service of \nprocess for all state and federal regulatory and civil actions anywhere \nin the United States. The bill allows the manufacturer to choose any \nlocation for that agent with a ``substantial connection to the \nimportation, distribution, or sale of the products of such foreign \nmanufacturer or producer.'' This clear and straightforward system will \nallow Americans to commence their lawsuits fairly and promptly, and \nensure that foreign manufacturers have proper and fair notice of the \nproceedings brought against them. It will not conflict with American \nobligations under the Hague convention, since that convention applies \nto service of process on foreign manufacturers in their home countries, \nnot in the United States.\n  The second hurdle, the inability to establish personal jurisdiction \nover foreign manufacturers, can end a lawsuit against a foreign \nmanufacturer before it even begins. Think about how unfair this is. A \nforeign manufacturer sells its defective products in the United States, \ninjures American consumers and businesses, and then argues that it is \nnot subject to the courts in the state where the American was injured--\nin legal parlance, that the courts do not have personal jurisdiction \nover it. As witnesses explained at the hearing, foreign manufacturers \nraise this technical legal defense to avoid liability even when serious \ninjuries or even death have been caused by their products--their \ndefective tires, fireworks, exercise equipment, bikes, and toys.\n  The Foreign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act will enable \ninjured Americans to surmount this hurdle. It will make clear to \nforeign manufacturers that by importing their products into the United \nStates and by registering an agent in the United States, they are \nconsenting to the jurisdiction of the courts in the state where their \nagent is located. By consenting to jurisdiction, the manufacturers will \navert unnecessary and expensive legislation about technical legal \nissues and allow courts to settle the merits of disputes. This approach \nis fair to foreign manufacturers since all American manufacturers are \nsubject to the jurisdiction of the courts of at least one state. This \nbill therefore complies with the trade principle that we should not \nsubject foreign manufacturers to burdens not already imposed on \ndomestic manufacturers.\n  Indeed, the Foreign Manufacturers Legal Accountability Act is \nultimately about fairness. We all know American manufacturers comply \nwith regulations that ensure the safety of American consumers and \nbusinesses. When they fail to do so, they must answer to regulators and \nare held accountable through the American tort system. Unfortunately, \nhowever, foreign manufacturers are not being held to the same \nstandards--injuring American consumers and businesses, and putting \nAmerican manufacturers at a competitive disadvantage. We must level the \nplaying field for all manufacturers and provide justice for American \nconsumers and businesses. The Foreign Manufacturers Legal \nAccountability Act will allow us to make a major step in that \ndirection. It covers major product categories including consumer goods, \ndrugs, cosmetics, and chemicals, and it requires relevant agencies to \nstudy workable approaches to ensure that foreign food producers also \nare brought within the ambit of the American legal system.\n  Protecting Americans and holding foreign manufacturers accountable \nwhen their products harm American consumers and businesses is a \nbipartisan issue. Everyone agrees that we should do what we can to keep \nAmericans safe from defective products. So too, I think, do we all \nagree that American companies should not be at a competitive \ndisadvantage to their foreign counterparts. The Foreign Manufacturers \nLegal Accountability Act builds on those fundamental agreements. I am \ngrateful to my colleagues Senator Sessions and Senator Durbin for their \nhard work on this bill and look forward to working with my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to see it passed into law.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, Senator Whitehouse's legislation would \nhelp American consumers bring civil claims against foreign \nmanufacturers who produce faulty goods and send them into the U.S. \nmarket. Currently, it is nearly impossible for harmed American \nconsumers to bring a tort action against foreign manufacturers of \nproducts that are flawed or even dangerous. Foreign manufacturers are \noften difficult to identify or locate and even if found, the process of \nseeking damages against them is extremely costly and burdensome. \nWithout the threat of litigation, foreign manufacturers have little to \nno accountability to their American consumers, resulting in lower \nquality and often defective products. Furthermore, American companies \nwho unknowingly buy shoddy products from foreign manufacturers and then \nresell them to consumers become the sole defendant in tort cases filed \nagainst them when foreign defendants cannot be located. According to \nthe Consumer Product Safety Commission, Chinese manufacturers were \nresponsible for 69 percent of all product recalls in 2007 and 53 \npercent in 2008. These numbers demonstrate the need for Congress to \ntake action to protect American consumers. Senator Whitehouse's \nproposal is a positive step in the right direction.\n  I have witnessed the effects of this problem firsthand in my State. \nMr. Chuck Stefan from Alabama testified before the Subcommittee on \nAdministrative Oversight and the Courts, which Senator Whitehouse \nchairs and I serve as ranking member, about the hardships his business \nhas faced in seeking damages against a foreign manufacturer. Mr. Stefan \nis a Senior Executive Vice President at the The Mitchell Company, a \nhomebuilder in Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi. Forty-five of the \nhouses he built have been identified as containing a defective type of \nChinese sheetrock, which produces corrosive gases. These gases are not \nmerely unpleasant. They damage the copper found in piping and wiring \nsystems. When the problem was first discovered, The Mitchell Company \ncould not even determine who manufactured the drywall as it was only \nstamped ``made in China.'' When the manufacturing parties were finally \nidentified as both Chinese and German-based, it was a substantial and \ncostly burden to serve them properly even though the companies had \nextensive operations in the United States. Mr. Stefan emphasized the \nfact that when foreign manufacturers cannot be held accountable, it \nhurts his company's bottom line and harms U.S. consumers.\n\n[[Page S9009]]\n\n  Stores such as Mr. Stefan's are becoming all too common and it is \nincumbent upon Congress to work towards ameliorating the burdens that \nU.S. businesses and consumers face when seeking damages against foreign \nmanufacturers. This issue is one that affects consumers nationwide. I \nam grateful to Senator Whitehouse for taking the initiative to ensure \nthat Congress does its part in solving this problem.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. CANTWELL (for herself, Mrs. Murray, Ms. Murkowski, and Mr. \n        Begich):\n  S. 1609. A bill to authorize a single fisheries cooperative for the \nBering Sea Aleutian Islands longline catcher processor subsector, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, today I introduce the Longline Catcher \nProcessor Subsector Single Cooperative Act.\n  In Washington State, our history is based on a rich maritime \ntradition that contributes billions of dollars to the state's economy \neach year. There are 3,000 vessels in Washington's fishing fleet that \nemploy 10,000 fishermen. Seafood processors employ another 3,800 \nWashingtonians. And fish wholesalers employ an additional 1,000 people.\n  For many communities along this nation's coastlines, the economy \nliterally ebbs and flows with the tide. It is important to remember \nthat the ocean resources these communities depend on are a public trust \nand a resource to be both treasured and protected.\n  As guardians of the ocean and its plentiful resources, it is \nnecessary that we examine all issues of ``ownership'' with care, \ntransparency, and fairness. The issue of fishery cooperatives has \nproved to be an issue that demands nothing less.\n  In July of 2008, I chaired a hearing in the Commerce Committee's \nSubcommittee on Oceans, Atmosphere, Fisheries and Coast Guard, \nexamining the impact of fishery management regimes on fishing safety \nand conservation. Following that hearing and numerous meetings with \nstakeholders to discuss the policy, safety, economic, and environmental \nimplications of fishing cooperatives, I am here today to introduce the \nLongline Catcher Processor Subsector Single Cooperative Act, \nlegislation that would allow for the formation of a single fishing \ncooperative in the Pacific cod catcher processor fleet.\n  Instead of fishermen racing against each other and the elements to \ncatch as much as they can, this bill would allow the fishermen to bring \nsome sanity back to their livelihoods. Under this legislation, the \nPacific cod catcher processor fishery can allocate the catch among \ntheir members, putting an end to the very dangerous ``race for fish.''\n  The cooperative would empower commercial fishermen with the framework \nand incentives to police themselves while still preserving the crucial \nregulatory and oversight responsibilities of the federal government and \nthe North Pacific Fishery Management Council.\n  By adopting this bill, we can improve fishing safety in the Pacific \ncod catcher processor fishery by putting an end to the ``race for \nfish.'' Doing so would lessen the fishery's environmental footprint, \nand give these fishermen the financial certainty that has worked for \nothers across this Nation.\n  Fishing safety is a real concern that must be addressed at the \nfederal level. In 2006, the Coast Guard reported that in the decade \nfrom 1994 to 2004, 1,398 fishing vessels were lost tragic--reminders of \nwhat can go wrong at sea.\n  Most of these fishing-related fatalities occur in the North Pacific, \nwhere the fishermen from my home state of Washington make their living. \nThe difficult waters equate to the highest casualty rates in the \nnation, and highest rates of fatality and injury among fisherman.\n  But the North Pacific's rough waters are not the only factor these \nfishermen have to cope with.\n  It is a tough business--tough for those who work the boats and those \nwho make the business-end decisions. It's a business that is driven by \nincentives and dangerous conditions that work in tandem to place \ncountless numbers of fishermen at risk.\n  When things go wrong, it is usually because of failures at multiple \nlevels. You see, it's not always about vessels. Nor is it all about \ninspections, safety equipment, or training. Fishing safety is closely \nrelated to how fisheries are managed and the very foundation fishing \nhas come to be built upon: competition.\n  Without legislation such as this, the fisheries will continue to \noperate on a foundation of destructive competition, or a ``race for \nfish.'' And this race for fish is a very dangerous race.\n  According to Lieutenant Christopher Woodley, the former fishing \nVessel Safety Coordinator of the 13th U.S. Coast Guard District based \nin Seattle:\n\n       This race encourages fishermen to operate in all weather \n     and sea conditions, to operate without rest, and encourages \n     risk-taking behaviors.\n\n  But we can change that.\n  By instituting a cooperative style of fishery management through this \nlegislation, we dramatically change the incentives. And by changing the \nincentives to put a new premium on safety, we can change the way people \nfish and hopefully prevent future tragedies at sea.\n  Safety is not the only goal of this legislation. This legislation \naims to make environmental and economic improvements to the process of \nfishing.\n  By eliminating the ``race for fish,'' as I mentioned before, we \neffectively slow the pace of fishing meaning commercial fishermen can \noptimize onboard processing facilities. The result is an increase in \nthe product recovery rate per pound of fish caught, meaning they can \nuse more parts of the fish and make wiser and more efficient use of our \nprecious ocean resources. A slower pace also decreases bycatch and \npromotes ownership of the fishery, which will facilitate a conservation \nmindset in the fishermen.\n  We have once again shifted the incentive from reckless speed to doing \nthings slower, better, smarter, and more environmentally conscious.\n  Furthermore, the Longline Catcher Processor Subsector Fisheries \nCooperative Act means greater job stability for the Pacific cod freezer \nlongliner fleet's workers.\n  When fishermen no longer race, the fishing season lasts longer. This \nmeans more stability and predictability for crew members, and \neliminates the boom and bust cycle that often prevails today.\n  I want to be clear that this bill is not yet a finished product. I \nwelcome comments, suggestions, and criticisms to help make this bill \ngood public policy for everyone involved.\n  As we discuss issues like safety of our fisherman and environmental \nimplications to our oceans, it's imperative that we commit to an open \nand transparent process that shines the light of accountability.\n  Both in fisheries management, fishing safety, and those areas where \nthe two intersect, transparency must be the rule.\n  We owe it to our coastal communities, our fisherman, and the American \npublic collectively as stewards of one of our greatest public \nresources--our oceans.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1609\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to repeal \nthe shipping investment withdrawal rules in section 955 and to provide \nan incentive to reinvest foreign shipping earnings in the United \nStates; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I am pleased to join with my colleagues \nSenators Vitter, Landrieu, Murray, and Martinez and introduce the \nAmerican Shipping Reinvestment Act of 2009. This legislation will build \non work Congress started in 2004 to strengthen the U.S. merchant \nmarine, create needed jobs in U.S. ship building, and stimulate \neconomic activity in our maritime sector.\n  Since our Nation's founding, the maritime sector has been integral to \nU.S. national security and economic\n\n[[Page S9011]]\n\nsecurity. American companies own and operate both U.S. flag ships and a \nsignificant number of vessels under international registries. The U.S. \nflag fleets of these companies generally are built in the United States \nand are manned with U.S. seafarers. These U.S. flag fleets support not \nonly the shipbuilding industrial base in this country and the pool of \nqualified seafarers, but they also create the shipping assets that are \nneeded for military sealift in time of war or national emergency.\n  Most people understand commercial shipping and understand that we \nmaintain a fleet of ships for military purposes. What may not be as \nwell known is that the international ships of some American-owned \ncompanies are part of what is called the effective U.S.-controlled \nfleet, EUSC fleet. The EUSC is the fleet of merchant vessels registered \nin certain foreign nations that are available for requisition, use, or \ncharter by the U.S. Government in the event of war or national \nemergency.\n  For example, U.S. flag commercial vessels and their American crews \ntransported the majority of the cargo--more than 25 million measurement \ntons of cargo--in support of Operations Enduring Freedom and Iraqi \nFreedom during the period of 2002-2008.\n  What people also may not know is that the EUSC fleet has been in \ndecline for the past quarter century, largely because of U.S. tax \npolicy. Following enactment of certain 1986 tax law changes, there was \na precipitous decline in American-owned international shipping. To \nremain competitive, many American-owned shipping companies either \nbecame foreign companies or simply divested themselves of their foreign \nassets.\n  A 2002 study commissioned by the Department of Defense and performed \nby professors at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that \nthe EUSC fleet dropped by 38 percent in terms of numbers of ships and \nnearly 55 percent in terms of deadweight tonnage between 1986 and 2000. \nPerhaps more importantly, these declines have been largely experienced \nin militarily-useful vessel types. For example, the results of a 2002 \nDOD study found that if the EUSC fleet continues its present decline, \nDOD's ability to support U.S. military tanker requirements will \ndiminish over time.\n  Fortunately, Congress recognized this problem in 2004 and addressed \nit by enacting the tonnage tax regime as part of the American Jobs \nCreation Act. Our legislation today builds on that policy by correcting \nan oversight in the 2004 act that has continued to stymie the ability \nof U.S. shipbuilding companies to invest in new ships in the United \nStates.\n  We have very strong economic and national security reasons to support \nU.S. owned shipowning companies and to maintain a vibrant maritime \nindustry in this country. We also have to continue to support needed \nchanges in our tax code so that we provide operators of U.S. flag \nvessels in international trade the opportunity to be competitive with \ntheir tax-advantaged foreign competitors.\n  Notwithstanding the significant competitive disadvantages between \n1986 and 2004 for American companies operating international ships, \nthere continues to be several U.S. owned shipping companies with \nforeign operations, and our legislation is directed as helping them \nsustain and grow their U.S. flag fleets and to maintain their EUSC \nfleets. This bill will help these companies make needed investment in \nthe U.S. economy, and create jobs in a way that also will enhance \nnational security.\n  Specifically, The American Shipping Reinvestment Act of 2009 would \nrepeal an outdated section of the Internal Revenue Code and allow U.S. \nshipping companies with foreign income earned prior to 1986 to reinvest \nit into the U.S. for the purpose of growing their U.S. flag operations.\n  Congress first included foreign shipping income in Subpart F in 1975, \nwhich meant that all shipping income was taxable at the full U.S. \ncorporate tax rate no matter whether it was invested abroad or in the \nUnited States. However, a temporary rule, applicable to foreign \nshipping income earned from 1975 to 1986, continued to allow for \ndeferral in cases where this income was reinvested in qualifying \nshipping activities. Section 955 of the Internal Revenue Code provided \nthat this income would be included in gross income, i.e., taxed, \nimmediately under Subpart F in the event of any net decrease in \nqualified shipping investments.\n  The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 restored for shipping income \nthe normal tax rule under which non-Subpart F income of foreign \nsubsidiaries is not taxed by the United States until it is repatriated, \ngenerally as a dividend. In restoring the potential for deferral for \ncertain shipping income, Congress in 2004 returned the treatment of \nshipping income to where it was prior to 1975.\n  Unfortunately, Congress did not address the rules under IRC Section \n955 that apply to income earned between 1975 and 1986, thus creating a \nsituation that this income is permanently stranded offshore. Our bill \nwould repeal IRC Section 955 and will allow these stranded assets to be \nreinvested in the United States under the favorable tax terms that were \nin effect for other companies and industries in 2004. Specifically, the \nlegislation provides a one-time opportunity for American-owned shipping \ncompanies to bring foreign source income back into the United States at \na discounted tax rate for the purpose of expanding and growing our \ndomestic maritime industry. Without the commonsense change in our \nlegislation, these old, stranded assets will never return to the United \nStates and never be subject to U.S. taxation.\n  The bill is guaranteed to create jobs for American workers with the \nfunds being brought back into the U.S. economy--on the ships, in the \nshipyards building the ships, and in supporting businesses. The bill \ncontains a provision that would recapture any tax benefits if a \nshipping company reduces its full-time U.S. employment levels.\n  This bill also would enhance U.S. national security interests by \nsupporting shipyards that are vital to our defense industrial base, by \nenabling new U.S. flag tanker capacity to transport our Nation's energy \nproducts, and by providing DOD with critical assets--manpower and \nships--necessary to help sustain military sealift.\n  The bill is strongly supported by maritime labor, shipyards, and ship \nowners and operators and can provide a boost to the U.S. maritime \nindustry at a time when the U.S. is struggling to find its economic \nfooting. The jobs created by this legislation are well-paying, long-\nterm jobs in a crucial sector of our Nation's economy. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me and my other original cosponsors in supporting \nthis bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1610\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Shipping \n     Reinvestment Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2.

         \n      By Mr. GREGG (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Ms. Collins, Mr. Dodd, \n        Mr. Martinez, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Snowe, and Ms. Mikulski):\n  S. 1611. A bill to provide collective bargaining rights for public \nsafety officers employed by States or their political subdivisions; to \nthe Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, this morning, 660,000 police officers and \n300,000 firefighters across the country will get up and go to work to \nprotect our homes, our families, and our communities. They will go into \nburning buildings, patrol our streets, and put their lives on the line, \nbecause they believe in the importance of what they are doing.\n  These dedicated workers are in the trenches every day making life-or-\ndeath decisions, and their experiences give them tremendous knowledge \nabout how to protect our country. We need to listen to their \nrecommendations and consider their advice. Unfortunately, however, all \ntoo often, our first responders have no voice in the decisions that \naffect their lives and their livelihoods. Their input is disregarded \nbecause they don't have the same rights as other workers.\n  Workers in the private sector who want a voice on the job have the \nright to form and join a union. They can fight for a safer, fairer \nworkplace. But 300,000 police and 70,000 firefighters live in States \nin which their State governments deny them the fundamental right to a \nvoice on the job. Even if these workers overwhelmingly agree that they \nwant to form and join a union, their State government says they can't \nhave one.\n\n  That is not fair. We are asking these workers to do so much for their \ncommunities--the least we can do in return is give them a voice at the \ntable in the life-and-death discussions and decisions that affect their \nfamilies and their futures. They deserve the opportunity to choose for \nthemselves whether they want the advantages that unions bring.\n  That is why it is an honor to join Senator Gregg and Senator Dodd in \nsponsoring the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation Act to \nguarantee that our first responders will have a path they can use to \ndecide if they want a union. If the workers don't want a union, they \ndon't have to follow that path. But the State has to make it available \nand let the workers choose.\n  It won't be difficult for States to create this path. All they have \nto do is provide four basic rights: the right to form and join a union; \nthe right to sit down at the table and talk; the right to sign a \ncontract if both parties agree; and the right to go to a neutral third \nparty when there are disputes.\n  Apart from these four rights, all the other details of the collective \nbargaining system are left up to the States. They have the flexibility \nto decide whether to exempt small communities. They decide how workers \ncan select a union. They can also decide how workers and employers \nshould resolve disputes--through arbitration, mediation, factfinding, \nor some other mechanism.\n  This bipartisan bill has been carefully drafted to preserve a balance \nbetween the interests of State and local governments and the rights of \nthe workers they employ. It has been the product of years of careful \nnegotiations, including a hearing and two markups in the HELP \nCommittee. It was passed by the House of Representatives in the last \nCongress with an overwhelming bipartisan margin, including 98 \nRepublican votes. No it is time to get it across the finish line and \ngive our dedicated first responders the fair treatment they deserve. It \nis a matter of fundamental fairness and an urgent matter of public \nsafety.\n  I commend Senator Gregg for his leadership on this very important \nissue, and I urge my colleagues to show these heroes the respect they \ndeserve by supporting the Public Safety Employer-Employee Cooperation \nAct.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BENNET:\n  S. 1613. A bill to reduce the Federal budget deficit in a responsible \nmanner; to the Committee on the Budget.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I cannot tell you how much I appreciated \nyour remarks--I was sitting in the chair--and those of Chairman Dodd as \nwell. The hour is late. The idea that you would be here at that hour to \ntalk about something as important as health care is appreciated, I \nknow, by the people in your State, but also by the people in my State \nas well. So I say thank you for that.\n  I also want to talk about health care. I want to talk about health \ncare in the context of fiscal discipline in this country. As you know, \nour Nation's annual deficits are staggering, and our\n\n[[Page S9013]]\n\nnational debt is absolutely unsustainable. For the future of our \ncountry and for our children's sake, as we recover from this \ndevastating blow to our economy, we have to stand together and begin to \nstart the difficult, but essential, work of putting our fiscal house in \norder.\n  Health care reform must help solve this Nation's fiscal problems, not \nmake them worse. To accomplish this, effective reform must bend the \ncost curve in health care spending both in the private and public \nsectors.\n  In part because of years of neglect and inaction, this Congress has \nreached a defining moment of reckoning. Rising health care costs, \nespecially Medicare costs, are now the largest driver of our deficits. \nOur Nation's health care spending, as you were just saying, is 17 \npercent of our Nation's gross domestic product and is expected to grow \nto over 20 percent of GDP in 10 years, on its way, as you said, to 35 \npercent.\n  Health care alone--just health care--will soon account for one-fifth \nof our economy. This represents a greater share of the GDP than our \nmanufacturing, agricultural, forestry, mining, and construction \nindustries combined.\n  As we emerge from this terrible recession, the worst since the Great \nDepression, we cannot commit one-fifth of our economy to health care \nand expect to compete effectively in the global marketplace.\n  Adding to the urgency of the problem, this recession has made \nrocketing health care costs even more painful for families and \nbusinesses in the last 15 months. Both large businesses and small \nbusinesses have cut some 5.1 million jobs, and 2.4 million of these \nnewly unemployed workers have lost the health coverage their jobs once \nprovided. Now the same people must try to find insurance in the \nindividual market where they can be rejected by private insurance \ncompanies for preexisting conditions such as asthma, diabetes, or even \ncancer.\n  Health care costs are strangling opportunities for working families \nand small businesses all over my State and the country. As health care \ncosts rise, families are forced to make choices no one should have to \nmake between insuring their families or their employees and sending \ntheir kids to college, taking lower paying jobs with less \nresponsibility just for the medical benefits and defaulting on their \nmortgage payments to pay for their medical bills.\n  Every one of these examples springs from the experiences of people in \nmy State. And it is no mystery why people are having to make these \nterrible choices. Middle-class wages are not even close to keeping up \nwith these rising insurance costs. While median family income in this \ncountry fell by $300 during the last decade--staggering, by the way; \nover a decade in real dollars, median family income in the United \nStates actually declined by $300--health care costs increased over the \nsame period by 80 percent.\n  The cost of health insurance is eating into family budgets faster and \nfaster. Over the past decades, premiums for Colorado families, as this \nchart shows us, have more than doubled, growing four times faster than \nwage increases. The cost of premiums for a Colorado family is over \n$13,000 today. If we do nothing, by 2016, Colorado families will be \nspending over $25,000 on their premiums, a 90-percent increase. We have \ncome out of a period with an 85-percent increase, and if we do nothing, \nwe are going to end up in a period with a 90-percent increase, with no \nreal increase in wages.\n  Left unaddressed, this imbalance, which is the creation of our \ncatastrophically inefficient health care system, will destroy the \nmiddle class in this country. If we do nothing, if we continue on with \nthe status quo, by 2016, just 7 years from now--and I believe these \nnumbers are very similar to the ones you quoted for Rhode Island--by \n2016, 40 cents of every dollar a typical Colorado family earns will be \neaten up by health care costs, leaving just 60 cents for everything \nelse.\n  Think about it. That is almost half an average family's income. Money \nspent not to educate their children, not to feed them or house them, \nbut just to cover the cost of the family health care plan. And that is \njust paying for coverage. Never mind if you actually get sick.\n  In 2007, 62 percent of the personal bankruptcies in this country were \ndue to medical costs. Traditionally, most people's employers help pay \nfor cost increases. That has been the case for over many years. But I \nheard from employers all over Colorado having to make tough choices--\ncutting back on benefits and laying off more costs to their employees.\n  In the coming years, copays for Coloradans will go up double digits. \nMore Coloradans are being forced into health plans with higher \ndeductibles, and more employers are getting out of the business of \nproviding health insurance for their employees altogether.\n  Mr. President, we won't be able to completely flatten the health care \ncost curve in the short run, and we should be careful not to \noverpromise, but we have to make the rising cost of health care \nsomething our economy can plausibly absorb.\n  Part of the solution is reducing waste and curbing overpayments to \ninsurance companies, and part of the answer is encouraging patients to \nseek preventive care. Small businesses may not see health costs go down \nimmediately, but we sure can slow their rise. And we have to work hard \nto make sure they do not rise this quickly. Reforming our health care \nsystem could save over 100,000 small business jobs in the coming years \nthat would otherwise be lost if we do nothing.\n  I agree with bipartisan voices saying that our first health care goal \nhas to be to drive down costs, and we must start with Medicare. As I \ntravel throughout Colorado, I have met countless physicians, nurses, \nand hospital workers who tell me about the perverse incentives in \nMedicare. Instead of being paid to spend time with patients and produce \nbetter quality care, doctors and nurses are paid for the number of \npatients they see in the shortest amount of time and the number of \nprocedures they perform. This is no way to produce patient-centered \ncare, and it is no way to reduce cost.\n  Medicare doesn't just influence, as you know, the care of the elderly \nand disabled. As the largest health care program in the United States, \nMedicare influences every level of health care. Private insurance and \nemployer-based health care look to Medicare as they make decisions on \nwhat to pay doctors, nurses, and hospitals. Owing to the perverse \nincentives in Medicare, however, since 1970--since 1970--every year for \nalmost 40 years, year-in and year-out, Medicare spending per person has \nrisen by over 8 percent each year, and private insurance spending per \nperson has risen by over 9 percent each year.\n  If we expect reform to begin to gain any traction, we must drive cost \ndown at the Federal level first. We can start by paying doctors and \nnurses to actually do what they are supposed to do and what they want \nto do--be focused on patients. We have to reform the system so that we \nare paying for quality and not volume. We must improve care, produce \nsavings, and slow down cost growth by bundling payments, paying for \nperformance and outcomes, and providing better coordinated care for \npatients and providers.\n  The burden is on us to meet the public expectation that we will drive \ndown costs in the health care system and make it more efficient, that \nwe will make the health care marketplace more competitive, and that we \nwill provide affordable, stable health care coverage to the American \npeople that can't be taken away because they lose a job, have a \npreexisting condition, or have reached some arbitrary cap.\n  Controlling health care costs would help our fiscal situation a great \ndeal, and that is one of the fundamental reasons health care reform is \nneeded. But this alone will not be enough to fill the deepening hole of \nnational debt that threatens America's prosperity. The fiscal decisions \nwe make today matter so much because they will dictate the well-being \nand range of choices of the generations that follow us.\n  Sometimes, with the daily hail of press clippings, these issues may \nseem overly complex, but I like to use a pretty simple analogy. The way \nwe run our government is not different than if you or I were to buy a \nhouse--probably a bigger one than we reasonably could afford--and then \nwe tell the bank to please send the mortgage documents to our kids. \nImagine how that burden--paying for mom and dad's house--would \nconstrain our children's choices. What dreams would they have to defer\n\n[[Page S9014]]\n\nbecause their first obligation was a debt they didn't even incur.\n  My three daughters, ages 9, 8 and 5, have never had an economics \nclass, but I can tell you that as much as they love their mom and dad, \nif asked, they would never do that deal--especially my 5-year-old, \nAnne. Whether we are taking her blanket away or telling her to stop \nsucking her thumb or putting a mountain of debt on her, she knows a raw \ndeal when she sees one.\n  We in Congress owe the next generation much more than this, as the \nchairman, Senator Dodd, was saying. We ought to be able to build on our \nroles as parents and community leaders to respect our children, come \ntogether, and plan America's way back to fiscal health. The longer we \nwait, the more difficult the choices become. If we wait 10 years, we \nwill face a massive gap between our spending and the revenue the \ngovernment collects. If we wait 10 years to take action, we would have \nto increase individual income taxes by almost 90 percent to keep pace. \nThat is an unacceptable outcome for Colorado's families. If you don't \nlike tax increases, fine, then we would have to slash Federal spending \nby almost one-half. That would mean massive cuts to Medicare, our \nNation's defense, and other critical initiatives that keep our country \nstrong. No one wants to be put in a position to make those kinds of \nchoices either. These outcomes are unacceptable, yet we can see them \ncoming. That is why inaction is so unacceptable on health care and also \non returning to policies of fiscal discipline. It is long past time to \nput in place the policies that will reverse this condition. And as with \nany deep hole, the first order of business is to stop digging.\n  The good news is that we have a tried-and-true way to stop making \nmatters worse. In the 1990s, we had Pay-Go, which effectively forced \nthe shovel from Congress's hands and made Congress stop digging. Pay-Go \nmeans that before Congress can create new spending on permanent \nprograms, it needs to figure out how to pay for that new spending, just \nas every family in the States we represent.\n  Pay-Go helped turn 1980s deficits into 1990s surpluses, and we \nactually began to pay down our debt. Pay-Go is commonsense budgeting. \nIt is not any different, as I just said, than what a family does when \nits spending gets out of hand. When that bad credit card statements \ncomes in the mail, a parent knows it is time to sit down at the kitchen \ntable and plan how to stop the spending. Pay-Go is what Congress and \nPresident Clinton did to respond to Washington's bad credit card bill.\n  Pay-Go was smart lawmaking because it imposed a culture of fiscal \nresponsibility--and I would say discipline--on the Congress. Yet, for \nsome reason, early in this decade a new administration let Pay-Go \nexpire. That played a part in how these surpluses all of a sudden \nturned back into big annual deficits. This is how America incurred \nyears of new debt.\n  The frustrating reality is that we are not getting enough out of \nborrowing all this money in the end--fighting an expensive war with \ntremendous unseen long-term costs to follow, ignoring the staggering \ncosts of our health care system and entitlements, paying huge interest \ncosts on our debt, in large part to foreign countries. These are hardly \nworthy uses of deficit spending.\n  In 2003, the Bush administration and Congress passed a new \nentitlement program called Medicare Part D. It is very popular, but we \nnever paid a dime for it. They also chose two tax cuts for people who \nneeded them least over fiscal discipline. They ignored skyrocketing \nmandatory spending. They created a brandnew bureaucracy and just \nsaddled all of this heavy new weight on America's national debt.\n  In short, Washington was unwilling to ask the American people to pay \nfor any of its investments--they put it on our children's shoulders \ninstead.\n  And the tragedy of this incredible mismanagement is, it didn't work. \nOur economy plunged into its deepest hole since the Great Depression.\n  Fortunately, earlier this year, the House rightly passed new \nstatutory Pay-Go. The Senate should pass Pay-Go too. That's why today, \nSenator McCaskill and I introduced Pay-Go. We believe that Pay-Go is \none important way to make sure that our fiscal situation doesn't get \nany worse. Pay-Go is not a magic bullet, but it is part of the answer \nto our fiscal woes.\n  Once Pay-Go is in place though, we cannot stop there. Pay-Go will \nhelp us stop digging. But we also need to budget for the future, stop \nrunning large deficits and fill this fiscal hole completely. I am \noptimistic that this can be done, and it will take bipartisan \ncommitment and discipline.\n  One place to start is with the growth of our yearly spending. Like \nPay-Go, the yearly spending of Congress has also been done before, and \nit has worked.\n  That is why today I am introducing separate legislation, the Deficit \nReduction Act of 2009, that would create yearly limits on discretionary \nspending. By pairing these discretionary spending limits with Pay-Go, \nwe can start to make a substantial change in how Washington does \nbusiness.\n  But it is not enough just to limit new spending across the board. \nMuch of the reason that we are running such large deficits, is that we \nhave made long-term spending commitments, called mandatory spending. To \ntruly reverse the totality of our disastrous fiscal course, we must be \nwilling to address rapidly expanding mandatory commitments too.\n  The best way--you know, it is funny, when you use the word \n``mandatory.'' It is the word that should be used to express what this \ndebt burden is we are putting on our kids. It will be mandatory that \nthey pay that back before they make decisions about how to educate \ntheir own children; before they make decisions about how to provide \nindividual health care in this country or make other kinds of \ninvestments all across the United States, in transportation or in new \neconomies. What will be mandatory as we fall farther and farther behind \nin this global economy--what will be mandatory for them is to pay the \nbill left behind by their mothers and fathers.\n  The best way to get Congress to take a hard look at mandatory \nspending, is to place a flexible cap on our annual deficits. That's the \nother main component of what my new legislation would do. The cap in \nthe Deficit Reduction Act is realistic--it would impose limits that are \nconsistent with what economists believe we can sustain. This deficit \nlimit is flexible--providing an exception when we are in a recession.\n  Here is how the deficit limit would work. Whatever the gross domestic \nproduct is in a given year, Congress must limit the deficit to 3 \npercent of the GDP or less. Economists tell us that this 3 percent \nnumber is sustainable over time, and that is a reasonably healthy \nceiling. Now of course we should push to do better than running a \ndeficit that is 3 percent of GDP. But this is a good starting point at \nsetting and adhering to a budget. We would all clap if the deficits of \ntoday--12 or 13 percent of GDP--were 3 percent, and no one would clap \nlouder than our children.\n  Under my legislation, if Congress failed to meet these deficit \ncontrol requirements, the government would have to impose an across the \nboard cut called a sequestration. Certain programs such as Social \nSecurity and veterans programs would not be subject to cuts. Yet most \nof the government's functions would be. The goal, of course, is to \navoid this drastic measure by forcing Congress to plan ahead, and \nforcing Congress to pay attention to the deficit when it makes its \nspending choices.\n  Deficit limits make perfect sense during most years. But, as we have \nlearned during this recession, an infusion of public funds can jolt a \nfrozen economy and help turn that economy around. Running temporary \ndeficits can kickstart a stagnant economy. But this only works if \nduring healthy economic times, you also reduce government spending. The \ndeficit limits I am proposing in this legislation would put Congress on \na gradual track back to solid fiscal footing.\n  We should immediately enact budget reform proposals like Pay-Go \ndiscretionary spending limits and deficit limits. The CBO has concluded \nthat after 2019, the rate at which we accumulate debt will continue to \naccelerate due to the aging of the population and increased health care \ncosts. As angry as we all are with the excessive leverage in the \nprivate marketplace over the past decade that contributed to the market \ncrashing, it is also obvious that Washington set a very bad example.\n\n[[Page S9015]]\n\n  Let's put an end to these unsound fiscal practices. Let's not put our \nkids in the kind of situation we have inherited. Let's not make matters \neven worse, and the policy decisions regarding the national debt even \nharder for our kids.\n  What we need now is leadership and cooperation; not more shifting \ncosts to our kids. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if we \nremain on our current course, the total debt owed by the public will \nstand at over $17 trillion by the end of fiscal year 2019--only 10 \nyears from today.\n  The point is that linked with our growing debt are the dreams and the \nplans of millions of American families. There is nothing fun about \ntightening our belt and cutting popular programs. I don't like it any \nmore than anyone else who is here. Yet there are plenty of encouraging \nsigns that this Congress and this President can stand together and do \nexactly that. Recently, just a couple of weeks ago, the Senate stood \nwith the President for fiscal discipline and slashed nearly $2 billion \nfrom an outdated weapons system. That is a good start that I gladly \nsupported. But so much more is left to do.\n  Coloradans already know we are in a bad way. People in my State are \nwell aware that the excesses in recent years are catching up to us, and \nthey know that Congress and the President have to make hard fiscal \nchoices, reform health care before it eats up our entire budget, and \npay for our reform efforts.\n  This challenging outlook may be just what it takes to bring both \npolitical parties to the negotiating table. Paired with Pay-Go, it is \nmy hope that this new legislation can be a real starting point for \nmeaningful fiscal negotiations. It is time we come up with an \nintelligent framework of fiscal management, that keeps Congress \nthinking ahead each time it makes a decision, and each time it puts \ntogether an annual budget, and each time it is faced with America's \nlong-term fiscal trajectory.\n  Washington's fiscal mess was created over many years, and we won't \nsolve the problem overnight. But this bill would give Congress and the \nPresident a guidepost to make the decisions necessary to get our budget \nunder control. It would set a strong and binding standard for us to act \nresponsibly.\n  We must start with what unites us. When I worry about what type of \ncountry we will leave my daughters and all of our young people, I know \nthat others who vote differently than I do have the same worries. We \nowe more to our kids than to leave them a huge national debt and no \nplan to get out of it.\n  If we don't start making difficult decisions soon, we will be \nlimiting our children's ability to make our country a better place, \nbefore they even get started. We will be limiting their ability to \ninvest in education, life-saving scientific research, or new \ntechnologies that form the foundation of economic growth. We will be \nlimiting their ability to defend the Nation during future times of war \nthat we can't even think of today. And we will be limiting their \nchances of having a quality of life even better than what our parents \nand grandparents left to us.\n  If we fail to confront the tough issues so we can control the cost of \nhealth care, we will have squandered this narrow window of opportunity. \nIf we fail to step up to the plate and pass a fiscally sound health \ncare reform bill, this Congress will be remembered for years to come as \nhaving let down the country. If we fail--not just to stop digging this \ndeep fiscal hole, but to put a process in place for climbing back up to \nsolid fiscal footing--we will have failed to perform as the stewards of \nour children's dreams.\n  Let's stand together, with our President and with American families. \nLet's get health care reform done responsibly, let's take action to \nreduce the deficit and debt, and let's put this economy back on track.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE:\n  S. 1615. A bill to amend the Small Business Act and the Small \nBusiness Investment Act of 1958 to stop the small business credit \ncrunch, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Small Business and \nEntrepreneurship.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, the state of small business lending in the \nUnited States is still dire, as was shown during CIT's recent close \nbrush with bankruptcy. One area of lending which has historically \nhelped small firms has been Small Business Administration backed \nlending, but while the SBA traditionally guarantees $20 billion in \nloans annually, before the passage of the stimulus, new lending this \nyear was on track to fall below $10 billion. In fact, in the first \nquarter of fiscal year 2009, the number of SBA 7(a) loans dropped by 57 \npercent when compared with the first quarter of fiscal year 2008.\n  Last year, to help address the frozen credit market and the drop in \nSBA lending I introduced the 10 Steps for a Main Street Economic \nRecovery Act. Many of the provisions in 10 Steps were included in the \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act and several have already been \ncredited with helping to increase SBA volume. These include fee \nreductions for 7(a) and 504 loans and allowing for the refinancing of \n504 loans. To ensure that SBA lending remains a critical source of \ncapital for small businesses, we must continue to bolster this program \nand help it to evolve and grow.\n  In order to maintain this momentum we must take steps to further \nreform and improve SBA-backed lending. The legislation I am \nintroducing, the Next Step, builds on the 10 Steps for a Main Street \nEconomic Recovery Act and makes the SBA's lending programs more vital \nand responsive to the needs of today's small business borrower.\n  The Next Step includes provisions that would allow borrowers to take \nout larger 7(a) and 504 loans up to $5 million. This bill would help \nsatisfy the capital needs of small businesses, looking to start or \nexpand their operations. The bill would also allow for the refinancing \nof 7(a) loans. Finally, SBA borrowers must have the ability to shop and \ncompare SBA loan rates online. My legislation would establish an online \nplatform through the SBA that would allow borrowers to compare SBA loan \nrates and make an informed choice, giving borrowers a chance to save \ntime and money.\n  These targeted reforms included in the Next Step for Main Street \nCredit Availability Act of 2009 will help bring SBA lending into the \nfuture, make the SBA's lending programs competitive with traditional \nsmall businesses' borrowing, and help to increase SBA lending volume.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this critical legislation to help \nimprove small business lending.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1615\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to authorize assistance to small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses to promote exports to the People's Republic of China, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban \nAffairs.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the U.S.-China \nMarket Engagement and Export Promotion Act of 2009. For many small- and \nmedium-sized businesses across this country, some of which are in my \nhome State of Washington, getting access to the Chinese market proves \ndifficult at best. However, to establish a foothold in the ever \nexpanding Chinese market can prove pivotal in achieving financial \nsuccess. China is a tremendous market for U.S. goods and services. \nAccording to the U.S.-China Business Council, despite the global \neconomic downturn, 85 percent of congressional districts increased \ntheir exports to China in 2008. In addition, exports to China in almost \nevery congressional district grew more than exports to anywhere else \nfrom 2000 to 2008.\n  In 2008, U.S. total exports to China equaled $71.5 billion. During \nthe same time, however, our imports from China equaled $337.8 billion. \nThat means our trading balance with China in 2008 was a $266.3 billion \ndeficit. This bill would help States establish export promotion offices \nin China and create a new China Market Advocate Program at U.S. Export \nAssistance Centers around the Nation. The bill also provides assistance \nto small businesses for China trade missions and authorizes grants for \nChinese business education programs.\n  I support this bill because of the enormous role that small \nbusinesses play in our economy. Small- and medium-sized businesses are \na great potential engine of growth. Between 2004 and 2005, small \nbusinesses created 78.9 percent of the Nation's net new jobs, and with \nexpanded export opportunities that number will be able to increase in \nthe near future. Considering the huge impact that small- and medium-\nsized businesses have on our economy, I urge all my colleagues to \nsupport this bill and give the business owners the assistance they need \nto succeed in the Chinese export market.\n  The U.S.-China Market Engagement and Promotion Act will build the \ninfrastructure necessary to connect American small- and medium-sized \nbusinesses with export opportunities in China.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1616\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the Office of Sustainable Housing and \nCommunities, to establish the Interagency Council on Sustainable \nCommunities, to establish a comprehensive planning grant program, to \nestablish a sustainability challenge grant program, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the Livable Communities \nAct.\n  Our communities are growing and changing. And the way we plan for \ntheir futures needs to evolve, as well. At stake is whether or not we \nwill be able to enjoy the places where we live and work without \nexcessive traffic, skyrocketing fuel costs, and sprawling development \npatterns that eat up our open space.\n  As our communities grow, people are living farther from jobs, \ncommuting longer distances on more crowded roadways, paying more at the \npump at a time when family budgets are stretched thin and putting more \ngreenhouse gases into the air at a time when climate change has emerged \nas an urgent threat.\n  We are losing our rural land and open spaces. Transportation costs \nare making housing less affordable. Even though our communities are \ngrowing in size, we are losing the community spirit that makes American \ntowns and cities so great.\n  It is clear that current trends simply cannot continue.\n  Sustainable development will cut down on the traffic that has long \nplagued my home State of Connecticut and connect people with good-\npaying jobs. Done right, it will protect the environment and help us \nmeet energy goals; protect rural areas and green spaces; revitalize our \nMain Streets and urban centers; create and preserve affordable housing; \nand make our communities better places to live, work, and raise \nfamilies.\n  But does that mean sustainable development is a transportation issue? \nAn energy issue? A housing issue? An environmental issue?\n  The answer, of course, is ``all of the above,'' and unfortunately, \nthat tends to short some circuits here in Washington. Our policy has \nlong been stovepiped within the various agencies responsible for each \nof the issues affected by planning and development.\n  In February, I wrote a letter to President Obama urging him to \nestablish a White House Office of Sustainable Development to coordinate \nhousing, transportation, energy, and environmental policies.\n  I felt confident I would find a partner in the White House. The \nPresident has been a strong leader on these issues, and he has shown a \nwillingness to shake up a Federal Government that hasn't always \nsucceeded when it comes to thinking outside the box and addressing \nrelated issues in a comprehensive, effective way.\n  Sure enough, last month I brought together Secretary of \nTransportation Ray LaHood, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \nShaun Donovan, and Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa \nJackson at a Banking Committee hearing--three public servants who don't \noften find themselves in the same hearing room at the same time.\n  They brought with them a pledge that the administration would work \nacross agency lines to take a holistic look at development policy--and \na firm commitment to livability principles that would serve as the \nfoundation for that policy going forward.\n  The administration's principles demonstrate a true understanding of \nthe best way forward.\n  Sustainable development, as grounded in these principles, provides \nmore transportation choices for families, expands access to affordable \nhousing, enhances economic competitiveness by\n\n[[Page S9018]]\n\nconnecting families with jobs and services, targets funding towards \nexisting communities to spur revitalization and protect our open \nspaces, values the unique character of both our cities and our small \ntowns, and improves collaboration between different government agencies \nto better leverage our investments.\n  As Secretary LaHood said at the hearing, we are now all working off \nthe same playbook. But now it is time to snap the ball and move down \nthe field.\n  Last month the White House announced the selection of Shelley Poticha \nto head up these efforts. If the Livable Communities Act becomes law, \nas I hope it will, Ms. Poticha will head a new HUD Office of \nSustainable Housing and Communities.\n  This new office will serve as a clearinghouse for best practices, so \nthat successful initiatives can be easily replicated. And it will give \nHUD Secretary Donovan, Deputy Secretary Ron Simms, and Ms. Poticha the \ntools and authority they need to really dig in and become a partner to \nour communities in creating a sustainable future.\n  One successful play from our playbook could be modeled after a \nproject in my home State of Connecticut. It links housing and \ntransportation policy, encourages smart land use, generates economic \ngrowth, and will reduce our carbon footprint around what's known as the \nTri-City Corridor in Connecticut. This proposal would provide commuter \nand 110-mile-per-hour intercity rail service between New Haven, \nHartford, and Springfield, MA, and feature 12 stops, creating ``transit \nvillages'' and revitalizing local economies.\n  Already, we are seeing how this proposed service is serving as a \ncatalyst: attracting new business, commuters, and residents, and \ntransforming struggling local economies.\n  Along the corridor is Meriden, a small city of nearly 60,000 \nresidents located roughly halfway between New Haven and Hartford. In \nanticipation of a commuter stop on the rail line, the city would like \nto transform 15 acres of brownfields into new commercial and \nresidential developments, including a public green that doubles as a \nflood buffer.\n  Immediately north of that site is the Mills Memorial public housing \ncomplex, providing 140 units of affordable housing to low income \nresidents.\n  By linking transit, housing, and commercial planning, the city of \nMeriden will be able to transform its downtown into a bustling economic \ncenter ready to support a wide range of residents.\n  The vision of Meriden and so many communities throughout the country \nneeds the support and planning tools to take these initiatives from \nidea to action.\n  So, today, I offer for your consideration legislation that encourages \ncommunities across the country to begin planning for more prosperous \nand livable futures.\n  In addition to creating the new HUD Office of Sustainable Housing and \nCommunities I mentioned earlier, this bill creates a competitive grant \nprogram that States and localities can use to better integrate \ntransportation, housing, land use, and economic development when making \nlong-term planning decisions.\n  In addition, it provides funding for communities to implement these \ncomprehensive regional plans through a challenge grant program. This \nprogram will help communities invest in public transportation, \naffordable housing, complete streets, transit-oriented development, and \nredeveloping brownfields.\n  Finally, this bill creates an Interagency Council on Sustainable \nCommunities to break down the ``stovepiping'' that exists within the \nFederal Government and coordinate Federal policies to encourage \nsustainable development.\n  In my home State of Connecticut, integrated planning and sustainable \ndevelopment is critical to growing stronger communities.\n  We have a state-level program called HOMEConnecticut that provides \ngrants to plan Incentive Housing Zones. In these zones, mixed-income \nhousing is built near jobs and transit centers, in downtowns and in \nredeveloped brownfields. More than 50 cities and towns have either \napplied for grants or already received them. The investment will pay \noff in affordable homes, good jobs, and more livable communities.\n  Like bragging on Connecticut, but I would love to see this success \nreplicated in communities around the Nation. The Obama administration \nhas indicated its commitment to encouraging sustainable development and \nhelping local authorities build a better future. It is time for us to \ndo the same.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of this important \nlegislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Mr. Kerry, and Mr. \n        Lugar):\n  S. 1620. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \ntax incentives and fees for increasing motor vehicle fuel economy, and \nfor other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, as the success of the Cash for Clunkers \nProgram that we are working to extend today makes clear, there is \nsubstantial interest among consumers in upgrading the fuel efficiency \nof their vehicles. In fact, maybe the most surprising thing about the \nprogram thus far has been the higher-than-expected appetite by \nconsumers for the most fuel-efficient vehicles.\n  It is an encouraging sign, but it remains surprising because it is \nextraordinarily difficult for a consumer to take into account the real \nbenefits, or costs, of fuel economy. The value of fuel efficiency \ndepends on the unknowable fact of what the price of gasoline is likely \nto be in future years as well as requiring a calculation to make and \napples-to-apples comparison of the costs of ownership at different \nefficiency levels. This explains why study after study demonstrates \nthat consumers don't fully account for the fuel costs of ownership when \nthey make buying decisions. Decisions that many people regretted making \nonly a few years earlier as gas prices climbed near $4 per gallon last \nfall.\n  This isn't only a problem for consumers. Improving the fuel economy \nof a vehicle requires significant engineering and new technologies, \noften adding hundreds or thousands to the manufacturer price of a \nvehicle; costs consumers have proved unwilling to bear. Faced with this \nreality, and the uncertainty of recovering their costs from consumers \nwho are unsure of the value of fuel efficiency, car makers have \ngenerally thought it is in their best business interests to meet the \nfuel economy requirements of CAFE but go no further. Even when \nmanufacturers want to go further than the CAFE requirements and produce \nmore efficient vehicles, they are faced with giving up a cost advantage \nto their competitors by putting on expensive new technologies. For this \nreason, and to attempt to take into account the very real costs in oil \nand climate insecurity by our undervaluation of efficiency, Congress \nhas put in a series of incentives for specific technologies such as \nhybrids, electric-drive, and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles. We have also \nrecently made significant investments in battery manufacturing and \nvehicle electrification to try and close the significant gap with our \nglobal competitors in these technologies.\n  Although I support those investments to increase our competitiveness \nin the clean energy technology manufacturing race, unless the domestic \nmarketplace will support them over the long term, they simply won't be \nenough. I believe the best path to both support our climate and energy \ngoals and enhance our economic competitiveness is to create a set of \nclear, technology-neutral incentives that can achieve our goals and \nthen let the market and consumers sort out the best technologies.\n  The Efficient Vehicle Leadership Act of 2009 that I am introducing \ntoday with Senators Snowe, Kerry, and Lugar provides a long-term \npathway forward that will allow consumers to afford the most fuel \nefficient vehicles and a clear signal to the manufacturers that they \ncan succeed in the marketplace by incorporating the most advanced fuel \nefficiency technologies into their new offerings. The bill would \nprovide for fuel performance rebates that would decrease the cost of \nefficient cars and pay for it by assessing a fuel performance fee to \nmanufacturers for inefficient vehicles to pay for the program.\n  The rebates and fees would be calculated based on how much more or\n\n[[Page S9019]]\n\nless fuel-efficient a vehicle is relative to the CAFE standard. The \nCAFE standard is based on the size, or ``footprint''--the interior \ndimensions of the four wheels of the motor vehicle, so each vehicle \nwould compete with other vehicles of a similar size. The CAFE standard \nitself becomes more stringent over time, based on the ``maximum \nfeasible'' fuel efficiency as determined by NHTSA, so the incentives \nare recast yearly against a higher target. Calculating the rebates and \nfees based on the CAFE standard allows them to net out, making the \noverall system revenue neutral and providing a continuing incentive \neach subsequent year. Thus, the purchasers of fuel efficiency laggards \nfor each size pay to make the most fuel-efficient equivalent vehicles \nmore affordable. The rebate amount must appear on the fuel efficiency \nsticker and consumers can choose if they want to receive their rebate \ndirectly in their tax returns or they can transfer the credit to \ndealer, as long as the dealer certifies they have given the rebate to \nthe consumer at the point of purchase.\n  In sum, this bill provides a long-term structure for the automotive \nsector that provides certainty to manufacturers that the technologies \nthat they must employ to meet the new fuel efficiency requirements will \nbe valued by consumers and, beyond that, rewards and incentivizes \ninnovation in vehicle efficiency to go beyond the CAFE requirements. \nThe technological acumen of the auto industry will be harnessed, with \nno net impact on safety or comfort, and without distorting the \nmarketplace. Consumers would benefit for years to come from a smaller \nhit on their wallet at the pump. The United States would benefit \noverall as we began to curb our appetite for oil.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1620\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

I also thank the International District Energy \nAssociation, the Biomass Energy Resource Center, the American Council \nfor an Energy-Efficient Economy, Sustainable Northwest, and the U.S. \nClean Heat and Power Association for working with us to ensure that as \nwe consider comprehensive global warming legislation, we do not forget \nabout energy efficiency and thermal energy.\n  This legislation addresses two ways of producing and distributing \nthermal energy, which is a technical term for heat. The legislation \nfocuses on combined heat and power and district energy. Combined heat \nand power is simple to understand and has great capacity to transform \nour use of energy and increase large-scale efficiency. It is a fully \ndeveloped technology, and there is nothing experimental about it. \nCombined heat and power means that one source of energy can produce \nelectricity and then capture and use the resulting heat for a second \npurpose: heating homes, schools, offices, and factories. Combined heat \nand power gets both heat and power from one energy source and can work \nwith fossil fuels or biomass or even waste. Combined heat and power can \noffer huge efficiency gains and lower carbon footprints for our \npowerplants.\n  District energy can be used together with combined heat and power, or \nseparate from it, in systems designed purely for heating. What district \nenergy does is use heat not just for one building or location but for \nmultiple locations. Just as homes or businesses share electric lines or \ntelephone lines, they can also share a heat source. And sharing a heat \nsource can often be a major source of efficiency.\n  For too long, Federal energy policy has not focused enough on thermal \nenergy or energy efficiency. We know we can do more. According to the \nDepartment of Energy, combined heat and power represents roughly 9 \npercent of our existing electric power capacity today, but if we moved \nto 20 percent by 2030, we could avoid 60 percent of the projected \ngrowth in carbon dioxide emissions in this country, equivalent to \ntaking more than half of the current passenger vehicles off the road in \nthe United States. Additionally, we could create 1 million new jobs and \ngenerate $234 billion in new investments.\n  We are talking about real technology that is deployable today. In \nCopenhagen, district energy provides clean heating to 97 percent of the \ncity. In our own country, in St. Paul, MN, district energy and combined \nheat and power provide 65 megawatts of thermal energy and 25 megawatts \nof electricity from renewable urban wood waste. Jamestown, NY, started \ntheir district heating project in 1981, and today the system provides \n16 megawatts of thermal energy heating. Jamestown's public school \ndistrict uses district energy and has saved more than 16 percent of \ntheir energy use over a 30-month period and saved more than $500,000 \ndollars for taxpayers in the process.\n  We have opportunities to expand this technology all around our \nNation. For example, in my home State of Vermont, several of our cities \nand towns are looking at district energy. In Burlington, VT, we have 50 \nmegawatt powerplant that uses wood chips and wood waste for power. Yet \napproximately 60 percent of the energy produced by this plant is lost \nas wasted heat. This is typical of many conventional power plants. If \nBurlington implemented a district energy system it could use the wasted \nthermal energy to heat and cool many buildings downtown. The hurdle for \nBurlington, and many cities and towns, is the upfront capital \ninvestment required to build a district energy system.\n  That is why today I am introducing the Thermal Energy Efficiency Act. \nWe need a stable, long-term funding source for district energy and \ncombined heat and power. This bill would use 2 percent of the revenues \nderived from auctioning emissions permits under global warming \nlegislation to support hospitals, cities and towns, schools and \nuniversities, businesses and industries, and even Federal facilities \nand military bases as they implement efficient thermal energy systems.\n  This bill would recognize the important role that efficiency and \nthermal energy can play in helping our Nation meet our energy security, \nemissions reduction, and economic goals. As a member of both the Energy \nand Natural Resources Committee and the Environment and Public Works \nCommittee, I look forward to working with my colleagues to ensure that \ncombined heat and power and district energy are included in \ncomprehensive energy and global warming legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Menendez):\n  S. 1623. A bill to prohibit the Secretary of the Interior from \nissuing new Federal oil and gas leases to holders of existing leases \nwho do not diligently develop the land subject to the existing leases \nor relinquish the leases, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nEnergy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am reintroducing legislation \nthat seeks to answer a question more and more Americans are asking in \nlight of our economic woes and our struggle toward energy independence: \nWhy aren't the oil companies developing 65 million acres, or nearly 75 \npercent, of land that they are leasing from the U.S. Government? Those \nsame companies and some of my colleagues continue to argue that we need \nto open more Federal lands to drilling and recently have been insisting \non opening up part of the Gulf of Mexico off Florida's coast that \nCongress agreed to keep closed during debate in 2005 for military and \nsecurity purposes. I would first like to know why the oil companies are \nnot producing on most of the Federal lands they already have under \nlease.\n  Last year, at a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing, I had the chance \nto ask top oil executives just that question. They couldn't come up \nwith a good explanation. In fact, one of the executives told me that \nthey have the manpower and infrastructure to put all their existing \nleases of Federal lands into oil production.\n  I find this troubling. No one is talking about pulling oil out of a \nhat. But with nearly 75 percent of currently leased Federal lands and \nwaters not producing oil and gas, Congress must insist on some \naccountability. This is why today I am introducing--along with Senators \nDodd and Menendez--the Responsible Federal Oil and Gas Lease Act, also \nknown as ``Use It or Lose It'' legislation. This bill says that if oil \nand gas companies want to lease additional Federal lands, they must \neither be producing or diligently developing their existing Federal \nleases, or they have to first give up those leases. Under my bill, the \nDepartment of the Interior is required to establish diligent \ndevelopment benchmarks, which will encourage leaseholders to \ndemonstrate they are taking steps that may lead to oil and gas \nproduction. This is a responsible way to increase production and keep \nthe private sector accountable for production of existing Federal \nresources.\n  Last fall, the Government Accountability Office issued a report, \n``Oil and Gas Leasing: Interior Could Do More to Encourage Diligent \nDevelopment,'' that looked at whether enough is being done to ensure \noil companies are taking steps to develop Federal oil and gas leases. \nThe report found that the Department of the Interior--whose Minerals \nManagement Service manages offshore leases and Bureau of Land \nManagement manages onshore and National Petroleum Reserve leases--lags \nbehind State and private landowner efforts to encourage development of \nland leased for oil and gas development. The GAO recommends that the \nSecretary of the Interior ``develop a strategy to evaluate options to \nencourage faster development of its oil and gas leases.''\n  Though both MMS and BLM require ``reasonable diligence'' in \ndeveloping and producing oil and gas on Federal leases, the GAO found \nthat the Interior Department has not clearly defined what activities or \ntimeframes constitute reasonable diligence--something my bill requires \nthe agency to do. Currently, the GAO concludes that leaseholders, in \ngeneral, are not required to take actions to develop a\n\n[[Page S9022]]\n\nlease during the primary term. The only specific diligent development \nrequirement that Interior officials identified to the GAO applies only \nto lessees of 8-year leases in the Gulf of Mexico and requires drilling \nto occur before the end of the fifth year or else the lease terminates. \nHowever, these leases represent less than 1 percent of the total lease \nuniverse.\n  In addition to the GAO evaluation, the Department of the Interior's \nOffice of the Inspector General issued a report in February 2009 on its \ninvestigation of whether oil and gas companies were adequately \ndeveloping Federal leases and whether the Department of the Interior \nwas ensuring companies bring their leases into production. The \ninspector general concluded that, while there is no guarantee that a \nparticular lease contains oil and gas in commercial quantities, there \nare no requirements to ensure lessees are taking steps to reach this \nconclusion and to ensure the development of leases capable of \nproduction. Specifically, the inspector general found there are no \nrequirements for the Department to monitor production progress or \ncompel companies to develop leases and there is no requirement to \ndetail activity on nonproducing leases. My bill will ensure the Federal \nGovernment develops diligent development requirements for oil and gas \nleases.\n  With over 100 billion barrels of oil under Federal lands and waters \nthat are being leased or are available for leasing, Congress must \nproperly encourage their development. This won't solve our energy \nproblems--the unfortunate truth is that in today's global market, gas \nprices are dictated less by our domestic production and more by OPEC's \nactions. Nevertheless, Congress must ensure appropriate oversight of \nour Federally leased lands and waters, as we simultaneously reduce our \ndependence on foreign oil through continuing to be a world leader in \noil and gas production, decreasing our demand of oil and gas since we \nare the No. 1 consumer of both in the world, and pursuing alternative \nenergy sources especially in the transportation sector.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. WHITEHOUSE:\n  S. 1624. A bill to amend title 11 of the United States Code, to \nprovide protection for medical debt homeowners, to restore bankruptcy \nprotections for individuals experiencing economic distress as \ncaregivers to ill, injured, or disabled family members, and to exempt \nfrom means testing debtors whose financial problems were caused by \nserious medical problems, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nthe Judiciary.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat would help families struggling with medical debts overcome hurdles \nthat under current law make it difficult for them to find relief in the \nbankruptcy system. With medical costs at an all-time high and the \nunemployment rate hovering near 10 percent nationwide--and 12.4 percent \nin my home State of Rhode Island--too many individuals and families \nstruck with injury and illness have no other option but to file for \nbankruptcy. According to a recent Harvard University study, health \ncare-related costs have been a primary driver of personal bankruptcy \nfilings, contributing to over 62 percent of filings in 2007.\n  The statistics are as shocking as the personal stories are \nheartbreaking. Countless Rhode Islanders have written to me during my \ntime in office asking for help with crippling medical costs, and I want \nto share just two of their stories with you today.\n  Adam, a 23-year-old from Bristol, recently underwent surgery for \ncancer. Adam's treatment plan requires him to undergo a CT scan every 2 \nmonths. While his insurance initially paid for his health costs, he \nreceived word not long after his surgery that his policy was ``maxed \nout'' and that he would have to pay $6,700 out of pocket for an \nupcoming CT scan. As of today, Adam, a young man just starting his \nadult life, has $20,000 in medical debt and reports that he ``cannot \nsee any light at the end of the tunnel.''\n  Robert, a veteran and retiree also from Warwick, suffered a major \nheart attack in November of 2004. Although he had health insurance, \nRobert was responsible for paying a $2,000 deductible plus 20 percent \nof the cost of his care. After 40 years of working and saving, these \nmedical costs wiped him out, and he had to sell his home.\n  Adam and Robert have both suffered unexpected medical costs that have \nturned their lives upside down. These Rhode Islanders, like millions of \nothers nationwide, may be forced to file for bankruptcy to get a clean \nstart--but when they do, they will learn that the bankruptcy process \ncan be time consuming and costly and ultimately may not allow them to \nstay in their homes.\n  The legislation that I am introducing today, the Medical Bankruptcy \nFairness Act of 2009, would help people who because of medical costs \nhave no other choice but to file for bankruptcy. The bill would waive \nprocedural hurdles so that Adam and Robert would have the option of a \nspeedier, less expensive, and more efficient bankruptcy. To begin with, \nit would waive credit counseling requirements for these debtors. Such \nrequirements have little relevance to people whose debt stems not from \npoor budgeting but, rather, from uncontrollable medical expenses. The \nbill would also waive the so-called ``means test,'' making the filing \nprocess quicker and less costly and making sure that people have the \nability to file to have their debts discharged in chapter 7, as opposed \nto a chapter 13 plan under which they would have made debt payments for \n3 to 5 years.\n  In addition to removing these procedural hurdles, the Medical \nBankruptcy Fairness Act would give people with high levels of medical \ndebt the ability to retain at least $250,000 in home value through the \nbankruptcy process. The ``homestead exemption'' is one of many aspects \nof bankruptcy law that looks to the laws of the individual States. \nWhile filers in some States already have the ability to preserve home \nequity at this level, a number of States offer homestead exemptions of \n$5,000 or less. With the average home price nationwide around $200,000, \nthe $250,000 exemption included in this bill will allow the majority of \nindividuals and families crushed by medical debt to keep their homes.\n  Finally, the bill would eliminate an obstacle that prevents many \nbankruptcy filers from accessing the chapter 7 bankruptcy system, which \nas I mentioned earlier is the simplest and most efficient form of \nbankruptcy. Because attorneys' fees are ``discharged'' at the end of a \nchapter 7 bankruptcy, attorneys generally require the upfront payment \nof fees in chapter 7 proceedings. Many debtors who would be better off \nfiling for a quicker and less costly bankruptcy in chapter 7 are forced \nto file in chapter 13 because they don't have enough cash to pay the \nattorney. The Medical Bankruptcy Fairness Act would make attorneys' \nfees nondischargeable in chapter 7 bankruptcies, as in chapter 13 \nbankruptcies, making it easier for debtors to elect the more efficient \nchapter 7 proceeding.\n  Before I conclude, I want to acknowledge the hard work of my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Senator Kennedy, on the issue of medical \ndebt. Senator Kennedy offered amendments during the consideration of \nthe 2005 bankruptcy reforms that would have given people struggling \nwith medical debts treatment similar to that which they would get under \nthe Medical Bankruptcy Fairness Act. Unfortunately, those amendments \nwere voted down. I look forward to working with Senator Kennedy to make \nsure that we don't miss another opportunity to help Americans \nstruggling with medical debt.\n  There are people in every State suffering from medical hardship and \nrelated debts who would benefit from this legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to work with me to pass it to Adam and Robert and the \nmillions like them nationwide a clean start in bankruptcy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. DODD (for himself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1625. A bill to amend title II of the Public Health Service Act to \nprovide for an improved method to measure poverty so as to enable a \nbetter assessment of the effects of programs under the Public Health \nService Act and the Social Security Act, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to speak about poverty and, \nspecifically, how we measure it and its influence on millions of \nAmericans.\n  When we return from the August recess, the Census Bureau will release \nits\n\n[[Page S9023]]\n\nannual report documenting the number of Americans living in poverty. \nBut these numbers will provide a flawed picture of poverty in America \nsince they are based almost exclusively on 50-year-old food prices. The \nbill I am introducing today, the Measuring American Poverty, or MAP, \nAct, directs the Census to develop a new poverty measure that is based \non a more comprehensive definition of need. Improving the poverty \nmeasure is not just an academic exercise for statisticians, it is \nessential in helping us identify and implement effective policies that \naddress this crisis.\n  Even with an inaccurate measurement, the picture of poverty in \nAmerica is startling. In 2007, the year for which we have the most \nrecent data, one in eight Americans--and nearly one in five children--\ndidn't have the resources to meet their basic needs: food, clothing, \nand shelter. Think about that. One in five children in America in 2007 \nwent to bed without even the most basic elements that we take for \ngranted. In my home State of Connecticut, more than 85,000 kids lived \nin poverty. And that was before the economic downturn in which we now \nfind ourselves. The Center for American Progress estimates that the \ncost to our Nation of persistent child poverty is $\\1/2\\ trillion each \nyear. Every year a child stays in poverty reduces future productivity \nover the course of his or her working life by nearly $12,000.\n  But the cost is more than just financial--it is moral. We are judged, \nHubert Humphrey famously said, by how we treat those in the shadows of \nlife. And every child who goes to bed hungry, every American who lacks \nthe basic necessities of life, is a mark on our national conscience. As \nwe struggle with the great challenges of our time, the crisis of \npoverty is growing. More and more Americans find that shadow creeping \ntoward them. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities estimated that \nif unemployment were to rise to 9 percent--our current unemployment \nrate is 9.5 percent, the highest rate in 26 years--the number of \nAmericans in poverty would increase by as many as 10.3 million, and the \nnumber of children in poverty would rise by as many as 3.3 million.\n  To put those numbers in perspective, this recession will add a number \nof Americans equivalent to the population of Michigan to the current \nnumber who live in poverty, which is already equivalent to the \npopulation of California. In my home State of Connecticut and across \nthis country, people who have long worked hard to get ahead are falling \nfurther behind. Folks who have worked two jobs with an eye toward \nsending their kids to college are having to choose between purchasing \nfood and medications. They are hoping that a child's hacking cough \ndoesn't turn into something more serious because they can't afford to \nsee a doctor. They are staying up late staring at unpaid bills, \nwondering how to pay their mortgage when their only incomes from their \nmeager savings and unemployment insurance, wondering what happened to \ntheir America dream.\n  The vast majority of people who are poor do not lack the desire for a \nbetter life for themselves and their family. They are not poor in their \nwork ethic, their love for their country and their communities. They \nare in poverty, but they are not poor in the qualities that we so \nadmire in America. The truth is, many are unlucky and face \ninsurmountable hurdles. For some that hurdle is their inability to pay \nfor higher education. For others it is that they work two jobs and \ncan't read to their kids at night like they want to. And far too many \nothers are struggling to pay their mortgage and are spending all their \nretirement savings just to keep a roof over their heads.\n\n  As many hard-working Americans are engulfed by the shadow of poverty, \nwe remember Hubert Humphrey's admonition, but too often we can't even \nsee into those shadows because the way we measure poverty in America is \nbadly outdated. It is that challenge to which I today urge this body to \nrise.\n  Currently, we measure poverty by comparing two numbers: the money a \nfamily has, which the census refers to as an ``income measure,'' and \nthe money a family needs to meet its basic needs, which experts call \nthe ``poverty threshold.'' If a family's income measure is less than \nthe threshold, they are counted as poor. It is a simple calculation. \nBut unfortunately both elements--the income measure and the threshold--\nare flawed.\n  The poverty threshold was created using data from the 1950s and \n1960s. Currently, it is calculated by taking the 1950s cost of \nemergency foodstuffs--food only for temporary use when funds are low--\nand multiplying that number by three because in the 1960s, food \nrepresented one-third of a family budget. But today, food represents \none-sixth or one-seventh of a family's budget. Similarly, a family's \ncash income before taxes was once an accurate and straightforward way \nto measure a family's resources. But today, many Americans are subject \nto both State and Federal income taxes and may face exorbitant health \ncosts or other critical needs which drain their resources. In addition, \nmany women now work outside the home, meaning they now need pay for \nchildcare and for getting to and from work.\n  And on the other side of the ledger, we now provide many benefits to \nlow income workers that are not cash payments--they are provided \nthrough our Tax Code, or like energy assistance programs, paid directly \nto providers. I have fought throughout my career for programs that lift \npeople out of poverty. Think of the earned-income tax credit, food \nassistance, housing assistance, home energy assistance, child care \nassistance--hundreds of billions of dollars spent to help Americans \nthat aren't accounted for when we calculate whether our efforts are \nworking. So, we need a new way to measure both what a family needs and \nwhat a family has.\n  When Mayor Bloomberg decided to tackle poverty in New York City, he \nstarted by doing what any successful businessman would--he surveyed the \nproblem. But he discovered that our outdated system of measuring \npoverty simply didn't allow him to see what was really happening. So \nthe mayor charged his Center for Economic Opportunity with creating a \nsystem that would better represent that threshold, as well as a \nfamily's resources. They followed the recommendation of the National \nAcademy of Sciences 1995 panel described in ``Measuring Poverty: An \nImproved Approach.'' The legislation I offer today also follows these \nguidelines.\n  Specifically, this bill--the Measuring American Poverty Act--updates \nthe calculations for both threshold and resources in the Federal \npoverty measure. The poverty threshold would be based on the current \nprices of food, clothing, shelter, utilities, and a few basic household \nexpenses. And it would revise the current measurement of income to \nbetter reflect the reality that Americans not only must pay taxes but \nalso certain unavoidable expenses like transportation to and from work, \nchildcare, and medical expenses. This revised measure would also \ninclude the value of near-cash benefits like energy assistance, food \nstamps, section 8 housing vouchers, and tax credits such as the earned-\nincome tax credit.\n  Let me be very clear: this isn't a bill to change eligibility for \nprograms or the allocation of Federal funds. In fact, the bill's text \nis explicit about that. The MAP Act creates a new measurement. It does \nnot replace the Federal Poverty Line. It does not change eligibility \nfor programs. It will not lead to an unprecedented automatic increase \nin spending.\n  What the MAP Act will do is help us to understand the scope of the \npoverty crisis in America, and to better evaluate the effectiveness of \nour solutions to it. We have a difficult job ahead of us, as we look to \nlift Americans out of poverty, provide middle-class families with a \nstrong safety net, and restore the American Dream for working men and \nwomen. But we must begin by facing unafraid the true nature and scope \nof the poverty crisis. I urge my colleagues to join me in support of \nthis legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN:\n  S. 1627. A bill to improve choices for consumers for vehicles and \nfuel, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, \nand Transportation.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, our national energy situation continues to \ndeteriorate. Volatile petroleum and gasoline prices threaten our \neconomy, and our oil imports are responsible for an incredibly large \nwealth transfer\n\n[[Page S9024]]\n\nfrom America to global oil producers. Our most immediate and visible \nenergy challenge is our dependence on petroleum-derived fuels for \ntransportation, but we also face the need to reduce the greenhouse \ngases that result principally from fossil fuel production and use. \nBecause our global warming challenge is fundamentally linked to our \nenergy systems, their resolution has a common strategy--to transform \nour energy sector to one far less dependent on fossil fuels and far \nmore reliant on energy efficiency and domestic renewable energy \nsupplies. This energy transformation strategy also represents a crucial \neconomic recovery and development opportunity because millions of jobs \nwill be created as we carry out this strategy.\n  Americans recognize the magnitude and the urgency of our energy \nchallenges. They rightfully expect us to adopt policies to move this \nenergy transition forward. In particular, we need to reduce dependence \non oil in transportation, and we have broad agreement on two \nfundamental approaches--increasing efficiency of vehicles and \nincreasing use of alternative fuels. We mandated more efficient \nvehicles by passing the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, \nEISA. That bill also mandates a brisk expansion of biofuels production \nunder the renewable fuels standard. However, we also need to expand the \nnumber of vehicles that can use these alternative fuels and the number \nof filling stations selling these biofuels.\n  Today I am joined by my esteemed colleague, Senator Lugar of Indiana, \nin introducing the Consumer Fuels and Vehicles Choice Act of 2009. This \nbill will expand the number of alternative fuel automobiles at a rapid \npace while not imposing undue production cost challenges for our auto \nmanufacturers. It calls for 50 percent of all automobiles manufactured \nfor sale in the United States to be dual-fuel automobiles by 2011. It \nincreases that to 90 percent of all automobiles manufactured for U.S. \nsales by 2013. These requirements are reasonable because it is known \nthat gasoline automobiles require relatively minor changes in fuel \nsystem designs to be able to use blends of gasoline and ethanol which \nqualify them for dual fuel designation.\n  This bill also requires that major fuel distributors install blender \npumps in increasing numbers of the retail fueling stations carrying \ntheir brand name. These blender pumps will be capable of dispensing \nethanol and gasoline blends ranging from 0 percent ethanol to 85 \npercent ethanol. This flexibility in blend choice is expected to be \nattractive to consumers, including those who want to use regular \ngasoline for non-automotive engines. This bill also authorizes grants \nof up to 50 percent of the cost for installing blender pumps and tanks \nand other infrastructure needed for selling ethanol fuel blends.\n  Mr. President, the requirements established and assistance authorized \nin this bill will ensure that the number of dual fuel automobiles and \nthe availability of ethanol fuel blends are expanding apace with the \nexpansion of ethanol production and use in our national fuel supply \nover the next 15 years and beyond. Taken together, our increasing \nproduction of biofuels, our incentives for installation of alternative \nfuel infrastructure, and this automobile requirement will provide \nAmericans the option of choosing clean, domestically produced fuels for \ntheir personal transportation needs in the future. These steps \nrepresent critical components in the transition of our energy systems \naway from fossil and imported fuels toward the benefits of greater \nreliance on sustainable domestic fuel sources.\n  Today I urge my Senate colleagues to join us in taking action to \nboost the transition to a cleaner, more resilient, and more secure \nenergy economy. I urge their support for this bill and its rapid \nenactment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1627\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title VII of the Public Health Service Act \nto increase the number of physicians who practice in underserved rural \ncommunities; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce an \nimportant piece of legislation on behalf of myself and Senator Kay \nHagan of North Carolina, the Rural Physician Pipeline Act of 2009.\n  In making my way across my home State, I have listened to rural \nconstituents from all over Colorado, and their message is clear: rural \ncommunities are being hit hard by America's health care crisis.\n  The life expectancy for women in many rural counties across the \nNation has declined significantly over the past several decades, and \nhealth outcomes for Hispanic, Native American, and other minority \npopulations are at unacceptable levels. Low-income rural Americans in \nthese areas have very few options for affordable access to health care, \nif they have any at all.\n  Just over 2 weeks ago, I reached out to health care providers and \nprofessionals in rural regions of Colorado that have been most impacted \nby our ailing health system to hear directly from those on health \ncare's front lines. While there are many factors contributing to the \nlower health outcomes we are seeing in these regions, including \nregulatory hurdles and low reimbursement rates for rural clinics and \nhospitals, the physicians and health professionals I spoke with were \npretty clear about the overwhelming culprit: lack of primary care \ndoctors.\n  Invoking imagery of the black bag toting doctor from decades ago \nmaking house calls to treat all that ailed you and your family, primary \ncare physicians are still the lynchpin of our health care system. These \nphysicians are the most familiar to Americans--they are the family \ndoctor, general practitioner, and pediatrician, and they are many times \nthe only point of contact that people have with the health care system. \nThey are the first line of defense for keeping our families healthy.\n  Unfortunately, as the entire Nation suffers from a shortage of \nprimary care doctors, our rural areas are hit the hardest. For a \nvariety of socioeconomic and resource-related reasons, rural \ncommunities struggle to compete with big cities in recruiting from an \nalready scarce pool of doctors. Some of these barriers are inherent to \nthese areas--lack of job opportunities for spouses or a general lack of \ndesire to live the lifestyle offered by our rural communities. But some \nbarriers can be overcome if we use our resources wisely and work toward \nsolutions to break them down, particularly with respect to how we as a \nnation train and compensate our front line doctors.\n  Medical school is where we develop and educate our new doctors, yet \nthe 4 years of training they provide more often than not nudge students \ninto more lucrative specialty care or toward practice in higher paying \ncities. While we certainly rely on our cardiologists, orthopedists, \nneurologists, and the many other medical specialists to provide the \ntop-notch care that only they are trained to provide, we cannot \ncontinue to push students into these areas to the detriment of primary \ncare. A balance needs to be found.\n  Today, I am proud to introduce, along with Senator Kay Hagan of North \nCarolina, the Rural Physician Pipeline Act of 2009, a bill that I hope \ncan be part of the solution to our rural physician shortage. This \nlegislation would make grants available to medical schools across the \ncountry for establishing programs designed to recruit students from \nrural areas who have a desire to practice in their hometowns. These \nprograms would cultivate and strengthen the rural commitment of these \nfuture ``homegrown'' doctors, provide them the specialized training \nnecessary to excel in the unique environment of sparsely populated \nregions, and assist them in finding postgraduate training programs that \nspecialize in training doctors for practice in underserved rural \ncommunities.\n  Primary care doctors in rural areas face challenges that urban \ndoctors do not. When a physician is the only health care provider for \nan entire county, he or she cannot refer patients down the hall to a \nspecialist. The rural training programs encouraged by this bill would \ngive students additional training in pediatrics, emergency medicine, \nobstetrics, and behavioral health, among other areas, which will allow \nthem to better serve their communities and hopefully lower the \ndisturbing disparities of health outcomes we have seen over the years.\n  I was prompted to write this bill after seeing the promising results \nof a similar program at the University of Colorado School of Medicine. \nFaculty like associate dean for rural health, Dr. Jack Westfall, and \nrural health track director, Dr. Mark Deutchman, have found that \nreaching out to rural communities for student recruitment and \nreinforcing their rural commitment throughout their training is the \nbest way to get them back into the communities that need them most.\n  My hope is that an expansion of similar programs nationwide will \nprovide a ``one, two punch'' for the rural physician workforce--it will \ntrain more rural doctors, and it will train them better.\n  I recognize that this legislation would play only a modest role in \ntackling the immense workforce challenges our health care system faces. \nWe need more equitable payments for low-paid primary care doctors, \nloan-forgiveness programs must be expanded to allow medical graduates \nto practice primary care without going into budget-crushing debt, and \ngraduate medical education dollars need to be more flexible so that \nrural residency programs can be established to train graduates.\n  Health care reform needs to address these areas.\n  As my fellow Senators and I depart Washington for our home States to \nlisten to the ideas, needs, and concerns of our constituents over the \nremainder of the month, We do so with the knowledge that there is much \nto accomplish\n\n[[Page S9026]]\n\nupon our return. And as Congress continues working toward a health \nreform bill that puts the patient in charge of his or her health care \nchoices, brings costs down, ensures financial sustainability, and \nbrings security and stability for all Americans, there is one other \nthing we must also insist: health reform will not leave rural America \nbehind.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1628\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act of \nimprove prescription drug coverage under Medicare part D and to amend \nthe Public Health Service Act, the Employee Retirement Income Security \nAct of 1974, and the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \nprescription drug coverage under private health insurance, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with the newest esteemed \nMember of this Chamber, Senator Al Franken, to introduce the Affordable \nAccess to Prescription Medications Act of 2009. I think this is the \nfirst bill we have introduced together, and I look forward to working \nwith him again in the future. The legislation we are introducing today \nis a critically important bill--one that protects all Americans from \nhigh out-of-pocket spending on prescription drugs.\n  With each passing year, Americans are paying more for their health \ncare. Rising out-of-pocket costs are problematic for all patient \npopulations, but are particularly burdensome for chronically ill and \nlow-income individuals. The health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket \ncosts for those below the federal poverty level are huge, with 28 \npercent paying more than ten percent of their income. Overall, out-of-\npocket spending for individuals insured in the private insurance market \nis large and rapidly growing, with an increase of 45 percent between \n2001 and 2006.\n  Prescription drugs represent the highest out-of-pocket cost for \npatients, comprising almost 31 percent of total out-of-pocket spending. \nThe higher the out-of-pocket cost, the fewer individuals fill their \nneeded medications. In fact, about 20 percent of individuals with out-\nof-pocket spending greater than $250 a month do not fill their \nprescriptions and, thereby further exacerbate their conditions. Out-of-\npocket expenses are only getting worse, especially as prescription drug \ncosts increase. A 2009 survey found that 53 percent of Americans have \ncut back on health care spending in the last twelve months, as the \neconomy has worsened.\n  In Medicare specifically, beneficiaries enrolled in a prescription \ndrug plan in 2007 spent $38 a month, on average, for prescription drug \nco-payments. However, for those on high-cost medications, the cost \nburden can be enormous. Ninety percent of Medicare prescription drug \nplans and ten percent of private insurance plans include what is \nreferred to as a specialty tier for medications costing over $600 a \nmonth. For these medications, enrollees can be asked to pay up to 33 \npercent of the drug's cost in copayments.\n  The high cost of treatment, particularly for life-saving and life-\nsustaining treatment, poses an unreasonable and devastating barrier for \nsick patients that can force them to delay or entirely forgo necessary \ntreatment. For one West Virginian, the chemotherapy drug he needs to \ntreat his cancer is more than $13,500 for a 90-day supply. Under his \nMedicare prescription drug plan, he would have to pay $4000 of that \ncost. He didn't have $4000, so he chose not to be treated.\n  Another West Virginian with multiple sclerosis contacted my office \nrecently, and told me that the drug to treat her disease, which allows \nher to continue to work, costs $1900 a month. Her private insurer \nchanged its policy from a $20 flat copayment for each prescription to \n25 percent co-insurance for each prescription, creating a financial \nburden for her of $475 per month. It should come as no surprise that \nshe is struggling to pay this amount every month.\n  These West Virginians are just a couple of examples of the millions \nof Americans who pay their health insurance premiums every month for \ncoverage that is supposed to protect them from such enormous financial \nlosses--but, sadly, it does not. Providing access to affordable \nprescription drugs for the treatment of chronic diseases is critical to \nimproving our nation's health care system, which is why we are \nintroducing this legislation today. The Affordable Access to \nPrescription Medications Act will go a long way to address the growing \nproblem of catastrophic prescription drug expenses.\n  First, this bill will establish a $200 cap on the amount a person \ncould be charged for any one prescription, and a $500 cap on the total \namount an individual could be charged for all prescriptions in any \ngiven month. These caps apply to all private and public insurance \nplans, including Medicare prescription drug plans.\n  Second, this bill establishes an exceptions process for specialty \ndrugs. Currently, the most expensive prescription drugs in the Medicare \nprescription drug program that are included on specialty tiers are not \nsubject to beneficiary exemption requests, but for all other Medicare-\ncovered prescription drugs, a beneficiary can request an exemption to \nallow them access to needed drugs. High-cost, specialty drugs can be \ndifficult to access and this bill will allow any beneficiary to request \nany needed prescription drug, including those in specialty tiers, \nthrough the exemption process.\n  Third, this bill requires the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, \nMedPAC, to conduct two studies regarding discrimination and cost-\nsharing. The first study will review Medicare Part B, Part C, and Part \nD prescription drug polices to make sure they do not violate the non-\ndiscrimination rules passed as part of the 2003 Medicare law. Under \n2003 law, plans are prohibited from discriminating against individuals \nbased on medical condition. The second study will examine the impact of \nprescription drug cost-sharing on beneficiaries and their health, \nparticularly for those who have already paid their way through the so-\ncalled doughnut hole.\n  If enacted, this legislation will protect Americans from high out-of-\npocket spending on prescription drugs. Based on studies that explain \nthe problem, this bill could potentially lower copayments for 2.5 to 10 \npercent of Americans with the highest prescription costs. It will \nprotect all Americans from the risk of incurring extraordinarily high \nprescription drug costs.\n  The national cap on out-of-pocket spending for prescription drugs \nwill reduce costs for the most vulnerable populations by over 50 \npercent. Given the rising costs of drugs, the prevalence of new drugs \non the market, and the current economic recession, addressing the \naffordability of prescriptions drugs is vitally important.\n  We must act now to make prescription drugs more affordable for all \nAmericans, but especially those with chronic diseases. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in support of this important bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1630\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to require the Secretary of Homeland Security, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to establish a program to \nissue Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Travel Cards, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Foreign Relations.\n  Ms. CANTWELL. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Asia-\nPacific Economic Cooperation, APEC, Business Travel Cards Act of 2009. \nThis bill would authorize the Secretary of Homeland Security and State \nDepartment to issue APEC Business Travel Cards, ABTC's, to business \nleaders from APEC countries and senior government officials who are \nactively engaged in APEC business.\n  The ABTC program has 18 nations participating, including China, Japan \nand Australia, which are among the world's larger economies. The United \nStates currently recognizes foreign issued ABTC travel cards. \nCardholders from non-Visa Waiver Program countries need to present \nvalid passports and those from other countries must still obtain U.S. \nvisas as required by United States law. However, ABTC card holders are \nallowed to benefit from expedited visa interview scheduling at U.S. \nembassies and consulates, and expedited immigration processing through \nairline crew and diplomat immigration lanes upon arrival at U.S. \ninternational airports. However, under current law U.S. passport \nholders are not yet eligible to apply for the ABTC program and \ntherefore do not enjoy these same benefits in Asia-Pacific countries. \nThis bill would require the Secretary of Homeland Security to issue \nABTCs to United States citizen business leaders and senior government \nofficials actively engaged in APEC business no later than January 1, \n2010.\n  I support the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Business Travel Cards \nAct because I have long supported increased free trade with the Asia-\nPacific region. International business travel is an essential part of \nselling goods and services around the world. The 21 member economies of \nAPEC together account for around 53 percent of world GDP and \napproximately 48 percent of global trade. This bill would help \nfacilitate international cooperation and trade by allowing business \nleaders within the participating countries to enter countries on an \nexpedited basis for the length of the program, currently three years.\n  The success of the program has been shown by the amount of \napplications for travel cards since inception of the program in 1997. \nFrom 1997, applications received by participating countries have grown \nby more than 100 percent each year. By March of last year, there were \nmore than 34,000 cards being used by APEC countries. The Asia-Pacific \nEconomic Cooperation Business Travel Cards Act of 2009 will help \nfacilitate global trade within the Asia-Pacific, and create expanded \nexport opportunities for U.S. businesses. Working to grow U.S. exports \nwill get our economy to grow again and create and maintain U.S. jobs.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1633\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend titles XVIII and XIX of the Social Security \nAct to protect and improve the benefits provided to dual eligible \nindividuals under the Medicare and Medicaid programs; to the Committee \non Finance.\n  Mr. ROCKEFELLER. Mr. President, I rise today with my colleagues, \nSenator Akaka and Senator Brown, to introduce the Medicare Prescription \nDrug Coverage Improvement Act, legislation that makes long overdue \nimprovements to the Medicare prescription drug program, particularly \nfor Medicare beneficiaries who are simultaneously enrolled in Medicaid. \nKnow as ``dual eligibles,'' these individuals are among our nation's \nmost vulnerable populations--and they have been overlooked for far too \nlong.\n  Approximately 8.8 million Americans are simultaneously enrolled in \nMedicare and Medicaid, and they are among the sickest and poorest \nindividuals covered by either program. Most dual eligibles are very \nlow-income, in poor health, and have substantial health care needs. \nSeventy-one percent of dual eligibles have annual incomes below \n$10,000. Over half of all elderly dual eligibles are limited in \nactivities of daily living and, in comparison to other Medicare \nbeneficiaries, are three times more likely to be disabled. Dual \neligibles also have higher rates of heart disease, pulmonary disease, \ndiabetes, and Alzheimer's disease than the general Medicare population.\n  After passage of the Medicare prescription drug law, Members of \nCongress and health care advocates alike tried for more than a year to \nwork with the Bush Administration to prevent prescription drug coverage \nbarriers for dual eligibles and other low-income Medicare \nbeneficiaries. I introduced the Medicare Dual Eligible Prescription \nDrug Coverage Act of 2005, S. 566. and the Requiring Emergency \nPharmaceutical Access for Individual Relief, REPAIR, Act of 2006, S. \n2183, to prevent disruptions in coverage for vulnerable seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities.\n  Unfortunately, effective fail-safe mechanisms were not put into place \nby the previous Administration to address the transition of the dual \neligibles to Medicare prescription drug coverage. Consequently, \nmillions of elderly and disabled Medicare recipients continue to \nexperience significant barriers to care.\n  Health care problems persist for the dually eligible largely because \nof poor coordination between Medicare and Medicaid--which have two \ndifferent sets of providers, two different sets of benefits, and two \ndifferent sets of enrollment policies. The legislation we\n\n[[Page S9030]]\n\nare introducing today will go a long way to provide dual eligibles with \nthe right care, in the right setting, and at the right time.\n  Additionally, the Medicare Prescription Drug Coverage Improvement Act \nwill provide more affordable and comprehensive prescription drug \ncoverage for all Medicare beneficiaries.\n  First, this bill will create a new Federal Coordinated Health Care \nOffice within the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, CMS. The \npurpose of this new office will be to provide a much more integrated \nmodel of care for dual eligibles by coordinating their Medicare and \nMedicaid benefits.\n  Second, this bill contains two provisions to help make prescription \ndrugs more affordable and accessible for all Medicare beneficiaries--it \nallows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to negotiate directly \nwith pharmaceutical companies to lower prescription drug prices and it \ncreates a Medicare-operated prescription drug plan.\n  The Secretary would be required to implement two or more of the \nfollowing strategies on an annual basis to reduce the cost of \nprescription drugs covered by Medicare: direct price negotiation with \npharmaceutical manufacturers, additional rebate agreements for Medicare \nprescription drugs that are consistent with the rebate agreements \nprovided to states for Medicaid, comparative clinical effectiveness \ndata, or prescription drug rates negotiated under the Federal Supply \nSchedule.\n  A Medicare-operated prescription drug plan would be created by the \nSecretary of HHS. This plan would be a stable and affordable option \navailable to all Medicare beneficiaries. This plan would create a \nrobust prescription drug formulary based on patient safety, efficacy \nand value. The formulary incentive process would be transparent and \nuniform. An advisory committee would be created to review petitions for \ndrug inclusion and recommend formulary changes. This Medicare-operated \nplan will create fair-market competition and lead to less costly drug \nchoices for Medicare recipients.\n  Third, this bill contains significant new requirements for Medicare \nAdvantage Special Needs Plans. These plans serve extremely vulnerable \npopulations, including dual eligibles; yet, they have very few \nstandards that they are required to abide by. The Medicare Prescription \nDrug Improvement Act will require special needs plans to be accredited \nby the National Committee for Quality Assurance. Additionally, our \nlegislation requires special needs plans to provide more robust \nprescription drug coverage, meet uniform standards for data collection \nand reporting, and offer better care coordination.\n  Finally, this bill will implement a number of technical fixes to \nfacilitate enrollment in the Medicare prescription drug benefit for \nthose who qualify. State and Federal officials will be required to \nclearly identify dual eligibles in all databases and electronically \nfile eligibility information, so that these beneficiaries will not \ncontinue to fall through the cracks. Pharmacies will use a facilitated \npoint-of-sale enrollment process and automatically enroll certain dual \neligible individuals in the Medicare-operated prescription drug plan. \nNew limits on cost-sharing and resource requirements for low-income \nbeneficiaries will also be put into place. Prescription drug cost-\nsharing for dual eligibles who are using home and community-based \nservices, instead of institutionalized care, will be eliminated.\n  We are in the midst of discussing sweeping changes to our health care \nsystem. In addition to provisions to help the uninsured, health care \nreform must also include provisions to improve the coverage that people \nhave today. This is especially true for seniors and individuals with \ndisabilities. The Medicare prescription drug program is extremely \ndifficult to navigate and many enrollees are still denied access to the \nprescription drugs that they need. This legislation will make the \nMedicare prescription drug program much more manageable for seniors and \nindividuals with disabilities, particularly those dually eligible for \nMedicare and Medicaid.\n  The time for action is now, and I urge my colleagues to join us in \nsupport of this important legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1634\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish an Indian Youth telemental health \ndemonstration project, to enhance the provision of mental health care \nservices to Indian youth, to encourage Indian tribes, tribal \norganizations, and other mental health care providers serving residents \nof Indian country to obtain the services of predoctoral psychology and \npsychiatry interns, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Indian \nAffairs.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, today I introduced a bill entitled 7th \nGeneration Promise: Indian Youth Suicide Prevention Act, to address the \ncrisis of youth suicide in Indian Country. I introduce this legislation \non behalf of myself and Senators Johanns, Johnson, Udall of New Mexico, \nBaucus, and Tester, in hopes that it will help provide prevention and \nintervention services to Native American youth.\n  Over the past 25 years, youth suicides in Native American communities \nhave reached epidemic levels. Suicide ranks as the second leading cause \nof death for Native American youth ages 15 to 35--a rate 3.5 times \nhigher than the national average. In fact, adolescent Native American \nmales have the highest suicide rate of any population group in the \nUnited States.\n  Over the years, the Indian Affairs Committee, which I chair, has held \na series of hearings on the issue of Indian youth suicide. This past \nFebruary, the Committee explored the progress made in youth suicide \nprevention in Indian Country. We heard from agencies and organizations, \nsuch as the Indian Health Service and the Substance Abuse and Mental \nHealth Services Administration, SAMHSA, who provide worthy prevention \nand emergency response services.\n  During the February hearing, we also heard from a courageous 16-year-\nold young woman named Dana Lee Jetty who testified about the loss of \nher 14-year-old sister, Jami Rose Jetty. Her story illustrates the \ncontinued need for suicide prevention.\n  In November 2008, Dana Lee found her beautiful little sister, Jami \nRose, hanging in her bedroom, on the Spirit Lake Reservation in North \nDakota. Dana and Jami's Mom had done all the right things--noticing \nJami was troubled, they took her to the doctor at the Indian Health \nService clinic. The doctors dismissed the mom's concern and said Jami \nwas just being a ``typical teenager.'' Dana told me that she believes \nher sister would be alive if there had been adequate mental health \nprofessionals to diagnose and treat Jami's depression. Jami Rose Jetty \nserves as a tragic example of the inadequate mental health services in \nIndian Country and why we need legislation like the one I introduced \ntoday.\n  This year, the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, located in North \nDakota and South Dakota, is experiencing epidemic levels of youth \nsuicide. There have already been 10 suicides and an additional 53 \nattempted suicides. The majority of these suicides have been among \ntribal members under the age of 24. Clearly, we must do more for the \nmental health and suicide prevention in our Native American communities \nacross the United States.\n  The bill I introduced includes three main sections to improve youth \nsuicide prevention services in Indian Country: a youth telemental \nhealth demonstration project; language to streamline and improve the \nprocess by which Tribes apply for grants through SAMHSA; and \nencouragement of post-doctoral mental health intern programs in an \neffort to increase the availability of services in Indian Country.\n  The Indian Youth Telemental Health Demonstration Project Act has been \nintroduced in previous Congresses. This project would authorize the \nSecretary of Health and Human Services to carry out a four-year \ndemonstration project for the use of telemental health services in \nyouth suicide prevention, intervention and treatment. Telemental health \nservices refer to those health care services provided from a remote \nlocation through technological means. These types of services are \nespecially important in remote, isolated communities like those in my \nhome state of North Dakota where mental health professionals are \nscarce.\n  The bill also includes new language to enhance available mental \nhealth resources by addressing the many issues and barriers Tribes and \ntribal organizations face when applying for federal assistance through \nSAMHSA. For example, this provision requires SAMHSA to monitor the \nincidence of youth suicide in Indian Country, accept non-electronic \ngrant applications from Tribes, give priority to disadvantaged tribal \napplicants with high rates of suicide, prohibit cost-sharing \nrequirements, and prevent Tribes and tribal organizations from being \nrequired to apply through a state. In addition, this section requires \nstates that apply for a SAMHSA grant using Tribal data to consult with \nTribes and include them in any implemented programs.\n  Lastly, the bill includes encouragement for Tribes to use post-\ndoctoral mental health professionals. Post-doctoral psychology and \npsychiatry interns are able to see patients and provide mental health \nservices under the supervision of a certified mental health \nprofessional. The Veterans Administration is currently utilizing post-\ndoctoral psychology intern programs, which have been successful in \nexpanding the availability of mental health services to veterans. We \nneed to promote innovative programs like this to increase the mental \nhealth services available in Indian Country.\n  The 7th Generation Promise in the bill's title is the Native American \nconcept that we need to consider the impacts of our actions on our \ndescendants seven generations in the future. Suicide is devastating our \ncurrent generation of Native Americans, and we need to do something to \nprotect them and\n\n[[Page S9039]]\n\nour Native Americans seven generations down the road.\n  I would like to thank Senator Johanns for working with me on this \nimportant piece of legislation. Health care, and especially mental \nhealth issues, remain a top priority for me as Chairman of the Indian \nAffairs Committee. I look forward to continuing this important work so \nthat we may stop the high levels of youth suicide and other health \ndisparities among Native Americans.\n  I would like to end by saying that one youth suicide is one tragedy \ntoo many. My hope is that passage of this bill will bring some aid to \nour Native American communities experiencing this crisis.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1635\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``7th Generation Promise: \n     Indian Youth Suicide Prevention Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds that--\n       (1)(A) the rate of suicide of American Indians and Alaska \n     Natives is 1.9 times higher than the national average rate; \n     and\n       (B) the rate of suicide of Indian and Alaska Native youth \n     aged 15 through 24 is--\n       (i) 3.5 times the national average rate; and\n       (ii) the highest rate of any population group in the United \n     States;\n       (2) many risk behaviors and contributing factors for \n     suicide are more prevalent in Indian country than in other \n     areas, including--\n       (A) history of previous suicide attempts;\n       (B) family history of suicide;\n       (C) history of depression or other mental illness;\n       (D) alcohol or drug abuse;\n       (E) health disparities;\n       (F) stressful life events and losses;\n       (G) easy access to lethal methods;\n       (H) exposure to the suicidal behavior of others;\n       (I) isolation; and\n       (J) incarceration;\n       (3) according to national data for 2005, suicide was the \n     second-leading cause of death for Indians and Alaska Natives \n     of both sexes aged 10 through 34;\n       (4)(A) the suicide rates of Indians and Alaska Natives aged \n     15 through 24, as compared to suicide rates of any other \n     racial group, are--\n       (i) for males, up to 4 times greater; and\n       (ii) for females, up to 11 times greater; and\n       (B) data demonstrates that, over their lifetimes, females \n     attempt suicide 2 to 3 times more often than males;\n       (5)(A) Indian tribes, especially Indian tribes located in \n     the Great Plains, have experienced epidemic levels of \n     suicide, up to 10 times the national average; and\n       (B) suicide clustering in Indian country affects entire \n     tribal communities;\n       (6) death rates for Indians and Alaska Natives are \n     statistically underestimated because many areas of Indian \n     country lack the proper resources to identify and monitor the \n     presence of disease;\n       (7)(A) the Indian Health Service experiences health \n     professional shortages, with physician vacancy rates of \n     approximately 17 percent, and nursing vacancy rates of \n     approximately 18 percent, in 2007;\n       (B) 90 percent of all teens who die by suicide suffer from \n     a diagnosable mental illness at time of death;\n       (C) more than \\1/2\\ of teens who commit suicide have never \n     been seen by a mental health provider; and\n       (D) \\1/3\\ of health needs in Indian country relate to \n     mental health;\n       (8) often, the lack of resources of Indian tribes and the \n     remote nature of Indian reservations make it difficult to \n     meet the requirements necessary to access Federal assistance, \n     including grants;\n       (9) the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration and the Service have established specific \n     initiatives to combat youth suicide in Indian country and \n     among Indians and Alaska Natives throughout the United \n     States, including the National Suicide Prevention Initiative \n     of the Service, which has worked with Service, tribal, and \n     urban Indian health programs since 2003;\n       (10) the National Strategy for Suicide Prevention was \n     established in 2001 through a Department of Health and Human \n     Services collaboration among--\n       (A) the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services \n     Administration;\n       (B) the Service;\n       (C) the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention;\n       (D) the National Institutes of Health; and\n       (E) the Health Resources and Services Administration; and\n       (11) the Service and other agencies of the Department of \n     Health and Human Services use information technology and \n     other programs to address the suicide prevention and mental \n     health needs of Indians and Alaska Natives.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to authorize the Secretary to carry out a demonstration \n     project to test the use of telemental health services in \n     suicide prevention, intervention, and treatment of Indian \n     youth, including through--\n       (A) the use of psychotherapy, psychiatric assessments, \n     diagnostic interviews, therapies for mental health conditions \n     predisposing to suicide, and alcohol and substance abuse \n     treatment;\n       (B) the provision of clinical expertise to, consultation \n     services with, and medical advice and training for frontline \n     health care providers working with Indian youth;\n       (C) training and related support for community leaders, \n     family members, and health and education workers who work \n     with Indian youth;\n       (D) the development of culturally relevant educational \n     materials on suicide; and\n       (E) data collection and reporting;\n       (2) to encourage Indian tribes, tribal organizations, and \n     other mental health care providers serving residents of \n     Indian country to obtain the services of predoctoral \n     psychology and psychiatry interns; and\n       (3) to enhance the provision of mental health care services \n     to Indian youth through existing grant programs of the \n     Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration.\n\n     SEC. 3.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to improve \nand extend certain energy-related tax provisions, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Expanding \nIndustrial Energy Efficiency Incentives Act of 2009. I am pleased to be \njoined by my Finance Committee colleague, Senator Snowe, in introducing \nthe Act, which creates the first direct tax-based incentives for \nindustrial energy efficiency. As such, the Act helps our industrial \nsector adopt advanced energy technologies and processes, enabling \nAmerican industry to reduce fuel dependency, cut costs, reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, add jobs, and enhance global competitiveness.\n  Even though the industrial sector represents 32 percent of our \ndomestic energy consumption, there are currently no significant tax \ncredits that directly promote industrial energy efficiency. But as a \nrecent study by McKinsey & Company found, the industrial sector \nrepresents the largest potential for end-use energy efficiency in the \nU.S. and could save $47 billion per year on energy costs through \nefficiency improvements. The time to make this investment is now.\n  The act creates incentives in the three critical areas: water reuse, \nadvanced motors, and CFC chillers. It also enhances incentives for \ncombined heat and power systems. Energy efficiency organizations \nestimate that these incentives together will save over 92 terawatt \nhours of energy--the equivalent of four months' worth of total U.S. \nenergy consumption.\n  First, the act adds a new investment tax credit for reuse, recycling, \nand/or efficiency measures related to process, sanitary, and cooling \nwater, as well as for blowdown from cooling towers and steam systems \nused by utility-scale thermo-electric generators. The U.S. currently \nreuses only 6 percent of its water, and there is significant potential \nfor gains in this area. The industrial sector, which is responsible for \n45 percent of domestic freshwater withdrawals, is an ideal place to \nintroduce transformative water reuse and water saving technologies. \nApproximately 3 percent of U.S. electricity use is for pumping, \ntreating and transporting water. The ``water-watts connection'' is \nwell-recognized. For instance, the California Energy Commission \nestimates that 95 percent of the energy savings of proposed energy-\nefficiency programs could be achieved through water-efficiency \nprograms, at 58 percent of the cost. Water conservation is therefore a \ncost-effective way to achieve significant energy savings.\n  Second, the bill establishes a $120-per-horsepower tax credit for \nefficient motor systems with adjustable speed capability. On average, \nmotors account for 65 percent of an industrial energy user's \nelectricity use, a percentage that is even higher in certain \nindustries, such as water supply, mining, and oil and gas extraction. \nIn fact, industrial motors are expected to be responsible for 7 percent \nof total global carbon emissions by 2020.\n  New advances in power electronics and controls over the past five \nyears have advanced the potential for new smart motor technologies to \nprovide a significant energy savings potential if these new motors are \nplaced widely into service. By reducing the initial design and added \ncomponent costs, this new credit will accelerate the adoption of \nadvanced motor technologies into higher volume production, helping to \nmake the technology available economy-wide.\n  Third, the bill adds a new incentive for replacing CFC chillers. \nLarge water-cooled chillers are the engines of air-conditioning systems \nfor almost all large buildings. The bill establishes a credit of $150 \nper ton, plus an additional incentive of $100 for each ton downsized \nduring replacement. The incentive extends only to pre-1993, post-1980 \nwater-cooled chillers that use the refrigerants CFC-11 and CFC-12. \nWhile chillers that use CFC-11 and CFC-12 refrigerants have been banned \nfor new installations because their refrigerant breakdown products \nattack the ozone layer, some 30,000 chillers that still use these \nrefrigerants remain in both public and private facilities across the \ncountry. Replacing these obsolete systems would allow for the recovery \nof 37 million pounds of ozone depleting CFCs--or 64 million metric tons \nof carbon dioxide equivalents. Additionally, the improvement in new \nchiller efficiency that would be achieved by replacing these old \nsystems would save 17.2 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from \nreduced electricity consumption--the equivalent of taking 3.3 million \ncars off the road.\n  While CFC chiller replacement is cost-effective over the long-term, \nthe high up-front costs mean that many building owners do not make \nthese investments. This moderate tax incentive improves the economics \nand reduces the up-front cost, substantially increasing the number of \nsystems replaced.\n  Collaterally, but just as significantly, this bill is a jobs bill. \nFor instance, if all CFC chillers are replaced, we expect that \napproximately 10,500 American jobs can be directly created or preserved \nin the manufacturing, removal and installation of new chillers. \nAdditional jobs will be created by the engineering services required to \ntake advantage of these incentives, adding up to a potential 60,000 \njobs.\n  Finally, the bill improves the combined heat and power incentive, \nwhich was enacted last October as part of the tax extenders package. \nThe package added a 10 percent investment tax credit for combined heat \nand power systems. The expansion of the combined heat and power tax \ncredit would increase the credit's applicability from the first 15 \nmegawatts to the first 25 megawatts of system capacity and remove the \noverall system size cap of 50 megawatts, allowing a greater number\n\n[[Page S9042]]\n\nof combined heat and power projects to be financially viable and move \nforward. A recent Department of Energy study estimates that ramping up \ntotal U.S. combined heat and power to account for twenty percent of \nelectricity capacity, a percentage that is within our reach, would \neliminate over sixty percent of the expected increase in carbon dioxide \nemissions from today to 2030--the equivalent of taking more than half \nof current passenger vehicles in the U.S. off the road.\n  Together, these four industrial energy efficiency incentives capture \na large portion of the energy efficiency potential in the industrial \nsector. These incentives will catalyze the deployment of new \ntechnologies that will decrease carbon emissions and protect our \nnatural resources, all while saving money on energy costs and creating \njobs.\n  I look forward to working with Senator Snowe to see these provisions \nenacted into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 1639\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nprovide coverage of intensive lifestyle treatment; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce the Take Back \nYour Health Act of 2009. I want to thank my friends Senator Cornyn and \nSenator Harkin for joining as original cosponsors of this bill.\n  This bill is another example of how Democrats and Republicans can \ncome together on health reform. This bill incorporates ideas that \nbridge the philosophies of both parties: prevention, individual \nresponsibility, and paying for health care services that provide value.\n  These days, health care reformers talk about bending the cost curve \ndown and focusing on delivery system ``game changers''. Often my \nfriends and I have talked about how pevention--preventing disease or \nillness before it happens--does both, but is not scored as bending the \ncost curve by the Congressional Budget Office.\n  Over the last year, I have worked with some of the brightest minds in \nprevention--Doctors Dean Ornish, Mike Roizen, and Mark Hyman--on how to \ndesign a program that will change the focus of medicine from treating \nmedical problems to preventing them while delivering savings. The road \nthat took us to this bill has not been an easy one, but I believe this \nbill achieves all of our goals when it comes to encouraging healthier \nbehaviors that will help prevent disease, especially chronic diseases.\n  The heart of this bill is what's called an intensive lifestyle \ntreatment program. This program is an individualized health plan \nprescribed by a doctor that gets people living healthier and getting \nhealthier through exercise, nutrition counseling, care coordination, \nmedication management, and stopping smoking.\n  This type of program has been proven to help or even reverse the \nprogression of many chronic diseases. A Highmark Blue Cross Blue Shield \nstudy found that their costs went down 50 percent after their patients \ntook part in an intensive lifestyle program. That can mean big savings \nfor Medicare and for seniors.\n  Even a CMS Medicare demonstration--which notoriously does not score\n\n[[Page S9044]]\n\nsavings for anything--found that people who went through a lifestyle \nprogram had the same or lower costs over three years than as Medicare \nbeneficiaries who didn't go through the program.\n  In times like these, the American people want to know that the \nMedicare program is going to get their money's worth. The Take Back \nYour Health Act embraces a pay-for-performance type system. Doctors are \npaid a bundled payment to encourage efficiency and teamwork, and they \nare held responsible for their success. If a patient's health status \ndoes not improve according to at least two measures, the doctor doesn't \nget paid. In addition, if a patient goes through the program for \ndiabetes, but still has problems and has to go to the hospital, the \nlifestyle treatment doctor doesn't get paid.\n  The last innovation in this program is that it gives individuals a \nfinancial incentive for getting healthier. Every person who goes \nthrough this treatment program and improves his or her health status \ngets a one-time $200 reward.\n  The beauty of this bill is that everyone has skin in the game: the \ndoctor, the patient, and the government. That will be the secret of its \nsuccess. It is just this kind of innovative program that can be a real \ngame-changer for Medicare and for our entire health care system, by \nbringing the focus of our health care system back to the basics of \nmaking us healthier.\n  I look forward to working with Chairman Baucus and Senator Grassley \non including this bill in health reform. I urge my colleagues to join \nme as cosponsors on this bill.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself and Mr. Bingaman):\n  S. 1643. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow a \ncredit for the conversion of heating using oil fuel to using natural \ngas or biomass feedstocks, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, addressing our Nation's dependence on \nimported oil and our greenhouse gas emissions will require policies \nthat extend across the economy, as well as policies that are more \nnarrowly tailored to specific sectors. Today, I rise with my colleague \nfrom Maine, Senator Snowe, to offer a bill that would enhance energy \nsecurity and reduce greenhouse gas emissions associated with heating \nour nation's homes and buildings. Our bill, the Cleaner, Secure and \nAffordable Thermal Energy Act, creates significant incentives for \nconsumers, businesses, and tax-exempt entities that now rely on heating \noil to convert to energy-efficient natural gas or biomass heating \nsystems.\n  Across the country, and particularly in the Northeast and Midwest, \nmany homes and buildings still derive heat from oil-burning furnaces. \nAccording to the Energy Information Administration, in 2007, our Nation \nconsumed nearly 160 million barrels of oil for heating fuel. This use \nof heating oil continues despite the existence of widely available \nalternatives that are cleaner, more secure, and more affordable.\n  On April 22, I held a hearing in the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee on the Energy Efficiency Resource Standards. The Committee \nheard from several witnesses about the advantages of and efforts to \nconvert residential, business, and public users from fuel oil to \nnatural gas and biomass heating systems. For each household that \nconverts from fuel oil to a natural gas heating system, we avoid 2.1 \nmetric tons of greenhouse gas emissions. For each commercial building, \nwe avoid 9.9 metric tons, and for each industrial facility, we avoid as \nmuch as 2,984 metric tons. These emission reductions are even more \nsignificant for conversions to heating systems that are fired by \nbiomass resources.\n  Besides being cleaner, natural gas and biomass are far more secure \nresources. Ninety-eight percent of domestically consumed natural gas is \nproduced in North America, and domestic reserves of natural gas are \nestimated at 100 years based on current consumption.\n  Finally, since the price of natural gas and biomass is lower and less \nvolatile than the price oil, converting offers significant short- and \nlong-term cost savings to consumers. For instance, while the average \nannual cost of using fuel oil for home heating averages $1,734, the \naverage annual cost of operating a natural gas furnace is $1,004.\n  But significant up-front costs prevent many families and businesses \nfrom converting their heating systems.\n  The Cleaner, Secure and Affordable Thermal Energy Act will make these \nconversions more affordable for American families, businesses, and tax-\nexempt entities.\n  First, for residential consumers, the Act establishes a 30 percent \ntax credit for costs associated with converting from a fuel oil to \nnatural gas or biomass heating system. The credit is capped at $3,500, \n$4,000 in the case of biomass stoves. To qualify, the replacement \nequipment must be energy efficient; a natural gas boiler must have an \nAFUE rating of at least 85 percent, a replacement natural gas furnace \nmust have an AFUE rating of at least 92 percent, and a replacement \nbiomass appliance must have a thermal efficiency rating of more than 75 \npercent.\n  For business taxpayers, the act authorizes bonus depreciation for \nproperty installed before 2012. This would enable business taxpayers to \nexpense--that is, immediately write-off--half of the cost of qualifying \nproperty, and depreciate the remaining balance over the typical cost-\nrecovery period.\n  Many of the Nation's heating oil systems are used by public entities, \nparticularly school systems. To help public entities finance their \nconversions to natural gas and biomass heating, the Act adds conversion \nprograms as an activity eligible for Qualified Energy Conservation \nBonds.\n  Finally, to encourage expansion of natural gas service capabilities, \nthe act includes a two-year extension of the 15-year depreciation \nschedule created for distribution facilities under the Energy Policy \nAct of 2005.\n  The act would move us significantly in the direction of a low-carbon \neconomy while enhancing energy security and reducing heating costs. I \nlook forward to working with Senator Snowe to enacting our bill into \nlaw.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S9044-1", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9044-S9045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 245--RECOGNIZING SEPTEMBER 11 AS A ``NATIONAL DAY OF \n                       SERVICE AND REMEMBRANCE''\n\n  Mr. SCHUMER (for himself, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. Menendez, Mr. \nLautenberg, Mr. Casey, Mr. Specter, Mr. Dodd, and Mr. Lieberman) \nsubmitted the following resolution; which was referred to the Committee \non the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Like \nmany of my colleagues, I began my political career in local government. \nI was mayor in my hometown and then served as a legislator in the \nWyoming State Legislature. It was during this time I learned that the \nmost effective legislation comes from a process that is transparent and \nfocused. For example, the Wyoming State Legislature requires that all \nbills must be focused on one issue. They cannot be loaded up with \nrandom provisions, riders, and add-ons that have nothing to do with the \noverall legislation. In Congress, we often use omnibus bills to pass \nmultiple legislative items that should be considered on their own \nmerit. Omnibus often create more problems in the long run than they \nsolve.\n  Instead of focusing on one policy issue at a time, we have allowed \nlegislative logjams to foul up the Senate's work and ill-considered \nlegislation to be hastily pushed through this institution. These \nlegislative practices, which have become the norm are a gangrene that \neats away at this institution.\n  Legislation that is fundamental to our country's wellbeing has become \npoliticized and burdened with extraneous provisions that have not been \nfully vetted through the regular order. Most of the time Members have \nnot had the opportunity to read the bills they are voting on, let alone \nthe public which will have to live under and pay for whatever lurks in \nthe unseen pages. By tolerating this behavior, the Senate is allowing \nlegislation needed to address our Nation's most pressing challenges to \ngo through unrefined and lousy with special interest provisions.\n  To help bring this institution back in line with its original \npurpose, today I submit my Single Issue Legislation resolution. I want \nthis resolution to be a starting point for changing the attitude the \nSenate has toward building bills. It will allow us to focus on getting \nindividual issues addressed more effectively. Specifically, this \nresolution enacts a standing order that creates a point of order \nagainst a bill or resolution that is not confined to a single issue. \nThis point of order can only be overruled by a supermajority.\n  My Single Issue Legislation gives the Senate the flexibility in the \namendment process it has always enjoyed and allows the Senate as a \nlegislative body to develop the structure and scope of the standing \norder through practice and precedent rather than through arbitrary \nrules. At the same time, we ensure that our legislative process is \nfocused and productive. In short, we bring ourselves back to how the \nFounding Fathers intended and wanted our legislative process to \noperate.\n  Our job is not to score political points by stuffing as many pet \nprojects and knee-jerk provisions as we can into bills, but rather to \nrepresent the needs of our constituents, our States, and our country by \ndoing what is best for us as a nation. We must get back to a better \nprocess for crafting and considering legislation so that we can enact \neffective policies to meet the many challenges we face today. This is \nwhy we were elected to serve in the United States Senate. We owe it to \nthe people we represent to work through a process that allows \nlegislation to be properly and thoroughly considered and debated. My \nSingle Issue Legislation resolution helps us do just that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "06"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/08/06/senate-section/article/S9045-2", "month": "08", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S9045-S9046]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n SENATE RESOLUTION 247--DESIGNATING SEPTEMBER 26, 2009, AS ``NATIONAL \n                            ESTUARIES DAY''\n\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE (for himself, Mrs. Boxer, Mr. Burr, Mr. Cardin, Mr. \nCarper, Mr. Cochran, Ms. Collins, Mrs. Feinstein, Mrs. Gillibrand, Mr. \nGregg, Ms. Landrieu, Mr. Lautenberg, Ms. Mikulski, Mrs. Murray, Mrs. \nShaheen, Mr. Warner, and Mr. Wyden) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n                              S.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to the immediate consideration of Calendar No. 101, S. \n423.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report the bill by title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (S. 423) to amend title 38, United States Code, to \n     authorize advance appropriations for certain medical care \n     accounts of the Department of Veterans Affairs by providing \n     two-fiscal year budget authority, and for other purposes.\n\n  There being no objection, the Senate proceeded to consider the bill.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am very gratified that the Senate is \nacting on S. 423, the proposed Veterans Health Care Budget and \nTransparency Act of 2009. This bill would authorize, beginning in \nfiscal year 2011, advance appropriations for certain medical care \naccounts of the Department of Veterans Affairs by providing two fiscal \nyear budget authority.\n  The Committee on Veterans' Affairs held a hearing on pending health \ncare legislation on April 22, 2009, during which the Committee received \ntestimony on S. 423. Support for this bill was voiced by the Department \nof Veterans Affairs, Disabled American Veterans, American Federation of \nGovernment Employees, and Paralyzed Veterans of America. The Committee \nordered the bill reported on May 21, 2009. The Committee report--S. \nRpt, 111-041--was filed on July 8, 2009.\n  In 19 of the past 22 fiscal years, final VA appropriations have been \nenacted late and requests for supplemental appropriations for VA health \ncare have increased in frequency during recent years. Over the past 7 \nyears, final VA appropriations were late approximately 3 months on \naverage. While there has been some impact on the timeliness and overall \nquality of VA care from these financial and management difficulties in \nthe past, there is a serious concern that continued funding problems \ncould significantly weaken the quality of veterans' health care. \nProviding sufficient, timely and predictable funding to the VA health \ncare system would mitigate these dangers and allow VA administrators \nand directors to more efficiently and effectively provide medical care \nto veterans.\n  Advanced funding would allow the VA to function more effectively, to \nbetter align with funding cycles, and to avoid annual partisan \npolitical maneuvering. Through appropriating funds in advance to the \nmedical services, medical support and compliance, and medical \nfacilities accounts, we can avoid any disruption to the provision of \nadequate and timely health care to those who have sacrificed a great \ndeal for this nation.\n  I understand that authorizing advanced appropriations is a serious \nendeavor and as such have made sure this legislation also enhances \noversight of the VA health care budget process. The Comptroller General \nof the United States will be required to conduct a study of adequacy \nand accuracy of the budget projections made by VA's Enrollee Health \nCare Projection Model and any other model or methodology used to \nmeasure health care expenditures. The study would cover the five fiscal \nyears included in each budget submission; however, the focus is \nintended to be upon the fiscal year for which the advance appropriation \nwould be made. These reports would be submitted to the appropriate \ncommittees of Congress no later than the date on which the President \nsubmits the budget request for the following fiscal year.\n  This bill has received support from a myriad of organizations \nincluding The Partnership for Veterans Health Care Budget Reform, The \nIndependent Budget Veterans Service Organizations, The Military \nCoalition, and the American Federation for Government Employees. I \nthank them for their efforts and ongoing commitment to this \nlegislation.\n  I thank the many Senators who have cosponsored this legislation, \nincluding Committee members Senators Burr, Rockefeller, Murray, \nSanders,\n\n[[Page S9059]]\n\nBrown, Tester, Begich, Burris, Specter and Isakson. I am also delighted \nthat Senator Snowe was an original cosponsor of this bill and has \nworked hard in support of it.\n  Mr. President, this legislation will bring much needed stability and \npredictability to the VA health care system and consistent, high-\nquality health care to the veterans and I am delighted with today's \naction by the Senate.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a third reading and was read \nthe third time.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \nSenate proceed to Calendar No. 129, H.R. 1016, the House companion; \nthat all after the enacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 423 \nbe inserted in lieu thereof; the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand passed; the motions to reconsider be laid upon the table; that upon \npassage of H.R. 1016, S. 423 be returned to the calendar, with no \nintervening action or debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment was ordered to be engrossed and the bill to be read a \nthird time.\n  The bill (H.R. 1016), as amended, was read the third time and passed, \nas follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1016\n\n       Resolved, That the bill from the House of Representatives \n     (H.R. 1016) entitled ``An Act to amend title 38, United \n     States Code, to provide advance appropriations authority for \n     certain accounts of the Department of Veterans Affairs, and \n     for other purposes.'', do pass with the following amendment:\n       Strike out all after the enacting clause and insert:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Health Care Budget \n     Reform and Transparency Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Title 38, United States Code, authorizes the Secretary \n     of Veterans Affairs to furnish hospital and domiciliary care, \n     medical services, nursing home care, and related services to \n     eligible and enrolled veterans, but only to the extent that \n     appropriated resources and facilities are available for such \n     purposes.\n       (2) For 19 of the past 22 fiscal years, funds have not been \n     appropriated for the Department of Veterans Affairs for the \n     provision of health care as of the commencement of the new \n     fiscal year, causing the Department great challenges in \n     planning and managing care for enrolled veterans, to the \n     detriment of veterans.\n       (3) The cumulative effect of insufficient, late, and \n     unpredictable funding for the Department for health care \n     endangers the viability of the health care system of the \n     Department and impairs the specialized health care resources \n     the Department requires to maintain and improve the health of \n     sick and disabled veterans.\n       (4) Appropriations for the health care programs of the \n     Department have too often proven insufficient over the past \n     decade, requiring the Secretary to ration health care and \n     Congress to approve supplemental appropriations for those \n     programs.\n       (5) Providing sufficient, timely, and predictable funding \n     would ensure the Government meets its obligation to provide \n     health care to sick and disabled veterans and ensure that all \n     veterans enrolled for health care through the Department have \n     ready access to timely and high quality care.\n       (6) Providing sufficient, timely, and predictable funding \n     would allow the Department to properly plan for and meet the \n     needs of veterans.\n\n     SEC. 3. TWO-FISCAL YEAR BUDGET AUTHORITY FOR CERTAIN MEDICAL \n                   CARE ACCOUNTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS \n                   AFFAIRS.\n\n       (a) Two-fiscal Year Budget Authority.--\n       (1) In general.--Chapter 1 of title 38, United States Code, \n     is amended by inserting after section 113 the following new \n     section:\n\n     ``Sec. 113A.
