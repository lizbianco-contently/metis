O'MALLEY\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, every one of our servicemembers deserves the \nunqualified appreciation and admiration of the Senate and our entire \nNation. Today, I wish to salute the service of one such soldier, a man \nwho first answered his country's call in World War II and has not \nstopped.\n  Bob O'Malley served our Nation with distinction in the 10th Mountain \nDivision in combat in Europe. He was a sergeant and a squad leader who \nled his men bravely and with honor. He put his life on the line on many \noccasions to protect his men and to fight for freedom against Nazi \nGermany and was recognized with his squad's admiration, the Combat \nInfantry Badge and, because he was wounded, a Purple Heart.\n  But he has not stopped serving his country. Bob came to Washington in \n1965 and worked for Congressman Robert Sweeney before starting a 27-\nyear career with the Doorkeeper of the House of Representatives. That \nis where I first met him, as a young Member of Congress. The \nDoorkeeper, Mr. Molloy, and Mr. O'Malley, had a suite of offices and it \nwas kind of a hangout for Democratic Members of the House; especially \nit was a way for new Members of the Congress to become acquainted with \nwhat was going on over there. They were very caring about new Members \nand always pointed us in the right direction. I have always remembered \nthose two men for all the good deeds they did on my behalf.\n  His was a 27-year career with the Doorkeeper. As I indicated, that is \nwhere I met him. By the time the war in Afghanistan started in 2002, \nBob had retired from service in the House of Representatives. Most \nretirees are content to seek a well-earned life of leisure, but \nSergeant O'Malley did not. He signed up for a new and worthy mission, \nwaking every day to serve our Nation's wounded warriors. When the war \nstarted, he went back to work as a volunteer--again a volunteer--\nsupporting and caring for the men and women of the 10th Mountain \nDivision, his old unit. He has made countless visits to Walter Reed, \nthis great medical center\n\n[[Page S2484]]\n\nwhere these wounded warriors come to recuperate. On all these visits to \nWalter Reed, he spent countless hours talking and sharing stories about \nthe Division and taking his fellow veterans to ball games and other \nevents, including the sharing of meals on many occasions. When many of \nthese wounded warriors could not make it home for the holiday, Bob \nwould reach into his own pocket and pay for Thanksgiving, Christmas, \nand New Years dinners for soldiers and their families at some of the \nfinest eateries in the Washington, DC, area. Bob says that helping \nsoldiers recover from their war injuries has added years to his life. \nWe know it has added years to the lives of those he helps.\n  Bob O'Malley would be the first to tell you this is not a one-man \nmission. He has had help from many different areas. When he decided to \nhelp those wounded on the battlefield, for example, he enlisted the \nhelp of another veteran, Dom Visconsi, Sr., an original member of the \n10th Mountain Division in World War II. He asked Dom to help and Dom \nwas happy to help entertain and support these troops. Many of Bob's \nfriends soon joined the cause as well, and they are a constant presence \nfor the soldiers, whether here or at home. Our Army would not be the \nbest place in the world without the work of veterans such as Sergeant \nO'Malley, whose life has been synonymous with service, sacrifice, and \nselflessness.\n  He is an inspiration to me, our Armed Forces, and our country. He is \na hero, and I am proud to call him a friend.\n  Would the Chair announce morning business now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/21/senate-section/article/S2484-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I am here today not only to salute these \ngreat Americans but also to talk about the urgency of bringing the \nissue of Wall Street reform to the Senate for open debate and final \npassage. We have weathered and witnessed the worst financial crisis in \nthe history of the country. We have seen wealth, trillions of dollars \nof wealth, evaporate because of this financial crisis. To hear people \nnow talking about, well, this is not a good bill--the question is not \nwhether we should delay further or go forward. The question is going \nforward with purpose, amending the bill on the floor, if necessary, in \nan open and transparent way so the American public can see we are \nmoving forward on perhaps their No. 1 priority related to the economy, \nand economic recovery and financial reform are integrated key elements. \nWe cannot have long-run economic success without fundamental financial \nreform.\n  We are here today essentially to urge that the anticipated vote on \nMonday to proceed to the bill be affirmed overwhelmingly to send a \nmessage to the American people we are on the job for them, we are doing \nthe work we have to do. We have to deal with a complex and significant \nlegislative measure--but we have to do it now. The time for discussion, \nthe time for consideration privately, has passed. Now we have to act.\n  I think we have to act because we should recognize the status quo is \nunacceptable. Those on the other side who have been saying: Not now, \nnot now, not now, essentially are defending the status quo. We have to \nask several questions. Who does the status quo favor? It favors the \nremaining big banks and other financial institutions. We have seen, \nover the last several days, that these banks are reporting record \nprofits, mostly based on trading. Here is another irony. Because of the \nsystem we have today, we are in desperate need of economic activity at \nthe local level, the infusion of capital, lending--all those things. \nWhere are the banks making their huge profits? On trading, essentially \ntaking their money and other people's money and not investing in new \nproductive capacity, but betting on financial products. That is not, in \nmy view, what we should be doing at this moment. We have to recognize \nthat if we do nothing, the banks will continue to operate as they have.\n  That, I think, has to be corrected. The second question is, what \nactivities are protected by the status quo? I will tell you. Exotic \nderivative trading. We saw this week where the Securities and Exchange \nCommission has made allegations against Goldman Sachs. Now, that will \nbe determined in a court of law.\n  However, the complexity of the transaction engaged in by Goldman and \nothers, the creation of a synthetic collateralized debt obligation, to \ntranslate, was essentially picking out some representative mortgage \nfunds and then betting on them. Somebody took the side that said they \nwould still pay; some would take the side that they would default.\n  What did that add to our economic capacity? In fact, one of the \nironies of this whole crisis is there was such a proliferation of these \ntoxic mortgage bonds that they no longer could sell them at a profit, \nso they started essentially creating virtual or synthetic securities.\n  Again, what has it added to the economic productivity of the United \nStates? Not much. In fact, some would argue nothing at all. We have to \nhave a financial sector which performs one of the essential functions \nof any financial sector, the allocation of capital to productive uses: \nhighways, buildings, education support, all of those things that not \nonly return a profit to the investors but also build up our economic \ncapacity and build up our wealth over the long term.\n  Other activities that will be protected by the status quo include not \nonly derivatives trading, but dark pools of capital, huge private \nequity funds that are shadowy in terms of their investment strategy, \neven to regulators, and the credit rating agencies. They are continuing \nto operate, and, frankly, we have to say their performance in the last \nseveral years was disappointing, and that is being very diplomatic. But \nthey will continue to operate as they have in the past because we will \nnot get the reform that is so necessary.\n  Of course, the Wall Street salary structure, the incentive \ncompensation, also will continue to be unaffected. So for all of these \nactivities, if you are comfortable with them, then vote against the \nmotion to proceed on Monday evening. If you are uncomfortable with \nthem, if you do not want to see the remaining banks continue to operate \nas they have, then you have to vote, in my view, to move forward to \ndebate this bill and engage on this issue.\n  Now, the third question we have to ask is, what does the status quo \ndo for consumers and taxpayers? The answer is very little, if anything \nat all. We saw in this whole situation consumers who were in some cases \nmisled. In some cases it was obvious they could not afford the credit \narrangement they were signing on to, but the incentive on the other \nside was not to look behind the veneer of the borrower but simply to \nget the loan closed and then sell it off for securitization profits.\n\n[[Page S2485]]\n\n  We have to change those incentives, and if we do not proceed to this \nlegislation, we do not have a chance of doing that. So we have to move \nforward. Some have claimed, the Republican leader and others, that this \nis just a partisan exercise. It has not been a partisan exercise. We \nhave been, under the leadership of Chairman Dodd, engaged in this \neffort for months and months and months.\n  Some people might have forgotten around here, but we started the \nmarkup of the financial reform bill November 19 of last year. We had a \nbill. Senator Dodd brought it to the committee. We started opening \nstatements, and then everyone said: We have not had time enough to do \nthis. We want more discussion.\n  Senator Dodd, even with the urgency of moving on this measure, said: \nFine. I respect my colleagues. I respect the process. We will stop. We \nwill start talking.\n  Well, the negotiations went on and on and on. It was clear there was \nno sense of urgency on the other side to move to a decisive vote. Then \nhe engaged other Members. Senator Corker and others entered the \ndiscussion. I have been discussing derivatives in a very thoughtful way \nwith Senator Gregg for months. But we have reached the point now where \nwe have to take deliberate action and make some decisions.\n  We have to move to the floor, to debate and votes and final passage. \nThis is something we have to continue to move forward. The way to move \nforward is to vote on the motion to proceed on Monday evening.\n  We have heard claims that this is a bailout bill, which I think would \nbe a huge shock to many of my colleagues on the committee who have been \nworking on this for months and months, Senator Corker and Senator \nWarner particularly, who crafted many of the provisions in this area.\n  The reality is, if we do nothing, which is the effect of voting \nagainst the cloture motion--if we do nothing, we could have a crisis \nnext week. Greek sovereign debt--there is huge turmoil in Europe about \nGreek bonds, the ability of the Greek Government to pay, the need for \nsupport. If those talks collapse and suddenly throughout the financial \nsystem there is a rush away from sovereign debt, not just Greek debt \nbut other countries, what will happen? We do not quite know, I suspect, \nwho is holding all of this debt and what are the systemic effects. We \nhave to be prepared for something like that.\n  The notion that this crisis has passed and we can go about our merry \nway without dealing with these issues is naive. The way to deal with it \nis to establish a resolution mechanism. Senator Warner and Senator \nCorker have done a remarkable job of crafting one. One of the questions \nthey struggled with the most is who is going to pay for the resolution.\n  Frankly, they stepped up to the plate today and said: Let's put the \nbanks on the line for the first $50 billion. That makes sense to me \nbecause it is clear who is going to pay: not the taxpayer but the \nbanks. But, in any case, we cannot engage in this discussion of the \nmechanism and how it will finally come out until we bring the bill to \nthe floor, debate it, and vote upon amendments or changes. That is what \nwe have to do. But this legislation is clearly not a bailout for the \nbanks. If it was, they would be supporting it.\n  Frankly, all the newspapers I read suggest the intense lobbying \neffort against the bill is by the banks, which, coincidentally, seems \nto favor the position of those who do not want to proceed to the bill. \nSo I think we are in a situation where we have to proceed forward. As I \nsaid, if we do not move forward, we are going to have a significant \nissue of confidence by the American people and others in the stability \nof our financial system. These are complex, intricate issues. They \nrequire debate and discussion. I do not think anyone should be \npresumptuous enough to stand here and say: We know exactly what to do, \nand we are going to do it without the consent and without the input of \nall of our colleagues. But that consent and input comes, ultimately, on \nthe Senate floor through debate, discussion, and voting.\n  Now, again, where are we if we do not take up this measure next week? \nWell, the $600 trillion market in derivatives will remain opaque, \ncomplex, confusing, and a potential vulnerability for our financial \nsystem. I say $600 trillion because when we talk about derivatives \nmarkets, billions are--you know, that is a rounding error. It is \ntrillions of dollars, and a miscalculation, a mistake, a misjudgment in \nthat market has huge consequences.\n  The big banks who sell complex, toxic instruments to pension plans, \nessentially taking savings and trading them, gambling with them, in \nsome respects, they will continue to do that. They will not only take \npension savings, but they will take municipalities' money in fancy bond \narrangements that the municipalities never needed.\n  All of these things will continue.\n  Unregulated mortgage lenders will continue to go out and operate \nunder the originate-and-sell model, which has led to so many problems. \nPayday lenders that are charging, in some cases, 900 percent interest \nwill continue to be unregulated. Credit card companies, even after our \nefforts with the credit card legislation, will continue to try to \ncircumvent the rules to maximize their profit.\n  The bottom line is, the people who benefit from delay, from taking \nthe course of action of delay and denial, I would say, because this \nurge to suggest this is a bailout bill is denying the facts of the \nbill, will be financial institutions and not consumers and not \ntaxpayers.\n  So, as a result, I would urge all of my colleagues on Monday to vote \nto proceed to this bill. Again, we have to ask three questions. This \nwill be decided on Monday evening. The status quo favors the banks. If \nyou want to favor the banks, then vote against cloture. The status quo \noperates to allow all sorts of arcane and exotic activities which we \nknow have posed significant threats to our financial system.\n  If you want these activities to continue unimproved, uncorrected, \nvote against cloture. The status quo disfavors consumers and taxpayers. \nSo if you want to see them continue to be on the short side of the \nsale, vote against cloture. I would urge we vote for cloture, we move \nforward to debate real ideas about how to improve our financial system, \nprotect consumers, and strengthen our economy.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/21/senate-section/article/S2485-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2485-S2486]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       ISRAEL'S 62ND ANNIVERSARY\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my congratulations \nto Israel on the 62nd anniversary of its independence.\n  This week, America's closest ally in the Middle East, Israel, \ncommemorated its Independence Day, Yom Ha'atzmaut, 1 day after its \nMemorial Day, Yom Hazikaron, and 1 week after Holocaust Remembrance \nDay, Yom HaShoah.\n  While Independence Day is about celebration for the people of Israel, \nthis Memorial Day was marked by somber ceremonies and national grief \nover the loss of their soldiers. Nationwide sirens and moments of \nsilence emphasize the sacrifices all Israelis have made living in their \nthriving, free and democratic state. These intensely personal losses in \nsuch a small country underscore the continuing threats faced by \nIsraelis, the scale of their efforts and the importance of a Jewish \nhomeland.\n  I commemorated last week's observance of Yom HaShoah in Baltimore, \nwhere I joined fellow community members to view a movie marking the \n50th anniversary of Adolf Eichmann's capture and trial. Eichmann was a \npremier architect of the Holocaust. Rather than dealing with such a war \ncriminal through forceful vengeance that would have been \nunderstandable, Israel prosecuted Eichmann by following the rule of law \nand his trial was a model of transparency and justice. This display of \nour shared values of law, justice, and fairness help to illustrate why \nthe United States and Israel have continued to build upon our ``special \nrelationship'' for six decades.\n  I observed Israel Independence Day at an event focused on the growing \nthreat of a nuclear Iran. If Iran acquired this capability, it would be \nan unequivocal ``game changer'' in the Middle East and, indeed, \nthroughout the world. An undeniable threat to Israel and the United \nStates, a nuclear Iran cannot become a reality. We therefore must do \nall in our power to\n\n[[Page S2486]]\n\nprevent Iran from acquiring nuclear capabilities. One of our first \nsteps should be immediate enactment of powerful and effective economic \nsanctions against Iran, and the foreign companies that do business with \nthis rogue nation.\n  While we work to minimize the key threats to Israel's security, we \nmust also focus on opportunities for peace in the Middle East. Israel \nhas always been prepared to pursue those opportunities and make peace \nwith its neighbors. Over the past six decades, despite diplomatic \ngestures, multiple Arab countries have repeatedly attacked Israel. We \nshould not forget that it was the Palestinian's leaders who walked away \nfrom the negotiation table at Camp David in 2000, on the eve of what \nwould have been a historic breakthrough for peace.\n  Today, it is Israel who continues to acknowledge the necessary \nframework for any peace agreements, a two-state solution. While Israel \nhas shown willingness for direct negotiations, the Palestinians \ncontinue to be, an unreliable partner in moving forward towards peace. \nHow can Israel make peace with any partner whose so-called ``moderate'' \nFatah leaders are not willing to meet directly with Israelis leaders \nand whose Parliament is controlled by Hamas, an organization still \nsworn to the destruction of Israel?\n  I am proud to have joined with 75 of my colleagues in reaching out to \nSecretary of State Clinton in a recent letter which included a \nreaffirmation of this fact as well as a reminder, that not only do the \nU.S. and Israel share common values but also common interests. Top \namong these interests is restarting the peace process and preventing \nIran from becoming a nuclear state.\n  This is precisely why the role of the United States in this process \nmust be one of an honest broker. President Obama must not place \nwrongful or unreasonable pressure on Israel or, worse, to put forward a \nproposal without Israel's consent.\n  Since Israel's founding 62 years ago, every American administration \nhas worked to strengthen the bonds between the U.S. and Israel. This \nhas been vital for Israel, as the nation is under constant threat of \nmilitary and terrorist attacks, economic boycotts and diplomatic \nhostility, often merely due to the fact of its very existence. At this \ncritical moment, when Iran is moving forward with its nuclear program \nand simultaneously strengthening Hezbollah's capacity to attack Israel, \nit is imperative the Obama administration say in clear and unambiguous \nlanguage that we stand with the people of Israel and will do all in our \npower to protect our shared values and national bonds.\n  As Israel celebrates its anniversary, let us all proclaim that the \nU.S. continues its unbreakable alliance with our closest ally in the \nMiddle East.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute \nto a man who served New Mexico and the entire country with distinction \nfor more than three decades in Washington, a man who dedicated his life \nto being a champion for the least of us. That man is Senator Dennis \nChavez, the Nation's longest serving Hispanic U.S. Senator. This month \nwe mark the 122nd anniversary of his birth. In everything he did, \nSenator Chavez showed his concern for the underdog. He fought for \npublic education because he knew what it could do to help the children \nof struggling families become successful adults. He supported farmers \nbecause he knew how difficult life can be in the small communities \nwhere the trains don't stop and the roads don't go. And he fought for \ncivil rights because Senator Chavez believed equality of opportunity is \nthe core of the American creed.\n  Dennis Chavez fought for the underdog because he was an underdog. \nBorn into poverty in Valencia County, NM, Chavez walked along a \ndifficult road to the pinnacle of political power. A child of an \nisolated small town, he would see the world and help to shape it. A \nhigh school dropout, he earned a law degree and became a lawmaker. A \nvictim of ethnic discrimination, he wrote legislation that would \neventually make employment discrimination illegal and, then, \nunthinkable.\n  Dennis Chavez was a man of conviction. He also was a man of courage. \nAt the height of anti-Communist sentiment in the 1950s, Senator Chavez \nwas one of the first to denounce the activities of Joseph McCarthy. \nHere is what he said on the Senate floor during the McCarthy hearings \nin 1950:\n\n       I should like to be remembered as a man who raised a voice \n     . . . and I devoutly hope not a voice in the wilderness . . . \n     at a time in the history of this body when we seem bent upon \n     placing limitations on the freedom of the individual. I would \n     consider all of the legislation which I have supported \n     meaningless if I were to sit idly by, silent, during a period \n     which may go down in history as an era when we permitted the \n     curtailment of our liberties, a period when we quietly \n     shackled the growth of men's minds.\n\n  My father, who died last month, served in the U.S. Congress with \nDennis Chavez in the late 1950s and early 1960s. He always said what he \nsaw in Senator Chavez was a visionary and a man of courage. When \nSenator Chavez left this world in 1962, he was eulogized by Vice \nPresident Lyndon Johnson. In that eulogy, Vice President Johnson \nremembered Senator Chavez as ``a man who recognized that there must be \na champion for the least among us.''\n  Four years later, when the U.S. Congress placed Senator Chavez's \nstatue in Statuary Hall, Rev. John Spence summed up the man nicely. \nSpence said Senator Chavez was ``ever a champion of the underdog, the \npoor and oppressed.''\n  But it is the quote inscribed at the bottom of the statue that best \nreveals the legacy of Senator Dennis Chavez. Written in three \nlanguages, Spanish, English and Navajo, it reads simply:\n\n       He left a mark that will never be forgotten in the hopes \n     that others would follow.\n\n  El Senador makes me proud to be a New Mexican and humble to follow in \nhis footsteps as a Senator representing the great State of New Mexico. \nAmerica is a better place because of Senator Chavez. For that, we honor \nhim today.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, good morning.\n  I rise in opposition to the piece of legislation that Chairman Dodd \nis calling financial reform. All Republicans want to reform our \nfinancial system and fix the things that have caused so much financial \ndistress in our country. But rather than address the underlying causes \nof the 2008 financial crisis, this bill would institutionalize \ngovernment bailouts for those it chooses are too big to fail. If \nDemocrats were serious about financial reform, they would work with \nRepublicans to permanently end too big to fail, to curb the power of \nthe Federal Reserve, and to address the government distortions in the \nmortgage market that led to the financial meltdown. This bill does none \nof these.\n  Instead of focusing on solving these problems, the Democrats have \neagerly crafted another massive bill designed to increase centralized \ngovernment planning, and they are vilifying anyone who dares to oppose \nit.\n  Without bringing any more accountability to the government actors who \ncontributed to the causes of the financial crisis, this bill simply \nrepresents additional regulation without real reform. Despite a recent \nPew poll stating that more than 80 percent of Americans support ending \nbailouts, this bill ensures they will continue. The bill requires the \ngovernment to keep a list of financial companies it considers too big \nto fail, and it provides these companies with a $50 billion slush fund \nto help them when they get in trouble.\n\n[[Page S2487]]\n\n  In one respect the Democrats may be right in saying they would not \nlet the bailouts take place like they did in the past. If their bill \npasses, the next TARP bailout would not even be voted on by Congress. \nThat is because this slush fund empowers the Treasury, the Federal \nReserve, and the FDIC to pump money to ailing banks without asking for \nany permission from Congress.\n  There have been rumors that this slush fund could be removed. I hope \nit will be. But even if that is done, the bill will still perpetuate \ntoo-big-to-fail policies.\n  Additional programs in the bill will still allow the FDIC to \nguarantee the debts of financial companies in trouble, and they will \nalso allow the Treasury to still selectively bail out the creditors of \nfailing institutions. The bill also fails to stop the Federal Reserve \nfrom propping up financial companies as it did AIG. It additionally \nexpands the Fed's reach by creating a new consumer protection bureau \ninside the Federal Reserve. With its extensive jurisdiction and its \nunchecked ability to micromanage lending, it should be considered the \nanticonsumer bureau. This new bureau will have sweeping authority to \nregulate almost anything it regards as financial activity. From car \ndealers to other companies that offer financing for their products, to \nsoftware companies that help people manage their money, this massive \nnew bureaucracy is certain to increase regulatory burdens on community \nbanks, credit unions, and many others who had no role whatsoever in the \nfinancial crisis, as well as to raise consumer costs and kill jobs.\n  Before we rush to give the Fed more control over our economy, we need \nmore information about its activities surrounding the 2008 financial \ncrisis. Even to this day, the Fed refuses to provide information about \nthe extent to which they have used taxpayer money for the bailouts, and \nit is unacceptable to keep this kind of secrecy. Legislation to fully \naudit the Fed continues to enjoy widespread support, and I will \ncontinue to champion this audit of the Federal Reserve.\n  I would also like to see this bill bring some much needed \naccountability to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These government entities \nthat dominate the mortgage market and hold $5 trillion in debt were \nringleaders in the chain of buying, securitizing, and spreading toxic \nsubprime mortgages that led to the financial collapse. Since the \ngovernment took them over in 2008, taxpayers have been forced to give \nthem $127 billion so far, and there is no end in sight. The Obama \nadministration handed them a blank check last Christmas Eve by lifting \nthe $400 billion cap on government aid, ensuring endless bailouts in \nthe future.\n  Real reform would address the ongoing crisis at Fannie Mae and \nFreddie Mac. Although the Democratic bill is completely silent on this \nissue, I intend to see that we find a way to reduce their holdings and \ndivorce them from government ownership. We cannot deny the fact that \nthese two government entities were a major cause of the financial \ncrisis. Yet they are not even mentioned in this so-called financial \nreform.\n  Reform would not be complete without also addressing the underwriting \nissues that led to the explosion of risky lending that fueled the \nhousing bubble. This bill leaves the Community Reinvestment Act and \nFannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's affordable housing goals untouched. Each \nrequired significant increases in mortgage lending to lower income \nborrowers, which led to a decrease in the underwriting standards to \nmake more loans to folks who could not afford to pay them back. These \nbad practices became contagious in the industry.\n  If we do not deal with these housing policy problems that led to \nunsafe lending, as well as Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's sizable \nability to sustain demand for such loans by still buying them, we risk \ncontinuing a boom-or-bust housing cycle that saddles taxpayers with the \nconsequences of mortgages given to borrowers who likely cannot afford \nto pay them back.\n  Meanwhile, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac keep getting bailed out by the \ntaxpayers. That is the kind of impervious backing a reckless bank could \nonly dream of getting, and that is the same kind of deal Democrats are \nnow offering to the big banks they pretend to despise.\n  Despite all the rhetoric coming from my Democratic colleagues, this \nbill does not crack down on Wall Street. In fact, Wall Street loves it. \nIt turns the relationship between Wall Street and Washington into a \nfreeway. The best way to get tough on Wall Street would be to make sure \nthose banks have the same freedom to fail as the banks who did not get \nbailed out by the government in the last few years.\n  Ruling out special treatment for these big banks would be the \nharshest punishment possible. So instead of ending too big to fail, \nDemocrats are constantly inventing new ways to break down barriers \nbetween Washington control and Wall Street. That is not how you stand \nup to big banks; that is how you deal them in.\n  It is important we fix the problems that caused our financial \nmeltdown. But it is even more important to recognize that this \npolitical vehicle that is being called financial reform is just a lot \nmore government control, a lot more government takeovers, an overreach \nby the Obama administration, with very little financial reform.\n  This is not fair to the American people. It perpetuates too big to \nfail. It essentially guarantees future bailouts. It does not fix the \ncore causes of the problems, and, again, it expands big government \ncontrol over thousands of community banks, credit unions, and \nbusinesses that had nothing to do with this financial crisis. I am \nafraid it is just another crisis being used as an excuse to expand \ngovernment without solving real problems.\n  Republicans are standing by and eager to work with Chairman Dodd and \nother Democrats to fix the problems in this bill so we can present real \nreform to the American people. I urge my colleagues on the other side \nto stop trying to stick another bill down our throats and down the \nthroats of the American people and work with us to do what the American \npeople expect.\n  With that, I yield back and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Will the Senator withhold his \nrequest?\n  Mr. DeMINT. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I come to the floor as a physician who \nhas practiced orthopedic surgery in Casper, WY, for 25 years.\n  I come to offer a second opinion on the health care bill that was \nrecently passed and signed into law. My opinion on this bill is very \ndifferent than what I have heard from the administration, from the \nSpeaker of the House, and from the majority leader because my opinion \nis that this bill--now law--is going to be bad for patients, bad for \npatients all around this country, bad for health care providers: The \ndoctors, the nurses, the folks who work in our hospitals, the \ntherapists. I believe it is going to be bad for the taxpayers--people \nwho are going to be left with this large bill to pay for a bill that is \nnot to save a health care system but to create new entitlements and new \nobligations.\n  As I have looked at this, it struck me last week when they were \nhaving the debate in England. They are having an election, and the \ncandidates for Prime Minister were having a debate. It was the first \nnationally televised debate ever in England in an election. They \ncompared it to the Kennedy-Nixon debate when people were up there \ndebating and discussing.\n  The question presented to the Prime Minister of England was: What \nabout the national health service? Those of us on my side of the aisle \nhave been very concerned that with this new law we are going to be \nseeing a nationalization of our health care in a way like we are seeing \nin other countries, whether it is Canada, whether it is England--a \nsystem I think is not what the American people want.\n  But I wish to read to you from the transcript of the debate because \nthey asked the Prime Minister, Gordon Brown, about the National Health \nService. He said:\n\n       My priorities for the health service are that we give \n     people personal guarantees--\n\n  So this is what he is promising--\n\n     that every individual patient will know they will get a \n     cancer specialist seen within two\n\n[[Page S2488]]\n\n     weeks if [they] need it. They'll get a diagnostic test within \n     one week, and the results to them. They will also be able to \n     know that their operation--\n\n  So now they know they have cancer--\n\n     will be in 18 weeks if you're any patient in need of an \n     operation.\n\n  So here you are, you have had your opportunity to see a cancer \ndoctor, you have had your test, you have your diagnosis. What is the \nbest the people of England are being promised by their Prime Minister? \nThe best they can expect is to have an operation within 18 weeks.\n  The question here is, How many Americans, how many Members of this \nbody, how many people across this country are going to see that as \nsatisfactory? Because that is where we are heading with this health \ncare bill that is now signed into law. How many people want that: You \nwill have your operation in 18 weeks.\n  So here you are, if you are diagnosed next week in the United \nStates--if this were the situation they have now in Britain--you would \nbe looking at having your operation in September. See you in September. \nCome back for your operation. Now you can worry about it. You can worry \nabout your diagnosis of cancer the rest of April, all of May, all of \nJune, all of July, all of August. That is what the candidate for Prime \nMinister and the current Prime Minister of England is promising the \npeople of that country with their national health system--a system that \nis the model of many people on the other side of the aisle of what they \nwant American medicine to be like.\n  This story, once again, demonstrates that coverage does not equal \ncare. Because everyone in Britain has coverage, but they sure cannot \nget care. Then you ask yourself: Does it truly matter? Does 4\\1/2\\ \nmonths--18 weeks--of waiting for your cancer surgery truly matter? \nThere is not just the emotional worry of: Is that cancer spreading \nwithin my body? Should I leave the county of England and go to the \nUnited States where I can get immediate care? You have to worry because \nthe statistics back up the fact that the care in the United States is \nmuch better than it is in England--not that the doctors are any better \nhere than they are in England but that the timing of when you can \nreceive the care from those qualified professionals is much better in \nthe United States.\n  So if you take a look at the statistics behind this from the \nresearchers who look at this--and I will just go through it because my \nwife is a breast cancer survivor. She has had a series of three \noperations. She has been through chemotherapy twice, and she is now \nsurviving 6 years after her diagnosis. I am grateful she was treated in \nthe United States, where the day after the diagnosis was made they \nwanted to get in immediately to do the operation.\n  So let me tell you, it says that today the United States leads the \nworld in treating cancer. These are scientific studies. For breast \ncancer, for instance, the survival rate, after 5 years, among American \nwoman--a woman who is diagnosed in the United States with breast cancer \nand is treated--83 percent are still alive 5 years later. For the women \nin Britain, 69 percent. Where do you want to get your care? The bigger \nquestion is, When do you want to get your care?\n  For men with prostate cancer, the survival rate is 92 percent in the \nUnited States; 74 percent in France; 51 percent in Britain. American \nmen and women are more than 35 percent more likely to survive colon \ncancer than their British counterparts.\n  In an article from the August 2008 edition of Lancet Oncology, the \ncancer Journal there, the United States is No. 1 again. In almost every \ncategory, Americans survive cancer at higher rates than patients in \nother developed countries. American cancer patients have a higher \nsurvival rate for every major form of cancer than patients in Canada \nand Britain.\n  American women have a 35-percent better chance of surviving colon \ncancer than British women. American men have an 80-percent better \nsurvival rate for prostate cancer. American survival rates are also \nbetter than survival rates in France.\n  You can go on and on with this, but it is evidently clear--evidently \nclear--that the timing on when one gets their care is critical.\n  It is interesting to me that just this week--just this very week--the \nPresident made his nomination for a new Director of the portion of the \nHealth and Human Services Department that deals with Medicare and \nMedicaid. The President has been in office for 15 months. We have had a \ndebate and discussion in this body for almost all that time on health \ncare. In this body, the Democrats have voted to cut Medicare by $500 \nbillion from our seniors who desperately depend upon Medicare.\n  Why is it the President has waited 15 months to finally nominate \nsomeone to be the head of the part of government that oversees Medicare \nand Medicaid? The President has put 15 million to 16 million more \npeople on Medicaid, has cut Medicare, has told us we can trust him on \nthis. Yet he would not put somebody up to go through the confirmation \nprocess to head Medicare and Medicaid? Why? Because, in my opinion, he \ndid not want anybody to answer the questions because they are tough \nquestions. Why wouldn't you nominate somebody for all that time and \nleave the post open, essentially, and not have somebody to come to \nCongress and say what are the implications to the American people of \ndumping another 16 million people onto Medicaid, of cutting $500 \nbillion from Medicare?\n  Well, because the person he has put in has a long history of a love \nof rationing care. It is a Dr. Donald Berwick. He has a history of \nsupport for government rationing of government health care resources on \nthe grounds of cost--not on the grounds of quality, not on the grounds \nof survivability but on the grounds of cost.\n  He has said, as recently as last June:\n\n       The decision is not whether or not we will ration care--the \n     decision is whether we will ration with our eyes open.\n\n  So here we are, the newly nominated person has basically said: I am \ngoing into this to ration care. He is a big supporter of what they have \ngoing on in Britain right now. In Britain, they call it NICE. It stands \nfor National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence. Well, this \nis what Dr. Berwick has said about it. He said:\n\n       Those organizations are functioning very well and are well \n     respected by clinicians, and they are making their \n     populations healthier and better off.\n\n  Well, let me tell you what a London doctor, a colon cancer \nspecialist, had to say. This doctor said:\n\n       A lot of my colleagues also face pressure from managers not \n     to tell patients about new drugs.\n\n  He said:\n\n       There is nothing in writing, but telling patients opens up \n     a Pandora's box for health services trying to contain costs.\n\n  He further went on--this now being again Dr. Berwick saying about \nthis British group:\n\n       NICE is an extremely effective and conscientious, valuable \n     and--importantly--knowledge-building system.\n\n  What did the BBC, the British broadcast group, say? They say:\n\n       Doctors are keeping cancer patients in the dark about \n     expensive new drugs that could extend their lives . . . A \n     quarter of the specialists--\n\n  one in four specialists--\n\n     polled by Myeloma UK said they hid facts about treatments for \n     bone marrow cancer that may be difficult to obtain from the \n     National Health Service. Doctors said they did not want to \n     ``distress, upset, or confuse'' patients if drugs had not yet \n     been approved by the National Health Service drugs watchdog \n     NICE.\n\n  So when we take a look at the British health care system: 18 weeks of \na wait--which is the promise from the Prime Minister in the debate last \nweek--18 weeks from when you are diagnosed with cancer until you have \nyour operation. That is their aspirational goal. It makes you wonder \nwhat it is now. It has to be a lot longer than 18 weeks. So I would \ntell my colleagues it is no surprise that in the latest polls that were \nout this morning, the Quinnipiac poll, polling done this past week: Do \nyou support passage of the health care reform bill? Less than 4 in 10 \nAmericans, only 39 percent, approve of what this body crammed down the \nthroats of the American people, whereas over half of all Americans \ndisapprove of what this administration--this President, Harry Reid, \nNancy Pelosi, and this Congress--has now forced upon the American \npeople.\n  The American people have great cause to worry about what they are \ngoing to face in their health care, in their health care decisions; if \nthey are going to be able to keep the doctor\n\n[[Page S2489]]\n\nthey like seeing. Those are the questions, and those are the concerns \nof the American people. My colleagues know my second opinion on the \nhealth care bill that we were told by Nancy Pelosi: You have to pass it \nbefore you get to find out what is in it.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak on financial \nregulatory reform. During the current economic downturn, we have seen \nfar too many Americans lose their jobs, homes, and their savings. \nToday, 15 million of our citizens are still out of work, and national \nunemployment continues to hover near 10 percent.\n  It is this uncertain climate in which we consider financial reform \nlegislation. The crisis is going to remain in the forefront of our \nnational consciousness for years to come, mainly due to the immense \ngovernment intervention that was pushed through over the past year and \na half, attempting to stabilize our frozen credit markets but instead \naccumulating massive debt that threatens to harm our economy much worse \nthan the original problems.\n  The current legislation continues the government's failed ``too big \nto fail'' policy. Too big to fail perverts free market capitalism and \nsuggests that entities can privatize their profits, yet socialize their \nrisks, and taxpayers foot the bill. The American taxpayer should not be \nforced to pay the gambling debts of risky bets made by large financial \ninstitutions.\n  Republicans and Democrats alike agree that we must end too big to \nfail, but the bill that is being proposed does not do that. Chairman \nDodd's bill provides both the FDIC and the Treasury Department \nemergency authority to provide broad debt guarantees in times of \n``economic distress'' to ``struggling firms.'' As written, it is \nforeseeable that the FDIC or Treasury could step in to prop up a firm \nunder any circumstance, all without seeking to resolve and unwind the \nfirm.\n  The chairman's bill authorizes continued emergency lending authority \nfor the Federal Reserve, but conceivably only for large banks. Under \nthe Dodd bill, the Federal Reserve would retain supervisory authority \nover bank holding companies with assets over $50 billion. The Federal \nReserve supervision essentially predesignates the firms that are too \nbig to fail. These banks would have the implicit backing of the \ngovernment and the taxpayers and, with it, the competitive advantage, \ngiving it access to cheaper credit from lenders expecting to be made \nwhole. This puts our Nation's community and independent banks at a \nsevere competitive disadvantage.\n  I will offer an amendment, if this bill comes to the floor, to permit \ncommunity banks to remain under the supervision of the Federal Reserve. \nIf the Fed supervises only the largest firms, it will gear monetary \npolicy toward these large financial institutions, effectively leaving \nout the voice and real-time experience of community bankers in my State \nand across the country.\n  While the large financial institutions were making bad bets on \nsubprime mortgage markets, community banks were making home and \nbusiness loans to local customers. Local community banks provide the \nlending and deposit services for our Nation's small businesses so they \ncan operate, invest, create jobs, and drive our economy. It is this \nbusiness lending that will help create jobs and grow our economy.\n  Tom Hoenig, President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, \nsaid recently that our Nation's largest banks would be well served to \ntake lessons from our community banks. Why? Because community banks \nhave been committed to providing the credit and services needed for \nsmall business. They know their customers, and they can make good, \nsolid loans that are supportable.\n  In Texas, Richard Fisher, President of the Dallas Federal Reserve \nBank, said the provision in the bill would leave the Dallas Federal \nReserve jurisdiction with only one or two bank holding companies, down \nfrom 36 member banks, for $74 billion in assets that he now has \nsupervisory authority over. The Fed should know the needs and the \neconomic conditions throughout the country, not just New York and \nWashington, DC.\n  It is precisely the ability to foster bottom-up growth through small \nbusinesses that sets community banks apart from other financial \ninstitutions. Unlike the big financial institutions we see in the \nheadlines for bailouts and bonuses, community banks don't have a \nsystemic risk to our financial system and they are not identified as \nprimary contributors to our latest crisis.\n  However, community banks would soon be subjected to a considerable \namount of new costs and regulatory burdens as a result of this \nlegislation. Community banks are already regulated. They are well \nregulated. Adding additional layers of Federal bureaucracy with \nlimitless authority would be a burden that would only serve to hamper \nthe ability of community banks to effectively provide depository and \nlending services to America's consumers and small businesses.\n  Community banks should not be punished as a result of this \nlegislation. We should preserve and enhance our dual banking system, \nnot impose additional Federal regulations that stifle their ability to \nserve their communities.\n  I am also concerned about the direction of the regulation of over-\nthe-counter derivatives. In the wake of the collapse of the mortgage \nmarket where the use of derivatives and even derivatives of derivatives \nhelped cause great losses to banks and nearly brought our economy to \nits knees, it is important that Federal regulators have a greater \nunderstanding of this derivatives market. We have Members on both sides \nof the aisle who are negotiating these terms. Republicans and Democrats \nhave the same goal. We want to end too big to fail. We want to end \nbailouts. We want to assure that our community banks still have the \ncapability to serve Main Street customers.\n\n  The bill before us that is not being brought to the floor because it \ndid not have any input from the Republican side does not achieve those \ngoals. So we are now meeting in small groups. We are meeting with the \nSecretary of the Treasury and others within the administration to try \nto come to terms that would do the right thing and meet the goal that \nwe all agree is the goal. That is what is going on right now in the \nSenate.\n  It is my great hope--and I see my colleague from Tennessee who is \nalso on the Banking Committee with me, and he too is a part of the \nnegotiations and wants to bring this bill to the floor--we can do \nsomething good for our economy. Passing the bill or letting it come to \nthe floor and roll out of here in its present form would not\n\n[[Page S2490]]\n\nachieve that objective. So I welcome my colleague from Tennessee, who \nhas been a major player in this debate. He has been a major reason that \nwe are coming to a point at which I think we can have a successful \nbipartisan bill.\n  I will say that our chairman and ranking member, Chairman Dodd and \nSenator Shelby, have been meeting for weeks to try to come to terms. So \nI think everyone is sincere at this point that we want a bipartisan \nbill. Financial regulation is not political. The consequences of \npassing a bad bill are huge for our country, for every American. We can \ndo this.\n  I welcome the comments of my colleague from Tennessee and I look \nforward to his continuing leadership so we can have a bill that will \nhelp the consumers in our country, stabilize our economy and, most of \nall, will bring the unemployment rate down from 10 percent so that more \nAmericans can go to work.\n  Thank you, Mr. President, and I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, typically when we come to the floor to \nspeak, we don't like to wait for another Senator who wants to speak; we \nwant to speak and go back to what we were doing, but today I am so glad \nI had the opportunity to hear the remarks of the Senator from Texas.\n  Both of the Federal Reserve leaders in Kansas City and Dallas have \nadded tremendously to this debate. No one has been more of a supporter \nfor community banks than the Senator from Texas. I could not agree more \nwith everything the Senator said regarding the Fed keeping community \nbanks. My sense is that by the time the bill comes to the floor, it \nwill either have that in it, or let me say to my colleague right now \nthat I will cosponsor the amendment the Senator brings forth, because I \nthink the Senator is absolutely right, that the Federal Reserve should \nkeep the smaller State-chartered Fed members. The fact is this \nrearranging the deck chairs serves no purpose, so I could not agree \nmore.\n  I also agree with the Senator regarding derivatives. I notice the \nSenator from Texas has a microphone if she wishes to comment. I am \ngoing to speak based on what the Senator said on derivatives, but if it \nis OK, I would like the Senator from Texas to be able to respond.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I appreciate the remarks of the \nSenator from Tennessee and, of course, I welcome his cosponsorship of \nthe amendment. It is essential. I couldn't support this bill if we shut \nthe Fed off from Tennessee and Texas and California. Then we might as \nwell all move to New York.\n  New York doesn't want any more people, I am sure. They are well \npopulated. But most of all, I want to make sure that the Main Street \nbankers and the small businesses of all of our States are known to the \nFed, and the way they are known to the Fed, of course, as the Senator \nknows, is that their local Federal Reserve bank knows their issues and \nproblems and needs, because they have the ability to serve those banks, \nwhich is not allowed in the bill before us.\n  I thank the Senator from Tennessee for his leadership. I look forward \nto coming up with something we can all support.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, that brings me back to where I want to be. \nThe fact is, there are a lot of people coming to the floor and a lot of \nthings are being said in the press. First, I think we are going to end \nup with a bipartisan bill before the actual vote to proceed takes \nplace. I believe that is being led by Senators Dodd and Shelby. They \nare the point people. You cannot have eight negotiators. I believe that \nis where we are headed. So when I hear a lot of the rhetoric on the \nfloor and other places, I think it is just rhetoric; but at the end of \nthe day, I think we will end up with a solid bipartisan bill. I hope it \nis one I can support. Obviously, I am giving input on that.\n  That leads me to this. There have been folks who have come to the \nfloor talking about the Republicans supporting Wall Street by not \nsupporting the Dodd bill in its present form. That is ridiculous. What \nis happening--some reporter made comments yesterday about Republicans \nand that I slammed the Dodd bill. That is not true. I was emphatic \nabout two things: One, Republicans are not representing Wall Street. \nCandidly, when I look at the bill--and my friend from Delaware will \nactually agree with this--there is not much in this bill that is very \noffensive to Wall Street, to be candid.\n  This bill focuses on three topics. What I have said to my colleagues \nis this: Whenever we have regulations, the big guys get bigger, right? \nThe small guys are the ones who bear the brunt of regulation. What we \nare all trying to do, as Senator Hutchison laid out, on our side of the \naisle is make sure this legislation deals appropriately with community \nbankers and manufacturers in Iowa, Texas, and other places. In fact, \nthere are issues with the bill that we need to work out.\n  Candidly, to say that Republicans are representing Wall Street could \nnot be further from the truth. There is not much in this bill that is \nvery offensive to Wall Street, to be candid. I am not saying we should \ngo out of our way to be offensive, but anybody who looks at what this \nbill says would know there is not much in the bill that is that \noffensive. The fact is, we are putting derivatives on clearinghouses, \nwhich I hope happens. I think that is a good thing. I think we need to \nget as much of that done as possible, where if somebody's money is bad, \nthey have to put money up that day. It alleviates some of the systemic \nrisk. We deal with resolving a firm that fails. I think that is \nappropriate.\n  Hopefully, we will get consumer protection back into the middle of \nthe road. By the way, that is a section of the bill that, if it is not \nhandled properly, won't affect the JPMorgans and Citigroups and Banks \nof America. It will affect community bankers. All we are trying to do \non our side--and this is what I was emphatic about yesterday--is trying \nto make sure this bill is in balance. I think we can do that.\n  Look, there is not much in this bill that is particularly offensive \nto Wall Street. To say that those of us who want to get it right for \neverybody else in the country are defending Wall Street was way off the \nmark, not true.\n  Second, there are many things in the bill that are good. There are \nsome things that aren't so good that I think are being worked out right \nnow. That is typically what happens when we have a bipartisan \ndiscussion. Each side brings their particular strengths to a bill. We \nall represent different points of view and, when we work together, we \nend up with a good bill.\n  One of the things that troubles me--and I was very emphatic about it \nyesterday, and will be again today and tomorrow, as I have been for a \nlong time--is that this bill doesn't even deal with underwriting. At \nthe end of the day, at the bottom of this upside down pyramid, the \ncrisis began because we had a lot of mortgages in this country that \nshould have never been written in the first place. Then we had firms \nthat were way overleveraged that were doing that. Then we spread the \npain through $600 trillion in notional value around the world. It \nstarted with the fact that a lot of loans were written that should not \nhave been written. I don't think this bill even addresses that. I think \nthat is a little bit of an issue.\n  If we come to the floor with a template that deals with consumer \nprotection, systemic risk, and derivatives, I hope my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle will join in with many Members on this side of \nthe aisle to correct that. At the end of the day, if we continue to \nwrite loans that should not be written, and we continue to securitize \nthem, and if we continue to spread them around the world, we have not \ndone much in this legislation. So I have been emphatic about that, and \nI have wanted these two pieces of the legislation to balance as it \nrelates to the rest of the country, making sure our underwriting is \ndone appropriately. Do I believe those are things that are important? \nYes. Do I think we are going to address those? I hope so on the \nunderwriting, but I am not sure. I cannot tell if people are willing to \nmake sure that Americans across this country have to live in a \nsemidisciplined way as it relates to mortgages. I hope we get there \nbecause I think it is important.\n  In closing, in spite of all the rhetoric about bailouts and not \nbailouts and Wall Street and not Wall Street, I think what is happening \nin rooms and\n\n[[Page S2491]]\n\noffices around the Hill is that negotiations are taking place that will \nget us to a place where we at least have a template, a piece of \nlegislation that can be embraced in the beginning in a bipartisan way, \nand then what I hope will happen--I know my friend from Delaware will \nbe highly engaged in this, because he has been focused on this for a \nlong time--what I hope happens, after we get the base template \ntogether, is that we have a vigorous debate on the floor about where we \nneed to go from there. There are other pieces--I would consider them to \nbe central--but I am OK with legislation coming to the floor where we \nhave a balance between resolution, derivatives, and consumer \nprotection. Then let's go from there and have the kind of debate I \nthink our country would love to see us have in public, focused not on \nrhetoric--because we have plenty of substance on this issue--but on \nsubstance, and let's do something that will stand the test of time. I \nthink we are going to do that. As a matter of fact--and I know my time \nis up--I think this bill has the opportunity in the next few days, and \nonce we begin debate on the floor, which I hope will happen in a \nbipartisan way--I think this bill is potentially the beginning of us \nbeing able to function in an appropriate way in this body. That is what \nI hope happens.\n  That is why for weeks and months I have been saying that I think at \nthe end of the day we are going to end up with a bipartisan bill. I \nhope it has some important elements in it, such as the ones I \nmentioned, that will allow me to support it. Whether that happens--and \nI hope it happens--or not, I hope we have a vigorous debate and end up \nwith a good product.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/21/senate-section/article/S2491-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2491]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONCLUSION OF MORNING BUSINESS\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will proceed to executive session to consider the following \nnomination, which the clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Christopher Schroeder, \nof North Carolina, to be an Assistant Attorney General.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Delaware is recognized.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I rise today to express my support for \nChris Schroeder's nomination to be Assistant Attorney General for the \nOffice of Legal Policy in the Department of Justice.\n  Before I go any further, I want to state for the record that Chris \nSchroeder is a long-time colleague and great friend. Not only did we \nwork together for Senator Biden, but for the past 20 years we have co-\ntaught a course on the Congress at Duke Law School--a course that for \nmany of those years was cosponsored by the law school and the Stanford \nSchool of Public Policy.\n  Chris is currently the Charles S. Murphy Professor of Law and \nProfessor of Public Policy Studies at Duke, as well as director of \nDuke's Program in Public Law.\n  Chris was born in Springfield, OH, received his B.A. from Princeton \nUniversity, a master of Divinity from Yale, and his J.D. from the \nUniversity of California at Berkley, where he was editor in chief of \nthe California Law Review.\n  He is married to Katherine T. Bartlett, former dean and current A. \nKenneth Pye Professor at Duke Law School. Chris and Kate have three \nwonderful children.\n  During his legal career, Chris has excelled in private practice, \ngovernment service, and academics.\n  Following his graduation from law school, Chris practiced law in San \nFrancisco, gaining valuable experience in a wide variety of both State \nand Federal practice.\n  In 1979, he became a law professor at Duke, where he has been a \nrespected and prolific scholar, an invaluable administrator, and a \ncommitted and effective teacher.\n  He has authored and edited several books, including a leading \ncasebook on environmental law, ``Environmental Regulation: Law, Science \nand Policy,'' now in its sixth edition.\n  He also has published countless articles in law reviews and journals, \non an impressive range of topics, including environmental law, \nfederalism, Federal courts, executive and legislative power, and \nnational security.\n  Chris's teaching is just as broad and deep as his scholarship. Over \nthe course of his career, he has taught environmental law, \nconstitutional law, comparative constitutional law, administrative law, \ncivil liberties and national security, Federal policymaking, the \nCongress, government, business and public policy, an environmental \nlitigation clinic, toxic substances regulation, land use planning, \nwater law, philosophy of environmental protection, property, and civil \nprocedure.\n  Chris is a true renaissance man. I can personally attest to the \nquality of Chris's teaching, having co-taught with him for 20 years. \nHere in the Senate, we have many former students doing excellent staff \nwork on both sides of the aisle.\n  Chris has also contributed his legal and policy expertise to \npractical problems affecting the health and safety of the community. He \nserved on National Academy of Science and Institute of Medicine \ncommittees to evaluate the use of human intentional dosage studies by \nthe EPA and the adequacy of the U.S. drug safety system.\n  Duke has also recognized Chris's considerable administrative skills. \nIn addition to serving as co-chair of the Center for the Study of the \nCongress, with me, and the director of Program in Public Law, Chris has \nchaired the school's appointments committee, served on the dean's \nselection committee, and served as a member of the university's \njudicial board.\n  In the 1990s, while at Duke, he took several leaves of absence for \npositions in public service. As a result, he has considerable \nexperience in government, which will stand him in good stead at the \nOffice of Legal Policy.\n  He has served in several capacities in the Senate, including as \nspecial nominations counsel and then he was the No. 1 staffer as chief \ncounsel for the Judiciary Committee.\n  He also held numerous positions in the Department of Justice, \nincluding counselor to the Assistant Attorney General of the Office of \nLegal Counsel, Deputy Assistant Attorney General, and acting Assistant \nAttorney General.\n  In short, Chris Schroeder has the experience, the intellect, and the \njudgment necessary to be a superb leader of the Office of Legal Policy.\n  Just as important, he has the character and integrity to help the \nAttorney General continue to restore the public faith in the Department \nof Justice.\n  The Office of Legal Policy, OLP, has a wide range of important \nresponsibilities within the Department of Justice. Let me read from the \ndescription on the DOJ Web site:\n\n       The major functions of the Office of Legal Policy are to:\n       Develop strategies and programs to implement legislative, \n     programmatic and policy initiatives;\n       serve as a liaison to the Executive Office of the President \n     and other agencies on policy matters;\n       conduct policy reviews of legislation and other proposals \n     and support and coordinate Departmental efforts to advance \n     the Administration's legislative and policy agenda;\n       assure policy consistency and coordination of Departmental \n     initiatives, briefing materials and policy statements;\n       provide support and policy expertise in conjunction with \n     other components to implement effectively major departmental \n     and administration initiatives in the criminal and civil \n     justice areas; assist the President and the Attorney General \n     in filling all Article III and certain Article I judicial \n     vacancies; coordinate regulatory development and the review \n     of all proposed and final rules developed by all Department \n     components; To serve as liaison to the Office of Management \n     and Budget and other agencies on regulatory matters: Track \n     and coordinate departmental implementation of statutory \n     responsibilities and reporting requirements.\n\n  In sum, OLP is responsible for developing the high-priority policy \ninitiatives of the Department of Justice. The Assistant Attorney \nGeneral for OLP serves as the primary policy adviser to the Attorney \nGeneral. OLP is the place within the Department where critical long-\nterm planning gets done. OLP also handles special projects that \nimplicate the interests of multiple Department components and \ncoordinates the regulatory development and review of all\n\n[[Page S2492]]\n\nproposed and final rules developed by the Department. Finally, OLP \nadvises and assists the President and the Attorney General in the \nselection and confirmation of Federal judges.\n  Chris's extraordinary career and exemplary character render him \nuniquely qualified to lead OLP. As we saw from his confirmation \nhearings in the Judiciary Committee back in June, Chris has excellent \ncredentials and broad experience in law and government. He fully \nunderstands the special role at the Department of Justice and is deeply \ncommitted to the rule of law.\n  He has broad support from lawyers of all political and judicial \nphilosophies. Just as an example, A.B. Culvahouse, former White House \nCounsel to President Reagan, gave Chris a ringing endorsement, \ndescribing him as having ``the requisite maturity, experience, and \nconfidence to work constructively across institutional, interest group, \nand party lines to advance the public interest.''\n  Ken Starr was similarly enthusiastic in his endorsement, saying:\n\n       Chris has a particularly keen and nuanced sense of what the \n     founding generation was seeking brilliantly to achieve: \n     balanced government. From both practical experience and \n     engaged scholarship, he understands deeply the appropriate \n     role of the coordinate branches.\n\n  Before I conclude, I would like to give my colleagues a little better \nsense of Chris Schroeder outside of his professional life because I \nthink his model character is something we should all bear in mind as we \nconsider his nomination.\n  Chris has deep roots in the Durham, NC, community. He and his wife \nKate have been members of the Pilgrim United Church of Christ for 30 \nyears. This is the church in which Kate and Chris have raised their \nthree children, and it has been an important part of their family life. \nChris has been a member of every elected board or committee of his \nchurch. He has been the chairman of the fellowship committee several \ntimes--a job he cherishes because of the simple pleasures that come \nfrom providing good meals and hospitality at church events of every \ndescription. Chris has also taught Sunday school for over 20 years at \nPilgrim, most often a Bible study class.\n  Chris has also been a member of the board of directors of the Meals \non Wheels program in Durham which supplies lunches to elderly and shut-\nin members of the Durham community. Besides having served in a \nleadership position for Meals on Wheels, Chris and colleagues from the \nDuke University faculty drive one of the Meals on Wheels routes every \nFriday. They have been doing this for more than 20 years.\n  Chris and his children have also been active in the CROP Walk, an \nannual event in Durham and many other cities around the country that \nraises funds for local as well as international food programs. Chris is \nproud of the fact that Pilgrim United Church of Christ is regularly \namong the leaders among churches its size in raising funds in the CROP \nWalk.\n  In selecting Chris Schroeder, the President has chosen wisely. Based \non our long association, I know him to have a piercing intellect, \nimpeccable judgment, and unparalleled integrity. I am proud to call him \nmy friend. I urge my colleagues to confirm him without delay.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that any time in a quorum call \nduring the debate on the Schroeder nomination be charged equally to \nboth sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that 5 minutes be \nset aside for the chairman during the debate.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak as in \nmorning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Financial Regulatory Reform\n\n  Mr. BURRIS. Mr. President, in early 1933, just after Franklin \nRoosevelt was sworn in as President, the Great Depression was at its \nworst. The American economy had been shaken to its core. Financial \ninstitutions had closed, people's life savings had evaporated, and no \none knew where to turn. That is when the unthinkable happened: Much of \nthe American commercial banking system collapsed.\n  President Roosevelt and his colleagues in the House and Senate sprang \ninto action. Congressman Henry Steagall and Senator Carter Glass, both \nDemocrats, worked with the President to write sweeping reform \nlegislation. They set out to get the economy back on the road to \nrecovery. The resulting law--known as the Glass-Steagall Act of 1934--\nhelped to lay the foundation for sensible bank regulation in this \ncountry. It would come to define America's financial landscape in the \ndecades that followed the Depression.\n  Mr. President, it is in this spirit that I ask my colleagues to join \nme today in supporting major financial reform and making sure that the \nVolcker rule is included in our financial legislation. If we pass the \nbill that has been introduced by Senator Dodd, we can help prevent \nanother economic crisis and reinstate some of the basic protections \nincluded in Glass-Steagall.\n  Almost 80 years ago, this legislation established the FDIC, which \nstill insures bank deposits--and it drew a sharp distinction between \ncommercial banks and investment banks. In the wake of economic \ncollapse, Congress recognized that these dueling roles often came with \nmassive conflicts of interest. In some cases, this resulted in risky \nbehavior. In others, fraud.\n  So Glass and Steagall designed their bill to set up a barrier between \ncommercial banks and investment banks. The law prevented these two \nactivities from mixing and kept financial professionals honest and \naccountable. For much of the next half century--as our economy \nrecovered from the Great Depression and prosperity returned to \nAmerica--the system worked just as it was intended.\n  As a former banker, I can personally speak to the significance of the \nGlass-Steagall Act in helping to keep our financial system on an even \nkeel. This important law was essential to the stability of our \neconomy--right up to the moment when my Republican friends repealed \nit--a little more than a decade ago.\n  In 1999, the Republican Congress decided there was no longer a need \nto keep commercial and investment banks separate, so they passed a bill \nthat rolled back key portions of the Glass-Steagall Act. Unfortunately, \nPresident Clinton signed it into law, and with the stroke of a pen, the \nwalls between commercial banks and investment banks were torn down.\n  Almost overnight, commercial institutions started to move into this \nfresh territory. They started to underwrite CDOs and mortgage-backed \nsecurities. Then they began to trade them. Commercial lenders even \ncreated new investment vehicles, which bought these very same \nsecurities. Without the Glass-Steagall Act, it was a free-for-all.\n  As soon as the regulations were removed, big banks swooped in without \nregard to responsible lending practices. Conflicts of interest sprang \nup everywhere. Fraud was allegedly committed by some of our largest and \nmost respected institutions. Then, 2 years ago, our economy went into a \nmassive downward spiral--a great recession from which we are still \ntrying to recover.\n  The repeal of Glass-Steagall certainly did not cause this financial \ncrisis on its own. But many believe it was a contributing factor, and \nunless we can take action to close this regulatory gap, the absence of \nGlass-Steagall could expose our economy to major systemic risk in the \nfuture.\n  So, today, as the Senate stands on the verge of considering major \nfinancial reform, I would urge my colleagues to reinstate some of these \nprotections. We must prevent big banks from engaging in these \nirresponsible practices ever again. That is why I am proud to support \nthe Volcker rule, which my friend, Senator Dodd, has included in his \nfinancial reform bill.\n\n[[Page S2493]]\n\n  This provision will prevent traditional banks from making private \nequity investments. It will stop them from running hedge funds. It will \nhelp keep them from placing bets on the market. As a key part of \nSenator Dodd's bill, the Volcker rule will essentially serve as a \nmodernized version of the Glass-Steagall Act.\n  It would stop short of reinstating the old law of 1933, but it would \nhelp to prevent fraud, discourage conflicts of interest, and keep large \nbanks from engaging in reckless behavior. It would also allow us to \nhelp regulate mergers among our biggest banks so we can prevent the \nmarket from becoming too concentrated or incurring systemic risk.\n  Mr. President, I believe each of these key components is a necessary \npart of any financial reform bill. That is why I am proud to join \nSenator Dodd, as well as President Obama, in supporting the Volcker \nrule. Colleagues, let's learn from the events of history. Let's impose \nfair and reasonable regulations so a handful of banks would not be able \nto undermine the American economy with a few foolish decisions. Let's \npass a financial reform bill that includes the Volcker rule.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Feingold and Mr. Leahy are printed in today's \nRecord under ``Morning Business.'')\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, today the Senate will finally confirm \nProfessor Chris Schroeder to lead the Office of Legal Policy at the \nDepartment of Justice. I say ``finally'' because he was nominated by \nPresident Obama nearly 11 months ago. Professor Schroeder was first \nnominated to this position on June 4, 2009. He appeared before the \nSenate Judiciary Committee last June. He was reported favorably last \nJuly, a year ago, without dissent from both Republican and Democrat \nmembers on the committee. But then he sat on the Executive Calendar for \n5 months, blocked by mysterious holds from the Republican side. Then, \nas the last session drew to a close, Republican Senators objected to \ncarrying over Professor Schroeder's nomination into the new session, so \nit had to be sent back to the White House. The President had to \nrenominate him. The President did that, to his credit. His nomination \nwas reconsidered, reported favorably by the Judiciary Committee by a \nrollcall vote, with a majority of the Republicans voting for him. That \nwas nearly three months ago.\n  Professor Schroeder is a scholar and public servant who has served \nwith distinction on the staff of the Senate Judiciary Committee and in \nthe Justice Department and has support across the political spectrum. \nThe Judiciary Committee has received letters of support for Professor \nSchroeder's nomination from Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr., former White \nHouse Counsel to President Ronald Reagan; Ken Starr, former Solicitor \nGeneral under former President George H.W. Bush; 11 former high-ranking \nofficials at the Justice Department; and Dean David F. Levi of Duke Law \nSchool, where Professor Schroeder has taught for many years.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have those letters \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n Letters of Support for the Nomination of Christopher Schroeder To Be \n           Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Policy\n\n                         (As of April 21, 2009)\n\n\n                  Current and Former Public Officials\n\n       Arthur B.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on the Judiciary, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy and Senator Sessions: I write to \n     endorse the nomination of Christopher H. Schroeder of North \n     Carolina to serve as Assistant Attorney General for the \n     Office of Legal Policy.\n       I am sure the Committee on the Judiciary is well aware of \n     Chris Schroeder's substantial record of academic \n     accomplishment as a chaired professor at Duke Law School and \n     of his distinguished public service with the Department of \n     Justice Office of Legal Counsel and with the Senate Judiciary \n     Committee. Perhaps less well known is Chris Schroeder's part-\n     time private practice association with our law firm, \n     O'Melveny & Myers, from January 2002 to the present, the last \n     four years in an ``of counsel'' position. As Chair of the \n     Firm, I can attest Chris has provided exemplary legal \n     services to the Firm and its clients, while working on highly \n     complex legal matters. His capacity for keen analysis, his \n     great maturity and judgment, and his ability to work in a \n     constructive and purposeful way with others, have impressed \n     both his colleagues and our clients.\n       Chris Schroeder's experience as counsel to our firm adds \n     yet another dimension to his qualifications for office, \n     making Chris one of the rare individuals who has excelled in \n     academic law, in public service to both the legislative and \n     executive branches of the national government, and in private \n     practice. This diversity of experience and perspective will \n     serve the Justice Department and the country well if Chris is \n     confirmed as head of the Office of Legal Policy.\n       From my time as White House Counsel to President Reagan \n     until now, I know how important it is to have senior Justice \n     Department office holders who not only are first-rate \n     lawyers, but also have the requisite maturity, experience and \n     confidence to work constructively across institutional, \n     interest group and party lines to advance the public \n     interest. I believe that Chris Schroeder will be one of those \n     leaders. I am pleased to endorse his nomination.\n           Yours very truly,\n                                        Arthur B. Culvahouse, Jr.,\n     Chair.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    June 23, 2009.\n     Re Nomination of Christopher Schroeder to serve as Assistant \n         Attorney General.\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Leahy, Ranking Member Sessions, and Members \n     of the Senate Judiciary Committee: We are all former \n     Department of Justice officials who worked closely with Chris \n     Schroeder when he served as a Deputy Assistant Attorney \n     General, and later Acting Assistant Attorney General, in the \n     Office of Legal Counsel in the 1990s. Many of us have also \n     known and worked with Chris in a variety of other settings. \n     Based on our broad range of experiences, we all offer our \n     enthusiastic support for Chris' nomination to serve as the \n     Assistant Attorney General for the Office of Legal Policy.\n       Chris brings together a broad range of talents, experience \n     and perspective that make him an ideal candidate to lead the \n     Office of Legal Policy. First, Chris is a superb lawyer. He \n     is a distinguished scholar, with an expertise in public law \n     and policy. He has taught classes on constitutional and \n     administrative law, on civil liberties and national security, \n     and on the Congress. As acting head of the Office of Legal \n     Counsel, he grappled with some of the most difficult legal \n     issues in the executive branch and, in the course of doing \n     so, earned the broad respect of others throughout the \n     government.\n       Chris would also bring to the job extensive knowledge of \n     the workings of the Department of Justice, and a deep respect \n     for the Department as an institution. Equally importantly, \n     Chris has worked extensively with other offices throughout \n     the government, and he has a clear understanding of the \n     interagency process. As a result, Chris would know how to \n     ensure that Department of Justice policy judgments are fully \n     informed by others in the executive branch.\n       Similarly, Chris also understands how the legislative \n     process works. He would be well positioned to ensure that the \n     Department's policy judgments are consistent with the laws \n     Congress enacts and that they are informed by the judgment \n     and experience of\n\n[[Page S2494]]\n\n     those in the legislative branch. Chris served as chief \n     counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, and he understands \n     how important it is to work effectively with Members of \n     Congress on both sides of the aisle in formulating effective \n     public policy.\n       In addition, Chris would bring to the job the perspective \n     of a lawyer who has engaged in the private practice of law. \n     As a result, he would also understand how Department of \n     Justice policy might affect the legal profession, and he has \n     the experience to understand the practical implications of \n     those policy decisions.\n       Finally, and most importantly, Chris is a balanced, \n     fundamentally fair, and honest person. He has excellent \n     judgment and a compelling sense of what is right. All of us \n     have worked with Chris, and we can all affirm that he is a \n     colleague of the highest order.\n       In short, Chris would bring to the job the perfect mix of \n     experience: he is a distinguished scholar; he has worked in \n     the Department of Justice, for the Congress, and in private \n     practice; and he has the integrity and judgment the job \n     demands. For all of these reasons, we believe that Chris is \n     superbly well-qualified to serve as the Assistant Attorney \n     General for the Office of Legal Policy.\n           Respectfully,\n         Eleanor D. Acheson (former Assistant Attorney General for \n           the Office for Policy Development), Walter E. Dellinger \n           III (former Assistant Attorney General for the Office \n           of Legal Counsel; former Acting Solicitor General), \n           Jamie S.

Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Sessions: It is my privilege \n     to endorse, and heartily so, the nomination of Christopher \n     Schroeder to be Assistant Attorney General for the Office of \n     Legal Policy. Having known Chris for many years, I know him \n     not only to be a distinguished professor at my beloved alma \n     mater, but--as befits his fine reputation--I also know him to \n     be a thoughtful and measured person. He has sound judgment. \n     Indeed, Chris is quite well known, and again rightly so, for \n     his balanced, careful writing.\n       Equally relevant, Chris served with great distinction in \n     the Department of Justice in the highly important Office of \n     Legal Counsel. He has thus been fully engaged in fashioning \n     the advice and counsel that is foundational to our system of \n     the rule of law. Having also served in the Article I branch, \n     Chris has a particularly keen and nuanced sense of what the \n     Founding generation was seeking brilliantly to achieve: \n     balanced government. From both practical experience and \n     engaged scholarship, he understands, deeply, the appropriate \n     role of the co-ordinate branches.\n       In short, based on both his personal character and \n     professional qualifications, I enthusiastically recommend him \n     to you for confirmation to this very important role at the \n     Justice Department.\n           Yours sincerely,\n     Kenneth W. Starr,\n       Duane and Kelly Roberts Dean and Professor of Law.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                Duke University School of Law,\n\n                                        Durham, NC, June 19, 2009.\n     Hon. Patrick J. Leahy,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Jeff Sessions,\n     U.S. Senate, Russell Senate Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Leahy and Senator Sessions: I am the Dean of \n     Duke Law School. Previously I was U.S. Attorney in the \n     Eastern District of California (1986-1990) and then a United \n     States District Judge in the same district (1990-2007). I am \n     writing in my personal capacity to endorse the nomination of \n     Christopher Schroeder to be Assistant Attorney General for \n     the Office of Legal Policy.\n       Professor Schroeder is currently a distinguished member of \n     the Duke Law School faculty, and the Charles S. Murphy \n     Professor of Law. His scholarship is well recognized across a \n     range of subject areas, including constitutional law, \n     administrative, and environmental law. He is the author of \n     dozens of articles and books in these fields, and has the \n     reputation of a fair, thoughtful teacher who respects all \n     points of view.\n       Professor Schroeder also directs Duke Law School's Program \n     in Public Law. This Program in Public Law exposes law \n     students to the opportunities and value of public service as \n     part of their professional careers, through speaker series, \n     workshops, conferences and other programs. The Program \n     engages topics that are newsworthy and often controversial, \n     in order to provide students an informed basis for evaluating \n     the public debate about them. I have participated in a number \n     of events sponsored by the Program and have been impressed \n     both with the quality of Professor Schroeder's own \n     contributions, and with the even-handedness of points of view \n     that he consistently brings to the programming. His \n     leadership of this program demonstrates, again, a balanced, \n     fair-minded person who respects, and is respected by, people \n     from many different backgrounds and perspectives. Professor \n     Schroeder is not an ideologue.\n       Professor Schroeder also has considerable government \n     experience both in the Department of Justice and in the \n     United States Senate. In the Department of Justice, he has \n     served in the Office of Legal Counsel, including as its \n     Acting Assistant Attorney General. Through that experience he \n     has gained knowledge of the organization and operation of the \n     Department, as well as of many of the policy issues that \n     regularly face the Department of Justice. His prior work at \n     Justice provides valuable preparation for the leadership \n     position to which he has been nominated. In the United States \n     Senate, he has served as Chief Counsel to the Senate \n     Judiciary Committee and in several other capacities as well. \n     I know from my conversations with him that he appreciates the \n     responsibilities of the Senate and the Congress, and \n     possesses a genuine respect for the role of the legislative \n     branch in our constitutional system. This orientation, too, \n     will be an asset in leading the Office of Legal Policy, which \n     often works closely with members of Congress in developing \n     policy initiatives.\n       Professor Schroeder possesses the intellect, skill, \n     training, reliability, and disposition to make him an \n     effective and dynamic director of the Office of Legal Policy. \n     He is someone in whom the members of the Senate and the \n     American people can be confident. He has distinguished \n     himself in every endeavor that he has undertaken. I am \n     certain that he will do so as the AAG for the Office of Legal \n     Policy. I highly recommend him for this position.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    David F. Levi.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, Chris Schroeder is well known to many of \nus in the Senate. He has served in a number of positions, including \nchief counsel for the Judiciary Committee when the chairman was then-\nSenator Joe Biden. He spent years in private practice and as a \nprofessor, including for the last 10 years as director for the Program \nin Public Law at Duke University Law School. He has also served in a \nnumber of high-ranking positions at the Justice Department making him \nextraordinarily well prepared for the position to which he has been \nnominated. In fact, in my nearly 36 years here, it is hard to think of \nsomebody more well qualified.\n  Look what he has done. He graduated from Princeton University, \nreceived his master of divinity from Yale Divinity School before \nearning his law degree from the University of California at Berkeley \nBoalt Hall in 1974. There is no question that he is well qualified to \nrun the Office of Legal Policy.\n  For somebody who is going to be confirmed easily, it shouldn't be \nnecessary for the majority leader to have to file cloture in order to \nend the Republican filibuster. The Senate should be able to at least \nhave an up-or-down vote on Professor Schroeder's nomination. What has \nthis place come to when we have filibusters on routine nominations such \nas this?\n  I remember, when I first came here, probably the biggest nomination \nwe had before a heavily Democratic-controlled Senate was a nomination \nby a conservative Republican President, Gerald Ford, for the U.S. \nSupreme Court. President Ford nominated a well respected Republican \nfrom Chicago seen as a conservative; John Paul Stevens. We took that \nnomination from the Republican President 2\\1/2\\ weeks after that \nnomination arrived here. We all voted for John Paul Stevens to be \nconfirmed for the Supreme Court, including myself. In fact, I am one of \nonly three Senators still here who voted, with Senator Inouye and \nSenator Byrd being the other two.\n  What have we come to when we have a nominee who is as extraordinarily \nwell qualified as Professor Schroeder, who is going to be confirmed, \nbut he has to get past a Republican filibuster.\n  The 11 months it has taken us to consider this nomination is a far \ncry, incidentally, from the way the Democrats\n\n[[Page S2495]]\n\ntreated President Bush's nomination to run the Office of Legal Policy. \nA Democratic majority confirmed President Bush's first nominee to head \nthat division, Viet Dinh, by a vote of 96 to 1 only 1 month after he \nwas nominated and only 1 week after his nomination was reported by the \ncommittee. The 3 nominees of that office who succeeded Mr. Dinh--Daniel \nBryant, Rachel Brand, and Elisabeth Cook--were each confirmed by a \nvoice vote in a far shorter time than Professor Schroeder's nomination \nhas been pending. None of these nominations were returned to the \nPresident without explanation. None of them required cloture to be \nfiled before being considered.\n  What is going on when a Republican President is treated with fairness \nbut a Democratic President, President Obama, is treated this way? It \nmakes me think of what one of the leaders of the Republican Party said \nlast year: I want this President to fail. If you have an objection to a \nnomination, vote against it, but none of us should want the President \nof the United States to fail because if the President fails, America \nfails and we all suffer, Republicans and Democrats alike. We have to \nget out of this mindset that if President Obama is for something, \neverybody has to find ways to block it.\n  I agree with Senator Franken's observation on the Senate floor \nearlier this week concerning the Schroeder nomination. He remarked that \nperhaps Republicans were blocking this nomination because Professor \nSchroeder has been nominated to lead the office that vets potential \njudicial nominees. Well, he is right, as is Senator Kaufman, who has \nspoken so eloquently on behalf of Professor Schroeder today.\n  To deflect criticism for Republican delays and obstruction of \njudicial nominations that have left 25 judicial nominations languishing \non the Executive Calendar, Senate Republicans have tried to place the \nblame on the administration for sending too few nominees to the Senate. \nBut these same Republicans have held up Professor Schroeder's \nnomination to lead the division of the Justice Department involved with \nreviewing and preparing judicial nominations for nearly a year. In \nother words, they stopped the person who is supposed to do the initial \nreview on judicial nominations and then said: Oh, my goodness, \nPresident Obama is not sending up enough nominations. Come on. Come on. \nThis is like a burglar saying: I should be excused for burglarizing \nthis warehouse because you had such nice things in the warehouse to \nsteal. It is your fault for having nice things to steal. How can you \nblame me for stealing them? What they are saying is: It is President \nObama's fault for not moving through judges who have to be vetted by \nsomebody we are blocking from vetting them.\n  I know the Department and the administration would be grateful to \nhave Professor Schroeder help them prepare judicial nominations. He has \nshown that he has a deep understanding of the proper role of a judge \ntasked with interpreting the Constitution. As he emphasized in a \nresponse to a question from Senator Sessions:\n\n       Any interpretation of the Constitution must begin with the \n     document's text, history, structure, and purpose, as well as \n     judicial precedent . . . [A] fundamental qualification for \n     anyone being considered for a judicial appointment is that he \n     or she understand the Constitution has binding force that \n     must be applied faithfully in cases that come before any \n     court, independent of his or her own policy or preferences.\n\n  So, again, I thank Senator Kaufman. He is one of the most valued \nmembers of the Judiciary Committee and somebody I am going to miss \nsorely when he retires this year. I thank him for his dogged efforts in \nsupport of Professor Schroeder's nomination and for his assistance in \nmanaging the debate so well today.\n  I congratulate Professor Schroeder and his family on his \nconfirmation. I have every confidence he will be an effective and \ndevoted public servant.\n  I might note--I see the distinguished Senator from North Carolina, \nwho is presiding over the Senate today. Among the 25 judicial nominees \nstalled before a final Senate vote, there were two courts of appeal \nnominees for North Carolina. I know the distinguished Presiding Officer \ntook a totally nonpartisan attitude toward recommending these judges \nand has worked extraordinarily hard, and I hope Judge Wynn and Judge \nDiaz will soon be allowed by Senate Republicans to be considered and \nvoted on. They are supported by both the distinguished Presiding \nOfficer, Senator Hagan, and the other distinguished Senator from North \nCarolina, Senator Burr. So they are supported by a Democrat and a \nRepublican.\n  Incidentally, Judge Wynn was reported out of the committee 18 to 1. \nMost of us would love to win elections by that kind of a margin. Judge \nDiaz was reported unanimously 3 months ago.\n  So let's stop this unprecedented kind of stalling and clear these 25 \njudicial nominees.\n  I see nobody else seeking recognition.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:15 p.m. today, the \nSenate proceed to vote on confirmation of the nomination of Christopher \nSchroeder, with the time until then equally divided and controlled as \npreviously ordered; further, that any other provisions of the previous \norder with respect to the nomination remain in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I ask to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Florida is recognized.\n\n\n                      Financial Regulatory Reform\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. Madam President, I come to the floor of the Senate today \nto talk about the issue of financial regulatory reform, an issue that \nis consuming the good efforts and time of many of our colleagues in the \nSenate. It is an issue that is very important to the future economic \nhealth and viability of this country.\n  As we go about our lives, even in this difficult economy, I think it \nis easy to forget how bad things were just a couple of years ago, how \nbad things were in the fall of 2008. It is important for us to remember \nthe situation that we were put in, where our stock market fell \nprecipitously, where our financial institutions were on the verge of \ncollapse, where the Congress was forced to step in to give billions of \ndollars of taxpayer money to save the financial institutions, to avoid \nwhat was perceived at the time to be a situation as dire as that which \nhappened in the late 1920s when the Great Depression started.\n  It is important for us to remember that terrible, challenging time as \nwe evaluate what we should do now to prevent that time from happening \nagain. We should be looking back to the causes of that crisis in order \nto figure out the solutions we should impose today.\n  There has been good work done among Members of both sides of the \naisle. Senators Dodd, Shelby, Corker, and others on the Banking and \nFinance Committee have been working overtime to come forward with a \npiece of legislation that will help put us in a situation where we will \nno longer have companies too big to fail which could have us going back \nto the American taxpayer to bail out Wall Street to save our financial \ninstitutions. We should never be put in that position again, so I \ncommend the work that is being done. I am hopeful we will have a \nbipartisan product.\n  There are pieces of this legislation as it is currently constructed \nwhich give me concern; that they would cause a bailout to again be a \nsituation that the Congress has to address gives me great concern. \nThere is particular legislation as part of this package which would set \nup a fund of $50 billion with certain companies designated as too big \nto fail. I think that is a wrong strategy. I think, therefore, we are \nguaranteeing future bailouts. We are saying to these companies: You are \ntoo big to fail. The Federal Government is giving you its stamp of \napproval. We will come in and rescue you with taxpayer dollars--or \nshareholder dollars, for that case.\n  I think that creates the wrong incentive. I think it promotes risky \nbehavior\n\n[[Page S2496]]\n\nand at the same time creates an unfair playing field for those \ninstitutions which have played by the rules, which have had sound \nfinancial management. We should not forget in this debate and \ndiscussion that the way business is supposed to work in this country is \nyou put together a venture to sell a product or a service. If you \nsucceed, you have a profit. If you fail, you go out of business. The \nfailures of the American economic system are in many ways just as \nimportant as the successes.\n  Where would we be if technologies that proved to be failures were \nsubsidized and preventing better technologies from coming forward? That \ndoesn't make any sense for consumers. It doesn't make any sense for the \nAmerican way of life. We need to make sure businesses can fail if they \ndo not succeed.\n  We have a system of bankruptcy in this country that is admired around \nthe world that, in an orderly way, takes companies into its procedures \nand either reorganizes them or liquidates them. That should be the way \nthe process works. We do not want to continue to support bad businesses \nwith bad practices and bad ideas. We want the good businesses to \nsucceed, and we certainly do not want to create a playing field where \nthe businesses that run the right way are at a disadvantage. So I have \nproblems with that portion of the bill.\n  There are other portions of the bill with which I have trouble. \nCertainly, we should not be in a situation of more taxpayer bailouts or \neven shareholder bailouts.\n  I wish to talk today about the causes of the prior crisis and what \nthis bill needs to do to make sure that crisis does not happen again. \nIf we go back to 2007-2008, we can see in hindsight what led to this \nfinancial meltdown. In a State such as mine, Florida, we have been \nparticularly impacted by the meltdown that occurred because the basis \nof this meltdown was residential property and the mortgages that went \nalong with that property.\n  In a State such as mine, in Florida, we have been very fortunate over \nthe past 30 years or so because as we have had slowdowns in our real \nestate economy--which is a main driver of the economy in Florida, \nconstruction of real estate--other parts of the market have been able \nto step in and succeed when real estate construction fell back. Never \nbefore, until this most recent crisis, was the financial market wedded \nwith the real estate market.\n  Let's look back at the circumstances that occurred. Sometime during \nthe early 2000s, a process started whereby banks and lending \ninstitutions would give mortgages to people who did not have the \nability, in all honesty, to afford the home they were purchasing. There \nwas a type of loan in Florida, and I am sure in other parts of the \ncountry, called the Ninja loan--no income, no job. Why would any \nlending institution give you a loan if you were not creditworthy in \norder to obtain that loan.\n  I had the opportunity to purchase my first home back in 1995. When I \ndid, I could only put down 15 percent. My bank required me to get \nmortgage insurance in order to make it to the 20 percent deposit \nrequirement. That was the way it was in this country. There was a time \nwhen you tried to obtain a mortgage where the bank was very vested in \nyou being able to pay because they were holding the note.\n  Sometime in the early 2000s, the process started whereby mortgage \nbrokers and banks could sell off your mortgage into the marketplace \nbecause we started to securitize mortgages, make mortgages trading \ninstruments. When that happened and when now the mortgage broker or the \nbank that generates a fee from the writing of the mortgage of itself \ncan take that mortgage and send it off, sell it off to somebody else, \nwe created a bad incentive.\n  The bad incentive was, I don't care about the creditworthiness of the \nperson to whom I am loaning the money because I no longer have to hold \nthe mortgage. So the creation of these instruments, these securitized \ninstruments to trade mortgages created that bad incentive, and all of a \nsudden mortgages were being written to people who otherwise did not \nhave the credit and didn't have the likelihood of repaying them.\n  What did that do? Easier money meant prices became inflated. Most \nfolks in Florida and all around this country did not look at the price \nof the home they were purchasing, they looked at their monthly payment. \nInterest rates were extremely low, money was easy to get, a downpayment \nwas no longer a requirement. This helped the building business, the \nhome construction business to take off--more homes, more mortgages.\n  The financial markets on Wall Street found that putting together \nthese mortgage-backed securities, these large trading instruments with \nthousands, tens of thousands of mortgages, was very profitable for \nthem. They could trade these back and forth and they, too, could \nreceive a commission on the sale of these products. That made them \nmoney. Guess what. They were not responsible if they went under either.\n  In order for all of this to work, someone had to vouch for the \nworthiness of these large mortgage-backed securities, these trading \ninstruments of mortgages. Wall Street looked, as it always has looked, \nto these rating agencies such as S, Moody's, Fitch--and guess what. \nThey came along and allegedly looked at these products and stamped them \nas being AAA, the highest level of creditworthiness, very unlikely to \nhave any problems with them where the person who purchased some kind of \ninstrument on them would not get paid let alone lose their investment.\n  The challenge was that the rating agencies did not understand the \nmortgages that were in these products. They didn't do the due \ndiligence, and we protect them by Federal law from any recourse. They \ndidn't have any skin in the game either.\n\n  So now we have the borrower with no skin in the game because they \ndidn't have to put anything down on their house--they are basically \nrenting. We have the bank and mortgage broker with no skin in the game \nbecause they don't have to hold the mortgage on their books. We have \nthe financial firms with no skin in the game because they are just \ntrading these large securitized instruments, and worse still they \ncreate what they call synthetic agreements where you do not have to \nhold any of these mortgages yourself. You are just creating sort of a \nshadow trading instrument that trades off of the same underlying \nmortgage when, in fact, it doesn't hold them. It is like me betting \nthat your house will burn down without me having an interest in your \nhouse.\n  We created this long chain of people in the marketplace, from the \nborrower to the mortgage broker bank to the financial institution to \nthe rating agency, who had no skin in the game on these transactions. \nThe sale of these market-backed securities, and later the credit \ndefault swaps which was the insurance policies against them, created \nhuge fees for the financial firms.\n  We did, for the first time in this history, something we had never \ndone before. We put the prime asset of most Americans--their home--in \nplay on Wall Street. Year after year the demand for these mortgages \ndrove the excess. More and more, poorer and poorer mortgages went to \nfeed the beast on Wall Street. At the end of the day, the housing \nmarket couldn't sustain itself, and when the mortgages started to fail, \nwhen people started to not be able to make their payments, when the \nincrease in property prices could not increase any more because gravity \naffects everything after a while, the whole system in 2007 and then \n2008 began to fall apart, and we found out that companies such as AIG \nwere all entangled in buying and selling insurance products on these \nproducts; that they had huge exposures, that Wall Street banks had $5, \n$10, $15 billion or more in exposure and some of the biggest \ninstitutions that we know from Wall Street failed--at first bought up \nby other companies and then ultimately bailed out by you, the taxpayer. \nI go through this history and explain it in the best way I know how. It \nis a very complicated topic, because what we do in this reform bill has \nto address the skin-in-the-game problem. So to my friends, Senator \nDodd, Senator Shelby, Senator Corker, Senator Warner, and others, who \nare in the midst of negotiating the bill that will come to this floor, \nI have made three suggestions as to what we need to do to make sure we \ndo not replicate this problem again.\n\n[[Page S2497]]\n\n  First, these rating agencies, which are captive to the investment \nbanks whose products they rate, can no longer be held harmless to not \ndo the due diligence required and stamp AAA on products they do not \ninvestigate and do not understand. But for these rating agencies, this \ncrisis probably would not have happened. But for them, but for the \nimprimatur of their AAA stamp, people would not have slept well at \nnight buying a product they did not understand. It is like Consumer \nReports. Consumer Reports says, this is a great car. It is safe. You as \na consumer do not understand the modern workings of a car with all of \nits computer technology, but you buy Consumer Reports, and you read it. \nIt tells you this is the safest car in America, so you feel safe \nputting your wife and your kids in that car.\n  But you did not know under this circumstance that the very rating \nagencies that were rating these products, one, were not doing any due \ndiligence, and, two, were being paid by the investment banks whose \nproducts they were rating. That has got to change.\n  Suggestion No. 2. In terms of residential mortgage underwriting, if a \nbroker or bank is going to write some exotic-type mortgage where there \nis little to nothing down, then they should be required to maintain a \nportion of those mortgages on their books. Let them bear the risk. Do \nnot let the bank shift it off so it can become securitized in the \nmarketplace, entangle all of our financial institutions, and put us, \nthe taxpayer, at risk. If we make those banks hold some of these \nnontraditional mortgages, I guarantee you they will do a better job of \nmaking sure the people they are lending money to are good creditworthy \ninvestments for them.\n  The third suggestion is this: The issuers of securitization, \nincluding these synthetic--which basically means manufactured, not \nreal--collateralized debt obligations also should be required to retain \na substantial stake of the instruments they market. They have to have \nskin in the game as well, so that if these instruments fail, they are \ngoing to lose money.\n  We have got to understand, not only in this discussion but throughout \nthe problems we address, the incentives we are creating. We cannot have \na financial market system whereby there is no exposure to me in any \npart of the equation, because that is going to encourage bad behavior. \nIt is the same reason why we got it wrong on health care reform. \nBecause as long as we have third-party payers, Medicare and Medicaid \ninsurance companies, we, the consumers, have little interest in the \ncost we are paying. Therefore, costs do not go down.\n  It is the same brewing problem we are going to have when a recent \nstatistic says that 47 percent of Americans do not pay taxes. If 47 \npercent of Americans do not pay taxes, do they actually care if the \nU.S. Government does a good job of spending money effectively and \nefficiently? The incentive is for them not to care, because it is not \ntheir money.\n  We have got to address this issue today in the financial markets, and \ntomorrow in all of the legislation we pass.\n  Americans, banks, consumers, in all forms, whether we are buying \nhealth care services or financial products, whether we are buying a \nhome or trading on Wall Street, we have to have skin in the game, or we \ncreate bad incentives that harm our country.\n  With that, I conclude my remarks and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to speak \nfor up to 5 minutes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                              Derivatives\n\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I know the Democrats are a bit shorter than that \nin time. If a Republican comes, I will yield the floor more quickly if \nthey ask.\n  I only have a couple of things I want to say. I just came earlier \nfrom the Agriculture Committee meeting where we passed legislation, \nbipartisanly, to regulate derivatives. It was a major step in financial \nreform. The discussion was vigorous, the discussion was not \ncontentious, but there was a good bit of disagreement. But in the end, \nthe committee voted bipartisanly for stronger derivative legislation. \nIt will provide financial stability by requiring banks to put capital \nbehind their trades. It will use transparency and accountability to \nprevent Wall Street banks from taking advantage of their business \ncustomers. It will reduce speculation that fuels bubbles in markets \nsuch as natural gas and mortgages.\n  We understand derivatives can be used responsibly by businesses to \nhedge commercial risk. But commercial businesses make up a relatively \nsmall part of the derivatives business. It used to make up a much \nlarger part. A lot of the synthetics, CDOs, and other derivatives have \nbecome way more commonplace and, parenthetically but importantly, put \nus in the position that we are in as a nation in our economy.\n  I commend Senator Lincoln for her advocacy and leadership in voting \nout a strong derivatives regulation. The reason this is so important is \nwe know what happened because of Wall Street excess. What happened is \nsome homeowners in Bryan, OH, lost their homes. We know that retirees \nin Ravenna, OH, lost a good bit of their wealth. We know that workers \nin Dayton, OH, lost their jobs. That is repeated in Charlotte, and \nRaleigh, and Asheville, NC. It is true in Marietta and Cleveland and \nBedford, OH, that because of Wall Street excesses, too many people lost \ntheir homes, lost their wealth, lost their retirement, lost their jobs.\n  This legislation today, coupled with Senator Dodd's legislation \ncoming out of Banking, was bipartisanly passed. It will move us in the \nright direction. It was bipartisan but not a compromise of Wall Street. \nWhen bipartisanship means bring Wall Street to the table to write the \nlegislation, that is not what the American people want. What \nbipartisanship means is that our committee writes strong language and \nRepublicans and Democrats, at least one Republican and Democrats, come \ntogether. That is what we ought to do. That is the direction we should \ngo. That is what responsible governing is all about.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The question is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination \nof Christopher H. Schroeder, of North Carolina, to be an Assistant \nAttorney General?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

VANASKIE TO BE UNITED STATES CIRCUIT JUDGE FOR THE THIRD \n                                CIRCUIT\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will report the next \nnomination.\n  The legislative clerk read the nomination of Thomas I. Vanaskie, of \nPennsylvania, to be United States Circuit Judge for the Third Circuit.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, there \nwill be 3 hours of debate on this nomination. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate just devoted more than 3 hours \nto the nomination of Chris Schroeder. I am glad that after many months \nthe Senate has finally been allowed to act on that nomination and \ngratified that he received a bipartisan confirmation vote. After months \nof delay no Republican came to the Senate to speak in opposition to the \nnomination in the 3 hours that Republicans insisted be set aside to \ndebate it. Senator Kaufman spoke in favor; I spoke in favor. Not a \nsingle opponent came to debate. That wasted more of the Senate's time \nwhen we should be considering other matters. We could be debating Wall \nStreet reform, patent reform, or clearing the way for some of the other \n100 Presidential nominations being stalled. We should have been.\n  With respect to the President's judicial nominees, we are well behind \nthe pace I set as chairman when the Senate was considering President \nBush's nominees during the second year of his Presidency. By this date \nin President Bush's second year, the Senate, with a Democratic \nmajority, had moved ahead to confirm 45 of his Federal circuit and \ndistrict court judges. So far during President Obama's Presidency, \nSenate Republicans have only allowed votes on 18 of his Federal circuit \nand district court nominations. During the first 2 years of President \nBush's Presidency we moved forward to confirm 100 of his judicial \nnominees. Republican obstruction of President Obama's nominations makes \nit unlikely that the Senate will reach 50 such confirmations. Last year \nthey allowed only 12 Federal circuit and district court nominees to be \nconfirmed, the lowest number in more than 50 years.\n  Today, thanks to the perseverance of the majority leader and the \nSenators from Pennsylvania, we will consider and I hope confirm the \n19th of President Obama's Federal circuit and district court nominees, \nJudge Thomas Vanaskie. It has been more than 4 months since Judge \nThomas Vanaskie's nomination to fill a judicial emergency on the U.S. \nCourt of Appeals for the Third Circuit was reported favorably by the \nJudiciary Committee with strong bipartisan support. His nomination has \nthe support of both of his home State Senators, Senator Specter and \nSenator Casey. He has more than 15 years of Federal judicial experience \nhaving served as a district court judge in Pennsylvania since 1994. The \nAmerican Bar Association Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary \nhas unanimously rated him well qualified to serve as a circuit judge on \nthird circuit. His nomination is not controversial. Yet, it has taken \nmonths to get consent from the other side for an up-or-down vote on \nJudge Vanaskie's nomination and that did not occur until the majority \nleader was forced to file cloture to end the stalling. Judge Vanaskie \nis one of the 25 judicial nominees still being stalled from final \nSenate consideration.\n  I appreciate the significant steps taken by the majority leader to \naddress the crisis created by Senate Republican obstruction of the \nSenate's advice and consent responsibilities. Their refusal to promptly \nconsider even the most noncontroversial nominations is a dramatic \ndeparture from the Senate's traditional practice of prompt and routine \nconsideration of noncontroversial nominees. The majority leader's \ndecision to file cloture was an unfortunate but necessary step, \nresulting from Senate Republicans' refusal month after month to join \nagreements to consider, debate and vote on this nomination. Those \npractices have obstructed Senate action and led to the backlog of \nalmost 100 nominations pending before the Senate, awaiting final \naction. These are all nominations favorably reported by the committees \nof jurisdiction. Most are nominations that were reported without \nopposition or with a small minority of negative votes. Regrettably, \nthis has been an ongoing Republican strategy and practice during \nPresident Obama's Presidency.\n  The vote on the confirmation of Judge Vanaskie's nomination is the \nfirst vote on judicial nominations that the Senate will hold in 5 \nweeks. Despite the dozens of judicial nominations ready for Senate \nconsideration, none has been allowed to move forward for over a month \nto fill longstanding vacancies in the Federal courts. Of the 25 pending \njudicial nominations, 18 were reported from the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee without any Republican Senator voting against. I have been \nurging the Senate Republican leadership for months to allow votes on \nthese noncontroversial nominations and to enter into time agreements to \ndebate the others. We need to clear the backlog of nominations and move \nforward.\n  I am pleased that the Senate tomorrow will consider another judicial \nnomination, that of Judge Denny Chin to the Second Circuit Court of \nAppeals. His nomination was reported by the Judiciary Committee \nunanimously, but it has also been stalled from Senate consideration for \nmore than 4 months. Senate Republicans should lift their secret holds \nand also allow votes on the remaining 23 judicial nominations currently \npending final action by the Senate. If we are allowed to act on the \njudicial nominations reported favorably by the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee but on which Senate Republicans are preventing Senate action, \nwe will more than double the number of judicial nominations confirmed \nby the Senate this Congress, and bring the number of confirmations in \nline with the number we confirmed at this point during President Bush's \nfirst two years in office.\n  Judicial vacancies have skyrocketed to over 100, more than 40 of \nwhich have been designated ``judicial emergencies.'' Caseloads and \nbacklogs continue to grow while vacancies are left open longer and \nlonger. On this date in President Bush's first term, not only had the \nSenate confirmed 45 Federal district and circuit court judges but there \nwere just seven judicial nominations on the calendar. All seven were \nconfirmed within 9 days. By the end of this month, which is nine days \nfrom now, we should clear the backlog that Republican obstruction has \ncreated and vote on the judicial nominations stalled on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar.\n  By this date during President Bush's first term, circuit court \nnominations had waited less than a week, on average, before being voted \non and confirmed. By contrast, currently stalled by Senate Republicans \nare circuit court nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee 5 months \nago, in November of last year. The seven circuit court nominees the \nSenate has been allowed to consider so far have waited an average of \n124 days after being reported before being allowed to be considered and \nconfirmed.\n  Judge Vanaskie was born and raised in Shamokin, PA. He is one of \nseven children raised by two working parents. He graduated magna cum \nlaude from Lycoming College in 1975 and cum\n\n[[Page S2499]]\n\nlaude from Dickinson School of Law in 1978, where he was an editor of \nthe law review. After law school, he spent 2 years as a law clerk to \nthe Honorable William J. Nealon, then Chief Judge of the United States \nDistrict Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Prior to \njoining the Federal bench, Judge Vanaskie spent 14 years in private \npractice.\n  In 1994, Judge Vanaskie was confirmed by voice vote to serve as a \nUnited States District Court Judge for the Middle District of \nPennsylvania. He served as the Chief Judge of the Middle District from \n1999 to 2006, and has sat by designation with the Third Circuit Court \nof Appeals on several occasions. He has also served as cochair of the \nThird Circuit Library Resources Task Force and as a member of the Board \nof Directors of the Federal Judges Association. He is presently the \nchair of the Third Circuit Judicial Council's Information Technology \nCommittee. His work in the area of technology in the courtroom has won \nhim widespread admiration and appreciation.\n  I congratulate Judge Vanaskie and his family on what I expect will be \nstrong bipartisan vote in favor of his confirmation to serve on the \nThird Circuit. It is long overdue.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                     Nominees Jim Wynn and Al Diaz\n\n  Mrs. HAGAN. Mr. President, there are two judicial nominees on the \ncalendar from North Carolina who I believe would be confirmed by this \nbody overwhelmingly. Judges Jim Wynn and Al Diaz, nominees for the \nFourth Circuit Court of Appeals, were both approved by the Senate \nJudiciary Committee in January. Judge Diaz had the vote of every single \nmember of the committee, and just one Senator opposed Judge Wynn.\n  The reality of this situation, though, is that North Carolina has \nbeen waiting for one of these judges since 1994. That is 1994. Since \nthen, there has been only one judge from North Carolina on the 15-judge \npanel of the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals, even though North \nCarolina is the largest and fastest growing of the five States in the \nFourth Circuit. Partisan bickering has continually blocked qualified \nNorth Carolinians from confirmation since the court's establishment \nback in 1891.\n  But in consultation with both me and Senator Burr, the President has \nappointed two highly qualified, experienced, and fairminded North \nCarolina judges: Al Diaz and Jim Wynn. Judge Diaz, of Charlotte, a \nBusiness Court judge, handles extremely complex business cases. Before \nthat, he was a State superior court judge. Judge Wynn, of Cary, is a \n19-year veteran of the North Carolina Court of Appeals and formerly \nserved on the North Carolina Supreme Court. The American Bar \nAssociation has given them both its highest possible rating. They both \nhave served our country in the military. They have the support of \nDemocrats and Republicans, including my North Carolina Senate \ncolleague, Senator Richard Burr. They have no real opposition that I am \naware of.\n  Finally, we have not one but two qualified and bipartisan choices to \nserve North Carolina and our country on the Fourth Circuit. I am \nhopeful that we are close to confirming these two outstanding nominees \nfor the Fourth Circuit. I will continue working with my colleagues to \nensure they are confirmed as swiftly as possible.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the nomination \nwe are considering in the next few hours, which is the nomination of \nJudge Thomas I. Vanaskie.\n  I can't tell you how proud I am to talk about his nomination. I have \nknown him for a long time. I think it goes without saying that--and I \njoin a lot of people who have spoken about him already and know him--I \nstrongly support his nomination and confirmation for a seat on the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. Tom Vanaskie is a \nlegal scholar, he is fair minded, and he has unquestioned integrity and \nability. He is an experienced Federal judge since his appointment in \n1994. On top of all that, he is a decent, compassionate man.\n  The Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary of the American Bar \nAssociation has unanimously rated Judge Vanaskie well qualified to \nserve as a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Third \nCircuit.\n  Judge Vanaskie's biography highlights both his scholarly and \nprofessional accomplishments and the highest esteem in which he is held \nby his colleagues in the legal profession. He graduated magna cum laude \nfrom Lycoming College in Williamsport, PA, where he was also an \nhonorable mention all-American football player, a first-team academic \nall-American, and he was the college's outstanding male student \nathlete, and the recipient of the highest award given to a graduating \nstudent.\n  Then he went to Dickinson School of Law in Pennsylvania, from which \nhe graduated cum laude in 1978, where Judge Vanaskie served as an \neditor of the law review and received the M. Vashti Burr award, a \nscholarship given by the faculty to the student deemed ``most \ndeserving.''\n  After graduating from law school, Judge Vanaskie served as a law \nclerk for Judge William J. Nealon, chief judge at the time of the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania.\n  Judge Vanaskie practiced law for two highly regarded Pennsylvania law \nfirms before his appointment to the United States District Court for \nthe Middle District of Pennsylvania in 1994. He became the Middle \nDistrict's chief judge 5 years later, in 1999, and completed his 7-year \nterm in that capacity in 2006.\n  He was appointed by Chief Justice Rehnquist to the Information \nTechnology Committee of the Judicial Conference of the United States, \nwhere he served as chairman for 3 years. He also participated in \nseveral working groups at the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts, \nmost recently on the Future of District CM/ECF Working Group, tasked \nwith determining the design and development of the next generation of \nthe Federal judiciary's electronic case filing program.\n  Finally, he is an adjunct professor at Dickinson School of Law and \nhas been active in civic and charitable endeavors in northeastern \nPennsylvania. Like me, he is a northeastern Pennsylvania native and \nresident.\n  Just a few accolades about his service from a wide variety of people. \nWe could read a number of these. I will highlight a few: Lawyers who \nhave appeared before Judge Vanaskie have expressed tremendous respect \nfor his intellectual rigor and the disciplined attention he brings to \nthe matters before him.\n  One attorney, who tried over a dozen cases before Judge Vanaskie, has \ndescribed him as ``objective, fair, analytical, dispassionate, \nextraordinarily careful, and very respectful of appellate authority.'' \nThis same lawyer, the same practitioner, said he had not always agreed \nwith Judge Vanaskie's decisions, but he always felt his rulings \nreflected what the judge considered to be the most appropriate result \nand the result that he was obligated to impose under the law.\n  A U.S. district court judge, William J. Nealon, for whom he clerked, \ndescribed him as follows:\n\n       Superbly qualified. He's outstanding, he's brilliant, he's \n     objective, and he's tireless.\n\n  Judge Vanaskie recognizes that for many citizens, his decisions will \nbe the final word on their claims before the court. He treats people \nwith respect and honors their right to be heard. His deep understanding \nof and respect for the rule of law will serve him well in ruling on \ncases and authoring opinions that will be influential in the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals and beyond.\n  For all these reasons and many others, I am proud to stand in support \nof Judge Vanaskie and urge his confirmation today.\n  With that, I ask unanimous consent that all quorum calls during the \ncontrolled time on the Vanaskie nomination be equally divided.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S2500]]\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be permitted \nto speak as in morning business.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                      Financial Regulatory Reform\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I rise today to talk about a major issue \nthat will be before the Senate very shortly, and which we have spent \nsome time on in the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee over \nmany weeks and days, but most recently today in a markup. I will talk \nabout that in a couple moments.\n  It is time that the Senate, in the next couple of days and weeks, \nfocuses on passing comprehensive reform measures that will put an end \nto Wall Street's reckless endangerment of our economic system. For too \nlong--in fact, for many years now--we have allowed this system to be in \nplace, where high-risk deals were cut on Wall Street. Some people made \na lot of money, but our economy went into the ditch because of it.\n  It wasn't always like that. For decades following the Great \nDepression, we enjoyed a financial system that worked--worked for \nAmerican families and small businesses. It is pretty simple when you \nthink about it, and it has been successful at the same time. Local \nbanks, operating in communities across the Nation, took deposits and \nmade loans for homes, cars, or businesses. People knew their bankers \nand their bankers knew them. Each party was invested in the success of \nthe other. During this time, our economy thrived. It experienced \nprolonged growth and innovation. These benefits were felt across the \nboard by people across our economy and our country.\n  Let's contrast that period of growth and shared prosperity with what \nhas happened in the last few years, and even over the last 30 years. \nThis most recent period can be characterized by the massive growth of \nthe financial sector.\n  In 1978, commercial banks held $1.2 trillion in assets, equivalent to \n53 percent of gross domestic product. By the end of 2007, that same \nmeasurement, what commercial banks held in assets, had grown to $11.8 \ntrillion or 84 percent of gross domestic product. So the percentage \nwent from 53 to 84, and the number went from $1.2 trillion to $11.8 \ntrillion in assets. Unlike the preceding period, this growth was not \nspread across the real economy to households and businesses. Instead, \nit was explicitly shifted away from families and communities and \nconcentrated on Wall Street.\n  The impact of this concentration has been acute. People used to rely \non local institutions, but they now face a financial service \nmarketplace dominated by a few banks with retail outposts sprinkled \nacross the country.\n  Instead of supporting small businesses, little league teams, or \nfamilies, as did their local predecessors, these megabanks gather \ndeposits from Main Street and then slice and dice them and leverage \nthem to the hilt and use the hard-earned wages and savings of Americans \nto make a handful of people very rich.\n  Make no mistake about it, the megabanks profited tremendously from \nthis new model. Over the last 30 years, profits and compensation in the \nbanking industry have skyrocketed. From 1948 to 1979, the average \ncompensation in the banking sector was more or less the same as any \nother job in the private sector. Today, bankers earn, on average, two \ntimes what other private sector employees take home.\n\n  Simply stated, American families and small businesses are no longer \nthe customer in this broken system. Instead, these institutions \nfunction to make wealth for themselves and their stockholders.\n  A clear example of this can be found in recent news stories detailing \nthe record profits of these megabanks--record profits in a time of \nhistorically high unemployment and a bad economy. These profits were \nnot made through savvy lending to their customers. In fact, in the case \nof JPMorgan Chase, Citigroup, and Bank of America--three of our largest \nmegabanks--they have cut lending through a key Small Business \nAdministration lending program by between 85 and 90 percent from 1 year \nto the next.\n  These multibillion dollar profits have been made through high-risk \ntrading operations with money deposited by families and businesses. The \nbanks are expecting people in our communities to shoulder all of the \nrisk, while getting none of the upside.\n  Something has to give in this situation. These megabanks, these big \ncompanies, are entitled to make profits, but we will no longer allow \nthem to continue to use the federally insured deposits of working \npeople as capital for their money-making schemes. We need commonsense \nrules that separate conventional commercial banking operations from \nhigh-risk financial gambles.\n  In no area is this need for reform more apparent than in the so-\ncalled derivatives market. A derivative is a high-risk bet that the \nvalue of another financial instrument, or commodity, or other product \nwill go up or down. It is a bet. For years, Wall Street fought and won \nthe battle to keep derivatives unregulated. In this highly unregulated \nmarket, Wall Street could place bets on bets, without backing them up. \nTherefore, when the underlying weakness of assets became apparent, the \nderivatives market went bust--along with it, the Wall Street banks \nplaying in the market, causing the need for the massive bailout of \nthese institutions.\n  To prevent another catastrophe, we need a strong regulation of the \nderivatives market. Today, the Senate committee of which I am a member, \nthe Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry, had a markup \nsession. What we are talking about is members of the committee talking \non amendments and then voting for final passage of the bill out of \ncommittee. That is a markup. We had that markup session today on the \nWall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010.\n  I applaud our chairwoman, Senator Lincoln, for her work on putting \nforth a bill that cracks down on the reckless activities of Wall \nStreet. I also commend her and other members of the committee for \nreporting it out of committee so we can incorporate it into the Banking \nCommittee bill we will be considering on the floor soon.\n  The Wall Street Transparency and Accountability Act of 2010 will add \nthose two important words to our financial system, both transparency \nand accountability. In particular, it will impose it on the derivatives \nmarket, No. 1, by requiring that derivative transactions--most of \nthem--be cleared through a central clearinghouse; second, require real-\ntime reporting, similar to a stock exchange, of the transactions that \nparties are entering into.\n  Besides a more transparent market, the most important provision in \nthis bill is the requirement that commercial banks that have FDIC-\ninsured accounts can no longer trade on the derivatives market. This \nprovision will force commercial banks to refocus on what should be \ntheir No. 1 priority--the customer--instead of just profits and their \nown stockholders.\n  Our current financial system is broken and no longer works for \nfamilies and small businesses. When I travel across the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, I often hear about the financial difficulties people are \nexperiencing. We have close to record-high unemployment, 582,000 people \nout of work. A lot of people lost their jobs or their homes or both, \nand, in so many ways, their hopes and their dreams. Then they read in \nthe paper every day it seems about record profits of these big \nmegabanks.\n  They think: What about me and my family? Why can't I get a loan? They \nwill ask people like me: Why is the interest rate being raised on my \ncredit card? Questions such as these have persisted for so long now. \nDid we not bail out these megabanks on Wall Street already so they can \ncontinue to lend money to people like me or their customers? Those are \nthe questions I get.\n  The answers to each of these questions are the same. These \ninstitutions have failed the American people. It is that simple. By \nextension, they have helped to collapse our economy. Thank goodness we \nare starting to turn, seeing some job growth in our economy. But we \nneed financial institutions that focus on the needs of our families and \nour small businesses once again.\n  Senator Lincoln's bill is a step in the right direction. We are not \nthere yet. With that bill and with the work we will do on the Banking \nCommittee bill,\n\n[[Page S2501]]\n\nwe can begin to restore not only transparency and accountability and \nsunlight, but I believe we can restore some measure of confidence in \nour financial system and make it work better for real people, for \nfamilies, and for small businesses and also to strengthen our economy.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                      Financial Regulatory Reform\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I wish to take a few minutes this afternoon, \nif I may, to discuss further the efforts in financial regulatory \nreform.\n  I would be remiss if I did not note the contribution of the Presiding \nOfficer to this effort. I thank him personally once again. He is a \nmember of the Banking Committee and has expressed strong interest in \nthis legislation and various parts of it, and I thank him for it.\n  Today I wish to talk about aspects of the bill. I have been talking \nabout this bill on the floor over the last several days, issues such as \ntoo big to fail, which we aggressively address in our legislation. I \ntalked about the efforts that have been made to try to forge a \ncomprehensive bill, a strong bill. We have involved, we have invited \nvirtually everyone interested to participate in the product. I am proud \nto say many did offer their ideas and thoughts as we tried to develop a \nproposal that was not only strong and broad based but attracted, again, \na strong group of our colleagues, both Democrats and Republicans, to \nthis effort.\n  Over the days, we have spent a lot of time discussing the impact of \nWall Street reform on large financial firms, big banks, investment \nbanks, nonbanks, corporate executives, Federal regulators, and other \npower players in the financial sector--that has been the subject of a \ngreat deal of attention--and the complicated subject matters of \nderivatives--how they work, how they apply--shadow economies, black \npools, systemic risk--all this language and discussion that sometimes \ncan leave the average citizen feeling as though we are talking in a \nforeign language about these matters.\n  The question they ask is: How does this affect me? I am glad you are \ngoing to try to clean this up, but what is happening with all of this \nthat has some positive impact on my life as a taxpayer, as a working \nAmerican? I would like to know what is being done to see to it that my \ninterests are going to be considered as you are trying to resolve all \nof these larger questions that somehow seem very distant to my concerns \nevery day.\n  Today I wish to take a few minutes to talk about the impact of this \nlegislation on millions and millions of our fellow citizens who are not \nfinancial wizards--and would be the first to tell you so--they are not \nbig wigs on Wall Street, major players in large banks and financial \ninstitutions. They are people just trying to build a nest egg for their \nfamilies, invest in their futures, maybe take a loan out to buy an \nautomobile, a home, send a child to college because that child has done \neverything they have asked them to do over the years and now wants to \ngo on to that educational opportunity and needs the resources to do so.\n  The stories are myriad. There are many. The demands are obviously \nclear. Unfortunately, as we know and many Americans found out the hard \nway over the last few years, our current financial system leaves \nconsumers too often vulnerable to being deceived into purchasing risky \nproducts, if not outright ripped off by greedy Wall Street firms and \nothers. After all, at the heart of the financial crisis that has cost \nour Nation so dearly were the subprime mortgages sold by unscrupulous \nlenders to Americans who did not understand their terms and who never, \never could have afforded them, and the lenders knew it. They knew going \ninto it. Yet they lured them into those arrangements, with great damage \ndone to individuals and to the economy as a whole.\n  Wall Street's unquenchable thirst for profits and utter disregard for \nordinary consumers led to a pattern of greed and recklessness that darn \nnear led to creating a complete collapse of our financial markets and \nour economy. Millions of Americans lost their jobs, around 8.5 million. \nSeven million homes have gone into foreclosure, many lost forever. \nRetirement earnings, as I have said over and over, evaporated in some \ncases almost instantaneously as a result of the collapse of our \neconomy. Maybe more important than all of that--as hard as it is if you \nlost your home, your job, your health care--is they lost their faith \nand sense of optimism and confidence in our financial system in this \ncountry, that loss of confidence, that loss of optimism, that loss of \nbelief that while you may make a bad bet on a stock, the system was \nsound and fair. It would treat you fairly, and you were not going to \nget hurt because we had a good system in place. That confidence, that \nfaith has been lost. That may be more important than everything else I \nhave mentioned in terms of the future strength of our economy and our \ncountry.\n  To add insult to injury, those same Americans then saw those same \nfirms collecting billion-dollar bailouts at the expense of the \ntaxpayer--and paying million-dollar bonuses to the same executives \nwhose bad decisions put us in the mess in the first place and who would \nhave been out of a job had the bailout not occurred.\n  The bailout allowed those financial institutions to survive and their \nexpression of gratitude was to write themselves a huge bonus check and \nbeing able to do so only because in this Chamber we voted 75 to 24 to \nstabilize our financial system--a decision I believe was the right one. \nI think we made the right call in doing it, as difficult as it was. But \nat the end of all that, major executives in these companies then \nrewarded themselves as the head of these institutions because we--\nmostly the taxpayers, by the way--came up with the resources to make it \npossible for those institutions to survive.\n  So the American people are angry and with good reason. But they are \nalso wondering: Who is looking out for us? Whose job is it to make sure \nthis doesn't happen again? While our current system pays lip service to \nconsumer protection, those responsibilities are divided among some \nseven different regulators for whom consumer protection is just an \nafterthought, in too many cases, to their primary safety and soundness \nmissions that they are responsible for as well. The result is, \nregulators put the interests of banks and large financial institutions, \nin too many cases, before the interests of the consumers who rely on \nthose institutions for their long-term economic security.\n  If this sounds like a recipe for failure, that is because it is. \nAssistant Secretary of the Treasury Michael Barr testified before our \nBanking Committee not long ago, and he said:\n\n       Today's consumer protection regime just experienced massive \n     failure. It could not stem a plague of abusive and \n     unaffordable mortgages and exploitative credit cards despite \n     clear warning signs. It cost millions of responsible \n     consumers their homes, their savings, and their dignity. And \n     it contributed to the near collapse of our financial system. \n     We did not have just a financial crisis, we had a consumer \n     crisis.\n\n  That massive failure could happen again. Today, we are in no \ndifferent position than we were in 2007, 2008, and 2009. Nothing has \nchanged. Yet we are on the brink of creating change that could make a \ndifference in this very area. So today those massive failures are still \nlurking out there, and the same consumers who lost their homes, lost \ntheir jobs, lost their retirement, lost their health care are in no \ndifferent position should another crisis happen tonight or tomorrow. It \nis exactly the same system, exactly the same structure, exactly the \nsame so-called regulators out there charged with protecting consumers \nfrom the kinds of problems that led us to the difficulties we are in \ntoday. Again, the financial products and practices being devised on \nWall Street, even as we speak, will make it even more difficult in many \nways. Are they safe? Are they exploitative? We have no idea, and \nneither do the American people because no one is looking out for them \nat this juncture.\n  Our legislation answers the question of who is looking out for \nordinary Americans when they interact with our\n\n[[Page S2502]]\n\nfinancial systems. The bill we will present to our colleagues in just a \nmatter of hours in this Chamber creates an independent Consumer \nFinancial Protection Bureau, a watchdog with bark and with bite. This \nnew bureau will not have any job more important than helping American \nconsumers make smart financial decisions--because protecting, \neducating, and empowering American consumers will be their only job.\n  This bureau will have an independent Director, appointed by the \nPresident and confirmed by the Senate. It will have a dedicated and \nindependent budget paid by the Federal Reserve Board. It will be \nempowered to write consumer protection rules governing any institution, \nwhether it is a bank or a payday lender that offers consumer financial \nservices or products. It will have a new Office of Financial Literacy \nto ensure that consumers are able to understand the products and \nservices they are being offered and a national toll-free consumer \ncomplaint line so, for the first time, Americans have somewhere to go \nwhen they need to report a problem.\n  When I talk to people back in my home State, they understand it is \ntheir responsibility to make smart decisions about their family \nfinances, and nothing in our bill suggests otherwise. That is the first \nline of defense, so we all bear responsibility to learn more, to pay \nattention, and to understand the financial arrangements we are getting \ninto. I am not saying anything different. Unlike Wall Street, they are \nnot looking to shirk that responsibility. They welcome that \nresponsibility, but they would like to understand it better. What they \nneed is clear, accurate information so they can make those good \ndecisions and a cop on the beat to stop abusive practices when they \noccur. That is what our legislation, which will soon be before this \nbody, does.\n  Our legislation finally puts consumers in control of their financial \nlives by requiring large financial institutions and credit card \ncompanies to tell them what they are selling in plain English so the \npurchaser doesn't need a master's in business administration to \nunderstand. It will finally put an end to the practices that have \nbecome almost standard operating procedure--skyrocketing credit card \ninterest rates, the explosion of overdraft fees, predatory lending by \nmortgage firms, and more.\n  This Congress has taken steps to address these abusive practices, \npassing the Credit CARD Act, which was authored by the members of our \ncommittee--again, I thank the Presiding Officer for having been a part \nof that--and forcing large banks to change their overdraft fee \npolicies.\n  But credit card companies continue to look for ways around the new \nrules, and history shows them to be pretty good at getting away with it \nas well.\n  Between 1997 and 2007--in that decade--credit card companies engaged \na wide variety of, frankly, unethical practices--from so-called double-\ncycle billing and universal default to retroactive and arbitrary \ninterest rate hikes. In that entire decade--a decade in which literally \nmillions of our fellow citizens were overcharged or outright ripped off \nby these banks--there were just nine formal enforcement actions taken \nby the seven regulators in our national government. Let me repeat that. \nIn that entire decade--when nearly every single citizen in this country \ncould talk about one horror story after another, where rates were \nincreased, fees were enlarged, and every gimmick and trick was used to \nsqueeze every last nickel out of a consumer's pocketbook--there were \nonly nine formal enforcement actions taken by the regulators at the \nnational level.\n  There are stories similar to the one I heard from Mario Livieri of \nBranford, CT. Mario is a 75-year-old retired homebuilder who \naccidentally overdrew his account by $2. I am not making this up. Mario \nis 75 years old and a small business contractor. He overdrew his \naccount by $2 and was charged $35. The bank took several days to notify \nhim that the account was overdrawn. In the meantime, of course, \nadditional minor purchases yielded three additional $35 fees, for a \ntotal of $140, which Mario Livieri was charged because he was $2 \noverdrawn in his banking account.\n  Unfortunately, that story by this individual in my State can be \nrepeated millions of times all across the country. A $2 mistake made by \na conscientious individual, and one that he was unaware of until \nnotified later, and every subsequent purchase he made brought an \nadditional $35 fee until he had a bill--before he discovered the \nmistake--of $140 because of being $2 overdrawn. That used to go on all \nthe time, and in too many cases it still does. When Mario protested, \nthe bank waived one of the four $35 charges, but they told him there \nwas nothing he could do to fight the fees because the practice was \nperfectly legal.\n  Then there are the auto dealers that have been shown to take \nadvantage of military servicemembers, the shady payday lenders that \nprey on minority communities, and a wide range of malicious actors who \nlook to take advantage of American consumers. This bill that will be \nbefore this body, which passed out of our committee, puts an end to \nthose abuses, and that is why it is supported by the Military \nCoalition, civil rights groups, consumer rights groups, and more. It is \nalso why it is opposed by large financial institutions whose business \nstrategies are based too often on taking advantage of their very own \ncustomers.\n\n  Let me take a moment to put an end to some of the malarkey we have \nbeen hearing from the Wall Street crowd. The large banks are paying for \nads now claiming that this legislation will impose new restrictions on \ndentists and butchers and other Main Street merchants. That is not \ntrue. You and I know this. But that kind of falsehood that goes out \nacross the country is exactly the kind of propaganda they are \ndetermined to engage in to undermine this legislation.\n  These rules we have crafted apply only to firms engaged in offering \nconsumer financial services or products, not the butcher, not the \nlaundromat, and not the dentist. An entity must be engaged in financial \nservices or products. Just because your butcher lets you keep a tab or \nyour dentist offers a payment plan doesn't mean these new rules apply.\n  Moreover, this legislation doesn't seek to strangle innovation in the \nfinancial sector. Quite the opposite. That innovation is part of what \nkeeps America prosperous. We are not dictating what products can be \noffered any more than the Consumer Product Safety Commission directs \nwhat toymakers can invent. But just as the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission watches out for toys that could hurt children, the \nindependent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau will watch out for \nproducts that will hurt someone's finances so customers and consumers \ncan make smart decisions.\n  The large financial institutions have tried to push this notion that \nthis legislation creates an enormous burden on small community banks. \nLet me address that. How nice of them to look out for their \ncompetitors, the ones they have been trying to drum out of business for \ndecades. But the fact is, the small community banks with $10 billion or \nless in assets will not see any regulatory changes. They will not be \ncharged any fees or assessments. They will follow the same rules they \nfollow today. Even better, these small community banks will be able to \noperate on a level playing field without the unfair competition from \nthe underregulated or unregulated shadow banks that don't operate with \nany rules whatsoever.\n  So this legislation has many important objectives, from ending \ntaxpayer bailouts to establishing an early warning system so future \nfinancial crises can be nipped in the bud before they threaten our \nentire economic system. But for millions of Americans who don't pay \nmuch attention to what goes on, on Wall Street, except when they have \nto write a check to bail out the firms that live there, perhaps nothing \nin this bill will impact their lives more directly than the new \nindependent Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Finally, there will \nbe a cop on the beat watching out for them.\n  The safety and soundness of our financial institutions are critically \nimportant. I am not arguing against that at all. But that is not the \nonly consideration. As this real estate bubble was building up, we were \ntold over and over that the system was safe and sound. Why? Because \npeople were making money. It was growing in profits. What we failed to \nlook at and understand\n\n[[Page S2503]]\n\nwas it may have been safe and sound from that narrow perspective, but \nfor the consumers who were relying on these financial institutions for \ntheir economic security, it was anything but safe and sound. With the \nestablishment of this bureau, for the first time in the history of our \ncountry, we are saying that financial products ought to be no different \nthan any other product consumers buy. There ought to be a place where \nsomeone can go when they have been deceived or defrauded in the use of \nthese financial products.\n  If your lawnmower breaks or your car malfunctions, we get all sorts \nof reports, as recently seen with recalls of products because they are \nunsafe for a consumer to use. Why shouldn't that also exist if someone \nis out there purchasing a financial product that could put them in \ngreat danger--in fact, bankrupt them and ruin their life because they \nhave been deceived and drawn into a financial arrangement because it \nwas a quick profit-making operation for the lender, but it put the \nconsumer at great risk--and ultimately causes, as we have seen in \nmillions of cases, the ultimate financial ruin of individuals, \nfamilies, and businesses. Thus, we have established a parity between \nphysical products you may buy and financial products you may engage in.\n  Finally, Americans will be able to rely on clear and accurate \ninformation about their family finances. They will know that someone \nwill be looking out for them. There is no better way to restore faith \nagainst the loss of homes, the loss of jobs, the loss of retirement--\nall of which have occurred--and perhaps the greatest tragedy of all \nbeing the loss of faith in our financial system. We need to restore \nthat. The absence of that will not make this get better. Every single \nother thing we do will not achieve its goal if Americans don't have \nconfidence in our financial systems--the faith that it is there, it is \nsafe; that they can be secure in the knowledge that when they deposit a \nhard-earned paycheck, when they buy an insurance policy, when they buy \na stock, when they engage in financial activity, the structure, the \nsystem there is not unfair. It is not out there to deceive them, to \ndefraud them, to take advantage of them, but to see to it they are \nprotected. That is our goal in this bill.\n\n  My hope is that my colleagues will allow us to get to this debate. If \nyou have objections or ideas, let's have that full-throated debate that \nhas been the history of this Chamber on important matters that have \ncome before us in the past. We ought not be denied that opportunity \nagain on this bill.\n  But I wanted to take a moment to talk about the consumer protection \nefforts on this legislation, and I again compliment my colleague in the \nchair, the Presiding Officer, because he has been a champion in our \nshort service together on this committee on the very issues I have \naddressed today, and I thank him for his commitment and passion for \nthese issues.\n  I yield the floor, and I see my colleague and friend from Arizona, so \nI will not note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, before I begin talking about this bill \nspecifically, I wish to compliment Chairman Dodd for the hard work he \nhas put into this matter. I believe it is important for us to reach a \nbipartisan consensus, and many of the things we just discussed are \nmatters on which we can reach a consensus. That is the goal of \nRepublicans.\n  I am concerned that there has been some politicization of this issue \nby many on the other side and, frankly, some in the administration. I \nknow, for example, that Senator Chambliss, a Republican, and Senator \nLincoln, a Democrat, worked very closely together and had virtually, I \nam told, reached an agreement on the derivative issue as it pertains to \nthe jurisdiction of their Agriculture Committee, only to be told by the \nWhite House that was not acceptable and that Chairman Lincoln needed to \ngo back and redo it the way they wanted it done. As a result, the bill \nwas passed out of the Agriculture Committee on an almost partisan line. \nThe same thing was true of the legislation that came out of the Banking \nCommittee.\n  While Chairman Dodd is here, let me make this point. He suggested \nthis morning that there are Republicans who support this bill, he \nknows, but that they are being told by Republican leadership that they \ncan't support it. I want to make it clear that our leadership does not \noperate that way. One reason I know that is because I am one of our \nleadership. Our members of the Republican caucus think for themselves.\n  We came to a conclusion unanimously in the Republican conference that \nthe partisan bill that came out of the Banking Committee--and it was \npartisan; it was written by Democrats, not Republicans, and it was \npassed on a party-line vote--that bill was not the way to move forward. \nIt was partisan, it was flawed and, among other things, it would \nprovide for perpetual bailouts and therefore didn't achieve the first \ngoal of the legislation, which was to finally end the taxpayer \nbailouts.\n  So all 41 of us wrote to the leader and said we will not vote to \nproceed to that bill because it is a partisan bill. It would be better \nif we could work together in a bipartisan way to bring a bill to the \nfloor of the Senate that represented not just Republican ideas but a \ncombination of Democratic and Republican ideas that had been negotiated \nby the members of the Banking Committee, members of the Agriculture \nCommittee, and others. That would ordinarily be the way we would take \nup a bill here on the Senate floor.\n  Having said that, I am still confident, based upon what Senator \nShelby and other Republicans on the Banking Committee have said, that \nit is possible to reach a bipartisan consensus. I know Chairman Dodd \nand Senator Shelby have been working hard every day on various aspects \nof the bill to try to reach a conclusion.\n  The second point I wish to make is that one should not describe the \nbill that passed out of the Banking Committee as the end of the story, \nas a successful bill that is going to solve all of these problems. I do \nnot think it will. It does not end taxpayer bailouts, for example, and \nat a minimum, it seems to me it ought to do that. So in just a few \nminutes here, I would like to describe some of the things that I think \nthe bill should address and that I hope are being addressed in the \nbipartisan negotiations.\n  I am sure it is obvious that it is very difficult--once a bill comes \nto the floor and you have a chairman and leader supporting the bill, \nwith 59 Senators on their side of the aisle, it is very hard to amend \nthat bill. That is one reason Republicans would like to see a bill \nbrought to the floor that already has bipartisan consensus, and then, \nyes, we can work our will on the bill and maybe amend it, maybe not, \nbut at least we know it is not going to be a purely partisan \nproposition.\n  There has been much attention paid to the $50 billion fund that is \ncreated by this bill. While it is true that the financial institutions, \nof course, pay the money, supply the money that goes into that fund, we \nall know where the money eventually is paid--the costs are passed on to \nthe consumers. But that is not the real problem because there are other \nfunds, such as the FDIC fund, for example, which the banks obviously \npass on to their consumers in order to have an ability to take care of \ntheir expenses to creditors should they not be able to do so.\n  But what this bill does is not just create this $50 billion fund but \nalso continuing government obligations beyond that. It provides not an \norderly bankruptcy type of procedure for the resolution of a failed \ncompany but, rather, an ad hoc procedure determined by bureaucrats who \nare not accountable to anybody and who can apply pretty much any rule \nthey want to the winding down of the institution.\n  What does that do? Today--and frankly, it has been this way for two \ncenturies--we have a series of laws that dictate what happens in the \nevent of the failure of a company. Primarily, these are our bankruptcy \nlaws. You know in advance what happens. If you are a company that \ncannot make it and you go bankrupt, there are two basic ways you can \nfile bankruptcy, one in which you totally liquidate, the other in which \nyou reorganize. In those two situations, the law provides for what \nhappens to your creditors.\n  By definition, bankruptcy means you cannot pay all your debts. So who \ngets paid and who doesn't and how much and in what order--all of that \nis resolved by the bankruptcy laws and by\n\n[[Page S2504]]\n\nthe laws built up as precedent applied in the bankruptcy courts. That \nis why you know--when you either lend money to an institution or you \ninvest in it in equity investments, you have an idea of where you \nstand, where your loan or equity investment stands in the order of \npriority should the entity fail. For example, a secured creditor would \nbe very high on the list. Security means you have something to fall \nback on to take from the company if they can't pay their debt to you. \nAs a result, you can lend the money at a lower rate because you don't \nhave to account for that risk when you lend the money. It is a good way \nfor companies to borrow money. Granted, they have to have something \nthat backs it up. Sometimes it is even the personal guarantee of the \nCEO of the company. But you get a pretty cheap loan if you do that \nbecause the lender knows he or she or it is going to get its money \nback. By the same token, if you need money pretty badly and don't have \nany more security, you might ask people to invest in your company or to \nborrow money on an unsecured basis. Well, you are going to get charged \na higher rate of interest on that because there is more risk to the \ninvestor or to the lender. But in every case, they know where they \nstand in the event you can't make it or you fold.\n  What this bill does is substitute an unknown, untested process for \nthe tried-and-true rules of bankruptcy. Nobody is suggesting there \ncould not be some modification of the bankruptcy process or rules that \nmight govern these particular institutions. They are unique \ninstitutions in some respects, and to the extent the rules should be \ntailored in order to fit these circumstances, they could be. But that \nis not what is done in this legislation. Instead, new entities are \ncreated and bureaucrats are allowed to decide when a company could \ndestabilize the markets and therefore decide what to do about it. Their \nrange of options is essentially unlimited. The bottom line is that \ntaxpayers could end up being on the hook for the bailout. That is true \nwith the FDIC, it is true with the Fed, and this legislation has \nspecific language in it that provides for that.\n\n  There are those who say: Why don't we just get rid of this $50 \nbillion fund, and then the problem will go away. No, that problem \ndoesn't go away unless you correct the other language as well.\n  I will not try to substitute my judgment for that of others who say \nwe need a $50 billion fund. I will say this: Creating that fund makes \nit more likely than less that risks will be taken and that therefore \nthere will be instability in the market. I also suspect that those who \nhave an implicit guarantee from the fund are more likely to receive \ncredit, for example, at a lower rate because there is much of an \nassurance on the part of the lender or the equity investor that they \nwill get their money back. So there are some downsides to having this \nfund.\n  But those aside, if you want to do away with the fund, OK. If you \nwant to keep the fund, OK. But what you should not do is provide that \nbeyond that, the taxpayers are on the hook. Here is the problem. Lehman \nBrothers, I am told, had well over $600 billion in liabilities, and a \n$50 billion fund does not go a long way toward resolving a $600 billion \nliability. In the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, which are not \neven dealt with in this legislation even though they were the prime \ncauses of the problem--and by the way, that is a deficiency in the law \nthat needs to be corrected. I hope these negotiations will provide \nsomething in that regard. But they have now created--it is about $6.3 \ntrillion in obligations. Guess who is on the hook for those \nobligations. Congress never passed a law that said the taxpayers were \ngoing to be on the hook, but that is exactly the result of the actions \ntaken by the bureaucrats who decide these matters now.\n  I do not want to create a perpetual situation where not Congress, not \nthe courts, but bureaucrats--by the way, I do not use that term \npejoratively. ``Government officials''--let's use that term. Unelected \ngovernment officials, to whom we give the power, simply decide who gets \nbailed out, when, under what circumstances, who gets paid back, who \ndoesn't get paid back, and how much it is going to cost the taxpayers. \nThat, in essence, is what is provided for in this legislation.\n  So when folks say this is a bill we need to support because it ends \ntoo big to fail, that is wrong because it doesn't end too big to fail \nand taxpayers are still on the hook.\n  If those things are fixed, then my criticisms in this respect go \naway. But we have not heard from these negotiations that is being done. \nSo I told my colleagues: Don't come to the floor and say this is a \ngreat bill, it solves all these problems, it ends too big to fail, and \nthere is nothing wrong with it. There are some things wrong with it \nthat need to be fixed. Let's do those things. I assume, on a bipartisan \nbasis, if you just ask the abstract question of every 100 of the \nSenators, do you think we ought to end too big to fail, the answer \nwould be yes. Ask our constituents--yes. Then we can get down to the \nnitty-gritty.\n  What about the language in the bill that says the FDIC ``will \nguarantee the obligations of banks'' under certain circumstances? That \nis language that has to be carefully either defined, limited, crabbed, \nor eliminated, or we are going to have taxpayers continuing to be on \nthe hook for these obligations.\n  As I said, we haven't done anything to Fannie and Freddie in the \nlegislation, and that is going to continue to mean a continuing \ntaxpayer obligation as well.\n  As I said before, too, those firms, the ones deemed too big to fail, \nhave an advantage over the smaller banks, the community banks. My \ncolleague just mentioned those a moment ago. We just met with the \ncommunity bank representatives in Arizona, and they fear this kind of \nprovision will make them uncompetitive vis-a-vis the big boys. As a \nresult, what we will eventually end up with is a few really big banks \nand maybe some that aren't, in kind of a medium-size operation, and \nalmost all of the smaller banks having to go out of business because of \nthis anticompetitiveness that will result from the legislation.\n  One of the other ways in which what I have been talking about occurs \nis through section 113, the so-called Financial Stability Oversight \nCouncil. This is one of the entities that allow for these backdoor \nbailouts. It gives the Federal Reserve the authority to prop up any \nnonbank company that the council, this new council, deems to be a \npotential threat to systemic stability in our economy. This is a board \nbased in Washington. It decides which institutions get special \ntreatment. It gives these bureaucrats tremendous latitude to pick \nwinners and losers, again resulting in a competitive advantage and \ndisadvantage. What determines whether a nonbank is a threat to \nstability? What are the criteria? Among other possible considerations, \n``any other factors that the council deems appropriate.'' That is \npretty much an open book--``any other factors that the council deems \nappropriate.'' I would think, if Congress is going to try to legislate \nin this very complex and difficult area, we would try to give pretty \nspecific direction to the Federal authorities, to whom we give great \npower, as to how we want it exercised, and I don't think this meets the \ntest--``any other factors that the council deems appropriate.'' Take \nthat out of the bill. Let's have a bipartisan negotiation to do that. \nIf somebody can demonstrate to me why that would have to be left in, \nthen great, but these are the kinds of things that lead me to the \nconclusion that, no, we should not agree to consider the bill that came \nout of the Banking Committee on a purely partisan basis because there \nare problems in it.\n  Today, the Wall Street Journal says:\n\n       The Dodd bill allows too much discretion to federal \n     regulators to determine which firms to regulate and how, \n     which firms to rescue or close down, and which creditors to \n     reward and how. . . .\n\n  Exactly what I was just saying. It goes on to conclude:\n\n       The Dodd bill also extends the FDIC's resolution authority \n     (subject to other executive approval) beyond deposit-taking \n     institutions to any financial company deemed to be \n     systemically important. And it gives the FDIC the discretion \n     to discriminate among creditors as it judges who gets paid \n     what as part of a resolution. . . .Recall how the White House \n     exploited its authority under TARP to trash Chrysler's \n     creditors and give unions a better deal.\n\n  Now, that is not the only section. Section 1155 of the bill is \nentitled ``Emergency Financial Stabilization.'' This is another way in \nwhich the bill\n\n[[Page S2505]]\n\nguarantees bailouts and puts them into the law and leaves the taxpayers \non the hook.\n  Under this section, the FDIC would be allowed to create a new program \nof unlimited size to guarantee the obligation of depositories and \nholding companies with depositories.\n  What does this mean since there is no requirement that a company that \nreceives, guarantees, and defaults on its obligations be taken into an \nFDIC receivership, bankruptcy, or resolution? The FDIC and Treasury can \nprop up whatever company they choose. This authority can be exercised \nwithout congressional approval.\n  It is one of the reasons I have said I think there needs to be some \nelement of bankruptcy or other process prior to the instigation of this \nparticular kind of authority. We cannot say this bill ends taxpayer \nbailouts as long as we have all of those sections in it.\n  Finally, there is much said about consumer protection. Does anybody \nknow anybody who does not favor consumer protection? I think we all do. \nThere are questions about how to intelligently do it. We can create a \nlot more cost to consumers if we make the regulations so costly and \ninefficient that they end up paying more money than they would have \notherwise. That is, I fear, what can happen here. It happened with the \ncredit card legislation we passed. I think it is predicted that it can \nhappen here as well.\n  It could easily happen with businesses we do not even intend to \ncover. I know I have heard from dental offices and car dealerships. \nWhen we think about Wall Street bailouts, we do not think about our \nnext-door neighbor who sells cars, or maybe our neighbor who is a \ndentist. But if they have an installment plan where it takes 4 months--\nwhere you can get up to 4 months to pay your bill to them, boom, you \ncan be covered by provisions here. Then all of the consumer protections \napply and so on.\n  Let's be careful that in an effort to make sure Wall Street handles \nits affairs properly that we do not impose conditions on Main Street, \nthe folks we would like to see thrive, particularly in times of \nrecession, in a way that would end up either causing them more expenses \nor, at worst, even making them uncompetitive with these so-called \nbigger guys.\n  Restraining credit is a big way to do this, requiring that they have \nto apply capital not to building their businesses but to somehow \nbacking up their credit issuance, even though that is not the main part \nof their business.\n  Just quoting briefly from the New York Post:\n\n       New restrictions on credit . . . are likely to cost our \n     economy tens of thousands of jobs a year.\n\n  And:\n\n       Reductions in credit--\n\n  Which would result here--\n\n     means declines in job creation. Many small business start-ups \n     use home equity debt or credit cards as their source of \n     funding.\n\n  There is not a lot of home equity debt to be had these days. A lot of \nour homes are not mortgageable at the present time, so credit cards are \nmaxed out and so on. Well, that is a difficult way to do it. But we \nhave to make sure if small businesses are doing this that the credit \nflows are not stopped because of provisions of this bill.\n  In an op-ed in the New York Post today, Mark Calabria pointed out:\n\n       The bursting of the housing bubble largely eliminated the \n     first option.\n\n  That is the mortgaging of your home to get additional credit.\n\n       Now Washington is trying its best to kill the second.\n\n  That is the credit card provision.\n\n       [The Dodd bill's] proposed ``consumer protections'' would \n     reach beyond credit cards and restrict the availability of \n     all forms of credit, while raising costs.\n\n  Now, nobody intends this result. I do not think anybody in this body \nwants to impose additional costs, especially on smaller businesses or \non startup businesses. It is simply an inevitable result of a policy \nthat is written too broadly. We need to be careful how we do it. We \nneed to ensure we do not write it so broadly that friends we want to \nprotect are not adversely impacted.\n  They have been coming to my office. Folks you never dream of who \nwould be covered by this act are coming in and saying: Here is how this \nbill could affect me. Please make sure it does not.\n  All I urge my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to do is, \ntake these concerns on board--they are not partisan concerns--and make \nsure when these negotiations figure out how to amend the bill, that we \ntake into consideration the things we are raising. They are not \npartisan concerns. They are concerns of everyday Americans, and we owe \nit to our constituents to think these things through and, if need be, \nchange the bill.\n  I am sure even Senator Dodd would say the bill is not perfect. If \nthere are things we need to see changed in it, then let's do that.\n  The last point has to do with another element of consumer protection. \nA lot of folks do business in more than one State. In fact, some of the \nlarger companies do business in all States, and it is cost efficient \nfor them if there is one rule, if there is one regulator, so that they \ndo not have to, for example, figure out what every single State \nrequires in terms of different consumer protections or notice or \nwhatever it might be, and then have to comply with all 50 States, some \nof which may be contradictory, as well as a Federal regulator.\n  So up to now we have pretty much had a Federal regime that has \npreempted the State jurisdiction in some of these areas. Well, as I \nunderstand it, the legislation does away with a significant component \nof that and would allow the State regulators to impose individual \nrequirements on these companies that are doing business throughout the \nUnited States. So we could have the anomalous situation where we have \nlots of different requirements.\n  Some of you have seen ads on TV. It says: Call now to get your $29.95 \nknife. If you call right now, you will get another one thrown in for \nfree. Then the last 10 seconds of the ad has some guy reading in very \nfast language: Offer not valid in New Mexico, New York, Arizona, \nTennessee, Oregon, and so on and so on. You cannot even follow what he \nis saying. But the reality is, there are a lot of different \nrequirements.\n  So what we would like to try to do is have things be as uniform as \npossible to keep the costs down because the greater the costs, the more \nthe cost to the consumer. Unfortunately, as I said, however, this bill \ncreates a patchwork of regulatory regimes that expand the number of \nregulators by 50 in certain areas. As a result, it is going to be much \nmore difficult to comply with and much more costly.\n  If we believe we understand what is necessary in consumer \nprotections, then let's provide for it. If we think we do not, that we \nneed to leave this to a lot of other regulators, then let's not try to \nmake the rules ourselves. Just let them do it. But we should not do \nboth.\n  In addition to that, the chairman talked about safety and soundness. \nThis is a technical term that essentially has regulators requiring \nbanks and other financial institutions to carry a certain amount of \nreserves so that if people want their money back out of the bank, the \nbank has enough money to give to them. No bank believes every day 100 \npercent of its deposits are going to be called back by its depositors. \nBut they have to have a certain percentage of those funds on deposit so \nif you go and say: I want my money out of the bank, they have enough \nmoney to give it to you or, if they have loans go bad, they have enough \nto carry those loans, and so on. That is what the safety and soundness \nrequirements of the regulators do. It is a good thing.\n  Those same people can also provide for consumer protections, and say: \nLook, we know the bank needs to reserve a certain amount of money, and \nwe also know, consistent with that, they need to ensure the protection \nof their consumers in a certain way.\n  What is difficult is when we separate these two functions, as this \nlegislation does, so we have one group saying to the bank here is what \nyou have to do for safety and soundness purposes, and we have another \ntotally independent group saying, we do not care anything about that, \nbut here is what you have to do for consumer protection.\n  We can end up with duplicative, overlapping, costly, and sometimes \neven inconsistent requirements, all of which make it more difficult for \nthese institutions to give a cheaper product, a better loan, a credit \ncard with a lower interest rate, or whatever it may be.\n  I just urge my colleagues, everyone is for consumer protection. \nEveryone is\n\n[[Page S2506]]\n\nfor safety and soundness. Let's try to do this in a way that does not \nimpose such great burdens, especially on the smaller folks, that they \nare not able to be competitive and provide their consumers, about whom, \nafter all, we should be mostly concerned, with the cheapest product \nthat is backed by the safety and soundness of the institutions.\n  Incidentally, on this last point, some who are a little more cynical \nhave said: Well, maybe this is being done for a more nefarious purpose. \nIf every single attorney general in the country can go out and hire \ntrial lawyers on a special contract to bring class action lawsuits \nbecause of a violation of State laws, then we have a brandnew cause of \naction for the trial lawyers to do even better than they have done in \nthe past.\n\n  I am not going to suggest that is the motivation, but I am going to \nsuggest that I see nothing in the bill that will prevent that. As long \nas that is a potential, then, Katey, bar the door.\n  So, again, there are many things in this legislation that are not \npartisan in terms of we all want to protect the same folks. But there \nare questions that have been raised that need to be dealt with. I think \nit would be far better to take the time, to have Republicans and \nDemocrats sitting down and going through all of these issues carefully, \nwriting up a bill on which they can agree, bring that bill to the floor \nso the rest of us can then look at it, and hopefully we would all say: \nGee, that is a lot better product than we thought.\n  It is not exactly as I would have done it. It looks like there are \nsome compromises in there, but after all, that is what the process is \nwhen we have little more than half of the body of one party and less \nthan half of the other party. That is how we get things done.\n  I can assure you this and assure my colleagues on the other side, \nRepublicans want to work with our Democratic friends to get a good bill \nthat all of us can support and that will be good for our country.\n  I think if we can work in good faith toward that end, we will be much \nhappier with the result than if it is the result of a partisan or a \nnear-partisan vote in this body and likewise in the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I thank my colleagues for their patience and am happy to yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken.) The Senator from Ohio is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage \nin a colloquy with Senator Kaufman for up to 30 minutes as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I want to believe what I just heard. I do. I \nbelieve the genuineness and the sincerity of the words from my \ncolleague from Arizona. I also, though--and I agree with him there are \nthings we need to fix in this bill. There always are. And we can work \nto improve it.\n  I met only 2 hours ago a dozen manufacturers from Ohio--mostly metal-\nworking companies, stamping, bending metal, all of that--who came to \nsee me to talk about credit. Their frustration with the banking system \nand Wall Street is pretty deep and pretty intense. Anger, frustration--\nI will not speak for them, to be sure. But it is pretty clear that Wall \nStreet has not served them well and has not served this country well.\n  As I said, I know we need to fix some things about this bill. A guy \nyears ago told me: Don't tell me what you believe. Show me what you do; \nI will tell you what you believe.\n  When I listen to leadership on the other side, especially to our \ncolleague from Kentucky, I really do watch what he does, not just what \nhe says. I know he says this bill does not work because it will mean \nmore bailouts. That is battle tested, focus group tested, poll tested. \nThat is the right thing to say you are against the bill.\n  But more than that, I watch what he does, and I watch what \nRepublicans have done on this bill. Back in December 100 bank lobbyists \nmet with Republican leadership in the House to talk about how to defeat \nany kind of Wall Street reform.\n  Earlier this month, Senator McConnell and Senator Cornyn--Senator \nMcConnell, the Republican leader; Senator Cornyn is head of the Senate \nRepublican Campaign Committee--went to New York and met with 25 hedge \nfund and other Wall Street executives to figure out how to defeat the \nbill and to do what--you know, what you would expect. The best way to \nbeat this bill is elect more Republicans. We need help. All of that.\n  So when I hear them talk about bipartisan, that they want a \nbipartisan bill, what they really mean, and I know Senator Kaufman and \nI have talked about this--what they really mean is, we want Wall Street \nto come to the table and help us write the bill. That is what is \nbipartisan, in the same way that ``bipartisan'' in the health care bill \nof the last year was, we want to invite the insurance companies to the \ntable and have them help write the bill.\n  The public wants bipartisan. They want us to work together. They want \nus to cooperate. We do that in a lot of things. But on a big bill like \nthis, the public does not want bipartisan if it means: Let's get Wall \nStreet and the five biggest banks in the country to write this bill and \nthen we can all be happy and let's get along and let's have legislation \nthat way.\n  Then I hear over and over, Senator McConnell, you know, kind of \ngetting a little bit--the leader gets a little upset when he talks \nabout this bill. It is a little bit like when you throw a rock at a \npack of dogs, the dog that yelps is the one you hit.\n  That is kind of what is going on here.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Brown and Mr. Kaufman pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 3241 are located in today's Record under \n``Statements on Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, I yield the floor and suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I have sought recognition to vigorously, \nenthusiastically support the nomination of U.S. district court judge \nThomas I. Vanaskie for the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n  Judge Vanaskie is someone known to me personally for the better part \nof two, perhaps even three decades as a practicing lawyer in \nPennsylvania, as a judge on the Middle District Court. I had the \nprivilege of recommending him, originally, for the district court \nduring the Clinton administration. I have had the privilege of joining \nwith Senator Casey in recommending him to President Obama for the Court \nof Appeals for the Third Circuit.\n  Judge Vanaskie has a spectacular record. He is a graduate of Lycoming \nCollege, in 1975, with a BA degree, magna cum laude; Dickinson Law \nSchool in 1978, cum laude. He was a law clerk to Judge William Nealon \nfrom 1978 through 1980. For those who know Judge Nealon, he is a \nmasterful judge, a paragon, a great person to learn from. Judge \nVanaskie was in private practice in Scranton from 1980 to 1994. He was \nconfirmed to the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of \nPennsylvania on February 10, 1994.\n  Judge Vanaskie has been awaiting confirmation for some time now. He \nhas had his hearing. He was reported out of the Judiciary Committee by \na vote of 16 to 3. He is an outstanding jurist.\n  During the course of the discussions on the Judiciary Committee, \nwhere I have served during all of my tenure in the Senate, there was \nnothing really said in any way which was substantive in opposition. The \ncontention was raised that he has cited foreign law, the law of other \ncountries, but that is in keeping with the decisions of the Supreme \nCourt in the United States, which has cited foreign legal precedents--\nnot that they are binding. They are not the U.S. Constitution. They are \nnot decisions in the U.S. Federal judicial system. But they have been \nrecognized by the Supreme Court as worthy of some consideration.\n  It is regrettable that Judge Vanaskie has been caught up in the \npartisan battle in the Senate. This is a part of a broader picture of \ngridlock in the Congress of the United States, as we have seen the \npopularity and approval rating of Members of the House and Senate fall \nprecipitously because of what America is seeing going on in this body\n\n[[Page S2507]]\n\nand across the Rotunda in the House of Representatives. We see a \nstimulus package where there is very little willingness on the part of \npeople on the other side of the aisle to negotiate with people on this \nside of the aisle. We have seen a health care package enacted into law \nwithout a single vote in the Senate. In the House of Representatives, \n176 Republicans said no and 1 said yes. On reconciliation, all 177 said \nno; all 41 in the Senate said no.\n  There has been a point reached where there is really an issue of \nwhether there can be governance at all with an obstructive minority \nstanding fast. We have seen a slight break in ranks when the issue came \nup on the vacation for the payroll tax. One Republican stood up and \nvoted with Democrats. That led a few others to join. And on \nunemployment compensation, again, one Republican took the lead, and a \nfew others joined. I think it is realistic to conclude that it is the \npressure from back home. There are some on the other side of the aisle \nwho may sensibly calculate--I do not fault them for the calculation--\nbut they have to have some flexibility if they want to return to this \nbody.\n  We have had concerns on Wall Street which are overwhelming with what \nhas gone on in the economy: the precipitous great recession, which has \nengulfed America and has engulfed the world. And for a lengthy period \nof time, there has been resistance to any real negotiation by the other \nside of the aisle.\n  Finally, within the last day or two, there has been some willingness \nto consider legislation on the Wall Street issue, but I think that has \ncome about as a result of public pressure. It is, simply stated, \nimpolitic to be against reforming Wall Street, considering what has \ngone on.\n  It would be my hope these cracks in the die would lead to some \nsubstantial shift in position so we could return to the bipartisanship \nwhich was present in this body when I was elected in 1980. At that \ntime, we had Mac Mathias of Maryland, who was willing to cross the \naisle, and Mark Hatfield of Oregon similarly and John Danforth of \nMissouri, Lowell Weicker of Connecticut and Bob Stafford of Vermont and \nJohn Heinz of Pennsylvania and John Chafee of Rhode Island and Bill \nCohen of Maine, so that when we had the so-called Wednesday club, it \nwas full. That has dwindled so that the moderates can meet in a \ntelephone booth today. We ought to go back to the days of just a little \nbipartisanship.\n  We had an enormous problem in 2005 when the shoe was on the other \nfoot and the filibustering was being done on this side of the aisle. \nFortunately, we were able to work through that problem. There was a \nflirtation with the so-called nuclear constitutional option, which \nwould have changed the rules on filibuster. We preserved the procedure \nof the Senate, the tradition of the Senate, to be the ``saucer which \ncools the tea'' as the expression was used during the colonial days. I \nthink it is very important to maintain that tradition and that \nprocedure. It was the coolness of the Senate which saved the \nindependence of the Federal judiciary and the impeachment proceeding of \nSupreme Court Justice Chase of 1805 and preserved the independence of \nthe Presidency and the acquittal on the impeachment proceeding of \nAndrew Johnson, when a controversy arose with the claim being made that \nthere had to be congressional or senatorial approval to fire a \nSecretary of War, and he barricaded himself in the office. President \nJohnson refused to seek Senate consent to fire the Secretary of War. \nArticles of Impeachment were filed and he was saved by the vote of the \nSenator from Kansas. Growing up in Kansas, there was great pride in the \nState about that courageous Senator who stood and later was defeated. \nMaybe that--I would not make any predictions of the cost of standing \nup.\n  So it is important to maintain the traditions of this body, but we \nhave to do it in the context of capacity to govern. Supreme Court \nJustice Jackson, in a somewhat different context, said the Constitution \nis not a suicide pact. Whatever rules we have are not substitutes for \nour capacity to govern.\n  We have seen this pattern illustrated by the nomination of Barbara \nKeenan of Virginia for the Fourth Circuit. Judge Keenan's nomination \nwas stalled for 4 months, and after the time-consuming process of \ncloture, her nomination was approved 99 to nothing. Well, if she can be \napproved 99 to nothing, why require the filing of cloture? Why tie up \nthis Senate for the better part of 2 days?\n  May the Record show that the distinguished Presiding Officer, the \njunior Senator from Minnesota, is nodding in agreement with my \nstatements. That is a procedure we lawyers use to perfect the Record. \nBut that has been the policy--tying up this body, going to cloture, the \ndelay, and then overwhelming confirmations; not all unanimous but very \nsubstantial, and I predict that is what will happen with Judge Vanaskie \nwhen the roll is called a little later this afternoon.\n  One additional note. These proceedings take a very heavy toll on the \nnominee. Judge Vanaskie is a man devoted to public service. When he was \npracticing law in Scranton, his paycheck was a great deal bigger than \nwhen he became a Federal judge. When he comes into the process of the \nnominating procedure and he is questioned and his writings are impugned \nbecause he follows the Supreme Court of the United States, it is a jolt \nand it is hard on the Vanaskie family and it is hard on the community. \nI have had many calls from the people in Judge Vanaskie's community \nsaying: What is going on in the Senate? What is going on? What is \nhappening? Repeated calls. Finally, I decided to write a column for the \nScranton Times Tribune, explaining what happens in the Senate as to why \nthe delay has occurred.\n  So I am glad to see this brought to a close. I hope we will move the \nappointments of the President. Consideration is being given to limiting \nthe filibuster, not having it apply to members of the administration. \nWe all concede, as a governmental doctrine, the President ought to have \nthe right to name his own team but maintaining the filibuster for \njudicial nominations where we are talking about lifetime appointments. \nBut this is a good and true man and he has been subjected to a process \nwhich is fundamentally unfair. I am glad to see it brought to an end \nthis afternoon.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the copy of the article which I wrote \nfor the Scranton Times Tribune, dated February 26, 2010, be printed in \nthe Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Scanton Times Tribune, Feb. 26, 2010]\n\n                   GOP Delaying Vanaskie Appointment\n\n                           (By Arlen Specter)\n\n       Republican inaction on nominations is paralyzing the work \n     of the Senate and putting the government's ability to \n     confront the nation's challenges at risk.\n       We have seen much obstructionism by the minority in this \n     Congress, but nothing compares to the gridlock on \n     nominations. During President Obama's first year, 46 \n     executive nominees waited at least three months to be \n     confirmed, 45 waited at least four months, and nine took six \n     months or longer. Inaction on these qualified nominees, many \n     in defense-related and national security posts, is \n     unacceptable.\n       This applies to nominations for federal judgeships, many to \n     important or long-vacant jurisdictions. Currently, 14 \n     judicial nominees, who have been approved--in many cases \n     unanimously--by the Senate Judiciary Committee are awaiting \n     confirmation in the face of Republican objections, many of \n     them specious or just plain outlandish. It is time to put \n     partisan politics aside and work to fill these positions as \n     quickly as possible.\n       Take the case of Judge Thomas I. Vanaskie, nominated by \n     President Obama last August to the U.S. Circuit Court of \n     Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Senate Judiciary Committee \n     voted 16-3 in support of his nomination on Dec. 3. More than \n     two months later the nomination still awaits confirmation.\n       Judge Vanaskie's appointment, like so many of this \n     administration's, has been stalled by political posturing. \n     The near certainty of his eventual confirmation only adds to \n     the charade. When Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid recently \n     called for a vote on a long-delayed circuit court nomination, \n     the Republicans voted to confirm unanimously. One \n     legitimately wonders whether partisanship is not the only \n     explanation for the delay.\n       The Senate can force a vote by resorting to the time-\n     consuming step known as cloture, which takes up two days of \n     the Senate's time. If cloture were to be invoked in each of \n     the 67 currently pending nominations that have been approved \n     by committee, it would take most of the year to deal with \n     nominations. This is an intolerable imposition on the \n     Senate's time and business.\n       Judge Vanaskie is eminently qualified to serve on the Third \n     Circuit, as evidenced by\n\n[[Page S2508]]\n\n     his 16-year record on the U.S. District Court for the Middle \n     District of Pennsylvania and the overwhelming bipartisan \n     support he received from the Senate Judiciary Committee. He \n     has built a reputation for consistency and judicial \n     restraint, backed by a first-class legal mind and even \n     temperament.\n       Republican objections to his nomination are specious. One \n     criticism--that Judge Vanaskie inappropriately cites foreign \n     law precedents--was ably explained in his testimony before \n     the Judiciary Committee that he was following Supreme Court \n     decisions when it relied upon foreign sources in Lawrence v. \n     Texas and Roper v. Simmons. In Lawrence, the Supreme Court \n     majority cited the European Court of Human Rights in a \n     decision overruling its own prior precedent on the \n     criminalizing of consensual gay sex. In Roper, the court \n     cited international law to support a ruling striking down the \n     death penalty when applied to individuals who committed \n     murder before they were 18. In short, Judge Vanaskie was \n     merely following the Supreme Court's lead. Following \n     precedent is mandatory, not grounds for rejecting his \n     elevation to the Third Circuit.\n       There is no reason to further delay the nomination of this \n     highly qualified jurist to the Third Circuit Court of \n     Appeals. The Senate should carry out its constitutional \n     duties promptly and promote this eminently qualified judge.\n\n  Mr. SPECTER. I thank the Chair and yield the floor and I suggest the \nabsence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the vote on \nconfirmation of the nomination of Judge Thomas Vanaskie occur at 5:30 \np.m. today, with the time until then divided as previously ordered and \nthe remaining provisions of the order governing consideration of this \nnomination still in effect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. SPECTER. In the absence of any Senator seeking recognition, I \nsuggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Pryor). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I briefly wish to share a few thoughts \nabout Judge Thomas Vanaskie, who has been nominated for the Third \nCircuit Court of Appeals--a very important position. He currently \nserves on the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of \nPennsylvania. I do intend to support his nomination, giving deference \nto the President, but I would just like to share a thought or two about \nhis testimony before the Judiciary Committee.\n  Judge Vanaskie testified he believed American courts should not use \nforeign law in interpreting the Constitution, but he did believe the \nSupreme Court properly used foreign law in cases such as Lawrence v. \nTexas, and I think that is a bit contradictory. He also testified that \nthe Supreme Court properly used foreign law in Roper v. Simmons, where \nthe Court concluded that the Constitution, because of ``evolving \nstandards of decency,'' would now prohibit States from imposing the \ndeath penalty on juveniles who commit murder. I think that is a \nlegitimate public policy issue to discuss, but the question is, Does \nthe Constitution say a State is not able to decide at what age people \nare executed?\n  Judge Vanaskie said, at another point, that foreign law was relevant \nto determining fundamental constitutional rights. Well, our \nConstitution is the one we have, and judges, if they are faithful to \ntheir oath, will enforce our Constitution--the one we have. It is \ndifficult for me to comprehend how somebody could conclude that a legal \naction in the European Union would provide illumination to a judge on \nhow to interpret our Constitution and what the Founders meant and the \nplain meaning of its words.\n  So I think this is a bad philosophy, and it evidences a detachment of \nthe judiciary from the limited role they are given. We have limited \npowers, the President has limited powers, and the courts have limited \npowers. Courts are not empowered to reinterpret our laws and our \nConstitution based on some better idea they think they may find in \nFrance. They are not. This is not a little bitty matter. It is a trend \nthat is occurring in our courts, and I am disappointed that several of \nthe President's nominees seem to be seduced by these ideas, including \nspeeches made by Justice Sotomayor where she talked about how she \nfavored Justice Ginsburg's views about that.\n  So I wish to give this judge the benefit of the doubt. He did say he \ndidn't follow this doctrine to the full extent of it, and I will give \nhim the benefit of the doubt. But also, some of his statements indicate \nthat he may yet be seduced by this idea. He had difficulty articulating \nany limit on the commerce clause. The commerce clause says Congress can \nregulate commerce. Does that mean everything? Does regulating commerce \nmean you can reach down into Oklahoma and tell an individual farmer: \nYou have to have insurance? That raises a serious question of \nconstitutional power, and does that impact interstate commerce? Well, \nyou could theoretically conjure up a way that it could, but I want to \nknow that a judge understands there is some limit to the amount of \nreach the Federal Government can have.\n  We have had a number of people complaining about the process of \nconfirmation and judges languishing before the Senate. In particular, \nmy friend, Senator Whitehouse, noted the nominations of Judge James \nWynn and Judge Albert Diaz to the Fourth Circuit. Senator Whitehouse \nhasn't been here but since 2006, so maybe he isn't familiar with some \nof the procedures that have gone on before. Wynn and Diaz's nominations \nhave been pending in the Senate for only 167 days. That is half the \ntime--half the time--that President Bush's circuit court nominees \nwaited--350 days.\n  In fact, four of President Bush's nominees to the Fourth Circuit \nnever received any hearing, and they were highly qualified nominees. \nThose nominees--Mr. Steve Matthews, Chief Judge Robert Conrad, Judge \nGlen Conrad, and former Maryland U.S. attorney Rod Rosenstein were well \nqualified and had the bipartisan support of their home State Senators. \nYet they were blocked steadfastly from ever moving forward. President \nBush nominated Steve Matthews in September of 2007 to the same seat on \nthe Fourth Circuit for which Judge Diaz has now been nominated and \nexpects to be confirmed--and will be confirmed, I am sure.\n  For Senators to be whining about how long it takes Judge Diaz to move \nalong, in a fairly steadfast way, in light of what was done to Mr. \nMatthews, is a bit much to me, I just have to tell you. We all know \nthis is a robust body. We don't mind speaking our minds. But Mr. \nMatthews had the support of his home State Senators and received an ABA \nrating of ``qualified.'' He was a graduate of Yale Law School, had a \ndistinguished career in private practice, and he waited 485 days for a \nhearing and never got one. So his nomination was returned and expired \nin January of 2009.\n  Another of President Bush's nominees, Chief Judge Robert Conrad, was \nnominated to the seat for which Judge Wynn is now nominated. He had the \nsupport of his home State Senators, received an ABA rating of unanimous \n``well-qualified,'' which is the highest rating. Judge Conrad met \nChairman Leahy's standard for a noncontroversial consensus nominee. He \nhad received bipartisan approval by the committee when he was confirmed \nby a voice vote to be U.S. attorney and later district court judge for \nthe District of North Carolina. He was then chief judge. Senators Burr \nand Dole sent letters in support of that confirmation. Yet he was \nblocked.\n  I know he can make decisions because, if I am not mistaken, I used to \nsay he was the point guard for the University of North Carolina \nbasketball team. I think that was incorrect. I think he was point guard \nfor Clemson. Regardless, anybody who can play a point guard in the ACC \ncan make decisions. He was chosen out of all the prosecutors in America \nby Attorney General Janet Reno to conduct a very sensitive \ninvestigation of President Clinton, when he was accused of some\n\n[[Page S2509]]\n\nwrongdoing. He conducted that and concluded no charges ought to be \nbrought. This was a highly qualified person. Yet he was blocked.\n  My time is up, but I know every nominee is not brought up immediately \nor when some people would want to call up the nomination. It requires \nunanimous consent to bring up a nominee, to immediately get a vote, and \nunanimous consent isn't always given, so it does slow down people. I do \nbelieve we ought not to unnecessarily delay persons, but I would want \nto say that the alacrity by which President Obama's nominations are \nmoving far surpasses anything like the difficulties that President \nBush's nominees had. I have been here, I have seen it, and I know that \nto be a fact.\n  I hope we can create a climate where judges have a reasonable time on \nthe calendar, that they have hearings in the Judiciary Committee, that \nthere is opportunity to raise objections, when they are made, and the \nnominee comes to the floor and eventually can be brought up for a final \nconfirmation vote. That would be my request.\n  I see it is time for the vote, and so I yield the floor.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, the Senate just devoted almost 3 hours to \nthe nomination of Thomas Vanaskie. Senate Republicans demanded this \nextended time for debate. I thank Senator Specter and Senator Casey for \ntheir statements. The Senators from Pennsylvania know Judge Vanaskie \nbest, and strongly support him.\n  I was glad to see Chairman Dodd, Senator Brown of Ohio and Senator \nKaufman come to use some of the time to talk about Wall Street reform. \nThat is what we should be working on. Wall Street reform, patent \nreform, and other matters that are important to the American people are \nwhat we should be debating. I was glad to see that time not wasted in \nanother extended quorum call because those who demanded this time to \ndebate the nomination did not use it.\n  I was glad to hear Senator Hagan talk about the two North Carolina \nnominees to the Fourth Circuit. They are among the 25 judicial nominees \nthat Republicans have objected to considering even though they were \nvoted out of the Judiciary Committee unanimously or nearly so.\n  With respect to the President's judicial nominees, as I have said, we \nare well behind the pace I set as chairman when the Senate was \nconsidering President Bush's nominees during the second year of his \npresidency. By this date in President Bush's second year, the Senate \nwith a Democratic majority, had moved ahead to confirm 45 of his \nFederal circuit and district court judges. So far during President \nObama's Presidency, Senate Republicans have allowed votes on only 18 of \nhis Federal circuit and district court nominations. During the first 2 \nyears of President Bush's Presidency we moved forward to confirm 100 of \nhis judicial nominees. Republican obstruction of President Obama's \nnominations makes it unlikely that the Senate will reach 50 such \nconfirmations. Last year they allowed only 12 Federal circuit and \ndistrict court nominees to be confirmed, the lowest number in more than \n50 years.\n  Today, thanks to the perseverance of the majority leader and the \nSenators from Pennsylvania, we will consider and confirm only the 19th \nof President Obama's Federal circuit and district court nominees. I \nhave already noted Judge Vanaskie's qualifications. There is no dispute \nthat he is well qualified. Indeed, the only concern his opponents have \nraised is their fixation that no Federal judge be aware of foreign law. \nAs Senator Specter has explained, the matter on which Judge Vanaskie is \ncriticized was a case involving an international treaty. To those whose \nideology clouds their judgment, I remind them that the Constitution of \nthe United States, our Constitution, expressly provides that the \njudicial power of the United States extends to cases arising under the \nConstitution, laws of the United States ``and Treaties.'' Treaties are \ninternational by their nature. How treaties are interpreted by other \ncourts in other jurisdictions is relevant. In fact, Justice Scalia \nobserved, when writing for the unanimous Court in Zicherman v. Korean \nAir Lines Co., 516 U.S. 217, 226 (1996):\n\n       Because a treaty ratified by the United States is not only \n     the law of the land, see U.S. Const., Art. II, Sec.  2, but \n     also an agreement among sovereign powers, we have \n     traditionally considered as aids to its interpretation the \n     negotiating and drafting history (travaux preparatoires) and \n     postratification understanding of the contracting parties.\n\n  I appreciate the significant steps taken by the majority leader to \naddress the crisis created by Senate Republican obstruction of the \nSenate's advice and consent responsibilities. Their refusal to promptly \nto consider nominations is a dramatic departure from the Senate's \ntraditional practice of prompt and routine consideration of \nnoncontroversial nominees. The majority leader was required to file \nfive cloture motions to break through the logjam. I, again, urge the \nSenate Republican leadership to reverse its course and its \nobstructionist practices. Those practices have obstructed Senate action \nand led to the backlog of almost 100 nominations pending before the \nSenate awaiting final action. These are all nominations favorably \nreported by the committees of jurisdiction. Most are nominations that \nwere reported without opposition or with a small minority of negative \nvotes. Regrettably, this has been an ongoing Republican strategy and \npractice during President Obama's Presidency. I hope it will now, \nfinally, be abandoned and we will be allowed to make progress after \nweeks and months of delay.\n  The vote on the confirmation of Judge Vanaksie's nomination is the \nfirst vote on judicial nominations that the Senate will hold in 5 \nweeks. Despite the dozens of judicial nominations ready for Senate \nconsideration, none has been allowed to move forward for over a month. \nThese are nominations to fill longstanding vacancies in the Federal \ncourts. Of the 25 pending judicial nominations, 18 were reported from \nthe Senate Judiciary Committee without any Republican Senator voting \nagainst. I have been urging the Senate Republican leadership for months \nto allow votes on these noncontroversial nominations and to enter into \ntime agreements to debate the others. We need to clear the backlog of \nnominations and move forward.\n  Judicial vacancies have skyrocketed to over 100, more than 40 of \nwhich have been designated ``judicial emergencies.'' Caseloads and \nbacklogs continue to grow while vacancies are left open longer and \nlonger. On this date in President Bush's first term, not only had the \nSenate confirmed 45 Federal district and circuit court judges, but \nthere were just seven judicial nominations on the calendar. All seven \nwere confirmed within 9 days. By the end of this month, which is 9 days \nfrom now, we should clear the backlog that Republican obstruction has \ncreated and vote on the judicial nominations stalled on the Senate \nExecutive Calendar.\n  By this date during President Bush's first term, circuit court \nnominations had waited less than a week, on average, before being voted \non and confirmed. By contrast, currently stalled by Senate Republicans \nare circuit court nominees reported by the Judiciary Committee as long \nago as five months, in November of last year. The seven circuit court \nnominees the Senate has been allowed to consider so far have waited an \naverage of 124 days after being reported before being allowed to be \nconsidered and confirmed.\n  I congratulate Judge Vanaskie and his family on what I expect will be \nstrong bipartisan vote in favor of his confirmation to serve on the \nThird Circuit. His confirmation is long overdue.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Franken). Under the previous order, the \nquestion is, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of \nThomas I. Vanaskie, of Pennsylvania, to be United States Circuit Judge \nfor the Third Circuit.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I have not listened to every speech on \nthe Senate floor in the last week or so where there has been a lot of \ntalk about secret holds and everything. But since I have been in the \nSenate working with Senator Wyden in a bipartisan way over the course \nof maybe a decade, not to do away with holds but to have a transparency \nof holds, and seeing those things compromised, and then particularly to \nsee exception taken to what has happened when this side of the aisle \nhas put on holds, and then considering when Senator Wyden and I did try \nto do something, that was gutted by people on the other side of the \naisle. So I would appreciate it if Democratic Members of the Senate \nwould listen while I explore some of the history so that they know this \nbipartisan effort, that if it had been done the way Senator Wyden and I \ndid it before it was gutted, we would not have a lot of problems today \nthat we have.\n  So I wanted to go into my remarks, but I preface it with what I just \nsaid. There has been a lot of talk recently on the Senate floor about \nsecret holds. For a practice with so much bipartisan guilt to go \naround, it is interesting that the discussion has taken on a partisan \ntone. Republicans are being accused of being particularly egregious \noffenders when it comes to circumventing disclosure requirements.\n  Let me say that if any of my colleagues have holds on either side of \nthe aisle, they ought to have the guts to go public and to go public \nthe minute they put the hold on, not like the mysterious way it is done \nnow, which amounts to nothing. It has been my policy for years to place \na brief statement in the Congressional Record each time I placed a \nhold, with a short explanation of why I placed the hold. I did that \nbefore there was ever any Wyden-Grassley proposal. The current \ndisclosure requirements for secret holds have been discussed quite a \nbit lately, as has bipartisan work with Senator Wyden to address the \nissue. It is important I give a little background about how we got \nwhere we are today.\n  After many attempts to work with various leaders over the years on \npolicy to make all holds public, Senator Wyden and I decided the only \nway to settle this matter once and for all was for the full Senate to \nadopt a very clear policy. In the 109th Congress, Senator Wyden and I \nwere successful in passing an amendment to the ethics reform bill by a \nvery wide vote of 84 to 13 to require public disclosure of holds. That \nbill was never enacted, but the identical provision was included in the \nethics bill passed by the full Senate at the very beginning of the \n110th Congress. Members may recall the Democrats had just secured a \nmajority in both houses of Congress. Then, in a process that has become \nall too familiar under the past two Democratic Congresses, there was no \nconference committee. Instead, in a twist of irony, the so-called \nHonest Leadership and Open Government Act was rewritten behind closed \ndoors by the Democratic leadership. Lo and behold, the public \ndisclosure provision Senator Wyden and I had worked so hard on, which \nthe Senate had overwhelmingly adopted on that 84 to 13 vote, had been \naltered, and altered significantly. Keep in mind, under Article I, \nsection 5 of the Constitution:\n\n       Each House may determine the Rules of its Proceedings . . .\n\n  That means that the House of Representatives has no say whatsoever \nabout the Senate rules. When the full Senate speaks on a matter of \nSenate procedure, that should be the final word, particularly if it is \n84 to 13. I want to be clear, the current weak disclosure requirements \nwe now have are not the ones originally proposed by Senator Wyden and \nthis Senator. In fact, at the time I came to the floor and criticized \nthe specific changes, because I saw they would be ineffective. And \nineffective they are.\n  Let me reiterate some of those criticisms I initially aired to the \nSenate on two occasions: August 2, 2007, and September 19, 2007. In the \nversion the Senate originally passed, we allowed 3 days for Senators to \nsubmit a simple public disclosure form for the record, just like adding \noneself as a cosponsor to a bill. This was intended simply to give time \nto perform administrative functions of getting the disclosure form to \nthe Senate floor, not to legitimize secrecy for the period of 3 days. \nThe rewritten provision gives Senators 6 session days. That might not \nsound so bad but wait to see how that actually works out in practice. \nFirst, it doesn't take a week to send an intern down to the Senate \nfloor with a simple form saying one is putting a hold on a bill. The \nchange I find most troubling is that the 6 days until the disclosure \nrequirement is triggered begins only after a unanimous consent request \nis made and objected to on the Senate floor. That is too late. I will \nexplain how that is ineffective. By that point, a hold could have \nexisted for quite some time, perhaps without the sponsor of the bill \neven realizing it. In fact, most holds never get to the point where an \nobjection is made on the floor, because the threat of a hold prevents a \nunanimous consent request from being made in the first place. So maybe \nthis 6 days is never even triggered.\n  The original Wyden-Grassley provision required disclosure at the time \nthe hold was placed. That is where it ought to be today. We have heard \nlately about how the minority party has used the weak disclosure \nrequirements to avoid making holds public. However, this change made it \nfar less likely that majority party holds would ever, in fact, become \npublic. Since the majority leader controls the Senate schedule, he \nwould hardly object to his own request to bring up a bill or nominee. \nHe would simply not bring up a bill or nominee being held up by a \nmember of his own party, and we might never know that there was a hold \non it at all.\n  Why were these provisions changed? Simply, I don't know. I don't know \nwho does know, because I can't be sure who it was who rewrote these \nprovisions in secrecy behind closed doors. The majority party should be \ncareful now, as they complain about Republicans exploiting loopholes in \nthe disclosure requirements for holds. Both parties are guilty of using \nsecret holds. But we can't blame Republicans for the fact that the \ncurrent disclosure requirements are weak and ineffective. Again, there \nis plenty of blame to go around when it comes to using secret holds, \nbut I am hopeful this recent attention to the problem can result in a \nbipartisan consensus to end secret holds once and for all. That is \nsomething we\n\n[[Page S2511]]\n\nhope, Senator Wyden and I, other people will talk to us about. We would \nlike to move in this direction. I, for one, am happy to work with \nanyone on either side of the aisle to that end.\n  It should be stressed that this has been a bipartisan effort. \nEverybody in this body talks about bipartisanship. When this was \nwatered down, it wasn't watered down in an environment that I know \nabout where any Republicans were present.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Will the Senator yield for a question?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Yes.\n  Mr. WYDEN. First, let me tell the Senator from Iowa how much I have \nenjoyed working with him on this. We have had, as incredible as it \nsounds, a 10-year campaign to try to end secrecy in the Senate, just so \npeople know a little bit about it. I always think when people hear \nabout a hold in the Senate, they probably think it is a hair spray or a \nwrestling move or something like that. Isn't it correct that a hold, \nthe ability to block a nomination or a piece of legislation, is one of \nthe most powerful tools a Member of the Senate has today to influence \npolicy?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Wyden is absolutely right. It is \na very powerful tool.\n  Mr. WYDEN. And with respect to transparency, what he and I have \nfocused on all these years, people asked: Are you trying to abolish a \nhold? I think he and I have said we believe Senators ought to have a \nright to weigh in on something important. But at a time when the public \nwants transparency and openness and accountability, a Senator who wants \nto use what the Senator has said is an extraordinary power, the real \npublic interest is satisfied by that Senator having to disclose \npromptly that they are imposing a hold; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, Senator Wyden is correct. I would add \nthis point, that not only is it transparency that is essential--and it \nhappens that way--but also a lot of times holds are put on because \nthere is something wrong. We have to know what it is somebody believes \nis wrong, if we are going to work out some sort of a compromise.\n  Mr. WYDEN. One additional point, is it the Senator's sense, because \nwe have talked about this often as we have been watching the spectacle \nof all these secret holds, that the central problem is it is triggered \ntoo late and it takes too long to kick in? Is that a fair statement of \nwhat needs to be changed? We need to get the openness earlier? It needs \nto be triggered earlier, and it needs to get into the public domain \nearlier; is that correct?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Senator is correct. The present \nrules are practically not much better than what we have always operated \nunder. So there isn't transparency, and it isn't done soon enough.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I express my appreciation to the Senator from Iowa for \ngiving me the opportunity to work with him. He and I have pursued a lot \nof issues in the past. Very often those issues are part of television \nnews debates and the like. Obviously, the secret hold would not be \nsomething on Main Street in Des Moines or Portland that people know \nabout. This is the time to get this right once and for all. We sought \nto do it literally for a decade. A number of majority leaders, \nDemocratic and Republican, said they wanted to get this done. Yet as of \nthis day, I personally believe it continues to be abused and flagrantly \nso. At a time when the American people are looking at these challenging \neconomic circumstances, they deserve a government that is truly open, \ntruly accountable, and truly transparent. That has been what has guided \nour bipartisan efforts over this last decade. I appreciate the Senator \ncoming to the floor this evening. There are not that many opportunities \nto advance a truly bipartisan agenda. He has given us the opportunity \nto do that tonight.\n  I look forward to working with my colleague to once and for all get \nsecret holds abolished in the Senate.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich). The Senator from Oregon.\n  Mr. WYDEN. I ask unanimous consent to speak for up to 10 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, to continue this topic, we need to kind of \nput into perspective a little bit about why this secret hold has become \nsuch a detrimental practice. When Willy Sutton was asked why he robbed \nthe bank, he said: That's where the money is. Secret holds are where \nthe power is. Senator Grassley and I have outlined the enormous effect \na secret hold can have on a piece of legislation but, frankly, one of \nthe other points that needs to be made is that a secret hold is a very \npowerful weapon that is available to a lobbyist.\n  I expect that practically every Senator has gotten a request from a \nlobbyist asking if the Senator would put a secret hold on a bill or \nnomination in order to kill it without getting any public debate and \nwithout the lobbyist's fingerprints appearing anywhere. If you can get \na U.S. Senator to put an anonymous hold on a bill, it is like hitting \nthe lobbyist jackpot. Not only is the Senator protected by a cloak of \nanonymity but so is the lobbyist.\n  A secret hold lets lobbyists play both sides of the street and can \ngive lobbyists a victory for their clients without alienating potential \nor future clients. Given the number of instances where I have heard a \nlobbyist asking for secret holds, I am of the view that secret holds \nare a stealth extension of the lobbying world.\n  In the U.S. Senate, there has been an effort to improve the rules and \nhave stricter ethics requirements with respect to lobbyists. It seems \nto me it would be the height of irony if the Senate were to adopt a \nvariety of changes to curtail lobbying, as we have done in the past, \nwithout doing away with what, in my view, is one of the most powerful \ntools that can be available to lobbyists.\n  The overwhelming majority of our citizens, in every corner of the \nland, be it Alaska or Oregon or Rhode Island, say they want public \nbusiness done in public. If you walk down the streets of this country, \nI do not think you could find 1 out of 100 people who would have any \nidea what a hold is or what a secret hold is all about. But the fact \nis, these secret holds in the U.S. Senate can dramatically affect and \nchange the lives of our citizens, and our people will not even know \nabout it.\n  The hold--the ability to block a piece of legislation, block a \nnomination--cannot even, in a number of instances, end up being \ndiscussed on the floor of the Senate. Literally, the Senate will not \neven get a peek, will not even get the briefest look, at a particular \nissue that may involve millions of our citizens, billions of dollars, \nand affect the quality of life of citizens in every corner of the land.\n  So what this is all about, what Senator Grassley and I have been \nworking for lo, this past decade, what I have heard colleagues talk \nabout--and Senator Whitehouse has spoken eloquently about this--is we \nbelieve now is the time, once and for all, to permanently wipe the \nsecret hold off the rulebooks of the Senate.\n  It is one thing if a Senator exercises the extraordinary power that a \nhold presents. It is quite another when they cannot be held accountable \nbecause they exercise this power in secret. So the average person in \nAmerica may not know what a secret hold is, but I am very certain they \nwant the Senate to do its business in public.\n  I want to express my appreciation to Senator Grassley, who has left \nthe floor, for working with me over this past decade to end what I \nthink is a simply inexplicable denial of the public's right to know. \nThat is what this is essentially about. This is a denial of the \npublic's right to know. With colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I \nam determined to, this time, get this changed, shorten the period, to \nmake it easier to trigger the requirements of public disclosure.\n  Mr. President, I know my colleague from Rhode Island is interested in \ngetting in this issue. I look forward to his comments and yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage for \n5 or 10 minutes in a colloquy with the distinguished Senator from \nOregon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I, first of all, want to salute \nSenator Wyden of Oregon for his long work on this issue. He has been \nworking on this issue since before I came to the Senate, before I had \nany experience of secret\n\n[[Page S2512]]\n\nholds, and saw--as we are seeing right now--their pernicious effect.\n  At present, we are looking at probably a little less than 80 secret \nholds by Republicans of President Obama's nominees--some judges. In the \npast few days, Senator McCaskill and I have come to the floor to push \nsome of these nominees forward, to ask unanimous consent they go \nforward.\n  In one case, a nominee was a judge who was supported by both a \nDemocrat and a Republican--the Senators from his home State--who had \npassed out of the Judiciary Committee by a unanimous rollcall vote of \n19 to 0. They have been held for months and months. The distinguished \nSenator from Arizona, Mr. Kyl, was put in the unfortunate position, \nsince he had voted for this nominee in committee, to have to come to \nthe floor and raise an objection to the unanimous consent request for a \njudge who he voted for in committee and one of his Republican \ncolleagues supported--the home State Senator supported--to have to \nobject to that nomination going forward because somebody had a secret \nhold.\n  We went through a great deal of these. I want to salute Senator \nMcCaskill. She carried the greater part of the burden. I only tried to \nmove a few. I think she tried to move over 70 by the time the day was \ndone. I really want to extend my appreciation to her for that.\n  I say to Senator Wyden, as I understand it, the rule is that now that \nthese unanimous consent requests have been made, there is a 6-day-of-\nsession period that has now begun to run, and at the end of that 6 \ndays, our Republican colleagues will be obliged to disclose publicly \ntheir holds, who is holding it, and what their reason is.\n  I understand there is a potential loophole, which is they could pull \nsort of the old switcharoo, and in the 6-day period the Senator or \nSenators with the hold could all release their hold so that at the end \nof the 6-day period they have no hold to disclose, but they could \nconnive with another colleague to put in a new hold, since the \nunanimous consent request, so they can start the process all over and \nhide their accountability.\n  But it strikes me those are really the only two choices our \nRepublican colleagues have: They either have to divulge or they have to \nengage in a game of switcharoo, connivance with another Republican \ncolleague to try to duck out from under the rule which was passed I \nthink by 92 votes. It has very strong bipartisan support.\n  I say to Senator Wyden, I just wanted to clear that understanding \nwith the Senator since he is an expert on this issue, that the clock is \nrunning, that they have 6 days to come clean about this; and that the \nonly two ways out are either to divulge or connive with another Senator \nto engage in a little switcharoo.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Or I think there might be a third option, of course, which \nis to lift the hold. But the Senator has done a very careful and \nthoughtful analysis of the situation and particularly this situation of \nwhat Senator Grassley and I came to call the ``rotating hold,'' simply \nshifting to another person--something that has been done often over the \nyears by Democrats and Republicans. I think now is the time to get this \nchanged. By the way, the Senator is absolutely correct on the \nbipartisan nature of the rule change. The vote was 84 to 13. There was \noverwhelming bipartisan support for it.\n  The Library of Congress has actually put together a very thoughtful \nhistorical analysis featuring the discussion of things such as the \n``Mae West'' hold, which came to be known as the ``come look me over'' \nhold, which I gather was not a full-fledged hold but it might actually \nblossom into one.\n  So the Senator is absolutely right about what the choices are. That \nis why it is time, once and for all, to get this changed. I so \nappreciate the Senator, and also Senator McCaskill from Missouri, \ncoming and highlighting the fact that this has again gotten out of \nhand.\n  The historical analysis of this has been that the hold was something \nthat would be used rarely. The hold was for something of great \nconsequence. Yet now it seems we have these secret holds that are \nsimply thrown out for nominations and pieces of legislation because \nsomeone has some modest interest or is carrying out a different agenda, \nand I think that is why the secrecy is so unfortunate.\n  I thank my colleague.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. So to have 80 secret holds by one party, all at once \npending in the Senate, is not consistent with the history of the use of \nthis procedural tactic in this body. Is my understanding correct?\n  Mr. WYDEN. The Senator is absolutely right about the fact that 80 \nsecret holds is clearly not what Senator Grassley and I and reformers \nthought would happen. Given all these secret holds, you would think at \nthe back of the Executive Calendar--which is page 19; it is entitled \n``Notice of Intent to Object to Proceeding''--given what the \ndistinguished Senator from Rhode Island has pointed out, one would \nthink that page 19, ``Notice of Intent to Object to Proceeding,'' would \nbe filled with these names if the rule was being honored.\n  I say to the Senator, both you and I are holding up this page 19 with \nnary a word on it.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. We are looking at an empty page.\n  So just to summarize, the clock has run as a result of this series of \nunanimous consent requests Senator McCaskill and I have put forward. \nThe 6 days have begun. By the end of that, one of three things--as the \nSenator has corrected me--will have happened. Either the hold will have \nbeen lifted, and then we can move to unanimous consent and clear these \nindividuals who the President has nominated and get them to work for \nthe American people or, two, the Senator who has the secret hold will \nhave to acknowledge publicly and become transparent and clear and \ncandid with the rest of the body about who they are holding and why, \nor, three, they can engage in this rather obscure, shall we say, game \nof rotating holds, what I called the switcharoo, ducking out before the \ntime runs and getting somebody else to actually have your hold for you \nbut get in a proxy.\n  Given this was a rule that was adopted with a very strong vote, a \nvery strong bipartisan vote, and that it is now a rule of the Senate, \nwhat comment would the Senator have on that third tactic in terms of \nits merit and appropriateness, if we find it is being used at the end \nof the 6 days? Would that spur the need for reform of this rule?\n  Mr. WYDEN. It surely would. I am grateful to the Senator from Rhode \nIsland for prosecuting the reform case. I have talked with Senator \nGrassley about it, and with Senator McCaskill and the Senator, and I \nthink this is the time.\n  There are two points with respect to the secret hold: one as it \nrelates to the institution and one as it relates to an individual \nSenator. With respect to the institution, in this example, the Senator \nhas given us scores of these secret holds. I think this serves to \nundermine the credibility of the institution at a crucial time in \nAmerican history. It is no secret Americans are divided on a host of \nissues.\n  Well, if the Senate insists on doing so much important business in \nsecret--which is what happens if you honor these secret holds--I think \nthat just undermines the institution. Because I think, first and \nforemost, you are absolutely right to zero in right now where we have \nall these secret holds.\n  Secondly, with respect to an individual Senator, what seems \nparticularly important--the Senator and I share an interest in health \ncare and a variety of economic issues--suppose an individual Senator \nworks for years and years to try to build a bipartisan coalition on an \nissue and then is done in by an unknown or secret opponent, an unknown, \nunseen opponent who has been able, in effect, to block all that \nbipartisan work in secret.\n  So I want the Senator to know I am four-square behind his efforts to \nget this changed. Senator Grassley and I have been talking about it. I \nthink there is an opportunity to make this bipartisan.\n  I will also say, in closing--and the Senator has been kind to give me \nall this time--I do not think the secret hold passes the smell test of \nopenness in American government. It is time to change it. I look \nforward to working with my colleague to finally, after all of these \nyears, get this done and send the secret hold off into the dust bin of \nhistory.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. The legacy of the Senator from Oregon on this, with \n10\n\n[[Page S2513]]\n\nyears of work, is very impressive to this newer Senator. I appreciate \nso much what he and Senator Grassley have done over the years to begin \nto put an end to this practice.\n  I think the straw that broke the camel's back--or maybe the 80 straws \nthat broke the camel's back--was the absolute avalanche of secret holds \nthat has confronted our new President from this Republican minority. It \nhas come to the point where the President, I think fairly, believes his \nability to staff his own administration is being compromised by people \nwho will not stand and be counted and be accountable for the reason for \ntheir opposition. It is being done in the dark, secretly, and without \nany accountability. I agree that needs to be put to an end.\n\n  So I urge people who are watching this: The sixth day has begun--6 \ndays of session. At the end, we will know who is doing this or we will \nbe able to clear these nominees, and we will have broken this \nunfortunate practice, to a significant degree or we will have learned \nsomething I think very unfortunate about our friends on the other side; \nthat is, that they have agreed to connive with one another to play a \nswitcharoo and bring in a new Senator to dodge the clear import of the \nrule that the Senator from Oregon and Senator Grassley worked on, on a \nbipartisan basis, to put into effect in this body and which was \napproved by an enormous majority of this body. So the clock is running \nand we will see. We will learn a lot about this institution and our \ncolleagues in 6 days. I thank the Senator for his leadership on this \nissue.\n  I yield the floor, and I note the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I come to the floor to recognize the \n40th anniversary of Earth Day and to remember the man who founded Earth \nDay, the late Wisconsin Governor and Senator Gaylord Nelson.\n  Before he was the founder of Earth Day, and one of the Nation's \ngreatest conservationists, he was a son of Wisconsin. He was a young \nboy growing up in the town of Clear Lake, WI, amid the great natural \nbeauty of our State. When asked how he developed his lifelong interest \nand dedication to the environment, Nelson would say ``by osmosis'' \nwhile growing up in Clear Lake, WI.\n  He reflected the very best of our State from the beginning, building \non Wisconsin's long tradition of environmental conservation. Our State \npassed landmark forest and waterpower conservation acts during the \nprogressive era and lays claim not only to Gaylord Nelson but to other \ngiants of the conservation movement such as Aldo Leopold, John Muir, \nand Sigurd Olson.\n  All of them were inspired, as Nelson was, by the beautiful Wisconsin \nwilderness. The natural beauty of our State charted the course of \nNelson's life, from the shores of Clear Lake to the banks of the \nPotomac, where he changed the way we think about our planet and changed \nthe law to protect the water we drink and the air we breathe.\n  There are few Members of this body, past or present, who have left \nsuch a valuable legacy. So I am proud to help celebrate that legacy \nwith a resolution in the House and Senate celebrating the 40th \nanniversary of Earth Day and its founder. As we look ahead to the many \nchallenges we face, we can draw strength from the example Gaylord set \nfor us all. He drove tremendous change and, with Earth Day, created a \nnew momentum that has been critical to so many efforts to protect the \nhealth of our environment.\n  Gaylord also understood the connection between the two great \nWisconsin traditions of fiscal responsibility and conservation. Too \noften, a Federal program that is wasting taxpayer dollars is also \nlaying waste to our air, our water or our public lands. The Nation's \noutdated mining laws are a perfect example. These laws allow the mining \ncompanies to mine on our public lands for next to nothing and leave \nbehind an environmental mess for taxpayers to clean up.\n  Gaylord fought to change those laws, and when I was elected to the \nSenate, he asked me to take up this fight and I have. I have made it \npart of my Control Spending Now Act, legislation to cut the deficit by \nabout $\\1/2\\ trillion over the next 10 years. If we scrap these \noutdated mining laws, we can save taxpayers hundreds of millions of \ndollars and protect the public lands that belong to the American \npeople. They do not belong to the mining companies.\n  I am also working on another environmental issue that has a special \nconnection to Gaylord Nelson; that is, clean water. The man from Clear \nLake did so much for clear, clean water everywhere, including being a \nchampion of the Clean Water Act.\n  Today, the Clean Water Act is under threat because two recent Supreme \nCourt decisions have jeopardized its protections. Those decisions put \nnearly 20 million acres of wetlands habitat and more than 50 percent of \nour stream miles in the lower 48 States at risk. These waters could now \nbecome polluted or wiped out altogether unless Congress takes action.\n  I am working to see that Congress stands up to the special interests \nthat want to roll back the Clean Water Act's protections and ensure \nthat these bodies of water can continue to provide drinking water, \nwildlife habitat, recreation, and support for industry and agriculture \nfor generations of Wisconsinites to come.\n  So I have joined with Minnesota Representative Jim Oberstar to \nintroduce the Clean Water Restoration Act. This bill is designed to \naccomplish one basic and important goal: ensure that the Clean Water \nAct of 1972 stays in place. There are no new regulations in our \nlegislation, only a return to the original intent of the Clean Water \nAct, which has protected our waters for more than 35 years.\n  Gaylord Nelson and others have done so much to protect the health of \nour waters, and we owe it to them and to ourselves to carry that legacy \nforward. That is what I seek to do in the Senate with the Clean Water \nRestoration Act.\n  We face many other challenges as well. Of course, climate change \nlooms largest of all. We need to address the serious problem of climate \nchange and do so without unfairly hurting Wisconsin, which relies on \ncoal for much of its energy needs. If we do this right, we have an \nopportunity to pass legislation that will reduce greenhouse gas \nemissions and create energy jobs here in America. We can help American \nbusinesses gain a competitive advantage developing new renewable energy \nand energy efficient technologies.\n\n  The desire to protect our air, our water, and our planet will bring \npeople together tomorrow, all around the world. They will talk about \nglobal issues we face and the local environmental issues in their \ncommunities that they want to address. They will organize, mobilize, \nand galvanize new momentum for change.\n  That is exactly what Gaylord Nelson intended. He knew the power of \npeople coming together and what that could mean for the air we breathe, \nthe water we drink, and the national parks and public lands we all \ncherish. He knew that these natural resources connect us all and that \nEarth Day would bring us together to protect them.\n  I am so grateful to have known Gaylord Nelson, and I am proud of the \nlegacy he left behind. As we celebrate the 40th anniversary of Earth \nDay, we remember the man from Clear Lake who came to this body inspired \nby the beautiful Wisconsin landscape of his childhood and in the end \nmade a better world for us all.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n[[Page S2514]]\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I would say to my distinguished friend from \nWisconsin, I was delighted to hear those words about Gaylord Nelson. I \nhad the privilege of serving for a term with Senator Nelson. He was \ndown-to-earth, respected by all in this body, and he had a commitment \nto the environment rarely ever matched. The Senator from Wisconsin has \nsaid it far more eloquently than I could. But I think how fortunate we \nare that we have this Senator from Wisconsin who has carried out that \ncommitment to the environment, that commitment to the best ideals of \nour government. I know our dear, departed friend Gaylord Nelson would \nbe so proud to have the Senator here representing Wisconsin.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, let me thank the Senator from Vermont \nfor his kind words, for his remembering Gaylord Nelson, and, of course, \nfor the incredible legacy of his own for the environment, coming from \none of the most beautiful States in this country, Vermont. I thank him.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/21/senate-section/article/S2514-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               95TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE ARMENIAN GENOCIDE\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, we teach our children that genocide, \nwherever it occurs, is a crime against humanity that must never be \ntolerated or ignored. That is why it is so important for the United \nStates to always recognize genocide for what it is and acknowledge when \nit takes place.\n  Between 1915 and 1923, the Ottoman Empire carried out genocide \nagainst the Armenian people. However, the United States has yet to \nrecognize this stain on history by its rightful name despite an \nirrefutable body of evidence documenting the atrocities.\n  Diplomats, members of the military, humanitarians, journalists and \nothers from the United States and around the world saw with their own \neyes the deportation, starvation, drowning and murder of an estimated \n1.5 million Armenians. And there are countless testimonies from victims \nwho lived to tell of their experiences.\n  The American Ambassador to the Ottoman Empire, Henry Morganthau, \nwrote:\n\n       When the Turkish authorities gave the orders for these \n     deportations, they were merely giving the death warrant to a \n     whole race; they understood this well, and in their \n     conversations with me, they made no particular attempt to \n     conceal the fact.\n\n  There were great efforts made by Americans to relieve the suffering \nof the victims of what would become the first genocide of the 20th \ncentury. Powerful leaders of industry and government did speak out. \nSchoolchildren and poor families contributed mightily to try to save \nlives by donating whatever they could. American farmers sent food to \nreduce starvation.\n  Yet in the 95 years since the Armenian Genocide began, the word \n``genocide'' has not been used by the United States to describe the \natrocities carried out against the Armenians.\n  The United States has always been a beacon to the world--standing up \nfor what is right and just. Now is the time for the United States to \njoin countries such as Argentina, Belgium, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, \nFrance, Greece, Italy, Lebanon, Lithuania, the Netherlands, Poland, \nRussia, Slovakia, Sweden, Switzerland, Uruguay, Venezuela, and more \nthan 40 U.S. States and unequivocally affirm the Armenian Genocide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/21/senate-section/article/S2514-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2514]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO RITA McCAFFREY\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, a distinguished and giving Vermonter will \nbe retiring after nearly 40 years of working on behalf of Vermont's \nprisoners and former prisoners. Rita Whalen McCaffrey is stepping down \nin May as the Executive Director of Dismas of Vermont, a residential \nprogram that helps former prisoners transition and reintegrate into \nsociety. Opened in Burlington in 1986, Dismas of Vermont has grown to \nprovide supportive housing in three homes and three satellite \napartments in the Burlington and Rutland communities, and has served \nmore than a thousand men and women in the past 25 years.\n  Rita has engaged hundreds of Vermonters from all walks of life \nthrough the years to actively participate in the Mission of Dismas: to \nreconcile former prisoners with society and society with former \nprisoners through participation in a supportive family-like community. \nThe Dismas model Rita founded in Vermont is powered by volunteers who \ncook and share the evening meal, choose to live in the community with \nthe residents, and participate as active board members. The act of \nmutual reconciliation happens because community members come into the \nhome and become a part of the Dismas family.\n  Rita's strong commitment to building and encouraging community \nsupport for former prisoners exemplifies the charitable spirit that has \nmade Vermont one of the best places in the country to live. Her efforts \nhave changed the direction of many lives and encouraged many to work \ntowards reconciliation and respect. By steering former prisoners away \nfrom crime and toward a more constructive path, her work has also made \nthe community a safer and better place to live. She leaves a legacy \nthat is as inspiring as it is impressive, and her successor will have \nlarge shoes to fill.\n  As she moves on from a career path that began in 1974, I congratulate \nRita for her invaluable service and leadership and I wish her a happy \nretirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/21/senate-section/article/S2514-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2514-S2515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO DR. WILLIAM TORTOLANO\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, one of my fondest memories of my \nundergraduate days at St. Michael's college was getting to know both \nDr. William Tortolano and his extremely accomplished wife Martha.\n  I could tell many stories about the Tortolanos and the times they \nwere also part of the Leahy family. I would rather let a story in the \nBurlington Free Press about his retirement after a 50-year career at \nSt. Michael's speak for me, and I ask unanimous consent that it be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, April 20, 2010]\n\n          St. Michael's College Professor Departs With Concert\n\n                           (By Matt Sutkoski)\n\n       St. Michael's College emeritus professor William Tortolano \n     has made big, varied contributions to the school in his 50-\n     year career there.\n       He's taught humanities and music, directed the chorus, gave \n     and organized countless performances, and even designed the \n     organ in St. Michael's chapel.\n       So it stands to reason his going-away gift to the community \n     is just as varied.\n       The free concert at 7:30 p.m. today in the chapel will \n     feature his beloved organ, even more beloved family members, \n     the Vermont Gregorian Chant Schola, the St. Michael's College \n     Chorale and a wide range of musical selections.\n       Tortolano, 80, is founder and first chairman of the St. \n     Michael's College fine arts department. He also founded the \n     St. Michael's Chorale and was its director for 28 years.\n       Music extends deeply into his personal life. He married a \n     musician, his three children are accomplished musicians and \n     his grandchildren are headed in the same direction, he said. \n     ``They were not forced into it, obviously. This was something \n     they wanted to do,'' Tortolano said.\n       Tonight's concert will feature two of his children, and a \n     grandson, a senior majoring in music at Boston College and a \n     cellist.\n       Tortolano said he had some experience with organ design \n     because he took a course on the subject while at the New \n     England Conservatory of Music, and he has always been \n     interested in the instrument.\n       He designed the organ for the Chapel of St. Michael the \n     Archangel with the structure's acoustics in mind. ``It has to \n     fit the acoustics, the reverberations. You don't buy it at \n     Walmart or anything,'' he said.\n       He completed the organ's design in 1962; the chapel opened \n     in 1964; and the organ was installed in 1966, he said. At the \n     time, it cost $13,500, which in today's dollars would be more \n     than $97,000, according to the Consumer Price Index inflation \n     calculator. That's not particularly expensive for a custom-\n     made organ, he said.\n       St. Michael's College's student body was strictly male when \n     Tortolano joined the faculty. He was in charge of the chorus, \n     but as more women became students, he created a new St. \n     Michael's Chorale in 1970, when the college became co-ed and \n     eventually disbanded the all-male group.\n       Tortolano said the Chorale is among his best memories of \n     his career. True, he performed for the Pope, and at Notre \n     Dame, and Cambridge University. But he said he takes great \n     joy in remaining in touch with past Chorale members and \n     attending reunions.\n       This semester, Tortolano is teaching humanities, but this \n     will be his last year, and the concert is his official \n     retirement.\n       He won't just sit back. ``I feel very good, and I keep very \n     busy,'' he said. He'll continue in music; he'll do workshops \n     and recitals. And, Tortolano says, he'll look back fondly at \n     his five decades at St. Michael's.\n\n[[Page S2515]]\n\n       ``It's been a great experience,'' he said.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/21/senate-section/article/S2515-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                        TRIBUTE TO JANET KURLAND\n\n Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I would like to ask my colleagues \nto join me in recognizing Janet Kurland, a great Baltimore social \nworker, who is being honored next Monday by the Edward A. Myerberg \nSenior Center.\n  For decades, Janet has been a trailblazer in policies and practices \npertaining to the elderly and their families. Among her many \naccomplishments, she was instrumental in establishing the Northwest \nSenior Center in 1976, the predecessor to the Myerberg Center that \nhonors her today.\n  Since first receiving her master of social work degree in the early \n1960s, Janet has set the gold standard for practices in gerontology. \nHer current work as the senior care specialist at the Jewish Family \nServices of Baltimore, a place where she has worked in different \ncapacities for over 40 years, is just one highlight of what has been an \noutstanding career.\n  Janet is a sought-after consultant who has developed manuals and \ntraining courses credited with advancing best practices that have \nbenefited the elderly in housing, life care communities, and health \ncare facilities. Her professional uniqueness lies in her ability to \ncarefully and compassionately assess the dynamics and needs of \nindividuals and families in order to improve the lives of all senior \ncitizens.\n  In 2001, Janet was the first recipient of the Daniel Thursz \nDistinguished Service Award from Kehilla, a Baltimore Jewish communal \nprofessionals association. She is also recognized by her students as an \nexcellent teacher for the post-masters course she teaches at the \nUniversity of Maryland School of Social Work called ``The Aging \nProcess.''\n  Not only has Janet made in impact in Baltimore, but she could easily \nbe called a world ambassador for the elderly as well. She has traveled \nextensively in Poland, Russia, Israel, China, and Kenya to train social \nworkers and to work with elderly populations. She is highly engaged in \nthe world around her and has proven that compassion and care can easily \ntranscend different cultures and language barriers. Her belief that \nelderly people often have an untapped internal capacity to live more \nfully than even they themselves can imagine continues to be an \ninspiration for many people around the globe.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in congratulating Janet on this award \nand in thanking her for her many years of dedicated service to our \nolder population. The Edward A. Myerberg Senior Center, the Jewish and \ngreater Baltimore senior community, in fact seniors around the world \nare benefitting from Janet Kurland's expertise and dedication.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/21/senate-section/article/S2515-2", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Williams, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/21/senate-section/article/S2515-3", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/21/senate-section/article/S2515-4", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2515]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MESSAGE FROM THE HOUSE\n\n\n                          enrolled bill signed\n\n  At 1:30 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mrs. Cole, one of its reading clerks, announced that the Speaker has \nsigned the following enrolled bill:\n\n       H.R. 4360.

A resolution adopted by the Senate of the General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee urging Congress to adopt \n     legislation that would postpone the Environmental Protection \n     Agency's effort to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from \n     stationary sources using existing Clean Air Act Authority; to \n     the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\n                       Senate Resolution No. 200\n\n       Whereas, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) \n     plan to regulate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from new cars \n     and light trucks will trigger the same regulation of GHG \n     emissions from stationary sources like manufacturing \n     facilities, power plants, hospitals, and commercial \n     establishments; and\n       Whereas, regulating greenhouse gas emissions from \n     stationary sources under the Clean Air Act might be a great \n     anchor on manufacturing and the economy in general; and\n       Whereas, the pending EPA effort might burden progress on \n     two of the nation's top priorities, environmental improvement \n     and economic recovery, by imposing onerous permitting \n     requirements that will significantly delay or even eliminate \n     investments in new energy-efficient technologies; and\n       Whereas, over four million jobs were lost in 2009, and the \n     EPA's proposed regulations have the potential to cause even \n     further job losses; and\n       Whereas, the regulatory requirements of the Clean Air Act \n     will overwhelm state agencies, which are not equipped to \n     handle the estimated six million permitting requests \n     anticipated; and\n       Whereas, only Congress can act to avoid the significant \n     costs and burdens imposed by such regulations on stationary \n     sources, which even the EPA admits will lead to ``absurd \n     results'': Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate of the One Hundred Sixth General \n     Assembly of the State of Tennessee, That we hereby encourage \n     the United States Congress to adopt legislation that would \n     postpone The Environmental Protection Agency's effort to \n     regulate greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources \n     using existing Clean Air Act authority until Congress adopts \n     a balanced approach to address climate and energy supply \n     issues without crippling the economy. Be it further\n       Resolved, That an enrolled copy of this resolution be \n     transmitted to the Speaker and the Clerk of the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the President and the Secretary of the U.S. \n     Senate, and to each member of Tennessee's Congressional \n     delegation.\n\n[[Page S2518]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/21/senate-section/article/S2518-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2518]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n              INTRODUCTION OF BILLS AND JOINT RESOLUTIONS\n\n  The following bills and joint resolutions were introduced, read the \nfirst and second times by unanimous consent, and referred as indicated:\n\n           By Mr. SCHUMER (for himself and Mrs. Gillibrand):\n       S. 3236.

A bill to repeal unwarranted provisions from the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act and to more efficiently use taxpayer \ndollars in health care spending; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation to \nrepeal unwarranted and inappropriate ``sweeteners'' that were added to \nthe Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act in the days before final \npassage of the bill.\n  These ``sweeteners'' are unjustifiable and only detract from our \ncollective goal of putting America's health care system on a better and \nmore sustainable path. They also undermine public confidence in the \nlegislative process and in elected representatives in Congress.\n  In some cases, there are valid policy or fairness reasons why certain \nstates or interests may receive seemingly different treatment. But \nseveral provisions were included in the health reform bill that create, \nrather than diminish, inequity.\n  This legislation would repeal four provisions in the Patient \nProtection and Affordable Care Act. These provisions are not supported \nby policy rationales and do not address any inequity in current policy. \nSimply put, they are intended to provide an undeserved windfall to \nspecific states.\n  This legislation also amends one provision in the Patient Protection \nand Affordable Care Act providing increased Medicaid assistance to \nStates recovering from natural disaster. Because there is some \njustification for Louisiana receiving additional help to cope with the \ncontinued aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, my legislation leaves this \nprovision intact, but it decreases the amount of assistance available.\n  I was pleased to support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care \nAct. That law will strengthen America's health care system and reduce \nthe national deficit and the five changes to the law that I am \nproposing would help us better meet those goals.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BROWN of Ohio (for himself, Mr. Kaufman, Mr. Casey, Mr. \n        Merkley, Mr. Whitehouse, and Mr. Harkin):\n  S. 3241. A bill to provide for a safe, accountable, fair, and \nefficient banking system, and for other purposes; to the Committee on \nBanking, Housing, and Urban Affairs.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Mr. President, when you look at Wall Street and \nyou look at the relationship between far too many Senators and Wall \nStreet, that is what got us into this mess. For the last 10 years the \nderegulation of the Bush administration, the people they appointed to \nwatch, such as the head of mine safety in the Bush years was a mining \nexecutive, we paid the price for that, the people in my State, people \nin West Virginia. Too often families pay the price for a government not \naggressive enough to regulate mine safety. We paid the price in this \ncountry because we didn't have a government aggressive enough to make \nthe banks and Wall Street behave. That is why they were able to \noverreach.\n  That is why the legislation Senator Kaufman and I are introducing, \nwith Senators Casey, Whitehouse, Merkley, and others, will address the \nissue of too big to fail. Too big to fail is not what you do if these \nbanks are in trouble, how you pull them apart when they are about to \nfail, and we want to make sure we don't spend taxpayer dollars to bail \nthem out. We make sure they don't hurt the whole financial system. Too \nbig to fail means don't let them get too big. Even Alan Greenspan, \nhardly an ally in regulating the banking system, says too big to fail \nmeans too big. That is what Senator Kaufman and I are addressing in our \nlegislation.\n  Let me give some numbers. Fifteen years ago, the six largest U.S. \nbanks had assets equal to 17 percent, one-seventh. Fifteen years ago, \nthe six largest U.S. banks had assets equal to 17 percent of overall \nGDP. Today the six largest banks have assets equal to 63 percent of \noverall GDP. Three of these megabanks have close to $2 trillion of \nassets on their balance sheets.\n  When that happens, we are setting ourselves up for one more round of \nserious problems. That is why homeowners in Youngstown lost their \nhomes. That is why retirees in Sidney, OH lost a lot of their wealth. \nThat is why workers in Newark, OH lost jobs--because we had a banking \nsystem that was overreaching, excessive, that became too greedy, and we \ndidn't do enough about it.\n  Here is what has happened. The Ohio manufacturers I talked to this \nmorning want to grow. They want to hire people. They have orders. They \nhave capacity. They just can't get loans. Three of the largest banks \nslashed their SBA lending by 86 percent over the last year. SBA loans \nwent from 4,200 in 2007 in Ohio alone to 2,100. At the same time banks \nhave increased their Wall Street trading by 23 percent. Something was \nwrong in the last 10 years. We paid the price in the last 2 years. But \nsomething is still wrong when these banks get bigger and bigger. They \ntrade more and more, and they lend to Main Street less and less.\n  That is why the legislation Senator Kaufman and I introduced with \nseveral other Senators today speaks to this. We need banks to serve \nthis country. Ultimately, it is which side one is on. Are you going to \nside with Wall Street or Main Street?\n  Today in the Agriculture Committee we had Republicans and Democrats \ntogether passing legislation, strong legislation to regulate \nderivatives. It is a first, good bipartisan step. Senator Grassley, a \nRepublican from Iowa, joined all of us on the committee to pass a \nstrong bill, not a bill that Wall Street helped to write but a bill \nthat works for American consumers, American small business, American \nhomeowners and workers.\n  I yield to Senator Kaufman.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. I agree with what Senator Brown is saying. This is a \nvery complex bill. It is a very complex area. But what we are talking \nabout is a very simple proposition. We can either limit the size and \nleverage of too big to fail financial institutions, such as the bill \nwhich Senator Brown and I are offering now will do or we will suffer \nthe economic consequences of their potential failure later. I \npersonally believe breaking apart too big to fail banks is a necessary \nfirst step in preventing another cycle of boom, bust, and bailout. Even \nif they do that, this bill is required if, in fact, we are going to \nlimit too big to fail.\n  This debate is a test of whether the power of that idea can spread \nand gain support. Although it is clearly the safest way to avoid \nanother financial crisis, this idea must overcome tremendous resistance \nfrom Wall Street banks and their politically powerful campaigns against \nany kind of structural financial reform. Moreover, the idea must \novercome the inertia and caution in a Congress drawn to easier ideas \nthat may work. But how much should we gamble that they will work? \nLimiting size and leverage are fail-safe\n\n[[Page S2520]]\n\nprovisions to prevent a dangerous outcome. Senator Brown and I are \nproposing a complementary idea to limit the size and leverage, not a \nsubstitute for breaking the banks apart.\n  The current banking bill has many important provisions we support. \nBut under its approach, we must hope the financial stability oversight \ncouncil can identify systemic risks before it is too late. We must hope \nthat regulators will be emboldened to act in a timely manner when \nbefore, in the recent past, they failed to act. We must hope better \ntransparency in financial data will produce early warning signals of \nsystemic dangers so clear that a council and panel of judges will \nunhesitatingly agree. We must hope that capital requirements will be \nset properly in relation to risks that all too often remain \npurposefully hidden from view. We must hope that resolution authority \nwill work, when we know it has no cross-border authority to resolve \nglobal financial institutions.\n  Under the current bill, we must hope all future Presidents will \nappoint regulators as determined to carry out the same strict measures \npreached belatedly by today's regulators who have been converted by the \ntraumatic experience of their own failures.\n  All rules to restrict excessive risk taking in banking have a half \nlife. That is because the financial sector is full of very smart people \nwith an incentive to find their way around the rules, particularly to \nload up on risk, as this is what provides them their excessive profits \nand gigantic bonuses. I would rather not pin the future of the American \neconomy on so much hope. I would rather Congress act now, definitively \nand responsibly, to end too big to fail.\n  The changes in regulations envisioned today in the bill we are \nproposing would help initially, particularly until the next free market \ncandidate who wins appoints regulators who only believe in self-\nregulation. This bill establishes hard lines. One of the greatest \nsayings is: Good fences make good neighbors. This builds the fences. \nThen we let the regulators do it, and we don't have to worry about the \nPresident picking the right regulators. Our bill would provide a \nlegislative size and leverage restriction that would last far longer \nthan the half life of who is appointed to be regulator. We want this to \noperate for a generation.\n  In 1933, our forebears, after the Great Depression, made hard rules. \nThey passed Glass-Steagall. They set up the FDIC. They set rules \nagainst margins, and they set the uptick rule. We should do no less. \nRemember, when they passed those bills in 1933, they helped us avoid a \nfinancial crisis for almost 50 years.\n  Some argue we need massive banks, but recent studies show that with \nover $100 billion in assets--and by the way, these banks, as Senator \nBrown said, have over $2 trillion worth of assets--financial \ninstitutions no longer achieve additional economies of scale. They \nsimply become dangerous concentrations of financial power that benefit \nfrom an implicit government guarantee that they will be saved if they \nfail. With this implicit guarantee, these firms will continue to have \nevery incentive to use massive amounts of short-term debt to finance \nthe purchase of risky assets. This bill would deal with their ability \nto be able to do that and would stop it. They would go on and be able \nto do this without us. They have done it in the past, and there is no \nreason to think they won't do it in the future until they cause the \nnext crisis and taxpayers must bail them out again. While $100 billion \nbanks would be smaller, they are not small banks. Such banks would have \nno trouble competing around the world.\n  Under this bill, we would still have banks far bigger than even that \nsize. People say: Look at other countries. Look what they are doing. \nJust because other countries subsidize megabanks banks that could send \nthose countries spiraling into a financial crisis should not make us \nwant to do the same.\n\n  Everyone agrees--as the Senator from Arizona said--the most important \nthing is too big to fail. How much can we risk that by doing what other \ncountries are doing, when they are creating banks that are clearly too \nbig to fail? Most people in the oil industry did well under the breakup \nof Standard Oil, including its shareholders, and the breakup of AT \nhelped the telecom industry become more dynamic, competitive, and \nprofitable.\n  The current Senate bill contains many important provisions that \naddress the causes of the financial crisis, but why risk leaving \noversized institutions in place when they potentially are too big to \nfail? Instead, we should meet the challenge of the moment and have the \ncourage to act, as in this bill, to limit the size and practices of \nthese literally colossal financial institutions, the stability of which \nare a threat to our economy. This bill is the best hope to ensure \nfuture decades of financial stability and the livelihoods of the \nAmerican people. This bill will put the days of too big to fail forever \nbehind us.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thank Senator Kaufman.\n  Some people think about this as a pretty big step, to decide we want \nto limit the size of banks. It is not something we like to do. We don't \nwant to do more regulation than we have to. We don't want to tell \nsuccessful companies not to grow. But when we look at what has happened \nin the past, as Senator Kaufman said, we did this right in the 1930s, \nand it protected our financial system, with a few hiccups but no \nserious problems until the end of this last decade, when President Bush \nand the Congress, starting with President Clinton--President Bush \naccelerated it and weakened regulation--repealed regulation and \nappointed, you might use the term ``lapdogs''--that might not be a \nsenatorial sounding word.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Lapdogs is another way of saying people who believe \nself-regulation will work.\n  Alan Greenspan also was quoted as saying we should breakup the banks; \nStandard Oil wasn't bad. At the time he said, after it was over, a year \nlater he gave a speech and said: I really thought self-regulation would \nwork. I am dismayed that it didn't.\n  The way I put it, it is as if there were a whole group of folks, not \njust in the financial regulatory area but all over the government, who \nbasically believed the markets are great. I am a big believer in \nmarkets, but I also like football. The idea that someone would say: \nFootball is great, but those referees keep blowing their damn whistles. \nLet's get the referees off the field so football players can be \nfootball players. We know what would happen if we pulled all the \nreferees off the field in a game. I wouldn't want to be in the second \npileup.\n  That is what we said with this. We said we are going to pull the \nreferees off the field and see what happens. These were good people. \nThey just didn't believe they had to regulate, and we are now seeing \nthe results.\n  People say to us, when we propose these things--I have had several \npress people say to me--why don't we leave it up to the regulators? \nThey can set these numbers. We shouldn't set these numbers.\n  Let me read from a couple things. The 1970 Bank Holding Company Act \namendments gave the Fed the power to terminate a company's authority to \nengage in nonbanking activities, basically doing what we are talking \nabout doing, if it finds such action is necessary to prevent undue \nconcentration of resources--I wonder if that went on recently--\ndecreased or unfair competition, conflicts of interest, or unsound \nbanking practices. The Fed had the power to do this. They did not do \nit.\n  The Financial Institutions Reform Recovery Enforcement Act also gave \nregulators the power to restrict an institution's growth and limit its \nsize.\n  What we are talking about now is giving the regulators essentially \nwhat they already have in the present bill. What Senator Brown and I \nare saying--and the other cosponsors--is, the buck stops here. We \nshould tell the regulators what these percentages are going to be. \nBecause if we leave it up to the regulators, as Senator Brown said, \nthese are very powerful people and very powerful institutions.\n  They hire the very best people to come and make their arguments.\n  So if you are sitting there running a regulatory agency and you are \nsaying: Oh my God, I don't want to do this, I don't want to shrink \nthese things down--and remember one other thing too. As bad as things \nwere in this latest crisis, think about what has happened during this \ncrisis. They have all exploded. What did we have happen? JPMorgan Chase \nnow includes Washington Mutual, a $400 billion bank.\n\n[[Page S2521]]\n\nBank of America now includes Merrill Lynch. We can go on from there. \nWells Fargo now has Wachovia. These things were big. We had this mess. \nWe deregulated. We put the regulators in. We changed laws. Now they are \nbigger. As the Senator says, their assets are 63 percent of the gross \ndomestic product of this country. Fifteen years ago, they were 17 \npercent of gross domestic product.\n  What do we have to do before someone sends the message that these \nthings are too big and that this Congress not pass the buck to the \nregulators, who did not do the job in the past? Let me just say this. I \nthink the world of our regulators now. I do not think there are people \nin regulating now who basically believe they should not be regulated.\n  In 1933, we made a decision that helped us through three generations. \nWhat are we doing as Senators on the floor passing legislation based on \nthe fact: I trust my regulators now. Why are we not passing legislation \nthat will work over the next two or three generations--something that \nwill work whether we get a President who believes in the fact that we \nshould have a market or not, whether we have a good regulator or a bad \nregulator? Why shouldn't the Senate of the United States do its job and \nbasically lay out restrictions of the kind that are in this bill so the \nregulators have them? Then they can enforce it. They can do the \nenforcement, which is their job. We should send a clear message to \npeople that this is what we have to do.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. Exactly. I say to Senator Kaufman, you made a \npoint maybe 5 minutes ago that some of the smartest people in the \ncountry are working on Wall Street. There is a huge incentive for smart \npeople to go to Wall Street and be creative and invent new financial \ninstruments to stay, in many ways, a step ahead of the regulators, in \nsome sense, a step ahead of the ``sheriff,'' if you will. Those \nregulators, who are paid probably one-tenth or one-hundredth--\nregulators are paid decent middle-class salaries that most Americans \nwould be very happy with. But some of these very smart people on Wall \nStreet are paid 100 times, 1,000 times--millions, tens of millions of \ndollars, and there is a huge incentive for them to figure out how to \nstay ahead of the regulators.\n  That is why it is so important that we have strong regulators. We \nalways work to do that, and we have good regulators. It is important \nthat a President appoint people who have the public interest in mind, \nwhich Presidents have not always done in the last decade. It is \nimportant that we write different rules, and that is exactly what we \nwant to do to keep these banks from being so big.\n  We had problems with rating agencies that gamed the system. We had \nproblems with mortgage brokers. We had problems with Wall Street. We \nhad problems with people creating these new CDOs and other financial \ninstruments, particularly these so-called synthetic ones that had no \nreal basis in any wealth creation for society, only wealth creation for \neach other. Ultimately, that does not work for Wall Street. It \ncertainly does not work for our country.\n  So in summary, as to this legislation that five or six of us are \nintroducing today, we will likely offer it as an amendment in the next \nweek or two. We ask our colleagues to support it. If we are going to \ndeal with too big to fail, we surely want to deal with it on the end if \nthere are banks that are about to fail. But we need to, sort of, ahead \nof time, in anticipation, deal with it by not letting these banks--no \nmatter how good the regulators are--not letting these banks get too \nbig.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. We just have to give the regulators the tools they need \nto do their job, and the guidelines because we know what these \nguidelines are. These are not really terribly strict guidelines; they \nare just to have the ability to stop what is going on now, to get banks \nback to the size where they can be managed.\n  As Senator Brown said, these banks have a competitive advantage \nbecause when they are too big to fail, not only do we have to worry \nabout bailing them out, but all their interest rate charges are lower. \nWe know that. The interest rate charges on CDs with these major banks--\nthey get higher interest rates than the other banks, and it is unfair \ncompetition for all the other small banks around this country.\n  As I said in the beginning, this is a very simple proposition: Is the \nSenate going to do its job to make sure we have in place the ability to \nkeep these banks from being too big to fail and preparing so we never \nhave to get to the resolution authority?\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. If we do what Senator Kaufman said, if we do this \nright, it will take care of this problem so it does not happen in the \nnext two or three generations, the way people in the 1930s did, or if \nwe do not do it right, we are back at this in 5 or 10 or 15 years.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. By the way, let me say one thing about that. I am not \nfor overregulation. But can you imagine, if we have another problem, \nwhat the regulation would be like then? Do you know what the proposals \nwould be on this floor if, in fact, we have another problem? It would \nbe draconian. It is important for all of us. We all care about our \ncapital markets. One of the things that drive this country and make us \ngreat is the capital markets. We want them to be credible and we want \nthem to be fair and we want them to work.\n  So we want to make sure we do not get faced with this. I think that \nis exactly what Senator Brown and I are trying to do. We are trying to \ndo a little bit of prevention here so we never get to that end of the \nroad where we have to get involved in resolution authority.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. These capital markets which worked so well for \nmany years are not working for local manufacturers, for small \nbusinesses today.\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Right.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thank Senator Kaufman.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      Mr. REED (for himself, Mr. LeMieux, and Mr. Brown of Ohio):\n  S. 3242. A bill to improve teacher quality, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, today I introduce with Senator LeMieux and \nSenator Brown of Ohio, the Teacher and Principal Improvement Act, to \nfoster the development of highly skilled and effective educators.\n  We are slated to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct--ESEA--this Congress for the first time since 2001. My top priority \nfor reauthorization is to build the capacity of our Nation's schools to \nenhance the effectiveness of teachers, principals, school librarians, \nand school leaders.\n  Decades of research have demonstrated that improving teacher and \nprincipal quality as well as greater family involvement are the keys to \nraising student achievement and turning around struggling schools. \nStudies have found that more than 50 percentile points of the \ndifference in student academic performance is attributed to teacher \nquality. The world's top performing education systems invest heavily in \nsupporting and developing teachers. Teachers in top-ranking countries \nsuch as Finland and Singapore get 100 hours of fully paid professional \ndevelopment training each year. It is clear that the United States must \nalso increase its investments in our educators to stay academically \ncompetitive in an ever-expanding global economy.\n  Unfortunately, every year across the country thousands of effective \nteachers leave the profession--many within their first years of \nteaching. A 2003 study by Richard Ingersoll found that one-third of all \nnew teachers quit after three years. That turnover rate increases to \nnearly half--one out of every two new teachers hired--after 5 years. A \nreport by the National Commission on Teaching and America's Future also \nestimated that the nationwide cost of replacing public school teachers \nwho have dropped out of the profession is $7.3 billion annually.\n  However, research has shown that comprehensive mentoring and \ninduction reduces teacher attrition by as much as half. New teachers \nneed extra support and guidance. As such, our bill would help schools \nimplement the key elements of effective multi-year mentoring and \ninduction for beginning teachers, including rigorous mentor selection; \nongoing mentoring with paid release time; training for mentors; and the \nuse of research-based teaching\n\n[[Page S2522]]\n\npractices such as the National Board for Professional Teaching \nStandards.\n  The bill also significantly revises ESEA's current definition of \n``professional development'' to foster an ongoing culture of teacher, \nprincipal, school librarian, and staff collaboration throughout \nschools. All too often current professional development still consists \nof isolated, check-the-box activities instead of helping educators \nengage in sustained professional learning that is regularly evaluated \nfor its impact on classroom practice and student achievement. Effective \nprofessional development is collaborative, job-embedded, and data-\ndriven. Research has shown that this type of professional development \nhas a positive impact on student learning.\n  Research has also increasingly emphasized the important role that \neffective evaluation systems can play in teacher and principal \ndevelopment. Unfortunately, most evaluation systems nationwide have \nsignificant flaws, including a lack of: clear standards of expected \nperformance; meaningful differentiation of teacher performance; ongoing \nevaluations and classroom observations; and rigorous training of \nevaluators. As such, our Teacher and Principal Improvement Act would \nfor the first time in federal law require school districts to establish \nrigorous, fair, and transparent evaluation systems to assess whether \nteachers and principals are having positive impacts on student \nlearning. If evaluation is done right, it provides teachers and \nprincipals with individualized ongoing feedback and support on their \nstrengths, weaknesses, and areas in need of improvement.\n  Principals and school leaders also have a critical role to play in \nleading school improvement efforts and managing a collaborative culture \nof ongoing professional learning and development. Research has shown \nthat leadership is second only to classroom instruction among school-\nrelated factors that influence student outcomes. As such, this bill \nwould provide ongoing high-quality professional development to \nprincipals and school leaders, including multi-year induction and \nmentoring for new administrators. In this way, we will ensure that \nprincipals and school leaders possess the knowledge and skills to use \nstudent data to inform decisionmaking, communicate with families and \nlocal communities, and design and implement strategies for addressing \nstudent needs, including for students with disabilities and English \nLanguage Learners.\n  Additionally, our bill recognizes the importance of creating \ncompensated leadership opportunities for teachers to take on additional \nroles and responsibilities outside the classroom, which will increase \ncollaboration and the sharing of expertise among teachers and staff and \nimprove instructional practices throughout the school. It also seeks to \ninclude for the first time in law a requirement that districts conduct \nsurveys of the working and learning conditions educators face so this \ndata could be used to better target investments and support.\n  Another precedent set as part of this legislation is that it requires \nan independent, formal review of professional development, mentoring, \nand evaluation programs. This review would look at whether these \nprograms are effectively implemented and raise student achievement; \nretain effective teachers; improve classroom and leadership practice; \nand increase family and community involvement. We must ensure that our \nteachers and school leaders not only have access to high-quality \nprofessional development opportunities, but also know whether or not \nthose programs are actually working to improve classroom practice and \nstudent learning.\n  Lastly, throughout the bill, school district collaboration with \nteachers and staff is viewed as a key element, particularly in the \ndevelopment and implementation of the teacher evaluation system. \nResearch has shown that true ``teacher buy-in'' is an important factor \nin ensuring the sustained success of school reform efforts. In Rhode \nIsland, we have seen in recent months an example of this as the \nProvidence School District, educators, and the local teacher's union \npartnered together to embark on critical school improvement efforts. I \nam pleased that the Administration also has recently recognized the \nimportance of teacher buy-in when it awarded the first Race to the Top \ngrants to Delaware and Tennessee--both states that had applications \nwith nearly 100 percent local teacher union support.\n  I worked with a range of education organizations in developing this \nbill, including the Alliance for Excellent Education; American \nFederation of School Administrators; American Federation of Teachers; \nAmerican Association of Colleges for Teacher Education; Association for \nSupervision and Curriculum Development; Center for American Progress; \nEducational Testing Service; National Association of Elementary School \nPrincipals; National Association of Secondary School Principals; \nNational Board for Professional Teaching Standards; National Commission \non Teaching and America's Future; National Middle School Association; \nNational Staff Development Council; National Writing Project; New \nTeacher Center; New Teacher Project; Pi Lambda Theta; and Teacher \nAdvancement Program. I thank them for their input and support for the \nbill.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bipartisan bill and work for \nits inclusion in the upcoming reauthorization of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3242\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Teacher and Principal \n     Improvement Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS AND PURPOSES.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Teacher quality is the single most important in-school \n     factor influencing student learning and achievement.\n       (2) A report by William L. Sanders and June C. Rivers \n     showed that if 2 average 8-year-old students were given \n     different teachers, 1 of them a high performer, the other a \n     low performer, the students' performance diverged by more \n     than 50 percentile points within 3 years.\n       (3) A similar study by Heather Jordan, Robert Mendro, and \n     Dash Weerasinghe showed that the performance gap between \n     students assigned 3 effective teachers in a row, and those \n     assigned 3 ineffective teachers in a row, was 49 percentile \n     points.\n       (4) In Boston, research has shown that students placed with \n     high-performing mathematics teachers made substantial gains, \n     while students placed with the least effective teachers \n     regressed and their mathematics scores decreased.\n       (5) McKinsey & Company found that studies that take into \n     account all of the available evidence on teacher \n     effectiveness suggest that students placed with high-\n     performing teachers will progress 3 times as fast as those \n     placed with low-performing teachers.\n       (6) A 2003 study by Richard Ingersoll found that new \n     teachers, not just those in hard-to-staff schools, face such \n     challenging working conditions that nearly one-half leave the \n     profession within their first 5 years, one-third leave within \n     their first 3 years, and 14 percent leave by the end of their \n     first year.\n       (7) A report by the National Commission on Teaching and \n     America's Future estimated that the nationwide cost of \n     replacing public school teachers who have dropped out of the \n     profession is $7,300,000,000 annually.\n       (8) Research by Thomas Smith, Richard Ingersoll, and \n     Anthony Villar has shown that comprehensive mentoring and \n     induction reduces teacher attrition by as much as one-half \n     and strengthens new teacher effectiveness.\n       (9) A recent School Redesign Network at Stanford University \n     and National Staff Development Council report by Linda \n     Darling-Hammond, Ruth Chung Wei, Alethea Andree, Nikole \n     Richardson, and Stelios Orphanos found that--\n       (A) a set of programs that offered substantial contact \n     hours of professional development (ranging from 30 to 100 \n     hours in total) spread over 6 to 12 months showed a positive \n     and significant effect on student achievement gains; and\n       (B) intensive professional development, especially when it \n     includes applications of knowledge to teachers' planning and \n     instruction, has a greater chance of influencing teacher \n     practices, and in turn, leading to gains in student learning. \n     Such intensive professional development has shown a positive \n     and significant effect on student achievement gains, in some \n     cases by approximately 21 percentile points.\n       (10) Recent reports from the Center for American Progress, \n     Education Sector, Hope Street Group, and the New Teacher \n     Project have collectively demonstrated the significant flaws \n     in current teacher evaluation and\n\n[[Page S2523]]\n\n     implementation, and the necessity for redesigning these \n     systems and linking such evaluation to individualized \n     feedback and substantive targeted support in order to ensure \n     effective teaching.\n       (11) Research by Kenneth Liethwood, Karen Seashore Louis, \n     Stephen Anderson, and Kyla Wahlstrom found that--\n       (A) leadership is second only to classroom instruction \n     among school-related factors that influence student outcomes; \n     and\n       (B) direct and indirect leadership effects account for \n     about one-quarter of total school effects on student \n     learning.\n       (12) Research by Charles Clotfelter, Helen Ladd, Kenneth \n     Leithwood, and Anthony Milanowski has shown that the quality \n     of working conditions, particularly supportive school \n     leadership, impacts student academic achievement and teacher \n     recruitment, retention, and effectiveness.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are to build \n     capacity for developing effective teachers and principals in \n     our Nation's schools through--\n       (1) the redesign of teacher and principal evaluation and \n     assessment systems;\n       (2) comprehensive, high-quality, rigorous multi-year \n     induction and mentoring programs for beginning teachers, \n     principals, and other school leaders;\n       (3) systematic, sustained, and coherent professional \n     development for all teachers that is team-based and job-\n     embedded;\n       (4) systematic, sustained, and coherent professional \n     development for school principals, other school leaders, \n     school librarians, paraprofessionals, and other staff; and\n       (5) increased teacher leadership opportunities, including \n     compensation for teacher leaders who take on new roles in \n     providing school-based professional development, mentoring, \n     rigorous evaluation, and instructional coaching.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       Section 9101 of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act \n     of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 7801) is amended--\n       (1) by striking paragraph (34) and inserting the following:\n       ``(34) Professional development.--The term `professional \n     development' means comprehensive, sustained, and intensive \n     support, provided for teachers, principals, school \n     librarians, other school leaders, and other instructional \n     staff, that--\n       ``(A) fosters collective responsibility for improved \n     student learning;\n       ``(B) is designed and implemented in a manner that \n     increases teacher, principal, school librarian, other school \n     leader, paraprofessional, and other instructional staff \n     effectiveness in improving student learning and strengthening \n     classroom practice;\n       ``(C) analyzes and uses real-time data and information \n     collected from--\n       ``(i) evidence of student learning;\n       ``(ii) evidence of classroom practice;

A bill to require U.S. Customs and Border Protection to \nadminister polygraph examinations to all applicants for law enforcement \npositions with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, to require U.S. \nCustoms and Border Protection to complete all periodic background \nreinvestigations of certain law enforcement personnel, and for other \npurposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. PRYOR. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the related \nproblems of corruption at the U.S. border with Mexico, turf wars \nbetween Federal investigators of corruption, and inadequate screening \nfor corruption of law enforcement personnel. Solving these problems is \ncrucial to ensuring we have a system that keeps drugs out, guns in, and \nmaintains an effective defense against efforts by drug cartels to \ninfiltrate parts of the Department of Homeland Security tasked with \nborder security.\n  The Mexican cartels that dominate drug trafficking into the U.S. are \nsophisticated, ruthless, and well-funded. They operate widely in Mexico \nthrough bribery and corruption and smuggle up to $25 billion of illegal \ndrugs as well as people into the U.S. They also smuggle illegal guns \nand drug money back into Mexico. In 2009, drug violence in Mexico \nresulted in over 9,600 murders. Already this year there have been over \n3,300 murders. Some of the illegal drugs and money goes to and through \nmy State of Arkansas.\n  The cartels used to operate differently in the U.S. relying mostly on \nstealth and a U.S. distribution network that reportedly includes \noperations in an estimated 230 American cities. In my State, the \nnetwork includes the cities of Little Rock, Fort Smith and \nFayetteville. The heightened U.S. border defenses have put a squeeze on \ncartels. They have tried to regain an advantage by exporting to the \nU.S. their experience and success in bribing and corrupting government \nofficials who can facilitate their business.\n  Today, I am introducing legislation and sending a letter with three \nother\n\n[[Page S2527]]\n\nsenators to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security to \nreverse what has become a successful campaign by drug cartels to \ninfiltrate U.S. law enforcement. At risk here is more than drug \ntrafficking. National security is also threatened because border \nweaknesses can be exploited by terrorists to transport operatives and \nweapons into the U.S.\n  At a recent hearing I chaired in a subcommittee of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, witnesses revealed that while an array of U.S. \nGovernment agencies have been targeted for infiltration by the cartels, \nthe U.S. Customs and Border Protection, known as CBP, has been \nshockingly susceptible to the threat. Federal investigators testified \nthat 129 CBP officials have been arrested on corruption charges since \n2003. In addition, the DHS Inspector General opened 576 allegations of \ncorruption within CBP in 2009. Now, the vast majority of CBP officers \nare good, decent, hard-working people. That is why we need to help them \nroot out those that are corrupting the system.\n  Some of CBP's susceptibility to infiltrate is the result of the high-\nthreat environment in which CBP works. But it is also because the \ndramatic increases in staff levels since 2003--which is a good thing--\nmeans that the agency doesn't always meet its own guidelines for \nscreening of job applicants and existing employees. That is not as \ngood, and we need to take action to make sure that the processes in \nplace to uncover infiltration and corruption are effective.\n  Established personnel integrity policies call for polygraph \nexaminations and background investigations of all job applicants for \nCBP law enforcement positions as part of the screening process prior to \nbeing offered employment, however less than 15 percent received the \nfull screening in 2009. CBP also has a 10,000 person backlog on these \nreinvestigations of existing personnel.\n  There are also indications that there may be coordination and \ninformation sharing problems between the DHS components responsible for \ninvestigating corruption. Evidence of these problems include a December \n16, 2009, memo from the DHS Inspector General's office and a March 30, \n2010, Washington Post article detailing a lack of coordination between \nFederal investigators regarding corruption cases.\n  As we seem to learn over and over again, cooperation and coordination \nby Federal, state, and local law enforcement is essential to \nidentifying and defeating threats to our national security. The threat \nof infiltration by drug cartels is no different.\n  I am deeply concerned that the department responsible for the \nsecurity of our homeland is falling short in these important areas.\n  To address these problems, I am sending a letter along with Senators \nFeingold, Wyden, and Burris to DHS Secretary Napolitano requesting that \nshe resolve turf issues between investigators and integrity screening \nshortcomings at CBP. I ask unanimous consent that this letter be \ninserted in the Record after my statement.\n  I am also introducing the Anti-Border Corruption Act of 2010. My bill \nrequires DHS to address the integrity screening problems at CBP and \nmake progress reports to Congress. Specifically, it requires that DHS \ntake such actions as necessary to ensure that the backlog of periodic \nbackground investigations is cleared up within 60 days. It also \nrequires job applicants to receive the polygraph test as required by \nDHS policy within 2 years.\n  Finally, I close with a message about and to the men and women at \nCustoms and Border Protection. Despite the unfortunate actions of a few \nthat dishonor a proud tradition at CBP, we know the vast majority of \nCBP employees are patriotic, honest, and hard-working. We know and \nvalue the contribution they make to the safety of America and the risks \nthat they take on our behalf. They deserve and have our thanks, \nsupport, and commitment to help them weed out bad elements in their \norganization.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the additional material was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3243\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Anti-Border Corruption Act \n     of 2010''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) According to the Office of the Inspector General of the \n     Department of Homeland Security, since 2003, 129 U.S. Customs \n     and Border Protection officials have been arrested on \n     corruption charges and, during 2009, 576 investigations were \n     opened on allegations of improper conduct by U.S. Customs and \n     Border Protection officials.\n       (2) To foster integrity in the workplace, established \n     policy of U.S. Customs and Border Protection calls for--\n       (A) all job applicants for law enforcement positions at \n     U.S. Customs and Border Protection to receive a polygraph \n     examination and a background investigation before being \n     offered employment; and\n       (B) relevant employees to receive a periodic background \n     reinvestigation every 5 years.\n       (3) According to the Office of Internal Affairs of U.S. \n     Customs and Border Protection--\n       (A) in 2009, less than 15 percent of applicants for jobs \n     with U.S. Customs and Border Protection received polygraph \n     examinations;\n       (B) as of March 2010, U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n     had a backlog of approximately 10,000 periodic background \n     reinvestigations of existing employees; and\n       (C) without additional resources, by the end of fiscal year \n     2010, the backlog of periodic background reinvestigations \n     will increase to approximately 19,000.\n\n     SEC. 3. REQUIREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO ADMINISTERING POLYGRAPH \n                   EXAMINATIONS TO LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL OF \n                   U.S. CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION.\n\n       The Secretary of Homeland Security shall ensure that--\n       (1) by not later than 2 years after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, all applicants for law enforcement \n     positions with U.S. Customs and Border Protection receive \n     polygraph examinations before being hired for such a \n     position; and\n       (2) by not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n     initiates or completes all periodic background \n     reinvestigations for all law enforcement personnel of U.S. \n     Customs and Border Protection that should receive periodic \n     background reinvestigations pursuant to relevant policies of \n     U.S. Customs and Border Protection in effect on the day \n     before the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROGRESS REPORT.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, and every 180 days thereafter through the date that \n     is 2 years after such date of enactment, the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security shall submit to the Committee on Homeland \n     Security and Governmental Affairs of the Senate and the \n     Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives a report on the progress made by U.S. Customs \n     and Border Protection toward complying with section 3.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                   April 21, 2010.\n     Hon. Janet Napolitano,\n     Secretary, Department of Homeland Security, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Napolitano: In a recent hearing in the \n     Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Subcommittee on \n     State, Local, and Private Sector Preparedness and Integration \n     on the corruption of U.S. officials by Mexican drug cartels, \n     senior officials of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) \n     testified that drug cartels are specifically targeting and \n     infiltrating federal law enforcement agencies along the \n     southwest border. These corruption activities encompass \n     almost every layer of the DHS border security strategy.\n       Of concern are indications that there may be coordination \n     and information sharing problems that result in duplication \n     of investigative efforts between the DHS components \n     responsible for investigating corruption. Evidence of these \n     problems include the attached December 16, 2009, memo from \n     the DHS Inspector General's office asserting jurisdiction \n     over corruption investigations currently being carried out by \n     the Customs and Border Protection Internal Affairs and a \n     March 30, 2010, Washington Post article detailing a lack of \n     coordination between Federal investigators regarding \n     corruption cases. We ask that you assist these DHS components \n     in developing clearly defined roles and responsibilities \n     regarding corruption investigations to ensure proper sharing \n     of information and prevention of duplicative investigations. \n     It is our belief that cooperation and participation by \n     Federal, state, and local law enforcement is essential to \n     eliminating this growing threat to our national security.\n       Also of concern was testimony regarding significant, \n     growing corruption within U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n     (CBP) where 129 officials have been arrested on corruption \n     charges since 2003. The DHS Inspector General reported that \n     it had opened 576 allegations of corruption within CBP in \n     2009. It appears that CBP has been susceptible to \n     infiltration and corruption because it occupies the front \n     line in the prevention of smuggling\n\n[[Page S2528]]\n\n     and illegal border crossings into the U.S., its dramatic \n     increases in staff levels since 2003, and DHS not meeting its \n     own guidelines for integrity screening of job applicants and \n     existing employees.\n       Hearing testimony established that although DHS integrity \n     policies call for polygraph examinations and background \n     investigations of all new job applicants for CBP law \n     enforcement positions as part of the screening process prior \n     to being offered employment, less than 15% received the full \n     screening in 2009. Testimony also established that periodic \n     reinvestigations are required of current law enforcement \n     personnel to uncover signs of corruption. CBP currently has a \n     10,000 person backlog of periodic reinvestigations, with the \n     number expected to rise to 19,000 by the end of this year.\n       These shortcomings pose a clear national security risk. We \n     believe this issue requires your immediate attention and \n     would like you to examine and specify what DHS is currently \n     doing to properly address these problems. We look forward to \n     working with you to solve this problem.\n           Sincerely,\n     Russell D. Feingold.\n     Mark L. Pryor.\n     Ron Wyden.\n     Roland W. Burris.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/04/21/senate-section/article/S2528-1", "month": "04", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2528]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\nSENATE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 59--EXPRESSING THE SENSE OF CONGRESS THAT \nTHE UNITED STATES SHOULD NEITHER BECOME A SIGNATORY TO THE ROME STATUTE \nOF THE INTERNATIONAL CRIMINAL COURT NOR ATTEND THE REVIEW CONFERENCE OF \n            THE ROME STATUTE IN KAMPALA, UGANDA IN MAY 2010\n\n  Mr. VITTER (for himself, Mr. Inhofe, Mr. Kyl, and Mr. Crapo) \nsubmitted the following concurrent resolution; which was referred to \nthe Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\n                            S. Con. Res. 59\n\n       Whereas President William Clinton signed the Rome Statute \n     on the International Criminal Court (``Rome Statute'') \n     through a designee on December 31, 2000, but acknowledged \n     ``significant flaws'' in the treaty, and recommended that \n     President-elect George W. Bush not submit the treaty to the \n     Senate for advice and consent;\n       Whereas the ``significant flaws'' identified by President \n     Clinton--including the fact that the International Criminal \n     Court (``ICC'') claims the power to exercise authority and \n     jurisdiction over the citizens of nations that have not \n     ratified the treaty--persist and have not been remedied;\n       Whereas President Bush, through Undersecretary of State for \n     Arms Control John Bolton, notified United Nations Secretary-\n     General Kofi Annan on May 6, 2002, that the United States \n     does not intend to become a party to the Rome Statute and \n     therefore has no legal obligations arising from its signature \n     on December 31, 2000;\n       Whereas the United States Government, acting through its \n     elected representatives, is the sole arbiter regarding \n     decisions on the use of military force in its defense or in \n     the defense of its allies;\n       Whereas the Rome Statute undermines national sovereignty \n     and established principles of customary international law by \n     claiming the authority in certain circumstances to \n     investigate and prosecute citizens and military personnel of \n     a country that is not a party to the treaty and has not \n     accepted the jurisdiction of the court;\n       Whereas the United Nations Security Council--upon which the \n     United States holds a permanent, veto-wielding seat--is \n     conferred under the United Nations Charter with ``primary \n     responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and \n     security'';\n       Whereas the authority of the ICC inappropriately intrudes \n     upon the United Nations Security Council's primary \n     responsibility under the United Nations Charter for the \n     maintenance of international peace and security;\n       Whereas, in September 2009, the ICC Office of the \n     Prosecutor announced that ICC personnel were investigating \n     accusations of war crimes and crimes against humanity \n     allegedly committed by United States and NATO forces fighting \n     in Afghanistan;\n       Whereas the parties to the Rome Statute have failed to \n     establish a definition of the ``crime of aggression'';\n       Whereas the United States Government has at various times \n     been accused of ``aggression'', including the congressionally \n     authorized use of military force against Iraq in 2003;\n       Whereas the Rome Statute would subject United States \n     citizens and military personnel charged with crimes before \n     the ICC to trial and punishment without the basic rights and \n     protections provided to criminal defendants and guaranteed by \n     the United States Constitution, including a right to a jury \n     trial by one's peers, protection from double jeopardy, the \n     right to confront one's accusers, and the right to a speedy \n     trial;\n       Whereas the first Review Conference on the Rome Statute \n     will be held in Kampala, Uganda from May 31 to June 11, 2010, \n     to consider amendments to the Rome Statute and to take stock \n     of its implementation and impact; and\n       Whereas the draft provisional agenda of the Review \n     Conference indicates that the Assembly of States Parties of \n     the ICC has no intention of addressing the grave and \n     persistent concerns of the United States regarding the Rome \n     Statute: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved by the Senate (the House of Representatives \n     concurring), That it is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the national interests of the United States are neither \n     preserved nor advanced by becoming a State Party to the Rome \n     Statute on the International Criminal Court;\n       (2) the Rome Statute undermines the sovereignty of the \n     United States, hinders its ability to defend itself and its \n     allies with military force, and conflicts with the principles \n     of the United States Constitution;\n       (3) President Barack Obama should declare that the United \n     States does not intend to ratify the Rome Statute and that \n     the United States does not presently consider itself to be a \n     signatory of the treaty;
