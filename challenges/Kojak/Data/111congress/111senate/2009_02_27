The committees of jurisdiction in \nthe House and the Senate, the Appropriations Committees, have worked \nvery hard to come up with bipartisan legislation. No one can ever \nsuggest there was not participation by Democrats and Republicans on \nthis legislation. We hope to be able to move to that Monday. We are \ngoing to move to it Monday. We hope to do it without having to have a \ncloture vote. If we cannot get consent to move to the matter within the \nnext few hours, we will file cloture on the motion to proceed to that \nbill. That will occur early in the morning on Monday. We have to do \nthat so that we can have the 30 hours run as quickly as we can. We have \nto finish the bill next week because the funding runs out on March 6. \nSo we hope that can be accomplished. If we can move to the bill, then \nwe would leave Monday for the opportunity for people to speak about the \nlegislation.\n  The bill would be managed, of course, by Senators Inouye and Cochran, \ntwo of the most experienced legislators we have. Monday would give us \nan opportunity for people to offer amendments, and we would be able to \nhave those votes prior to the regular caucus luncheon on Tuesday. So we \nwill await as to what happens during the day to determine what is going \nto happen on Monday. We could have a Monday morning cloture vote if we \ncannot get permission to move to that. If we do get permission, then we \nwill have no votes on Monday and have that for debate and offering \namendments, no votes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/27/senate-section/article/S2577-7", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2577-S2578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXECUTIVE SESSION\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                           EXECUTIVE CALENDAR\n\n  Mr. REID.

I rise to address the President's plan to withdraw \nAmerican troops from Iraq that he will announce today in Camp Lejeune, \nNC, as has been widely reported in the media.\n  Yesterday afternoon, I participated in a White House briefing with \nother Members of Congress, during which the President and his national \nsecurity team described the contours of a plan to withdraw troops from \nIraq. As he described it, this plan would aim to remove the bulk of \ncombat troops by August of 2010, approximately 19 months, leaving up to \n50,000 troops in place. That is a little over a third of the present \ntroop level in Iraq. Most combat forces would remain in place for the \nduration of this year, ahead of national elections likely to take place \nin December. National elections in December are of the utmost \nimportance. To have security and the ability of the Iraqi people to \ntake part in that election is a vital part of the progress Iraq will \nmake toward freedom and democracy. The President noted that he reserves \nthe right to revisit the timeline currently envisioned based on \nconditions on the ground.\n  It is encouraging that the dramatic success of the surge strategy has \nenabled us to move from a discussion about whether the United States \ncould bear the catastrophic consequences of failure in Iraq to planning \nthe way in which to consolidate the success. Thanks to the leadership \nof GEN David Petraeus, Ambassador Ryan Crocker, GEN Ray Odierno, and \nthe many brave men and women who have served under them, the failing \nsituation in Iraq has been arrested and reversed.\n  It is important to point out that the President's plan is not without \nrisk. We have not yet completed the mission in Iraq, and the gains we \nhave made there remain fragile. We will need to be cautious as we \nwithdraw troops so as not to jeopardize these achievements and listen \nclosely to commanders on the ground as the administration determines \nthe pace of withdrawals. The greatest risk will be present ahead of the \nDecember elections, and conditions could worsen before or even after \nthey take place.\n  With these factors in mind, I believe the President's withdrawal is a \nreasonable one. The plan is reasonable. Given the gains in Iraq and the \nrequirements to send additional troops to Afghanistan, together with \nthe significant number of troops who will remain in Iraq and the \nPresident's willingness to reassess based on conditions on the ground, \nI am cautiously optimistic that the plan, as laid out by the President, \ncan lead to success.\n  The American people should be clear. The President's plan, even after \nthe end of its withdrawal timeline is reached, will leave in place up \nto 50,000 U.S. troops. All will be in harm's way. Some will continue to \nconduct combat operations. They will play a vital role in consolidating \nand extending the remarkable progress our military has made since early \n2007. That is why I believe the administration should aim to keep the \nfull complement of 50,000, as briefed by Secretary Gates and Admiral \nMullen, and not succumb to pressures, political or otherwise, to make \ndeeper or faster cuts in our force levels. The President's plan, as \nbriefed yesterday, is one that can keep us on the right path in Iraq.\n  I worry, however, about statements made by a number of our colleagues \nindicating that, for reasons wholly apart from the requirement to \nsecure our aims in Iraq, we should aim at a troop presence much lower \nthan 50,000. We have spent enormous amounts of American blood and \ntreasure in Iraq. We all know that. After all the tragic losses of \nlife, after the hundreds of billions of dollars spent, after all the \nother costs our country has absorbed as a result of the conduct of the \nwar, we are finally on a path to success. Let us have no crisis of \nconfidence now. Instead, let us welcome home our fighting men and \nwomen, not only thanking them for serving in Iraq, not just for ending \nthe war in Iraq but thanking them for bringing us victory in Iraq.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN.

Mr. President, this morning's newspapers, once again, \nchronicle the difficulty that exists in this country. There is \nobviously a financial crisis, a collapse of the banking system, \nparticularly on Wall Street.\n  Just to name two, today's paper says there is a place in the budget \nthat is a holding pattern for a potential $750 billion of additional \nfunding that might be necessary for the big bank bailouts in this \ncountry. We also know from the newspapers and from news this morning \nthat Citigroup has reached some sort of a deal with the Federal \nGovernment in order to make Citigroup viable. So each day we see more \nand more discussion about these kinds of issues. It begs the question \nabout who is doing what? What do we know about all of this? How open is \nthis? How much\n\n[[Page S2579]]\n\nshould the American people know about how their money is used?\n  I have come to the Senate floor today to talk about just one part of \nit. At a time when there is so much discussion here about hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, billions of dollars, tens of billions, hundreds of \nbillions of dollars, and now trillions of dollars, I wish to trace just \n$3.6 billion. That is a lot of money: $3.6 billion that the American \ntaxpayers paid in bonuses to some big shot executives that steered \ntheir institution into the ground. Let me tell my colleagues about the \nstory.\n  This is a story about Bank of America buying Merrill Lynch. Our \nprevious Secretary of the Treasury was concerned about Merrill Lynch \nhaving serious problems. He let Lehman go bankrupt, believed that was a \nmistake, and so Merrill Lynch is adrift and we have to find a marriage \nfor Merrill Lynch. Apparently, the Treasury Department worked to get \nBank of America to agree to buy Merrill Lynch. By the way, Bank of \nAmerica had already purchased Countrywide Mortgage, which was a \ncomplete mess and a collapse and one of the big mortgage companies \nthat, in my judgment, has caused much of this problem. Bank of America \nalready had purchased Countrywide and the assets of Countrywide \nMortgage. Now it was being encouraged to purchase Merrill Lynch. So \nthat marriage was arranged by the Treasury Secretary and others, and \nthat marriage was announced, by the way, last September and consummated \nin early January of this year.\n  Now what we discover is that Bank of America got substantial amounts \nof taxpayers' money in TARP funds and other guarantees. So Bank of \nAmerica has taxpayers' money, and $10 billion of the taxpayers' money \nthat went to Bank of America would have been destined for Merrill Lynch \nhad Bank of America not purchased it. Merrill Lynch, it turns out, when \nthey were taken over, had just suffered a loss of some $15 billion in \nthe fourth quarter of 2008. That caused problems for Bank of America \nwhich had agreed to purchase Merrill Lynch because Bank of America, \nbefore buying Countrywide and Merrill Lynch, was a healthy company, and \nnow all of a sudden it is not a healthy company and needs substantial \nfunds from the American taxpayers. But now we find that Merrill Lynch \npaid bonuses to its employees in December of last year just before the \ntakeover by Bank of America was completed.\n  Now, as I indicated, Merrill Lynch lost $15 billion late last year, \nand they paid $3.6 billion in bonuses in December. Let me describe the \nmagnitude of these bonuses. Six hundred ninety-four employees at \nMerrill Lynch, according to reports, received bonuses in excess of $1 \nmillion. Let me say that again. Nearly 700 employees in that failed \ncompany--a company that lost $15 billion in the fourth quarter of 2008 \nreceived bonuses of over $1 million. It is unbelievable. Four top \nexecutives in that bank received $121 million. The top 14 employees in \nthat institution got $250 million. Think of that: $3.6 billion paid in \nbonuses in December to people at an institution that lost $25 billion \nin the year. That $3.6 billion could have just as well been transported \nthrough a pipeline from the pockets of the American taxpayers to these \n700 people who got over $1 million apiece because that is taxpayers' \nmoney. That money from TARP funds--$25 billion and further money which \nguaranteed bad assets--that comes from the American taxpayers.\n  Had they not paid the $3.6 billion in bonuses to these folks, their \nloss in the fourth quarter of 2008 would not have been $15 billion, it \nwould have been $11.4 billion. Taxpayers would not have had to come up \nwith that kind of funding through the TARP program. So I know where \n$3.6 billion went; American taxpayers were asked to pay that $3.6 \nbillion in bonuses to the 700 people who got $1 million apiece from a \nfailed institution. Now Bank of America has this issue because Bank of \nAmerica purchased Merrill Lynch. Bank of America now has serious \nfinancial trouble, and they have received even more funds as well. One \nof the questions about this is, How do we know the details about these \nbonuses? It is because an attorney general in the State government in \nNew York had the guts and the intelligence to subpoena this information \nand demand that it be turned over to him. Question: Why is it that some \ncommittee in the Congress doesn't have this information? Why is no \nsubpoena coming from the Congress on these issues? Why is there no \nsystematic, significant investigation here? After all, this Congress is \nthe institution that has triggered the funding. Yet these \ninvestigations are occurring with an attorney general in State \ngovernment.\n  This Congress needs to do a lot more. There needs to be \ninvestigations and accountability. I have offered those amendments. We \nought to get to the bottom of who did what, who got the money, and who \nleft town with the cash from the American taxpayers. This morning's \nnews about Citigroup being rescued--do you know what? We are told \nCitigroup is too big to fail. How did it become too big? The Federal \nReserve Board, Alan Greenspan, Treasury folks, and both Republican and \nDemocratic Members pushed legislation that allowed them to create big \nholding companies and become too big to fail. I understand you need \nbanks, and I understand you need big banks. But the big banks don't \nhave to be so big that they are too big to fail, so when they make \nreckless decisions, the American taxpayers are told: We are too big to \nfail and you must bail us out. There is no inherent right for the \nbiggest financial institutions in this country to continue to exist. I \nunderstand the circulatory system in this country and that a necessary \npart of it is the banking institutions. I understand how critical that \nis.\n  My point is not that we can do without banking institutions. My point \nis that there is no inherent right to exist for those banks that have \ntheir current names and are declared too big to fail. What about \nputting them through some sort of a ``bank carwash'' and getting rid of \nall that tar--those bad assets--and sell the good assets to an \ninstitution that is reconstituted as a new bank? What inherent right is \nthere for banks that have run this country into the ditch and destroyed \ntheir financial capability--what inherent right do they have for them \nto continue to exist?\n  I am not suggesting we shut down the banking system. But perhaps this \nlesson ought to suggest to us that ``too big to fail'' is a doctrine \nthat is a failure, because if you have decided you are going to allow \ninstitutions to become too big to fail, you have sent yourself down a \nroad that is a dead end, in my judgment.\n  The culture, it seems to me, that is on Wall Street, and the culture \nin this town--precisely in Treasury and some in Congress--is a culture \nthat suggests that what was is what has to be in the future. That is \nnot the case at all. I have talked ad nauseam about 1999 on the floor \nof this Senate, when both Republicans and Democrats steered a different \ncourse and said let's get rid of those old protections we put in place \nafter the Great Depression--Glass-Steagall and those things, those old-\nfashioned notions--and let's dump them and create the Nation of one-\nstop shopping for securities and virtually everything you want to do in \nsecurities, real estate, and finance. So the Congress did dump all \nthose old-fashioned rules and laws that were put into place after the \nGreat Depression. I was one of eight Senators who stood on the floor \nand said no--one of eight who voted no. I said then on the floor of the \nSenate that I think within a decade we are going to see massive \ntaxpayer bailouts. It was a disastrous decision to have done it. Now we \nmust reconnect it. There is no discussion here, and there needs to be \nabout what do you reconnect? Do you go back to some semblance of \nwhether it is Glass-Steagall, or some approach to Glass-Steagall, in \nwhich you begin to separate the essential functions of banking from \nother areas of substantial risk? If you don't do that, what do you do \nto provide protections that this would not happen again?\n  There is a culture here that suggests you cannot do that, it is \nimpossible. There is a culture here that suggests we have to keep \nbailing out whatever it is. We have pumped $700 billion out of this \nChamber into something called a TARP fund to be used for the big banks. \nNow we are told there needs to be a marker to protect the potential of \nanother $750 billion. That is nearly $1.5 trillion pumped into the top \nof our banking institutions, like putting oil\n\n[[Page S2580]]\n\nin a crank case--and these are failed institutions. Yet the only \ninvestigation I see happening is coming out of an office in the \nattorney general's office in Albany, NY. It is unbelievable to me.\n  Does anybody here understand that $3.6 billion was put in a hose \ndirectly from the taxpayers' pockets to bonuses for 700 people in a \nfailed banking institution, so each of those 700 people got $1 million \nor more, and the 4 top people, by the way, got $120 million. By the \nway, let me point out that one of those top four people in Merrill \nLynch, according to a news article in New York, got $24.9 million and \nwas just hired in September of last year. So he got almost $25 million \nfor 3 months of work. Then he quit. The day he quit, according to the \nnews record, his wife closed on a $36 million luxury co-op on Park \nAvenue. Pretty unbelievable. By the way, another top executive, Thomas \nMontage, who headed global sales and trading at Merrill Lynch, was \nreportedly given a guaranteed payment of $39.4 million for 2008. Does \nthis sound like fiction? It does to me.\n  This week, we were treated to a rant on television by a guy I saw \nstanding on a trading floor, a derivatives trader, who was ranting \nabout losers and about reckless behavior, about the losers who might \nget help to stay in their homes. We have had millions of people lose \ntheir jobs, some 2.6 million people last year. A good number of them \nare also losing their homes. Somebody says maybe you can try to find a \nway to help some of them stay in their homes, and that derivatives \ntrader stood and ranted about the losers who have lost jobs and are \nabout to lose their homes. I wonder if that derivatives trader might \nstand on the floor of an exchange and describe losers as people who \nmake $24.9 million for 3 months of work in a failed institution. Are \nthey losers? How about the nearly 700 people who got over $1 million \neach in bonuses from the American taxpayer? Are they losers? Or is it \njust the little folks, the casualties at the bottom of this economic \nwreckage, the people who lost their jobs, their homes, and who are \nlosing hope? Then they see these stories about ``too big to fail.'' \nWhen 700 people get bonuses of $1 million each in an institution that \nlost $15 billion in just one quarter last year and the institution pays \n$3.6 billion in bonuses, I wonder if the folks who are having an itch \nto rant today might want to rant about that kind of nonsense.\n  How about laying off the folks who don't have it so good, the folks \nwho are struggling and trying to get by, hoping beyond hope that maybe \nthey are not going to get laid off; or if they just got laid off, \nhoping beyond hope they might be able to find another job; or hoping \nbeyond hope that if they got laid off and haven't yet found a job, they \ncan find some way to scrape up enough money to make the next house \npayment so they will not be kicked out of their house. These people are \nlosers, you say? I mean, of all the unbelievable things I have heard, \nfor a derivatives trader to stand on the exchange floor and rant about \nthe losers at the bottom of the economic scale, shame on him, in my \njudgment. I will tell you where the losers are. The losers are the \nfolks who have wallowed in big bucks, getting bonuses from institutions \nthat have failed and then asking for taxpayer money and then asking us \nto pry those bonus numbers out of the bowels of their financial \nrecords. They didn't give them up exactly voluntarily. It was an \nattorney general of New York who forced that information into the open. \nWell, where is the outrage about these things? Where is the outrage? \nLet me hear a rant from somebody standing on a trading floor about \nthat--just one.\n  This Congress has a lot of work to do. This Congress has not begun to \ndo the investigations that are necessary. We should not learn these \nthings from an attorney general in New York who is issuing subpoenas. \nWe should learn them by substantial investigations here to find out \nwhat happened, who got the money, and what happened to the first $700 \nbillion.\n\n  I have used the term ``bank robbery,'' and I understand it is a \npejorative term. When we think of bank robbers, we think of Jesse James \nin Northfield, MN, with a mask over his face and a gun and a fast \nhorse. Well, a whole lot of folks have robbed big banks in this country \nof their financial viability and of their strength, through horrible, \nbad decisions--even as they have taken massive amounts of money from \nthe banks for themselves. That is bank robbery. I know it is a \ndifferent kind--with no violence and they are wearing suits and flying \nin private jets--but it is robbing America's financial institutions. As \nI have described, I think it also robs American taxpayers.\n  I want this country to do well. I want this financial wreckage to \nend. I want us to put America back on track. I want us to do the things \nthat are necessary to prevent this from ever happening again. But you \ncannot do that unless you understand what happened. Accountability is \nlooking backward and forward. I am talking about all this because when \nwe have to discover by reading the newspaper that a State official has \nfinally subpoenaed records to find out that a company that lost 25 \nbillion last year gave out $3.6 billion in bonuses, probably from $10 \nbillion of the American taxpayers' money, we have a right to know that. \nI have indicated on the floor of the Senate before that much of this is \nabout economic recovery. If we are going to get by this and through \nthis--and I think we will--it is about confidence. It is about \nrestoring confidence in the American people about their future. When \nthe American people are confident about their future, they do things \nthat expand the economy. When they are not confident, they do things \nthat contract the economy. It is as simple as that.\n  I ask, how can Americans be confident when, day after day, they read \nthese stories about how folks at the top get off with a lot of money \nand then their friends call the folks at the bottom losers. That is \nhardly inspiring, in my judgment. We have a lot of things to do. First, \nis to investigate all this and, at the same time, to understand what \nhas happened; we need to begin working to figure out what kind of a \nbanking and financial future we want. We are going to try to put people \nback to work with the economic recovery package, building \ninfrastructure, trying to put people back on the payroll. That will \ngive confidence and also build an asset for our country. All those \nthings are necessary.\n  The other steps that are necessary is for us to think, what did we do \nin 1999 to say let's allow big bank holding companies to be created and \ngrow banks that are too big to fail, and let's decide we don't want to \nregulate anything. How are we going to put that back together? Should \nwe not revisit that decision that turned out to be so wrong and the \nissue of Glass-Steagall or some form of it? Shouldn't we revisit \nexactly what we want in terms of future regulatory oversight?\n\n  Let me make one other point while I talk about this. I sat across the \ntable from a North Dakota banker some while ago at what was called a \nsauerkraut festival. I said to him--this is a town of 1,200 people or \nso. I said to this community banker: Do you have money to lend?\n  He said: Oh, sure.\n  I said: If the biggest company in your town--which is a small \nmanufacturing company--if that company needed some funding for an \nexpansion, would you have money?\n  He said: Oh, sure, we have money. We have done banking the old-\nfashioned way. We take deposits and we make loans, but we do \nunderwriting for those loans. We sit across the table from someone who \nwants a loan to be sure they are able to pay that loan. That is called \nunderwriting. We bank the old-fashioned way.\n  Would it not have been nice if some of the biggest institutions \nbanked the old-fashioned way?\n  I got a call the other day from a woman who runs a company that makes \nsteel buildings. She has lost 80 percent of her business; 80 percent of \nher business is gone. Maybe they won't make it. But she asked the \nquestion: Is there any help for us? Is there any program out there that \nwould help bail out our company because we were doing pretty well; this \nwas a good economy for us; we were selling steel buildings, and it was \nnot our fault this thing took a bad turn. Is there anything that can \nhelp us stay in business? We have people on our payroll. Is there \nanything that can help us because every day, she said, I read about the \nbig banks getting all this money.\n  I assume she will probably read something I have said that not only \ndo they get all that money in Merrill Lynch, they got $3.6 billion in \nbonuses\n\n[[Page S2581]]\n\nfor the very executives who helped lose $25 billion last year.\n  The answer to that woman is, no, there is nobody here who has a \nprogram that says: You know what, let's pay as much attention to the \nMain Street business that is struggling this morning as is being paid \nto the biggest banks that are too big to fail. Nobody is talking about \nthat small business.\n  By the way, when they lose, they lose everything. That small \nbusiness, that dream, that risk of, in most cases, all the assets that \nfamily has, when that is gone, it is gone. Is there anybody here who \nhas put together some structure that says: Let's help those folks. \nMaybe the economic engine also runs well when you help folks at the \nbottom. Maybe things percolate up in America.\n  I think it is a fair question to ask. It is a fair question to ask \nthat many ask about rewarding reckless behavior, about what do you do \nin a country to try to put an economy that has been so savaged by bad \ndecisions and, in some cases, bad luck, but also greed, a carnival of \ngreed, what do you do to put it on track, to give people confidence \nabout the future? There is not one solution. There is not one answer. \nThere are a series of things to be done. It seems to me, first and \nforemost, we have to try to understand that the American people cannot \ncontinue to read this. They cannot continue to read that they are asked \nto come up with another $750 billion because these institutions are too \nbig to fail but apparently not smart enough to understand you don't \nneed to give $3.6 billion in bonuses to people who lost $25 billion. \nThere is no Main Street in America where that decision would be made.\n  As I conclude, let me say that I want this country to succeed so \nbadly. The President said it the other day. He had a room full of \nRepublicans and Democrats in a joint session of Congress, and he said: \nI know everybody in this room loves their country. And we do. This \ncountry is in a lot of difficulty. It is not some natural disaster. \nThis was not some Hurricane Katrina. This difficulty was caused by a \nlot of terrible decisions. Some people can call our offices and look at \nthis Government and they can say: It was all Government policies. Let \nme just make this case as well that the consumer debt by the American \npeople has gone up, up, up, straight up. That is not Government debt; \nthat is consumer debt. That is also a problem. Giant trade deficits \nthrough unbelievably incompetent trade agreements, at $700 billion a \nyear. We have a lot of problems, and we need to address them all right \nnow and begin fixing them and putting this country on course so that we \nhave an economy people can believe in and so they can believe life will \nbe better for their kids than it was for them because this is a country \nthat cares about expanding the middle class and lifting everybody up.\n  We can do this. We can do it. But we won't do it by ignoring the \nthings about which I just talked. We ought to face them and face them \nnow.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Alaska.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI.

Mr. President, we have had a number of discussions in \nrecent days about the E-Verify system that allows employers to do a \nquick computer check of an individual's Social Security number to \nvalidate whether it is a legitimate number before hiring them, an \naction that would help them avoid hiring people in the country \nillegally.\n  The discussion has been whether to extend that program which is \ncurrently set to expire in March. I offered an amendment to do that, an \namendment similar to the one that passed in the House last year, 407 to \n2, that would extend the E-Verify program for 4 years. There are \n100,000 American businesses using it every day, and 1,000 to 2,000 new \nbusinesses a week are signing up voluntarily--just voluntarily because \nit protects them.\n  They want to follow the law, as most of our businesses do. When they \ngo through this process, if someone were to say: You deliberately hired \nsomeone illegally in the country, they could say: Well, we checked it \nout on the system and they showed up to be legitimate and we felt \nlegitimate in hiring them. So it protects them and helps them follow \nthe law.\n  But for some reason there has been a resistance here. It passed the \nHouse. It was in the House stimulus bill, that $800 billion stimulus \nbill. It also provided, in the House legislation which was accepted and \nthe majority of the House Members all voted for it on final passage, \nthat everybody who gets a contract from the U.S. Government as part of \nthis stimulus package must use E-Verify. In other words, it was \ndesigned to create and protect jobs for lawful Americans. The \namendment, which was unanimously accepted in committee, said that \nbeneficiaries of stimulus money must use the E-Verify system, and that \nE-Verify system would help ensure that only legal people would be \nhired. They could be green card holders; they could be legal workers; \nthey did not have to be citizens. But they at least ought to be in the \ncountry legally. And this Senate systematically refused to allow us to \nhave a vote on that amendment, so it was not in the Senate bill.\n  I asked three or four times to be able to have a vote on that \namendment and was rejected. When they went to conference, sure enough, \nas I suspected, as I stated on the floor, the Senate version won. Our \nbill, which did not have this language in it, prevailed. They took the \nHouse language out at conference without any deliberation. This was a \ncommon sense amendment, and I think it would have passed overwhelmingly \nin this Senate had we been allowed to have a vote.\n  So this has caused me great concern. A lot of us have believed \nPresident Bush and his administration failed to aggressively enforce \nthe law to ensure that jobs are going to American workers and not those \nin the country illegally. And I criticized him for that.\n  But it does appear this administration and this new Congress may be \neven more determined to not enforce the law. In fact, it appears they \nmay be indeed taking steps to undermine some of the programs that \nPresident Bush and the ICE Agency and the Homeland Security Department \nhave been taking that were at least making progress toward creating a \nsystem of lawful immigration that we can be proud of.\n  We are a nation of immigrants. Nobody wants to end immigration in \nAmerica. Over 1 million people can enter our country lawfully each year \nand become citizens and contribute to our country in many positive \nways. But since so many people would like to come to our country, and \nwe recognize we have to have a certain limit on the number who come, we \nhave a legal system that requires them to make application, and by \nvarious standards they are approved or disapproved in their \napplication. Those who are approved get to come to America, and those \nwho do not have to wait until maybe later or maybe they, for one reason \nor another, are permanently unable to come. Maybe they have a criminal \nrecord or have other problems that would make them unacceptable for \nadmission. No one has a constitutional right to come to America. We \ncannot have and do not have and should not have an open borders policy \nso that everybody who would like to come and work, can come and work.\n  So this is the situation we are in. In light of that, I was \nparticularly troubled, I have to say, and all Americans should be \ntroubled by a recent headline article in the Washington Times this \nweek. It was about certain activist immigration rights groups \ncriticizing the Obama administration because some of the agents in the \nImmigration Enforcement Division had raided an engine machine shop in \nWashington State and actually went so far as to detain certain illegal \nimmigrants. They are not happy they actually went into a business and \ndetained some individuals who\n\n[[Page S2582]]\n\nwere in the country illegally, and they complained about that. So, \napparently, according to the article, the Obama administration itself \nseemed ``taken aback by the raid by the United States Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement Agency.'' The new Secretary, Janet Napolitano, was \n``vowing to Congress that she would get to the bottom of it.''\n  The article goes on to say that an official with the agency said, \n``The Secretary is not happy about it.''\n  Well, that is troubling to me. In 2008, under the Bush \nadministration, which was not, I think, particularly aggressive--as a \nmatter of fact, not aggressive enough, ICE made 5,173 administrative \narrests at work sites. Additionally, ICE made 1,101 criminal arrests in \nconnection with worksite investigations. Those arrest represented \ncriminal activity, gangs or drugs or other kinds of criminal activity. \nThey were doing that, and periodic enforcement actions were taken \nbecause a company does not have a right to have hundreds and hundreds \nof illegal workers who perhaps certainly are working for less money \nthan Americans would work for.\n  That is not good and creates unfair competition and undermines our \nlawful immigration system. But this worried me even more. According to \nthe Washington Times article, immigrant rights groups said they had \ndiscussed this with the administration some time during the last \nelection. They did not discuss it publicly, but they apparently had \ndiscussions with the campaign, and they said this:\n\n       This was a fixture of our conversations and demands with \n     him during the campaign. It has always been one that there \n     would be a hold on the raids or a stop to the raids.\n\n  The National Council of La Raza has urged supporters to call the \nWhite House and demand that Mr. Obama lay out his immigration policy. \nIn criticizing this, they said:\n\n       What are Latino and immigrant voters to think? They turn \n     out in massive numbers and vote for change and yet the change \n     we can believe in turns out to be business as usual.\n\n  Well, I think maybe the American people need to make some demands on \nthis administration. Maybe that is the way you get things done; you \nmake demands on the administration that they actually enforce the law \nand that they do not conduct investigations of the law enforcement \npersonnel who were doing what the law required and who were, by all \naccounts, legitimately identifying illegal workers in America.\n  So now, according to this article, the Secretary of Homeland Security \nis investigating our law enforcement officers for simply doing their \nduty in response to some secret demand and agreement they made back in \nthe campaign to undermine law enforcement in America. I do not think it \nis good.\n  This is why people are upset with Washington and upset with Congress. \nI believe in lawful immigration. I think we need to stop all of this. \nBut what do we do? Nothing. Whenever something starts happening and has \nsome possibility of being successful, well, politicians intervene and \nstop the law enforcement officers from doing their duty.\n  I am really concerned about it. The Immigration and Customs \nEnforcement Agency says in their statement about the operation that \nthey were investigating criminal activity, and they apparently \ndiscovered in the course of that the hiring records revealed a \nsignificant number of people were using bogus Social Security numbers \nand counterfeit identity documents. That is why they did their jobs. \nThey went and checked it out and found 28 people at this company who \nwere not here lawfully.\n  So now the Secretary of Homeland Security has promised to get to the \nbottom of it--not to the bottom of why this company was hiring 28 \nillegal workers, not asking whether this company ever used the E-Verify \nsystem, they are going to get to the bottom of why the law enforcement \nofficers of the U.S. Government, paid for by the taxpayers, had the \ntemerity to actually go out and investigate criminal activity and \ndetain people in the country illegally.\n  So I have to tell you, this is not going to fly. We are not going to \ngo quietly about this issue. We need a vote in the Senate, and we need \none soon to extend E-Verify. It is unthinkable that this highly \nsuccessful, proven system that over 100,000 businesses voluntarily are \nusing would be allowed to expire.\n  The only reason it would be allowed to expire would be we do not want \nthe laws enforced. And, by the way, E-Verify does not raid any \nbusinesses. E-Verify does not call for a single investigator, not a \nsingle detention facility. All it says is the business owner could \ncheck and not hire someone if they did not have good documents. That is \nall. They do not arrest them. They do not call the police. Nothing \nhappens. You just eliminate the jobs magnet, as the Border Patrol \npeople tell us, that is causing people to come to our country illegally \nto get jobs, and that magnet is a factor. E-Verify would diminish that.\n  I wished to share those thoughts. I believe this is a troubling \nevent. We need to consider it and not go down this path. It signals a \nfurther erosion of the efforts to bring a lawful system to this \nunlawful system we have today.\n  The Secretary does deserve credit for one statement she made, that \nbusinesses do need to be held accountable for exploiting the illegal \nlabor market. I thought that was a good statement. She went on to state \nthat there is an impact of illegal workers in the country and ``that \nhas impacts on American workers, and it has impacts on wage levels, \noften has undue impacts on illegal workers themselves.''\n  This is also true. There are costs to the American worker in terms of \nwages, the ability to get a job, when we allow huge numbers of illegal \nworkers into the country.\n  I hope our colleagues will consider this issue. The American people \nhave a different view than some about the need to enforce our laws. The \nAmerican people would like to see that, before we start talking about \namnesty and a lot of other things. If we are not going to enforce the \nlaw, why should we go forward with some of these expansive programs \nthat have been proposed to allow persons who only recently broke into \nthe country to be placed on legal status? The American people are not \nnaive about this. They want something done, and they have a right to \nexpect it. We in Congress have to figure out a way to be responsive to \ntheir demands and not focus only on the demands of special interests, \ncertain big businesses, and certain activist groups, but to focus on \nlegitimate demands of the public for good public policy. Good public \npolicy requires the end of the illegality in immigration and the \nestablishment of a lawful system of immigration that honors our great \nheritage of immigration of which we have always been proud.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/27/senate-section/article/S2582-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2582-S2583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SUPPORTING SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING\n\n  Mr. KAUFMAN. Mr. President, America's economy is in crisis. We can \neither drown under the weight of the problem, or we can ride the wave \nof opportunity that it offers.\n  To do that, we must put science, engineering, and innovation back in \ntheir rightful place in our economy.\n  If every cloud has a silver lining, this economic crisis can benefit \nAmerica, we use this opportunity to restore our leadership in the \nworld, if we create anew the industries, businesses and products that \nwill shape the new economy.\n  As the only Senator holding an engineering degree, I remember when \nengineering ranked far ahead of business administration as the premier \ncollege degree for those who had ambition and the determination to \nsucceed.\n  After the Soviet Union's 1957 surprise launch of Sputnik 1, American \nleaders spurred the Nation to catch up, to increase our national \ncommitment to science.\n  The Sputnik crisis led to the creation of NASA and other government \nresearch agencies, as well as an increase in U.S. Government spending \non scientific research and higher education.\n  It doensn't seem that long ago, but I was one of the young students \nwho were drawn by Sputnik and our leaders' call to seek an engineering \ndegree.\n  More recently, though, more and more of America's best and brightest \ncollege students opted instead to take their ``quant'' skills in math \nand analysis to Wall Street.\n\n[[Page S2583]]\n\n  From what I understand, of all the undergraduate majors in the 2008 \nclass at the Massachusetts Insitute of Technology, 11.4 percent took \njobs in finance. This is the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, our \nleading engineering school, sending over 10 percent of its graduates to \nWall Street.\n  The stark truth is that during the go-go years on Wall Street, \nAmerica's engineering and innovation expertise declined.\n  And it is not just that engineers have been choosing finance over \ntraditional engineering careers; fewer students having been choosing to \nstudy engineering, period.\n  Back in 1986--not that long ago--engineering and engineering \ntechnology students earned close to 10 percent of U.S. bachelor's \ndegrees. Despite attractive starting salaries, often above $50,000 a \nyear, the percentage today is only about 5 percent.\n  Only about 121,000 people earned degrees in engineering in 2007, and \nthat includes bachelors, masters, and doctoral degrees.\n  Today's financial crisis has given our young people an opportunity to \ntake a hard look at how they want to spend their lives.\n  It gives America's political and educational leaders an opportunity \nto reorder their resources, to open a pipeline to produce students \nskilled in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, STEM.\n  According to the U.S. Department of Labor, about 80 percent of the \nnew jobs created in the next 10 years will require these critical STEM \nskills.\n  While America must remain a leader in finance, it is clear we must \nalso be a world leader in energy, biotech, biomed and many other \nindustries based on science, technology, and mathematical skills.\n  Here is what we should do right away:\n  We need to find more and better ways to marry public policy and \nengineering. Many universities have begun to do this, but we also must \nact on a national level, with the support and coordination of national \npolicies.\n  To take one key example, our Nation, and indeed our planet, is facing \na potential crisis in the supply and demand for clean energy and water.\n  How these issues are resolved will define our children's future. \nThese problems require technical solutions, designed by scientists and \nengineers who also have an understanding of cultures, religions, and \npolicy.\n  We also need to develop programs that allow students to ``make a \ndifference,'' to tap the idealism our young people are eager to \nexpress.\n  For example, we should create an engineering jobs corps--similar to \nthe Peace Corps or Teach for America--to help channel the young talent \nemerging from our engineering schools.\n  The fields of biotech and biomed, energy and environment should \nattract socially conscious students who want to improve the quality of \nlife for us all.\n  Prior to graduating, engineering students typically must write a \nfinal paper addressing a problem to solve. We should make those papers \npart of our national dialogue, publish them, and make them available to \ngovernment and to the business community, with authors' rights kept \nsecure.\n  Finally, we need to reach out to women and other students who have \ntraditionally been underrepresented in engineering.\n  The United States cannot maintain its position as a technological \nleader nor can we solve the problems we face without the perspectives \nand participation of all members of our society.\n  We are in a struggle to define our nation's future. We must recruit \nall of the talent we can find.\n  We know our competitors in countries like China are throwing their \nresources into science and engineering. We can do no less.\n  When I went to college I wanted to be an engineer, in part because 52 \nyears ago the United States was supporting science and engineering on \nan unprecedented level. America's competitive spirit helped us meet the \nchallenges of those times.\n  Thousands of technical innovations created new products, new jobs, \nnew industries, and new levels of economic productivity. We can do this \nagain.\n  The financial crisis--and our recognition of the misplaced priorities \nand resources that created it--can help lead a cultural shift back to \nthe strong foundations of innovation and know-how that have always been \nthe American way.\n  The Federal Government can and should lead in supporting the basic \nscientific, medical and engineering research that will spur discoveries \nand innovations.\n  Our entrepreneurs have always been ready to build on those \nfoundations, to create millions of new jobs and shape a bright American \nfuture.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues and the administration \nto restore the prestige and leadership of science and engineering in \nour country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/27/senate-section/article/S2583-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 UNANIMOUS-CONSENT AGREEMENT--H.R. 1105\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Testimony may be filed electronically. The \n     presiding officer at any hearing is authorized to limit the \n     time of each witness appearing before the committee or a \n     subcommittee. The committee or a subcommittee shall, as far \n     as practicable, utilize testimony previously taken on bills \n     and measures similar to those before it for consideration.\n       Rule 10.--Should a subcommittee fail to report back to the \n     full committee on any measure within a reasonable time, the \n     chairman may withdraw the measure from such subcommittee and \n     report that fact to the full committee for further \n     disposition.\n       Rule 11.--No subcommittee may schedule a meeting or hearing \n     at a time designated for a hearing or meeting of the full \n     committee.

In the event there are \n     supplemental, minority, or additional views, an appropriate \n     opportunity shall be given the majority to examine the \n     proposed text prior to filing or publication.

Prior to the issuance of each subpoena, the ranking \n     minority member of the committee or subcommittee, and any \n     other member so requesting, shall be notified regarding the \n     identity of the person to whom it will be issued and the \n     nature of the information sought and its relationship to the \n     authorized investigative activity, except where the chairman \n     of the committee or subcommittee, in consultation with the \n     ranking minority member, determines that such notice would \n     unduly impede the investigation. All information obtained \n     pursuant to such investigative activity shall be made \n     available as promptly as possible to each member of the \n     committee requesting same, or to any assistant to a member of \n     the committee designated by such member in writing, but the \n     use of any such information is subject to restrictions \n     imposed by the rules of the Senate. Such information, to the \n     extent that it is relevant to the investigation shall, if \n     requested by a member, be summarized in writing as soon as \n     practicable.

The \n     committee form shall be in two parts--\n       (I) information relating to employment, education and \n     background of the nominee relating to the position to which \n     the individual is nominated, and which is to be made public; \n     and,\n       (II) information relating to financial and other background \n     of the nominee, to be made public when the committee \n     determines that such information bears directly on the \n     nominee's qualifications to hold the position to which the \n     individual is nominated.\n       Information relating to background and financial interests \n     (parts I and II) shall not be required of (a) candidates for \n     appointment and promotion in the Public Health Service Corps; \n     and (b) nominees for less than full-time appointments to \n     councils, commissions or boards when the committee determines \n     that some or all of the information is not relevant to the \n     nature of the position. Information relating to other \n     background and financial interests (part II) shall not be \n     required of any nominee when the committee determines that it \n     is not relevant to the nature of the position.\n       Committee action on a nomination, including hearings or \n     meetings to consider a motion to recommend confirmation, \n     shall not be initiated until at least five days after the \n     nominee submits the form required by this rule unless the \n     chairman, with the concurrence of the ranking minority \n     member, waives this waiting period.\n       Rule 19.--Subject to statutory requirements imposed on the \n     committee with respect to procedure, the rules of the \n     committee may be changed, modified, amended or suspended at \n     any time; provided, not less than a majority of the entire \n     membership so determine at a regular meeting with due notice, \n     or at a meeting specifically called for that purpose.\n       Rule 20.--When the ratio of members on the committee is \n     even, the term ``majority'' as used in the committee's rules \n     and guidelines shall refer to the party of the chairman for \n     purposes of party identification. Numerical requirements for \n     quorums, votes and the like shall be unaffected.\n       Rule 21.--First degree amendments must be filed with the \n     chairman at least 24 hours before an executive session. The \n     chairman shall promptly distribute all filed amendments to \n     the members of the committee. The chairman may modify the \n     filing requirements to meet special circumstances with the \n     concurrence of the ranking minority member.\n       Rule 22.--In addition to the foregoing, the proceedings of \n     the committee shall be governed by the Standing Rules of the \n     Senate and the provisions of the Legislative Reorganization \n     Act of 1946, as amended.\n\n            [Excerpts from the Standing Rules of the Senate)\n\n                                RULE XXV\n\n\n                          STANDING COMMITTEES\n\n       1.

Each standing committee, including any subcommittee of \n     any such committee, is authorized to hold such hearings, to \n     sit and act at such times and places during the sessions, \n     recesses, and adjourned periods of the Senate, to require by \n     subpoena or otherwise the attendance of such witnesses and \n     the production of such correspondence, books, papers, and \n     documents, to take such testimony and to make such \n     expenditures out of the contingent fund of the Senate as may \n     be authorized by resolutions of the Senate.

The majority leader or his designee shall \n     announce to the Senate whenever consent has been given under \n     this subparagraph and shall state the time and place of such \n     meeting. The right to make such announcement of consent shall \n     have the same priority as the filing of a cloture motion.\n       (b) Each meeting of a committee, or any subcommittee \n     thereof, including meetings to conduct hearings, shall be \n     open to the public, except that a meeting or series of \n     meetings by a committee or a subcommittee thereof on the same \n     subject for a period of no more than fourteen calendar days \n     may be closed to the public on a motion made and seconded to \n     go into closed session to discuss only whether the matters \n     enumerated in clauses (1) through (6) would require the \n     meeting to be closed, followed immediately by a record vote \n     in open session by a majority of the members of the committee \n     or subcommittee when it is determined that the matters to be \n     discussed or the testimony to be taken at such meeting or \n     meetings--\n       (1) will disclose matters necessary to be kept secret in \n     the interests of national defense or the confidential conduct \n     of the foreign relations of the United States;\n       (2) will relate solely to matters of committee staff \n     personnel or internal staff management or procedure;\n       (3) will tend to charge an individual with crime or \n     misconduct, to disgrace or injure the professional standing \n     of an individual, or otherwise to expose an individual to \n     public contempt or obloquy or will represent a clearly \n     unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual;\n       (4) will disclose the identity of any informer or law \n     enforcement agent or will disclose any information relating \n     to the investigation or prosecution of a criminal offense \n     that is required to be kept secret in the interests of \n     effective law enforcement;\n       (5) will disclose information relating to the trade secrets \n     of financial or commercial information pertaining \n     specifically to a given person if--\n       (A) an Act of Congress requires the information to be kept \n     confidential by Government officers and employees; or\n       (B) the information has been obtained by the Government on \n     a confidential basis, other than through an application by \n     such person for a specific Government financial or other \n     benefit, and is required to be kept secret in order to \n     prevent undue injury to the competitive position of such \n     person; or\n       (6) may divulge matters required to be kept confidential \n     under other provisions of law or Government regulations.\n       (c) Whenever any hearing conducted by any such committee or \n     subcommittee is open to the public, that hearing may be \n     broadcast by radio or television, or both, under such rules \n     as the committee or subcommittee may adopt.\n       (d) Whenever disorder arises during a committee meeting \n     that is open to the public, or any demonstration of approval \n     or disapproval is indulged in by any person in attendance of \n     any such meeting, it shall be the duty of the Chair to \n     enforce order on his own initiative and without any point of \n     order being made by a Senator. When the Chair finds it \n     necessary to maintain order, he shall have the power to clear \n     the room, and the committee may act in closed session for so \n     long as there is doubt of the assurance of order.\n       (e) Each committee shall prepare and keep a complete \n     transcript or electronic recording adequate to fully record \n     the proceeding of each meeting or conference whether or not \n     such meeting or any part thereof is closed under this \n     paragraph, unless a majority of its members vote to forgo \n     such a record.\n\n                           *   *   *   *   *\n\n\n  Guidelines of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions With Respect to Hearings, Markup Sessions, and Related Matters\n\n\n                                HEARINGS\n\n       Section 133A(a) of the Legislative Reorganization Act \n     requires each committee of the Senate to publicly announce \n     the date, place, and subject matter of any hearing at least \n     one week prior to the commencement of such hearing.\n       The spirit of this requirement is to assure adequate notice \n     to the public and other Members of the Senate as to the time \n     and subject matter of proposed hearings. In the spirit of \n     section 133A(a) and in order to assure that members of the \n     committee are themselves fully informed and involved in the \n     development of hearings:\n       1. Public notice of the date, place, and subject matter of \n     each committee or subcommittee hearing should be inserted in \n     the Congressional Record seven days prior to the commencement \n     of such hearing.\n       2. At least seven days prior to public notice of each \n     committee or subcommittee hearing, the majority should \n     provide notice to the minority of the time, place and \n     specific subject matter of such hearing.\n       3. At least three days prior to the date of such hearing, \n     the committee or subcommittee should provide to each member a \n     list of witnesses who have been or are proposed to be invited \n     to appear.\n       4. The committee and its subcommittee should, to the \n     maximum feasible extent, enforce the provisions of rule 9 of \n     the committee rules as it relates to the submission of \n     written statements of witnesses twenty-four hours in advance \n     of a hearing. Witnesses will be urged to submit testimony \n     even earlier whenever possible.

Mr. President, I had intended to speak briefly yesterday on \na very important piece of legislation, S. 160, the District of Columbia \nHouse Voting Rights Act of 2009, but I was delayed by meetings and so \nwanted to have an opportunity to address this bill today. S. 160 \nprovides the people of our Nation's capital with permanent voting \nrepresentation for the first time in over 200 years. Legislation on \nthis matter has been bottled up for many years in the Senate, and I am \nhopeful that this year it will finally be enacted.\n  Despite our Nation's great progress over the years toward removing \nunnecessary and irrelevant voting restrictions--including those based \non race, sex, wealth, property ownership, and marital status--about \nhalf a million U.S. citizens are effectively unrepresented in the U.S. \nCongress. Major decisions in domestic and foreign policy are made in \nthese citizens' backyards, but they have no one to represent their \nconcerns as a voting Member of Congress.\n  As a recent New York Times editorial stated, ``Washington's lack of \nrepresentation is profoundly undemocratic. Its residents are American \ncitizens who pay taxes, vote for the president and serve and die in the \nmilitary. Although the city is relatively small, it is more populous \nthan Wyoming and nearly equal to those of Vermont and Alaska.'' DC \nresidents pay the second highest per capita Federal income taxes in the \ncountry but have no vote on how the Federal Government spends their \nmoney. The famous phrase, ``no taxation without representation,'' that \nignited the American Revolution and launched the original Thirteen \nColonies on their quest for independence is\n\n[[Page S2587]]\n\nstill displayed prominently on DC license plates today.\n  It is ironic that the city most closely associated with our \ndemocratic Government is the very place that U.S. citizens remain \nwithout a voice or a vote in Congress. In the words of Thomas Paine: \n``The right of voting for representatives is the primary right by which \nother rights are protected.'' It is, in fact, the right on which all \nothers in our democracy depend. The Constitution guarantees it, and the \nU.S. Supreme Court has repeatedly underscored that it is one of our \nmost precious and fundamental rights as citizens.\n  I know that some opponents argue that the reasons the Founders made \nthe Nation's Capital a separate district, rather than locate it within \na State, remain sound, and therefore we should not tinker with their \nwork, even at the cost of continued disenfranchisement of DC's \ncitizens. That argument ignores the commitment we all must have to \nextending the full franchise to all Americans and to ensuring their \nrepresentation in Congress. And it ignores the fact that article I of \nthe Constitution explicitly gives Congress legislative authority over \nthe District ``in all cases whatsoever.'' The courts have over time \ndescribed this power as ``extraordinary and plenary'' and ``full and \nunlimited,'' and decades of legislative and judicial precedents make \nclear that the simple word ``states'' in article I--which provides that \nthe House of Representatives ``shall be composed of members chosen by \nthe people of the several states''--does not trump Congress's \nlegislative authority to grant representation in the House to citizens \nof the District. Even so, to address the concerns of some, section \n2(a)(2) of the bill states that ``The District of Columbia shall not be \nconsidered a State for purposes of representation in the United States \nSenate.''\n  The current bipartisan compromise embodied in this bill would \nincrease the number of seats in the House of Representatives from 435 \nto 437. It would provide one seat for a voting Member representing DC \nthat is predominantly Democratic and one at-large seat for Utah in a \ndistrict that is predominantly Republican-leaning and which was next in \nline for congressional representation in the House according to 2000 \ncensus data. This legislation strikes the appropriate balance by \nallowing additional representation for both DC and Utah without \ndisadvantaging either national political party. It embodies a \nreasonable compromise and allows for a responsible reassessment during \nthe next reapportionment effort.\n  Congress has never granted the DC Delegate full voting rights in the \nHouse. Whether such a Federal law is constitutional has never been \nplaced squarely before the courts. While no one can respond to the \nconstitutionality question with certainty until the U.S. Supreme Court \nissues a binding decision directly on point, a bipartisan group of \nacademics, judges, and lawyers have concluded that Congress has the \nauthority to provide for voting representation for the District's \npeople. Upon review of the arguments on both sides, I agree. I believe \nthat the Constitution vests in Congress broad power to regulate \nnational elections and plenary authority over DC under article I, \nsection 8, clause 17, known as the ``District clause,'' to address this \nproblem legislatively without the need for a constitutional amendment.\n  When even conservative legal scholars--from Judges Ken Starr, former \nU.S. Solicitor General appointed by President George H.W. Bush, to \nformer Assistant Attorney General Viet Dinh appointed by President \nGeorge W. Bush--have done exhaustive legal analyses which outline the \npositive case for Congress granting representational rights to citizens \nof the District, you know there is a strong case to be made. In any \nevent, it is clear to me that these important constitutional questions \nshould ultimately be resolved by the U.S. Supreme Court, and enactment \nof this bill would enable us to do just that. If opponents of the bill \nare so certain of their constitutional arguments, they should, it seems \nto me, allow those arguments to be tested in the full light of day, in \nthe courts, and be resolved once and for all. If it were to be enacted \nand then struck down because of constitutional infirmities, it would \nthen be clear that a constitutional amendment is the only viable \nalternative left to DC citizens. This bill provides for expedited \nreview by the courts of the constitutionality of the law, a prudent \nstep in my view.\n  Mr. President, I would like to briefly address the issue of the \nfairness doctrine, which was the subject of two votes yesterday. This \ndoctrine, enforced by the Federal Communications Commission, FCC, for \nover 30 years, required broadcast licensees to cover issues of public \nimportance in a fair, balanced manner.\n  The fairness doctrine was established to ensure that there would be a \ndiversity of views available to the public in the limited media market \navailable at the time of its adoption. At the time of its \nestablishment, there were just three major television networks and a \nfar smaller number of radio stations. However, in 1987, the FCC \nrescinded the policy after concluding that the doctrine was no longer \nnecessary given the abundance of media outlets available to the public.\n  I have been supportive of the fairness doctrine in the past because a \nwell-informed citizenry is of fundamental importance to our democracy. \nHowever, given the incredible communications innovations just over the \nlast decade and the explosion of new news sources, I believe that \nreinstating the fairness doctrine could prove unnecessary and \nunmanageably complex. Today, citizens can get their news from the major \nbroadcast television networks, a growing number of 24-hour cable news \nnetworks, dozens of radio stations, and hundreds or thousands of \nInternet news outlets and blogs.\n  I supported the amendment offered yesterday by Senator DeMint \nbecause, in my view, such a fundamental issue as how the public gets \nits news deserves a larger forum for debate than the FCC provides. The \nDeMint amendment ensures that only Congress would have the authority to \nreinstate the fairness doctrine. While the FCC will continue to play a \ncritically important role in regulating telecommunications, as the \nelected representatives of the people, the Members of this body and the \nHouse of Representatives must be involved in whether to reinstate such \na far-reaching policy.\n  Mr. President, what is at stake with the DC voting rights legislation \nis nothing less than a fundamental issue of fairness in voting. Every \neligible citizen, regardless of where he or she lives, has a \nconstitutionally guaranteed right to be represented in Congress by a \nvoting Member. This bill is another step forward in our efforts to \nensure that all Americans are represented equally before this \nGovernment. It is the right thing to do, and this century is the right \ntime to do it. In fact, it is long past due. I commend my colleague \nfrom Connecticut, the chairman of the Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee, for bringing this important measure \nbefore the Senate and for getting it adopted by the Senate yesterday, \neven with the unnecessary and unwise addition of the gun provisions, \nwhich I hope will be stripped from the final bill. I hope the House \nwill act favorably on it next week and that we will soon have a \nconference report before us to vote on. The President has made clear he \nwould sign it, and I hope it will be enacted soon. The people of the \nDistrict have waited much too long for that happy day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/27/senate-section/article/S2587-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2587-S2588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCOMMEMORATING THE 100TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE \n                     ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE\n\n  Mr. LAUTENBERG. Mr. Presdient, I rise to commemorate the 100th \nAnniversary of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored \nPeople, NAACP. I strongly support the NAACP and I am proud to be a \nlifelong member. Today, I wish to recognize this organization and the \ntremendous work it has done fighting for political, educational, social \nand economic equality for all. America would be a less equal and less \njust nation without the work and lasting influence of the NAACP.\n  One hundred years ago on the centennial of Abraham Lincoln's birth, a \ndistinguished group of Americans came together to fight racial hatred \nand racial discrimination through nonviolence. In the intervening \nyears, the NAACP has become one of the most respected civil rights \norganizations in\n\n[[Page S2588]]\n\nthe United States, having fought some of country's greatest civil \nrights battles.\n  Since its inception, the NAACP has been on the frontlines fighting \nfor racial equality in all areas of life. A team of NAACP lawyers, led \nby Thurgood Marshall, fought successfully for the desegregation of \npublic schools in the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education in \n1954. The NAACP also played a key role in ensuring the passage of the \n1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act, laws that are \nessential to guaranteeing all Americans' full participation in our \ndemocracy.\n  Whether it is combating racial profiling, reauthorizing the Voting \nRights Act, or fighting hate crimes and pay discrimination, I have been \nproud to stand side by side with the NAACP throughout my Senate career.\n  There is no better way to honor the NAACP's work than to continue its \nfight for justice and equal opportunity. This fight starts with getting \nthe Nation's economy moving again, and giving every child access to \nquality education and every family access to affordable health care. I \nlook forward to working with the NAACP and with all my Senate \ncolleagues to make these goals a reality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/27/senate-section/article/S2588-1", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          FILLING GUN LAW GAPS\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, while Congress frequently considers \nimportant matters, not every day does it pass legislation capable of \nactually saving lives. The Brady bill, however, signed into law \nNovember 30, 1993, has proven to be such a piece of legislation. The \nBrady law requires that a prospective gun purchaser undergo a criminal \nbackground check before obtaining any firearm from a Federal firearm \nlicensee. Created to prevent felons, fugitives, domestic abusers and \nother prohibited persons from access to guns, the Brady law has been an \nimportant tool in the fight to keep our families and communities safe.\n  According to the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Brady \nbackground checks have blocked more than 1.6 million attempts by high-\nrisk people to buy a gun from licensed dealers through the end of 2007, \nincluding an estimated 842,000 convicted felons, 236,000 people \nconvicted of domestic abuse and 68,000 fugitives from justice. Also, \nduring this 15-year period, the total number of robberies and \naggravated assaults committed with a firearm decreased from 564,648 in \n1993 to 377,331 in 2006, a decrease of 33 percent. The number of \nmurders committed with a firearm also declined 32 percent, from 17,048 \nin 1993 to 11,566 in 2006.\n  Despite these significant reductions in crime, much more needs to be \ndone. Brady background checks, for example, are currently only required \nfor purchases from a licensed gun dealer, which only account for \napproximately 60 percent of gun sales. They are not required for sales \nbetween unlicensed persons, such as sales at gun shows. According to \nthe Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, almost one-\nthird of all trafficked guns are acquired at gun shows and flea \nmarkets. These types of settings provide the perfect loophole for \nunlicensed sellers to offer countless guns for sale with no questions \nasked. Someone that would not be able to pass a background check in a \nlicensed gun store currently is able to purchase as many guns as they \nwant at gun shows.\n  As we begin the first session of the 111th Congress, it is my hope \nthat we will take this opportunity to build upon the success of this \nlaw. I urge my colleagues to pass sensible gun safety legislation that \nwill fill the gaps in our gun laws.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/27/senate-section/article/S2588-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2588-S2590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday expenses \nbut also have suggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can \ndo now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond \ntoday. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       First I do not know why I am writing this since I doubt \n     that the Senate will really hear me, but since you gave me \n     the opportunity to vent here goes.\n       My husband and I have been married for nine years. Our goal \n     has always been to live within our means. He is an \n     electrician and makes a decent wage and has good health \n     benefits. I am a stay-at-home mom and am busy taking care of \n     our three children (soon four). We have tried to stay out of \n     debt our whole marriage. We currently have our house payment \n     which takes up 27% of my husband's take-home pay each month \n     (This can be lowered if he works overtime but for this sake \n     it is just working a 40-hour week). We then have life \n     insurance policies that are cash policies that take up 08% of \n     our income. We contribute 10% to our faith each month. Then \n     there is 11% used for utility bills, car insurance, etc. The \n     rest is used for gasoline, food, clothing, and unexpected \n     expenses. Last year we were saving 12.5% of my husband's \n     income monthly. This year we are barely making it monthly and \n     saving only 3% if possible.\n       We can foresee that if energy prices continue it will be \n     hard for my husband to keep working as an electrician. Pay \n     has not increased as well as costs and living where we do in \n     Idaho we cannot stay in the same town to work. Last year he \n     was traveling over 120 miles a day to go to work and home. It \n     is not unusual for electricians in Idaho to travel at least \n     60 miles one way. We have tried to accommodate his traveling \n     and moved to the middle of where he has worked but still we \n     figured it costs him 400 dollars a month in gasoline to go to \n     work which is 11% of his income. It is easy to see why we are \n     barely making it.\n       We are frugal citizens. I do the cooking of food, we pack \n     lunches from home, we have no cable television or cell \n     phones, we grow our own garden, I can our own fruit and \n     vegetables, my husband hunts for venison in the fall which we \n     package ourselves (being the majority of our meat source), \n     and we try to stock up monthly on our food storage. I have \n     been doing less storage because we have less income. I also \n     as the primary shopper have noticed that our food is costing \n     more to purchase.\n       The problem is not that gasoline is just high. Because it \n     is high food prices are higher, parts for vehicles are higher \n     (we do the majority of our vehicle repairs too), electricity \n     and utilities have raised, taxes are raised to pay for the \n     increase in cities budgets, etc. The 11% we are seeing in gas \n     does not compensate for all the increases because of gas. If \n     we take that into account we would probably see that number \n     grow exponentially.\n       So we see what gas is doing, what are we doing about it? 1) \n     As a family we are trying to start a business that we can do \n     on the side from home. We sent my husband to Taxidermy School \n     so he can maybe earn a little on the side along with being an \n     electrician. This has been very difficult to do since it \n     costs money and we have very little extra to spend. It has \n     taken us a year to pay for the supplies and tools that are \n     needed. We have spent our savings hoping that in the future \n     it will work out. 2) We make sure he carpools with coworkers \n     so our gas bill is minimal. This so far has been great but we \n     cannot always count on it working out as smoothly as it has. \n     3) We do not travel; I go out very little and drive only \n     about 50 miles a week. The rest of the time I am home with \n     our kids. On the weekends we stay home and try to entertain \n     ourselves in our yard. We have planted a larger garden to \n     hopefully help us keep out of the grocery store less. We try \n     to stay active as a family. We no longer for fishing, hiking, \n     camping, or geocaching as a family. It is too expensive to \n     go. I have not enrolled our children in anything extra such \n     as soccer, tee ball, swim lessons, etc. because the money is \n     not there to accommodate such wants. With such cuts we are \n     still able to barely make it.\n       The time has come for people to be extremely frugal, work \n     more than one job, or go into extreme debt to make ends meet. \n     We once were a nation to progress, to succeed, to set the \n     standards .  .  . are we now becoming a nation in steady \n     decline? How do we reverse such a movement? Will our \n     government written by the people and for the people help us \n     or hinder us? Let us start the upward movement before the \n     decline is too hard for many of our citizens to climb out of. \n     Curbing the costs of gasoline and educating the public on \n     financial security will help many get out of the holes they \n     have dug themselves into, and help others from digging any \n     holes at all. Thanks.\n     Sesha, Shelley.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for caring enough to listen to the folk in Idaho. \n     Why does it matter how we feel or what we think? Nothing will \n     change for the working man.\n\n[[Page S2589]]\n\n       Idaho Power will continue to raise our energy bills. Gas is \n     rising each day and now food, then gas heat, etc. It is a \n     domino effect. Why does nothing ever go down? Taxpayers keep \n     getting hit time and again for everything, including illegal \n     immigrants. Get them back home to where they came from that \n     would save a bunch of money right there, in gas, food, \n     welfare, and money paying their medical hospital/ER bills, \n     etc. Have you seen the new laws of Ada County, having to \n     cover illegal immigrants and their medical problems? I can \n     barely take care of my own anymore.\n       I wish I earned hundreds of thousands like [so many people \n     who make policy decisions. Perhaps more need to know that \n     it's like to] hope you have enough money after buying food \n     for your family and prescriptions for your child for gas for \n     your car--no more fun vacations that we remember as children \n     for my kids; instead, I am doing all I can to keep myself and \n     my family above water and working for benefits.\n       Why should we be proud to be Americans anymore? Our \n     government gives and gives to other countries, and sends our \n     men and women to a senseless waste of time war--costing \n     billions, and what do we all get in return? The vets come \n     home with hardly any thanks, and we Americans get [the short \n     end] one way or another, by money, tax and politics, and the \n     system in general.\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for standing up for the working class who are \n     being profoundly affected by the rising gasoline and energy \n     costs. The rising cost of gasoline is affecting the cost of \n     food and commodities as well. It is getting more difficult \n     all the time to make ends meet. My husband and I are in our \n     60s and have turned to riding scooters to be able to afford \n     the gasoline which has gone from costing $200 per month to \n     over $450 per month just to be able to get to work! We \n     definitely need to increase our domestic oil production, \n     provide refineries to process it. We must remember that the \n     oil is a finite resource and therefore we must expand nuclear \n     energy research and develop incentives for conservation. We \n     need to fix some very serious problems in our country. We \n     have major health care issues--insurance companies getting \n     rich and employers having to reduce benefits and all of it \n     basically comes right out of our pockets. We have hungry \n     people in our own country and we should be taking care of \n     business at home, work on becoming much more self sufficient \n     in providing our own energy resources and fix the problems to \n     give Americans back a life that is affordable.\n     Sherry, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am 27 years old, married with no children, and working \n     the hard grind like everyone else. I am currently enrolled at \n     BSU working diligently towards a doctorate degree in \n     chiropractics.\n       While attending BSU, I was able to take an English class \n     that was focused around the environment and problems that \n     have recently arisen. One of the assignments that we were \n     given was to think of a particular crisis that we as humans \n     are facing and come up with a reasonable solution. The topic \n     that I choose to write on was alternate fuels sources. After \n     much research I found that one of the easiest and most \n     abundant fuel sources we have is hydrogen (H).\n       I understand that you set up this email to hear from the \n     people of Idaho with concerns, ideas or whatever to come up \n     with a solution to the current crisis we are in, and \n     everything that I have noticed is everyone is worried just \n     about the cost of fuel. Inflation is a real thing, and it was \n     coming sooner or later . . . but why do we have to focus on \n     using old technology? Why can we not focus on using alternate \n     fuels in Idaho? I am an Idaho native, and I personally \n     believe this is the greatest state to live in because of the \n     quality of life this great state provides. The problem is we \n     are destroying that quality by still utilizing fossil fuels.\n       I recently went to the movies with my wife and saw an \n     inspiring short film about the town of Greensburg, Kansas. If \n     you are not familiar with the phenomenon that is occurring in \n     this town I will briefly describe it. Recently this town of \n     Greensburg was devastated by numerous tornadoes to the point \n     of there were no sound structures still standing . . . \n     instead of the people of the community just giving up and \n     moving, they decided to rebuild the city but to rebuild it as \n     the ``greenest'' city on earth. They made a commitment to not \n     only better the environment, but also the community and the \n     quality of life. This short story struck a chord with me . . \n     . why combat the prices of fuel? Why not combat the harmful \n     fuel itself? Through the basic laws of physics we know that \n     mass cannot be destroyed, just changed. Hydrogen (H) is the \n     simplest form of a molecule known to man, and once combusted \n     with Oxygen it creates water. I know you are a very educated \n     man and probably do not need physics or chemistry lessons but \n     I do have a point. Being our Senator and our voice, and \n     acknowledging the crisis we are in I applaud you for your \n     ongoing efforts, but I personally think we should not only \n     focus our efforts to help alleviate the hardships on Idahoans \n     but make the quality of life better. Become the first State \n     in this great nation to do something different, make a \n     difference, and show the rest of the nation what Idahoans are \n     all about.\n       Fuel will always be needed, but why limit what fuel that \n     is? We have a chance to make a difference, become leaders and \n     not followers. Set a trend that will improve our economic \n     standings, make miracles happen and change the world. I \n     understand that you are one among a very powerful group of \n     people . . . but you have the state of Idaho behind you to \n     make a difference. The only thing I ask is for you to enlist \n     into a righteous cause and make a difference that the world \n     can see and will follow.\n       Thank you for your efforts and your time in reading this; \n     it is my pleasure to have a representative who cares in \n     office.\n     Mike.\n                                  ____\n\n       I did not receive your email request because I am not a \n     registered Republican. However, whether Republican or \n     Democrat, we are all suffering the same crisis with the \n     rising fuel costs.\n       I will not go into the politics of this because I just do \n     not understand how big oil business can control the whole \n     world like this.\n       What I do know is this: I moved my daughter out to Meridian \n     a few years ago so I could be more help raising her three \n     children. She is a single mother who is not receiving child \n     support, but makes too much money for state help. We both \n     work in Boise. She keeps her children involved in sports to \n     help keep them out of trouble. Now she has to decide--drive \n     to work, drive the kids to sports, or buy groceries. My other \n     daughter (she and I are both single also) and I help buy \n     groceries, help her with expenses, and help drive the kids to \n     sports events. Now we are all suffering.\n       My daughter (with the children) received a 2% raise this \n     year, but her power just went up 10%, gas has gone up 100%, \n     and her medical insurance deduction from her check went up \n     20%. It has reached the point where we are all selling our \n     homes and moving into one to help with expenses. The days of \n     multiple generation homes has come back. I really do not know \n     how the elderly on limited incomes are surviving.\n       Thanks for listening, and I hope answers will be coming \n     very soon. This just has to stop.\n     Arden, Meridian.\n                                  ____\n\n       I just wanted to share that we are one of many grandparents \n     that are raising a grandchild. I have chosen to stay at home \n     to raise her so we are now a one-income family. My husband \n     works in Boise, and we live in Middleton. It is costing us \n     over $200 a month for gas for him to go to work. Our \n     granddaughter's father is in a work camp in St. Anthony and \n     every year we take her to see him. She lives for that visit, \n     but this year we had to break the news to her that we could \n     not afford to make this trip. She was brokenhearted. But if \n     the cost of fuel keeps going up, we may have to also break \n     the bad news to her that she will not be able to continue \n     with her dance classes. She has been taking ballet for 7 \n     years, but we will have to make the choice of food and gas \n     over her dancing. I have also been able to help at her school \n     during the day, but again this year that may not happen. If \n     the gas prices do not go down and the state raises the price \n     on registrations I will have no option but to park my car and \n     not use it at all. My husband always goes to a church mission \n     every year to help the poor and needy with house repairs, but \n     not this year, as they have to supply their own gas back and \n     forth.\n       We are at the point with gas prices and food prices and \n     utilities and property taxes going up and wages staying the \n     same we do not have anything left at the end of each pay \n     period. There is no fun time for us now, no vacations, eating \n     out, or going to a movie. We are saving our dimes this year \n     to just go to the fair, which our little girl looks forward \n     to also. I pray I do not have to say no to her again.\n       I also have a father who lives here in Middleton; he is 84 \n     years old and has cancer and has to drive everyday to Boise \n     for treatments. He has not complained but I am sure being on \n     a fixed income he is giving something up to get that gas to \n     receive his radiation. Please help all of us people. I know \n     there are people who are worst off than we. This is just not \n     fair or just.\n     Diana.\n                                  ____\n\n       My story is as follows: I am a (divorced) single parent of \n     three. I work fulltime and am buying my home. I receive a \n     small amount of child support along with my salary. It has \n     become nearly impossible to be able to afford to just drive \n     to work and back. Taking my children anywhere for a summer \n     vacation has become an impossibility this year. It has \n     already reached the point that I have to choose between gas \n     and anything else (including running my air conditioner in my \n     home or car). If the cost of fuel keeps rising, I will \n     definitely have to mortgage my house just to get through the \n     remainder of the year. It is not right! We are living hand to \n     mouth, and the United States has resources we should be \n     utilizing. Even if the oil off-shore will not immediately \n     alleviate the cost of fuel, we need to start drilling in \n     order to stabilize our economy. In the mean time, the \n     ``negotiators'' who buy the oil from other countries could \n     cut back their bonuses and cut our costs drastically.\n     Jeanna, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       How much energy can the sun provide?\n       According to the American Solar Energy Society, enough \n     sunlight falls on the earth's surface each minute to meet \n     world energy demand for an entire year. http://\nwww.powerhousetv.com/.\n\n[[Page S2590]]\n\n       The above info blows me away.

We employ \n     approximately 50 people. Our industry uses primarily steel. \n     From raw stock steel products, to axles with wheels and tires \n     and all the necessary hardware to complete this equipment.\n       Over the past two and a half years our company has endured \n     huge price increases in our consumables needed to produce our \n     products.

FAB TEC uses many \n     petroleum based products such as large amounts of conveyor \n     belting, tires and paint products. Not to mention the fuel it \n     takes to bring in and ship out our products. The \n     manufacturer, and also the end user of products like ours are \n     absorbing huge costs due to the out of control pricing of the \n     consumables we use in the production of the product we sell.\n       With the public's whispered word ``recession'' at hand, we \n     think it is time our government steps in to control the price \n     gouging large corporations have forced on all of us, \n     especially including the individual standing in line at the \n     grocery store to buy his bare necessaries to survive the ever \n     increasing cost due to out of control fuel costs.

Mr. President, I am joined by my \ndistinguished colleague, Mr. Bennet from Colorado.\n  Next week, several thousand city and town leaders from across the \ncountry will visit us in Washington, DC, to discuss the major issues of \nthe day. They will be gathered under the auspices of the National \nLeague of Cities, NLC, whose president is one of our distinguished \nmayors--Northglenn, CO, Mayor Kathleen Novak.\n  Senator Bennet and I will have the honor of meeting with Mayor Novak \nand a group of other Colorado municipal leaders working through NLC and \nthe Colorado Municipal League.\n  I want to take this opportunity to recognize Mayor Kathleen Novak. \nMayor Novak was elected to Northglenn's City Council on July 11, 1991, \nafter years of serving the community. She was elected mayor in November \n2001 and then reelected in November 2005, serving two 4-year terms.\n  It was Mayor Novak's interest in planning for the city's future that \nled the city council to develop goals and adopt a strategic plan to \nhelp guide the city into the future. Each year, the Northglenn City \nCouncil identifies critical issues that can impact and shape \nNorthglenn's future and develops an action agenda to prioritize and \naddress these pressing issues. This has allowed the city to make \ntremendous progress on many fronts throughout the mayor's term in \nelected office.\n  Over the years, Novak helped continue to provide the top-notch \nservices that residents have grown to appreciate while balancing the \ncommunity's transportation and infrastructure needs through upgrades to \nthe city's infrastructure and facilities. While Mayor Novak was in \noffice, Northglenn built a new wastewater treatment facility and a new \nmaintenance and operations facility and self-funded the 112th Avenue \nOverpass to make traveling from east to west easier for the city's \nresidents. Northglenn was the first city in Colorado to promote water \nconservation efforts such as instituting a lottery system whereby city \nresidents could secure free high-efficiency water features for their \nhomes. Through these efforts, the city expects to save 20-25 acre-feet \nof water annually and thereby save the city and its citizens money from \nthe conserved water.\n  Northglenn also applies biosolids from water treatment to fertilize \nfarms in Weld County. Through such applications, the city grew, \nharvested, and sold 2,500 tons of crops. Since recycling conserves \nprecious natural resources, over the past 9 years, the city has been \nheating two shop buildings with used motor oil that residents have \nplaced at the curb for recycling.\n  In 2008, Mayor Novak's interest in reconnecting government to all age \ngroups led the city to be the first in the State to be named a Playful \nCity USA by KABOOM, as unique offerings of play continued to take shape \nin Northglenn. Early in Novak's tenure, Northglenn received America's \nCrown Community Award by American City and County Magazine for the \nrehabilitation and redesign of Webster Lake and E.B. Rains Jr. Memorial \nPark. The park included an innovative concept of providing unique \nopportunities of play for all--Northglenn's Sensory Playground. The \nplayground offers children with a range of disabilities the opportunity \nto experience play and exceeds the Americans with Disabilities Act \nrequirement of 50 percent accessibility by providing nearly 100 percent \naccessibility for people who use wheelchairs.\n  Most recently, the renovation of the Croke Reservoir Nature Area \nearned the city the 2009 Colorado American Public Works Association \nAward for Engineering and Construction Management for medium-sized \ncommunities. The project included stabilization of the eastern \nshoreline, removal of sediment to improve fishery and wildlife habitat, \nand improvements to stormwater detention in the area.\n  Throughout her service, Mayor Kathleen Novak has worked hard to \nensure that the city of Northglenn maintains its high quality of life. \nLast December, in recognition of her efforts, Mayor Novak was \nunanimously elected by her national peers to serve as the president of \nthe National League of Cities, the voice of municipal government in \nthis country. Senator Bennet and I thank Mayor Novak for her leadership \nand dedication to Northglenn, CO, and to the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/27/senate-section/article/S2590-2", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mr. Thomas, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/27/senate-section/article/S2590-3", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2590]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "27"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/02/27/senate-section/article/S2590-4", "month": "02", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2590-S2592]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-834.

A bill to authorize the exploration, leasing, development, \nand production of oil and gas in and from the western portion of the \nCoastal Plain of the State of Alaska without surface occupancy, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nthat I believe represents a true compromise to end a three-decade \ndispute over oil development in northern Alaska. Today, I am \nintroducing legislation that would permit oil and gas to be siphoned \nfrom underneath the Coastal Plain of the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge in northern Alaska but without there being any permanent roads, \nwells, buildings, pipelines, or structures erected that may interrupt \nthe beauty of the Coastal Plain.\n  Today, I am happy to announce that I am being joined by my colleague \nfrom Alaska, Senator Begich, in introducing the No Surface Occupancy \nWestern Arctic Coastal Plain Domestic Energy Security Act.\n  For 29 years since passage of the Alaska National Interest Lands \nConservation Act in 1980, there has been a controversy that has raged \nover whether oil and natural gas development should occur from within \nthis 1.5 million acres of the Arctic Coastal Plain. This is located \nright inside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in northern Alaska. \nAccording to the USGS, the area has a mean chance of containing 10.36 \nbillion barrels of oil and 8.6 trillion cubic feet of natural gas and a \nhigh chance of producing 16 billion barrels. This is the largest likely \nundiscovered onshore conventional oil deposit in North America.\n  Over the years, environmentalists have argued that this area cannot \nbe developed without causing disturbance and perhaps environmental \ndamage to the surface of the Coastal Plain which could harm the Arctic \nporcupine caribou herd that roam in the area and also harm the bird \nlife that utilizes the Refuge during the brief Arctic summer.\n  Over the years, this argument and controversy has been fought with \nnear religious intensity. But now what we have is a technology that has \nbeen developed that offers a compromise solution that may allow much of \nthe area's energy to be produced without surface damage or disturbance \nwhen wildlife is in the area. The solution is to permit oil and gas \ndevelopment to occur without any surface occupancy, meaning without \nconstruction of any structures above the ground within the area of the \nCoastal Plain protected by section 1002 of ANILCA. This is possible \nsince the extended-reach directional drilling technology now permits \noil wells to be drilled on the western Alaska State-owned lands, \noutside of the Refuge's boundary, or from the State waters up to the \nnorth, and still be able to tap oil and gas deposits located between 8 \nto 10 miles inside the Refuge.\n  Some have suggested this is incredible. How can you place a well and \nbe\n\n[[Page S2593]]\n\nable to drill directionally or tap into resources directionally a \nlength of perhaps 8 miles? Proof for this concept comes from British \nPetroleum's efforts just last season in the 2008 to 2009 drilling \nseason to develop Alaska's North Slope Liberty oilfield. They are using \nthe directional drilling technology that will allow them to tap \nreserves up to 48,000 feet from the well pad.\n  What we are talking about here is placement of a drill and then going \ndirectionally out in all areas in a length or a distance of up to 8, \npossibly 10, miles in all directions. It is like an invisible straw \nthat would essentially be able to siphon the oil from under the Coastal \nPlain area and provide for the resource we need without surface \ndisruption. According to estimates last year by the U.S. Department of \nInterior's BLM, up to 1.23 billion barrels of oil and 7 trillion cubic \nfeet of natural gas may be accessible initially using this directional \ndrilling technology.\n  This proposal will require that three-dimensional seismic and other \ntests be conducted within the Coastal Plain to pinpoint exactly where \nwe want to drill for the location of the hydrocarbons. But these can be \nconducted in the wintertime from ice roads when we do not have any \nwildlife in the area.\n  Eventually, more of the oil and gas from the Coastal Plain may be \naccessible either as the directional drilling technology improves and \nexpands its reach or as other subsurface oil development technology is \ndeveloped.\n  Regardless, if there are no pipelines, if there are no wells, no \nphysical structures that are permitted on the surface of the land, \nthere can be no impact on the wildlife and no degradation to the \nwilderness characteristics to the Coastal Plain for visitors. \nMeanwhile, oil to help improve the Nation's supplies and to lower \nprices can start to be produced quickly since the infrastructure over \nin Prudhoe Bay already extends to nearly the border of the Refuge.\n  Finding more oil in America is vital to prevent oil prices from again \nspiking as the global economy recovers and energy demand increases. Not \none of us can forget the pain of just last summer when world prices of \n$147 per barrel for crude oil triggered prices of $4 to $5 a gallon at \nour filling stations. Without more domestic oil being developed, prices \ncan again be expected to skyrocket, especially if OPEC is successful in \ncurrent efforts to reduce the world's oil supplies.\n  There may be some who question whether there is precedent to do \nsomething as we are suggesting today. There is clearly precedent. \nCongress, back in 2007, approved a Wyoming wilderness lands bill. This \nwas the Wyoming Range Legacy Act that permitted subsurface resource \nextraction provided that no surface occupancy occurs.\n  Our legislation would guarantee that royalties from any oil and gas \nproduced would be split equally between the Federal and State \ntreasuries, as is required by current Federal law. It provides for full \nenvironmental protections and project labor agreements for any \ndevelopment that results. The bill further proposes that $15 million a \nyear be made available to mitigate any developmental impacts that might \nresult and allocates 50 percent of the Federal share of total revenues \nto fund renewable energy.\n  Senator Stevens, when he was in the Congress last year, and I had \nintroduced legislation to open ANWR. Within that ANWR legislation, it \nwas, again, directing a substantial portion of the revenues to enhance \nthe buildout of our renewable energy. We are proposing that in this \nlegislation as well: 50 percent of the Federal share of the total \nrevenues to fund renewable energy, another 25 percent for fish and \nwildlife habitat and conservation programs, and then the balance of 25 \npercent would go to the general Treasury.\n  The mitigation aid I just mentioned will guarantee that any Alaskan \ncommunity impacted by development, especially residents of the North \nSlope Borough and the village of Kaktovik, will be protected from the \nindirect impacts of increased development activity.\n  What we can anticipate from this is a bill that would funnel tens to \nperhaps hundreds of billions of dollars toward construction of \nrenewable energy over the life of the prospective oilfields. According \nto a report by the Congressional Research Service, ANWR's opening could \nprovide the Federal Treasury with $91.7 billion of revenues--and this \nassumes oil at a price of $60 a barrel--and with $191 billion, assuming \noil prices of $125 a barrel.\n  This all assumes a mean case estimate that 10.3 billion barrels will \nultimately be produced. Obviously, with the legislation we have, the \nrevenues would initially be much less because with the protection for \nthe surface disruption we simply cannot extract as much. But as the \ntechnology improves, certainly we could see that amount increase.\n  Given that the Obama administration is seeking at least $15 billion a \nyear to fund renewable energy, this measure could go a long way toward \nmeeting the administration's goal to pay for green, renewable energy in \nthe future. It will certainly provide a massive boost to funding for \nexisting fish and game habitat and wildlife conservation programs \nacross the Nation.\n  This proposal is a clear benefit for America. We gain the oil and \nnatural gas that is crucial to provide a bridge until a new era of \nnonfossil fuel, renewable energy can power our lights and move our \nvehicles. But it also guarantees that none of the Arctic porcupine \ncaribou herd that migrates across the Coastal Plain between June and \nAugust will ever see, hear, or feel oil development. The proposal also \nmeans that none of the migratory birds that nest on the Coastal Plain \nwill ever be impacted by oil development. And it means that no hiker or \nwilderness enthusiast who visits the Coastal Plain or floats its river \nin the brief Arctic summer will ever see, hear, or feel oil and gas \ndevelopment.\n  With the proposal and the environmental safeguards this legislation \nallows the Secretary of the Interior to establish, there is no danger \nthat any of the few species that overwinter on the coastal plain will \nbe impacted by seismic or other activities, and it protects the \nsubsistence resources and activities for Alaskan natives. We clearly \nhave the ability to prevent any impacts to the few polar bears that \nsometimes den on the coastal plain or the musk oxen that sometimes \nvisit the area in the winter.\n  For decades now, Alaskans have been seeking permission to explore and \nto develop oil in the 1002 area. Given the general estimates the USGS \nhas indicated, we recognize that it offers this country the best chance \nfor a major oil find of any spot onshore in North America, and the \ntechnology has advanced so that we now have the possibility of \nresolving this dispute to the satisfaction of all sides.\n  For years, Mr. President, this debate has raged with an intensity \nthat is quite remarkable. I would hope that in this era of change, this \nbill will change the tone of this debate and permit oil and gas \nproduction to go hand in hand with responsible environmental \nstewardship.\n  I thank the Chair for his attention this morning, and I hope that \nMembers of this body who have been engaged in the debate on the \npotential opening of ANWR for development would look at this proposal \nwith fresh eyes. I hope they will set aside some of the political \nrhetoric this has generated over the past 25-plus years and look at \nthis as a meaningful way to help enhance our Nation's energy security, \nwhile at the same time respecting the land that we have up North.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 503\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
