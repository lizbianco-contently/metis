Madam President, it is now official. Top Democrats on \nCapitol Hill are starting to signal their intention to raise taxes on \nthe middle class. The House majority leader in a speech today warned \nthat in order to do anything about the debt crisis Republicans have \nbeen speaking about on the Senate floor in recent weeks, President \nObama will have no choice, no choice, but to break his campaign pledge \nof ``no new taxes'' for millions of American families.\n  That is the majority leader in the House of Representatives in a \nspeech today, saying that the President will have no choice but to \nbreak his promise of no new taxes for millions of American families.\n  Respectfully, I think this is a tough argument for the Democratic \nleadership in the House that will not even take up the Senate's version \nof the so-called doc fix legislation for no apparent reason other than \nthe fact that it does not increase the debt.\n  It is hard to imagine anyone taking advice on fiscal discipline from \na party that has spent the last 2\\1/2\\ weeks arguing not about how to \npay for the extenders bill that is on the floor or how to use this bill \nto cut the debt but about how much money to add to the debt in the \nprocess of passing it.\n  Here is another idea Democrats should consider, one that Americans \nhave been proposing loudly and clearly: Stop spending money you do not \nhave. Stop spending money you do not have. The American people do not \nthink our problem is that the government taxes too little. Our problem \nis that the government taxes too much and that it spends too much and \nborrows too much. Until Democrats demonstrate even the slightest \nability to restrain the recklessness with which they spend America's \nhard-earned tax dollars, the job creators and the workers of this \ncountry are not about to take them seriously on how to lower the \nnational debt.\n  The American people should not be asked to pay the price for \nDemocrats' recklessness through higher taxes. America faces a debt \ncrisis. Democrats have done nothing whatsoever to show they understand \nthat. Breaking a campaign pledge now will not help; cutting spending \nwill.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5219-6", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5219]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The minority leader, Senator McConnell, is right. \nDeficits are important. So are facts. Let's mention a few facts on the \nfloor of the Senate. When was the last time the U.S. Government ran a \nsurplus? A surplus. Collected more money than it spent? Well, it \nhappened to be in the last year of President Bill Clinton's \nadministration. So when President George W. Bush was elected, President \nClinton said: Welcome to Washington. Here is a $230 billion surplus, \nand if you follow the spending patterns we have laid out over the next \n10 years, you will generate a $5 trillion surplus in the Treasury--$230 \nbillion now, plan for a $5 trillion surplus. At that time the debt of \nAmerica, the accumulated debt of America, from George Washington \nthrough Bill Clinton, all of the debt we had amassed, $5 trillion.\n  George W. Bush. Welcome to Washington. A surplus. A plan to increase \nthe surplus. A plan to spend down the national debt. But what happened \nin 8 years of Republican rule, fiscally conservative Republican rule? I \nwill tell you what happened. The national debt went from $5 trillion to \n$12 trillion.\n  How do you do that in 8 years? Well, you wage two wars that you do \nnot pay for, and you give tax breaks to the wealthiest people in \nAmerica, and you have a prescription drug plan that is not paid for as \nwell under Republican Presidents.\n  The national debt from Bill Clinton, $5 trillion; to the end of \nPresident George W. Bush, $12 trillion, and a little gift that \nPresident George W. Bush left to President Barack Obama as he left \noffice. No, he did not leave him the $230 billion that he was given as \nhe came into the presidency. No, he handed off to President Obama a \n$1.3 trillion deficit. Welcome to Washington, President Obama. And when \nyou take your hand off the Bible at the swearing in, let's mention too \nthat the Bush economic policies have now cost us, that month, January, \nthat month in 2009, 750,000 American jobs. Now we hear from the \nRepublican side of the aisle these pious incantations about our budget \ndeficit.\n  Well, it is a problem. But let's put the blame where it belongs. When \nthe Republicans had their chance, they took a surplus and turned it \ninto the biggest deficit in the history of the United States. When \nPresident Bush had his economic policies in place, we doubled the \nnational debt. When President Bush left office, he left the economy in \nthe worst recession we have had since the Great Depression.\n  Now come the Republicans and say: We need to cut spending. Well, \nlet's go back and look at another lesson in history. This goes even \nfurther back--80 years, the worst economic situation in modern times in \nAmerica, the Great Depression. I heard about it as a kid. But it was \nnot as if my parents were giving me a history lesson, they were giving \nme a story about our family, how my mom and dad got married in 1928, \nhad their first baby in 1929, and their second baby in 1931, and tried \nto raise a family in the Great Depression. Their lives were changed \nforever. Their view of the world changed forever. My\n\n[[Page S5220]]\n\nmom, an immigrant to this country, and my dad, from a farm family, \nnever borrowed money, scared to death of debt, because they saw the \nGreat Depression and they saw it destroy people. Franklin Roosevelt \ncame in as President in those days. He came in in March of 1933. He \nsaid, we are going to change this. We are going to get America back on \nits feet. You have nothing to fear but fear itself. We are going to put \npeople back to work. We are going to give them government jobs if we \ncannot find them jobs in the private sector. We are going to tell our \nfarmers, you are going to survive because we are going to basically \nstand behind you through the tough years. Whether it is a drought or a \nflood, we are going to be around to help you get through to the next \nyear. We are going to make sure that banks do not fail. We are going to \ninject government into this economy and get America back on its feet.\n  At that time the unemployment rate in America was 25 percent. When \nthe New Deal got started, they brought it down 13 percent, cut it in \nhalf because of government investment in this economy. People went back \nto work. They left the long lines waiting for soup and bread and \nstarted earning some money. They built highways. They built bridges. \nThey built stadiums. They built parts of America we still use today. It \nwas an investment by the government in our economy to bring us out of \nthe worst depression we had ever faced.\n  Then, after a few years what happened? Republican critics came \nforward and said, wait a minute. This is deficit spending. We are \nspending money we do not have. We have got to stop. And they prevailed, \njust as Senator McConnell wants to prevail today. Hit the brakes. Stop \nspending. You know what happened? They prevailed with that argument. \nYou know what happened with the unemployment rate? It went from 13 \npercent back to 19 percent, and the sick economy continued for years \nuntil the war came along, World War II, and we had a massive investment \nin our Nation to protect our Nation, to give our troops what they \nneeded, and we put people back to work.\n  Now we are about to repeat history. The Republicans come to us now \nand say, we have got to stop putting money back into the economy. It \ncreates deficit. Yes, it does. But if you do not get the 14 million \nunemployed Americans back to work, the deficit will get worse. They \nwill not be paying taxes, they will be drawing on government services.\n  We want them back to work. And it means making sure we make \ninvestments in America that count--helping small businesses; tax \ncredits and tax deductions for small businesses; credit for small \nbusinesses; government actively moving forward to give small businesses \na chance to keep their employees and hire more.\n  That is what we believe in on the Democratic side of the aisle. The \nRepublicans say: Oh, deficit spending. Stop. We cannot do that. Then \nwhat happens? The business fails. The jobs are lost. The people draw \nunemployment and, in desperation, wait for something to happen.\n  You know what the Republicans are up to now? Last week we asked them: \nWould you please extend unemployment benefits for these millions of \nAmericans who are out of work. In my State the unemployment rate is \n10.8 percent. It has been around that for several months now. Boone \nCounty, 16.6 percent; Pulaski County, way down south, 12 percent; \nwestern edge of our State, Hancock County, 11.8 percent; and in Clark \nCounty, in the southeastern end of our State, 13.7 percent. There are \n717,000 people in Illinois officially unemployed.\n  The Republicans say: Cut off their unemployment benefits. That is \nwhat they voted for last Thursday. And 80,000 of those 717,000 \nunemployed will lose their unemployment benefits.\n  What happens to the unemployment check? It is the most quickly spent \ngovernment check ever sent out. Desperate people out of work take that \ncheck and turn it into groceries and clothes and shoes and gas in the \ncar and utility bills and rent and mortgage payments as quickly as they \nreceive it. It is money right back into the economy. They want to cut \nit off because we have a deficit.\n  I understand this deficit. I am on the Deficit Commission, and I \nunderstand taking it seriously. But let's take seriously putting \nAmerica back to work. This Republican approach of cutting the \nunemployment compensation for people who lost their jobs through no \nfault of their own is a strategy that failed in the 1930s and is going \nto fail us now.\n  We have to believe in America and a better day when people are back \nto work and this economy is moving forward. We will deal with this \ndeficit with a strong economy, with Americans working, not by quaking \nand quivering and saying we cannot put money back into the hands of \nthose who are out of work. That is one of the fundamentals in this \ngovernment. It is the way we take this great free market system of \nours, when it falls on hard times, and move it forward again.\n  All of the speeches we will hear from the other side of the aisle \nabout deficits are going to overlook the obvious. Were it not for the \nfailed economic policies of the Bush administration, we would not be \nwhere we are today. Were it not for the doubling of the national debt \nunder the last Republican President, we would not be where we are \ntoday.\n  It seems that those on the other side of the aisle have, I guess, an \nextreme sensitivity to deficits when there is a Democratic President, \nand are oblivious to them when there is a Republican President. The \nAmerican people know what the facts say. They know the history. I hope \nthey do not embrace the Republican approach which will drive us further \ninto unemployment and recession.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Maryland.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5220-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5220-S5223]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KAGAN NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, this Monday the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee will begin the confirmation hearings for Elena Kagan to be an \nAssociate Justice of the Supreme Court. These confirmation hearings \nwill provide an opportunity to the public to see firsthand how \nimportant Supreme Court decisions are in their ordinary lives. There \nare many examples we could give, from schools to consumer issues to \npersonal lives, privacy, religious protections, helping the \nenvironment, the workplace.\n  In recent years, by a sharply divided Court, they have reversed \nprecedent and congressional intent and ruled on the side of big \nbusiness over individual rights. This is judicial activism, not \njudicial restraint. I hope all my colleagues will agree that the next \nSupreme Court Justice should be on the side of individual Americans, \nfollowing legal precedent and congressional intent.\n  I wish to give an example--I know my colleagues will give others--\nabout workplace fairness in Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire. Let me provide \na little background. Lilly Ledbetter worked for 19 years at Goodyear \nTire. During that period, she was paid $15,000 a year less than her \nmale counterparts doing the same work. This type of discrimination is \nprohibited by congressional statute under the Civil Rights Act of 1964. \nWithin that legislation, title VII was specifically enacted to protect \nAmerican workers from undue discrimination, including gender \ndiscrimination. When Mrs. Ledbetter found out she was being \ndiscriminated against, she did the right thing: she brought a claim \nagainst her employer.\n  The only reason Mrs. Ledbetter knew she was being paid less than her \nmale counterparts was because a colleague finally told her. This is not \nunusual. In fact, in most employment discrimination cases, employees \nare unaware of discrimination until an unexpected event occurs or \nundisclosed information finally comes to light.\n  Mrs. Ledbetter went to court, stated her claim, and won. After \nmultiple appeals, the case reached the Supreme Court. The Supreme \nCourt, by a 5-to-4 decision, denied her claim. The Court said Mrs. \nLedbetter had to file her case within 180 days after the beginning of \nthe discrimination, and since she did not do that, her claim was barred \nby the statute of limitations. This defies logic. How can a person \nbring a claim when they don't know they are being discriminated \nagainst? It makes no sense.\n\n[[Page S5221]]\n\n  This decision appalled me and many of our colleagues. Whose side is \nthe Supreme Court on? What happened to protecting American workers and \nnot big business? What happened to following legal precedent? What \nhappened to following congressional intent? What happened to judicial \nrestraint from a majority of the Court that professes that is what they \nbelieve is right? If an employee is being discriminated against, there \nshould be effective remedy. If they don't know they were discriminated \nagainst, it doesn't make the error any less wrong when they find out \nabout it. The Court is clearly out of touch with the impact they have \non everyday Americans.\n  This case is a perfect example of hurting female workers. As of 2009, \nwomen comprised 46.8 percent of the U.S. labor force. As of 2009, 66 \nmillion women were employed in the United States; 74 percent were \nemployed full time; 26 percent, part time. Equal pay has been U.S. law \nfor more than four decades. But on average, women today still make just \n78 cents for every dollar made by a man in an equivalent position. \nWomen of color are in an even worse position. The average earnings for \nAfrican-American women were 68 percent of a male's earnings, while \nLatinos earn just 58 percent of a male's earnings. The Supreme Court \nruled against precedent and actually made it more difficult for women \nto bridge this gap. That is not what we want from the Supreme Court of \nthe United States. That is not what we want as far as the activism of \nthe Supreme Court is concerned.\n  When the Court turned the law completely on its head and circumvented \ncongressional intent, Congress stepped in. I am proud to say that my \nsenior Senator, Ms. Mikulski, introduced the Lilly Ledbetter Equal Pay \nAct, which I cosponsored. This legislation had 54 Senate cosponsors and \npassed the Senate by a vote of 61 to 36. The House of Representatives \npassed the bill by a vote of 255 to 177. On January 29, 2009, President \nObama signed his first bill into law, the Lilly Ledbetter Equal Pay \nAct.\n  Under our system of checks and balances, each branch of government \nhas a responsibility to keep the other in check. But we all should be \non the side of the American people and workers. As the Judiciary \nCommittee and the Senate convene next week to consider the nomination \nof Elena Kagan, we need to remember whose side we are on. We need to \nremember that big business can and will fend for itself, but it is \nindividuals who look to the Court and to Congress to uphold the law and \nthe protections it delivers.\n  Elena Kagan will be the fourth woman to serve on the Nation's highest \nCourt, and this will be the first time in history we will have three \nwomen serving on the Court at the same time. Elena Kagan's record as \nSolicitor General and her broad legal background give me confidence \nthat she understands the appropriate role of the Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Madam President, let me thank the Senator from \nMaryland for his comments about the Ledbetter decision.\n  What we are gathering on the floor today to discuss is whether \nAmerican corporations are getting something more than a fair shake from \nRepublican appointees on the Supreme Court, whether there is a bit of a \nsystemic lean in favor of corporate interests on the part of those \njudges to the point where we really now need to call that out because \nit is beyond what statistics could possibly justify.\n  Certainly, the Ledbetter decision helps prove that point. We have at \na company a woman who does not know she is being discriminated against; \nthat for the same work as her male colleagues, she is being paid less. \nShe has no way to know that. She does not know that. The fact that she \ndoes not know that is held against her rather than against the company \nwhich discriminated against her. The company was able to get off scot-\nfree for all those months and years of discrimination before she found \nout what they were doing to her. The law did not require that \nparticular answer. As the dissenting Justices pointed out, it was, in \nfact, the wrong answer. But it certainly served the interests of \ncorporations across America to limit their liability when they \ndiscriminate against their employees.\n  The case I wish to talk about is the Exxon decision where the Supreme \nCourt threw out a jury verdict after the Exxon Valdez oilspill, a jury \nverdict for punitive damages in the amount of $5 billion. Sounds like a \nlot of money. It is a lot of money, but at the time, it was just 1 year \nof profits for Exxon.\n\n  Remember what they did in this case. They took this gigantic tanker, \nthe Exxon Valdez, and they allowed the captain, a known alcoholic, to \nget on board drunk, to continue drinking heavily while on board, and to \nsteer the Valdez aground in Prince William Sound, creating what was \nthen, in 1989, the biggest oilspill in American history.\n  Prince William Sound is still recovering from that. Our colleagues \nfrom Alaska will tell us that one can still pick up rocks on the \nseashore and see the oil on the underside of the rocks. We all remember \nthe images we first saw there--and are now seeing tragically echoed in \nthe gulf--of birds, marine mammals covered in oil, poisoned by oil, \ndying on the shores and beaches or, if they can be found, being \nrecovered by human volunteers who try to clean them up and save their \nlives. It was a very significant error by Exxon.\n  Everybody knows corporations are all about their bottom line. That is \nnot me saying that; that is the law of corporations. They actually have \na duty, a legal duty to their shareholders to maximize their economic \nself-interest. It is what they do. It is why they were set up. It makes \nthem a very important economic engine for society. But it does mean we \nhave to control that motivation through the law. One of the ways we \ncontrol that motivation through the law is with punitive damages--\npunitive damages assessed through the jury.\n  Let me say a quick word about the jury. The jury is an American \ninstitution of government. It is mentioned three times in the \nConstitution and Bill of Rights. It is there for a reason. It is there \nfor a very important reason. When de Tocqueville wrote ``Democracy in \nAmerica,'' he wrote about the jury that it is ``an institution of the \nsovereignty of the people.'' He wrote that in a chapter whose heading \nwas about protecting against the tyranny of the majority.\n  The Founding Fathers saw it that way because they saw corrupt \ncolonial Governors. They saw legislatures that had panicked in that \nperiod between independence and the Constitution. Remember Thomas \nJefferson talking about the Virginia Legislature, saying: We have \nturned out 1 tyrant, and now we have 270 tyrants--or whatever the \nnumber was--of the Virginia Assembly. They had to go back, and Madison \nhad to rethink the balance of powers. They adopted what is now the \nAmerican system of government. They had an experience that there needed \nto be a place where one could go to get a clean decision from a jury of \none's peers. And it didn't matter who the Governor was, who the general \nassembly was, what the power structure was; there was some place in \nAmerican Government where power did not count, where the powerful and \nthe powerless had the same shot. That is why it is in the Constitution. \nThat is why it is described as a mode of the sovereignty of the people.\n  When the Supreme Court takes away from the jury what seems to me to \nbe a reasonable punitive damage assessment--if they had really been \nwhacked for $5 billion, who knows what message that might have sent \nthrough the oil industry. Conceivably, it might have prevented the \noilspill in the gulf if it really rattled their cages enough. But, no, \nit interfered with the predictability corporations want. So the Supreme \nCourt threw out the $5 billion punitive damage assessment--just 1 \nyear's profit for that company--and knocked it down 90 percent. They \nadopted a rule that it couldn't be more than one-to-one with damages. \nIt is not in the Constitution. It is not statutory. They just decided \nthat the interests of corporations in predictability were so important \nthat paying back Alaskans for the damage done and putting a punitive \nassessment on top of it that would prevent this from happening again \nwas less important. Predictability was more important; deterring \nmisconduct\n\n[[Page S5222]]\n\nwas less important. That is a value judgment. It is a value judgment \nthese Justices bring to this Court.\n  Jeffrey Toobin is an authoritative writer about the Supreme Court. He \nstudies it carefully. He tracks it carefully. Here is what he wrote \nlast year about our Chief Justice:\n\n       In every major case since he became the nation's \n     seventeenth Chief Justice, Roberts has sided with the \n     prosecution over the defendant, the state over the condemned, \n     the executive branch over the legislative, and the corporate \n     defendant over the individual plaintiff. Even more than \n     Scalia, who has embodied judicial conservatism during a \n     generation of service on the Supreme Court, Roberts has \n     served the interests and reflected the values of the \n     contemporary Republican Party.\n\n  Remember, this is the one who, when being confirmed, said he was only \ngoing to call balls and strikes, as if that was even an apt \nmetaphor. Well, it seems that the strike zone for individual plaintiffs \nis a lot smaller in this Court than the strike zone for the big \ncorporations. I will pick out a part of the sentence:\n\n       In every major case since he became the Nation's \n     seventeenth Chief Justice, Roberts has sided with the \n     corporate defendant over the individual plaintiff.\n\n  That is as of May 25, 2009.\n  If you take a look at the decision that came down today in Rent-A-\nCenter v. Jackson, an employee challenges a contract saying, Wait a \nminute. I should not have to be a party to that contract because the \ncircumstances that caused me to enter into that contract were \nunconscionable. I should be protected from that contract because it was \nunconscionable to force me to sign it. The contract requires that you \ngo and arbitrate instead of having access to--guess what--the jury.\n  The Supreme Court said the decision over whether it is unconscionable \nshould go to the arbitrator. You wouldn't even be at the arbitrator if \nthe contract weren't valid. It is topsy-turvy logic. But, once again, \nit reflects the fact that the strike zone for corporations is a lot \nbigger with the Republican appointees of this Court than the strike \nzone for regular people.\n  I see Senator Franken from Minnesota here waiting to speak, and I \nwill yield the floor so he may do so.\n  As we face this question of Elena Kagan's nomination to the Supreme \nCourt, we need to be clear that when the opponents talk about rule of \nlaw, when they talk about not having activist judges, when they talk \nabout making sure corporations get a fair shake, there is actually a \nlittle bit more going on here. There is a little bit more going on \nhere, and what is going on here is that over and over and over again \nthe Republican appointees to the U.S. Supreme Court, when they have the \nchance, will rule in favor of the corporation and against the \nindividual defendant. It is not surprising, since the Republicans are \nthe party of the corporations, that the judges they appoint want to \nhelp the corporations. We should not forget that fact as we look at a \nnominee who will hold the strike zone the same; who won't give that \nbenefit any longer to the corporations that now, apparently, are \nbeginning to feel they are entitled to at the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Minnesota.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Madam President, I couldn't agree more with my colleague \nfrom Rhode Island and his eloquent statement, as well as my colleague \nfrom Maryland. I think we are going to be hearing a lot about this \nRoberts Court as we head into and during the Kagan hearings.\n  I rise today to talk about Americans' basic right to have their day \nin court. The Supreme Court has always been a towering institution, \nboth physically and metaphorically. Until recently, as visitors walked \nup the steep steps of the Supreme Court's front doors, they entered \nunderneath a mantle inscribed ``Equal Justice Under Law.'' Now those \nbronze doors are closed to the public.\n  That may have been because of security concerns, but it is hard to \nimagine a better metaphor for what has been happening to our Court. The \nRoberts Court has consistently denied hard-working people their day in \ncourt, blocking them from their entrance to the courtroom.\n  Many of my colleagues remember me speaking on the Senate floor about \nJamie Leigh Jones. As a 20-year-old, she went to Iraq as a contractor \nfor KBR, then a Halliburton subsidy. She complained about sexual \nharassment almost immediately. She was put in a barracks with 400 men \nand a handful of women. When she complained to KBR, they not only \nignored her, they mocked her. They told her, Oh, go spend the day in \nthe spa. Four days later, she was drugged and brutally gang raped by \nher coworkers and then locked in a shipping container with no contact \nwith the outside world.\n  What happened to Jamie Leigh in Iraq was bad enough, but because of \nthe Supreme Court's decision in Circuit City Stores v. Adams, KBR had \nbeen able to force Jamie to sign an employment contract that required \nher to arbitrate all job disputes rather than bringing them to a court \nof law. So Jamie, now a teacher in a Christian school in Texas, was \nforced to spend the next 4 years fighting to get her day in court after \nbeing gang raped on the job. She has had two reconstructive surgeries \nsince this happened. Let me say this again. She was brutally gang raped \non the job and still had to fight to get her day in court.\n  I am proud the Senate passed my amendment to give victims such as \nJamie Leigh Jones a chance for justice and I was proud to see it signed \ninto law. But, sadly, we are about to see a lot more Jamie Leighs \ndenied their day in court. Just yesterday, as Senator Whitehouse noted, \nthe Court erected yet another hurdle for people seeking justice in \nanother 5-4 decision, this one called Rent-A-Center v. Jackson.\n  On one side of the courtroom in this case was Rent-A-Center, a \ncorporation that runs over 3,000 furniture and electronics rent-to-own \nstores across North America, with 21,000 employees and hundreds of \nmillions of dollars in annual profits. On the other side stood Antonio \nJackson, an African-American account manager in Nevada who sought to \nbring a civil rights claim against his employer. Jackson claims that \nRent-A-Center repeatedly passed him over for promotions and promoted \nnon-African-American employees with less experience.\n  Although Jackson signed an employment contract agreeing to arbitrate \nall employment claims, he also knew the contract was unfair, so he \nchallenged it in court. But yesterday the Supreme Court sided with \nRent-A-Center, ruling that an arbitrator, not a court, should decide \nwhether an arbitration clause is valid. Let me say that again. The \narbitrator gets to decide whether an arbitration clause is valid. Let \nme repeat that. The arbitrator gets to decide whether the arbitration \nclause is valid. That is just one step away from letting the \ncorporation itself decide whether a contract is fair.\n  In doing so, the Supreme Court made it even harder for ordinary \npeople to protect their rights at work. Justice Stevens, not \nsurprisingly, wrote the dissent. As he did in Gross, Stevens notes that \nthe Supreme Court, yet again, decided this case along lines ``neither \nbriefed by the parties nor relied upon by the Court of Appeals.'' In \nother words, the Supreme Court went out of its way to close those \nbronze doors--and keep them closed. Clearly, this is a ruling that \nCongress needs to fix, and I look forward to working with my colleagues \nto do so.\n  Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Supreme Court matters to \naverage people--to our neighbors and our kids. Some have tried to \nconvince us that Supreme Court rulings only matter if you want to burn \na flag or sell pornography or commit some horrendous crime. But as \nJamie Leigh Jones and Antonio Jackson show us, the Supreme Court is \nabout much more than that. It is about whether you have a right to a \nworkplace where you won't get raped and whether you can defend those \nrights in court before a jury afterwards. It is about whether \ncorporations will continue to have inordinate power to control your \nlife with their armies of lawyers and their contracts filled with fine \nprint. It is about whether they can force you to sign away your rights \nin an unfair employment contract so you never see the inside of a \ncourtroom. It is, quite frankly, about the kind of society we want to \nlive in.\n  Next week, the Judiciary Committee will hold hearings on the \nnomination of Elena Kagan to the U.S. Supreme Court. Those hearings \nprovide a good opportunity for us to examine the legacy of the Roberts \nCourt and talk\n\n[[Page S5223]]\n\nabout what it would mean to have a Court that instead cares about hard-\nworking Americans.\n  Solicitor General Kagan is nominated to fill the seat currently \noccupied by Justice Stevens who wrote the impassioned dissent in \nyesterday's Rent-A-Center ruling. I hope General Kagan has learned from \nJustice Stevens and takes his words to heart. I look forward to \nquestioning her during these hearings. I want to make sure she \nunderstands that Supreme Court cases impact all of our lives--and that \nshe will be the kind of Justice who believes in equal justice under the \nlaw.\n  Thank you, Madam President. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Madam President, how much time do I have?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Madam President, last week the New York Times ran a \nstory, and I ask unanimous consent to have it printed in the Record at \nthis time.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                [From the New York Times, June 18, 2010]\n\n              Net Benefits of Biomass Power Under Scrutiny\n\n                          (By Tom Zeller, Jr.)\n\n       Greenfield, MA.--Matthew Wolfe, an energy developer with \n     plans to turn tree branches and other woody debris into \n     electric power, sees himself as a positive force in the \n     effort to wean his state off of planet-warming fossil fuels.\n       ``It's way better than coal,'' Mr. Wolfe said, ``if you \n     look at it over its life cycle.''\n       Not everyone agrees, as evidenced by lawn signs in this \n     northwestern Massachusetts town reading ``Biomass? No \n     Thanks.''\n       In fact, power generated by burning wood, plants and other \n     organic material, which makes up 50 percent of all renewable \n     energy produced in the United States, according to federal \n     statistics, is facing increased scrutiny and opposition.\n       That, critics say, is because it is not as climate-friendly \n     as once thought, and the pollution it causes in the short run \n     may outweigh its long-term benefits.\n       The opposition to biomass power threatens its viability as \n     a renewable energy source when the country is looking to \n     diversify its energy portfolio, urged on by President Obama \n     in an address to the nation Tuesday. It also underscores the \n     difficult and complex choices state and local governments \n     face in pursuing clean-energy goals.\n       Biomass proponents say it is a simple and proved renewable \n     technology based on natural cycles. They acknowledge that \n     burning wood and other organic matter releases carbon dioxide \n     into the atmosphere just as coal does, but point out that \n     trees and plants also absorb the gas. If done carefully, and \n     without overharvesting, they say, the damage to the climate \n     can be offset.\n       But opponents say achieving that sort of balance is almost \n     impossible, and carbon-absorbing forests will ultimately be \n     destroyed to feed a voracious biomass industry fueled \n     inappropriately by clean-energy subsidies. They also argue \n     that, like any incinerating operation, biomass plants \n     generate all sorts of other pollution, including particulate \n     matter. State and federal regulators are now puzzling over \n     these arguments.\n       Last month, in outlining its plans to regulate greenhouse \n     gases, the Environmental Protection Agency declined to exempt \n     emissions from ``biogenic'' sources like biomass power \n     plants. That dismayed the biomass and forest products \n     industries, which typically describe biomass as ``carbon \n     neutral.''\n       The agency said more deliberation was needed.\n       Meanwhile, plans for several biomass plants around the \n     country have been dropped because of stiff community \n     opposition.\n       In March, a $250 million biomass power project planned for \n     Gretna, Fla., was abandoned after residents complained that \n     it threatened air quality. Two planned plants in Indiana have \n     faced similar grass-roots opposition.\n       In April, an association of family physicians in North \n     Carolina told state regulators that biomass power plants \n     there, like other plants and factories that pollute the air, \n     could ``increase the risk of premature death, asthma, chronic \n     bronchitis and heart disease.''\n       In Massachusetts, fierce opposition to a handful of \n     projects in the western part of the state, including Mr. \n     Wolfe's, prompted officials to order a moratorium on new \n     permits last December, and to commission a scientific review \n     of the environmental credentials of biomass power.\n       That study, released last week, concluded that, at least in \n     Massachusetts, power plants using woody material as fuel \n     would probably prove worse for the climate than existing coal \n     plants over the next several decades. Plants that generate \n     both heat and power, displacing not just coal but also oil \n     and gas, could yield dividends faster, the report said. But \n     in every case, the study found, much depends on what is \n     burned, how it is burned, how forests are managed and how  \n     the industry is regulated.\n       Ian A. Bowles, the secretary of the Massachusetts Office of \n     Energy and Environmental Affairs, said that biomass power and \n     sustainable forest management were not mutually exclusive. \n     But he also said that the logical conclusion from the study \n     was that biomass plants that generated electricity alone \n     probably should not be eligible for incentives for renewable \n     energy.\n       ``That would represent a significant change in policy,'' \n     Mr. Bowles said.\n       The biomass industry argues that studies like the one in \n     Massachusetts do not make a clear distinction between wood \n     harvested specifically for energy production and the more \n     common, and desirable, practice of burning wood and plant \n     scraps left from agriculture and logging operations.\n       The Biomass Power Association, a trade group based in \n     Maine, said in a statement last week that it was ``not aware \n     of any facilities that use whole trees for energy.''\n       During a recent visit to an old gravel pit outside of town \n     where he hopes to build his 47-megawatt Pioneer Renewable \n     Energy project, Mr. Wolfe said the plant would be capable of \n     generating heat and power, and would use only woody residues \n     as a feedstock. ``It's really frustrating,'' he said. \n     ``There's a tremendous deficit of trust that is really \n     inhibiting things.''\n       In the United States, biomass power plants burn a variety \n     of feedstocks, including rice hulls in Louisiana and sugar \n     cane residues, called bagasse, in parts of Florida and \n     Hawaii. A vast majority, though, some 90 percent, use woody \n     residue as a feedstock, according to the Biomass Power \n     Association. About 75 percent of biomass electricity comes \n     from the paper and pulp companies, which collect their \n     residues and burn them to generate power for themselves.\n       But more than 80 operations in 20 states are grid-connected \n     and generate power for sale to local utilities and \n     distribution to residential and commercial customers, a $1 \n     billion industry, according to the association. The \n     increasing availability of subsidies and tax incentives has \n     put dozens of new projects in the development pipeline.\n       The problem with all this biomass, critics argue, is that \n     wood can actually churn out more greenhouse gases than coal. \n     New trees might well cancel that out, but they do not grow \n     overnight. That means the low-carbon attributes of biomass \n     are often realized too slowly to be particularly useful for \n     combating climate change.\n       Supporters of the technology say those limitations can be \n     overcome with tight regulation of what materials are burned \n     and how they are harvested. ``The key question is the rate of \n     use,'' said Ben Larson of the Union of Concerned Scientists, \n     an environmental group based in Cambridge, Mass., that \n     supports the sensible use of biomass power. ``We need to \n     consider which sources are used, and how the land is taken \n     care of over the long haul.''\n       But critics maintain that ``sustainable'' biomass power is \n     an oxymoron, and that nowhere near enough residual material \n     exists to feed a large-scale industry. Plant owners, they \n     say, will inevitably be forced to seek out less beneficial \n     fuels, including whole trees harvested from tracts of land \n     that never would have been logged otherwise. Those trees, \n     critics say, would do far more to absorb planet-warming gases \n     if they were simply let alone.\n       ``The fact is, you might get six or seven megawatts of \n     power from residues in Massachusetts,'' said Chris Matera, \n     the founder of Massachusetts Forest Watch. ``They're planning \n     on building about 200 megawatts. So it's a red herring. It's \n     not about burning waste wood. This is about burning trees.''\n       Whether or not that is true, biomass power is also coming \n     under attack simply for the ordinary air pollution it \n     produces. Web sites like No Biomass Burn, based in the \n     Pacific Northwest, liken biomass emissions to cigarette \n     smoke. Duff Badgley, the coordinator of the site, says a \n     proposed plant in Mason County, Washington, would ``rain \n     toxic pollutants'' on residents there. And the American Lung \n     Association has asked Congress to exclude subsidies for \n     biomass from any new energy bill, citing potentially ``severe \n     impacts'' on health.\n       Nathaniel Greene, the director of renewable energy policy \n     for the Natural Resources Defense Council, said that while \n     such concerns were not unfounded, air pollution could be \n     controlled. ``It involves technology that we're really good \n     at,'' Mr. Greene said. For opponents like Mr. Matera, the \n     tradeoffs are not worth it.\n       ``We've got huge problems,'' Mr. Matera said. ``And there's \n     no easy answer. But biomass doesn't do it. It's a false \n     solution that has enormous impacts.''\n       Mr. Wolfe says that is shortsighted. Wind power and solar \n     power are not ready to scale up technologically and \n     economically, he said, particularly in this corner of \n     Massachusetts. Biomass, by contrast, is proven and\n\n[[Page S5224]]\n\n     available, and while it is far from perfect, he argued, it \n     can play a small part in reducing reliance on fossil fuels.\n       ``Is it carbon-neutral? Is it low-carbon? There's some \n     variety of opinion,'' Mr. Wolfe said. ``But that's missing \n     the forest for the trees. The question I ask is, What's the \n     alternative?''\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. The above-referenced article is entitled ``Net \nBenefits of Biomass Power Under Scrutiny.'' It is about how the people \nof Massachusetts are starting to debate the idea that they are \naccomplishing anything by displacing coal with biomass to produce clean \nelectricity. I am talking here about producing electricity, not \nbiofuels which we use in our cars.\n  Biomass is essentially burning wood and other organic products in a \nsort of controlled bonfire to produce electricity. The argument for \nbiomass goes like this: Wood is natural. Trees regrow. Burn them up \ntoday and more trees will grow tomorrow. Therefore, we won't run out of \nresources. Moreover, trees are carbon neutral. Burning wood may release \ncarbon dioxide, but trees reabsorb carbon so we can benefit from this \nnatural cycle by generating electricity. Therefore, we are not making \nclimate problems any worse with biomass.\n  Indeed, biomass produces about 50 percent of our Nation's renewable \nelectricity today, according to the New York Times, and by most of the \ndefinitions of renewable electricity that we use in proposals in the \nSenate. But we can't rely upon biomass to replace significant amounts \nof the fossil-based electricity we get today from coal. Biomass \nelectricity has its place, and can be used to burn forest and other \nwood waste. In Tennessee we have a lot of pine trees. They need to be \nremoved from the forest, and this is a good way to do that and make a \nlittle electricity. However, we cannot and we should not start cutting \ndown and burning our forests to produce electricity. The loss of forest \nland is still one of the major ecological catastrophes in Africa, Asia, \nand South America. So are we, the most advanced country in the world, \ngoing to talk about going back to burning up our forests for energy? \nMany environmental advocates are now arguing that biomass should not \neven be considered to be ``renewable'' or ``carbon neutral'' because of \nthe fact that burning wood releases greenhouse gases. While that is \ntrue, so does the natural process of decay, but the carbon is \nreabsorbed by the growth of new trees. Biomass can be, and should be, \nan important--albeit a small part--of our electricity portfolio by \nusing excess forest material and industrial wood waste.\n  Unfortunately, the New York Times piece misses out on one of the most \nimportant concerns about biomass. Just like other renewable electricity \nsources, it cannot be the solution for our clean energy needs because \nof the problem of scale. We would have to continually forest an area \n1\\1/2\\ times the size of the Great Smoky Mountains National Park to \nreplace the electricity created by two standard coal plants or one \nstandard nuclear reactor. Wood has only half the energy density of \ncoal. That means, if nothing else, we have to do twice as much work in \nhauling it around. There is a utility in Georgia that is using wood to \nreplace coal in a 100-megawatt powerplant. This utility has trucks \nrunning in there day and night hauling wood to keep the plant running, \nand that is only 100 megawatts--about one-tenth the size of one nuclear \nreactor. For the southeastern United States to meet a 12-percent \nrenewable electricity standard, as called for in the Waxman-Markey \nenergy climate bill, by using biomass alone, we would have to cut down \nmore trees than the entire U.S. paper industry uses each year.\n  I think it is worth taking note of all this as we move toward the \nidea that renewable resources are the answer to our energy problems.\n  Tomorrow, there will be a group of my colleagues going to the White \nHouse to discuss with the President the issue of how to proceed on \nclean energy. My fear is that we may all be asked to put our \ndifferences aside and settle this issue by pushing through a \n``renewable electricity standard'' that says all we have to do is \nchoose a number--17 percent by 2020 or 25 percent by 2030--and before \nyou know it, we will have all the energy we need from wind, the Sun, \nand from the Earth running our highly advanced technological country.\n  In fact, more than half of the States already have adopted some \nversion of these renewable electricity standards, but they haven't \naccomplished much. New Jersey wants to close down a nuclear reactor and \nreplace it with an offshore wind farm. It will have to build 50-story \nwind turbines along its entire 125-mile coast, and it will still need \nto have the nuclear plant or a natural gas plant or coal plant or some \nother plant to provide electricity when the wind doesn't blow, which is \nmost of the time.\n  To meet its requirement of 33 percent renewable electricity by 2020, \nCalifornia has put up wind farms, developed its abundant geothermal \nresources, and siphoned methane from almost every landfill in the \nState, and it still only gets 12 percent of its electricity from \nrenewables.\n  Last year, a Wall Street Journal article cited the California State \nEnergy Commission's warning that the renewable requirement could begin \ncausing reliability problems--that means that when you turn your light \nswitch on, the light might not go on--and increase electricity rates by \n2011, which is next year. California State agencies were warning that \nsimply increasing the renewable requirement from 20 percent to 33 \npercent could cost $114 billion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe Wall Street Journal article from July 3, 2009.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, July 3, 2009]\n\n          State's Renewable-Energy Focus Risks Power Shortages\n\n                           (By Rebecca Smith)\n\n       California officials are beginning to worry that the \n     state's focus on transitioning to renewable-energy sources \n     could lead to power shortages in the near term.\n       The state has been so keen to develop renewables that \n     relatively few conventional power generators, such as gas-\n     fired plants, have been built lately. That risks a possible \n     energy shortfall in certain places if the economy rebounds \n     any time soon.\n       California's utilities are barreling ahead to try to meet a \n     state mandate to garner 33% of their power from renewable \n     sources by 2020, and some officials are concerned the effort \n     might push up electricity prices and crimp supplies.\n       The state auditor warned this week that the electricity \n     sector poses a ``high risk'' to the state economy. A staff \n     report from the state energy commission also warns that \n     California could find itself uncomfortably tight on power by \n     2011 if problems continue to pile up.\n       Utilities complain that the ambitious renewable-energy \n     mandates, combined with tougher environmental regulations on \n     conventional plants, are compromising their ability to \n     deliver adequate power. ``Conflicting state policies are a \n     problem,'' said Stuart Hemphill, senior vice president of \n     procurement at Southern California Edison, a unit of Edison \n     International of Rosemead, Calif.\n       The stresses being felt in California could be a harbinger \n     of problems to come in other states. The federal Waxman-\n     Markey climate-change bill, passed by the House of \n     Representatives on June 26, would require states to obtain \n     about 15% of their electricity from renewable sources by \n     2020. Currently, about 4% of U.S. electricity comes from \n     renewables, excluding hydropower.\n       California's 33% renewable-energy target is so ambitious \n     that it is likely to miss the goal by five years or more, \n     energy officials now concur.\n       State energy agencies recently concluded it could cost $114 \n     billion or more to meet the 33% mandate, more than double \n     what it might have cost to achieve an earlier 20% \n     requirement. Consumers will bear those costs, one way or \n     another.\n       Agencies also identified problems with constructing \n     sufficient transmission capacity to move renewable-based \n     energy to cities.\n       Southern California Edison, which buys more renewable \n     electricity than any other U.S. utility, has conducted seven \n     solicitations for renewable-energy supplies since 2002 and \n     inked 48 renewable energy contracts. Yet it is still only \n     halfway toward its procurement goal. In 2008, 16% of its \n     electricity was renewable in origin, but more than 60% of \n     that came from geothermal plants--most of them built long \n     before the current push for green power.\n       At the same time, new regulations are putting existing \n     power plants under pressure. Last week, the state Water \n     Resources Control Board issued a proposed policy that would \n     clamp down on power plants that use something called ``once-\n     through cooling,'' which sucks water out of the ocean and \n     rivers and discharges massive amounts of warmed water, \n     harming some aquatic life.\n       The policy would end the practice at 19 plants that produce \n     as much as 15% of the\n\n[[Page S5225]]\n\n     state's electricity. That has the California Energy \n     Commission worried electricity shortages might arise if \n     older, marginal plants are shut down before there is \n     replacement power available.\n       Building conventional power units is notoriously tough in \n     Southern California because of air-quality problems and \n     difficulty getting air-emissions credits, which are \n     essentially rights to spew specified amounts of pollutants.\n       Early this year, the local air agency, the South Coast Air \n     Quality Management District, imposed a moratorium on issuing \n     air credits from its ``bank'' that affected 10 power plants \n     that were under development.\n       ``It's too early to tell how the pieces will fit together, \n     but all the agencies and utilities are talking,'' said \n     Edison's Mr. Hemphill. ``Something has to be worked out.''\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, countries such as Denmark and Germany \nhave done the same thing. Denmark, which is often cited for its wind \npower, has pushed its windmills up to 20 percent of its electrical \ncapacity. That sounds good. Many people regard 20 percent as about the \ntheoretical limit that wind power can supply to a total electric grid, \neven for a small country such as Denmark. Yet Denmark hasn't closed \neven one single coal plant as a result of all these new windmills. So \nit is still dependent on fossil fuels, and it has the most expensive \nelectricity in Europe because of all of its renewable electricity. \nMeanwhile, France, which has gone to 80 percent nuclear power, has per \ncapita carbon emissions 30 percent lower than those of Denmark, and it \nhas so much cheap electricity that France is making $3 billion a year \nexporting its electricity--mostly from nuclear power--to other \ncountries.\n  So what are we getting into when we say we are going to solve our \nenergy problems by passing a law telling ourselves we have to get 15, \n17, or 20 percent of our electricity from renewable sources, very \nnarrowly defined, by 2020?\n  First, it is important to point out that 80 percent of the facilities \nbuilt to satisfy State renewable standards have been windmills. So a \nrenewable electricity standard is really a national windmill policy \ninstead of a national energy policy. Wind turbines are easy to put up, \nespecially in remote areas. We have built 35,000 megawatts in total \nwind energy capacity, which represents an increase of more than 100 \npercent in the past 3 years. But most wind turbines only generate \nelectricity about 33 percent of the time. That is how often the wind \nblows. The best wind farms--the ones on the eastern and west coast \nmountaintops or on the windy plains of the Dakotas--operate a little \nmore than 40 percent of the time. That means our 35,000 megawatts in \nwindmill capacity only generates about 10,000 megawatts at best--the \nequivalent of ten standard nuclear reactors.\n  Moreover, the wind doesn't always blow when it is needed and often \nblows when it is not needed. The strongest winds are at night or during \nthe fall and spring, which are periods of low demand, while the periods \nwith the least wind are hot summer afternoons, when the electricity \ndemand peaks. Wind and other renewables are not dependable in the terms \nthat utilities need dependable electricity. The Tennessee Valley \nAuthority, in the region where I live, says it can only count on the \nwind power it produces in Tennessee and even the wind power it buys \nfrom the Dakotas about 10 to 15 percent of the time when it is actually \nneeded. That is also what has happened in Denmark. They have to give \naway almost half of their wind-generated electricity to Germany and \nSweden at bargain prices because it comes at a time when it is not \nneeded. The result has been that the Danes pay the highest electrical \nprices in Europe and still haven't achieved much reduction in carbon \nemissions.\n  Then there is the matter of subsidies. We hear a lot about oil \nsubsidies in the Senate. I suggest that when we talk about big oil, we \nalso talk about big wind. The U.S. taxpayers are already committed to \nspending $29 billion over the next 10 years to subsidize the investors, \ncorporations, and the banks that have financed the big wind turbines, \nand they only produce 1.8 percent of our electricity. If we went to 20 \npercent of our electricity from wind in the United States, that would \nbe $170 billion from American taxpayers.\n  Windmills are and can be said to be a big success compared to solar \nelectricity at today's prices. California now has more solar \nelectricity than any other State, and in March, the California Public \nUtilities Commission announced the opening of one of the largest \nphotovoltaic stations in California--21 megawatts. Solar power makes \nmore sense as a supplement to our power by offsetting some of our \ndemand by placing solar panels on rooftops, not large-scale electricity \nplants. We all hope we can reduce the cost of solar power, which today \ncosts four times as much as electricity produced from coal.\n  These are technologies we are counting on to solve our energy \nproblems. I think we have to exercise some caution here. The assumption \nis that all we have to do is subsidize these technologies and get them \nup and running, and they will find their place in the market. That \ndoesn't seem to be true. All of these technologies still have much to \nprove before they can shoulder a significant portion of our \nelectricity. Biomass facilities need to be placed where they are most \nefficient and can be used as a supplement to low-cost reliable sources \nof electricity that already provide the large amounts of clean and \nreliable energy we need. We already have a proven technology in nuclear \npower that provides us with 20 percent of our electricity and 70 \npercent of our carbon-free electricity. We should focus on that.\n  As the President and our colleagues consider our clean energy future \ntomorrow and the things we agree on, we can agree to electrify half our \ncars and trucks, and we can agree to build nuclear plants for carbon-\nfree electricity. We can certainly agree on doubling energy research \nand development to bring down the cost of solar power by a factor of 4 \nand to create a 500-mile battery for electric cars.\n  But we need to remember, as we think about the next 10, 20, or 30 \nyears, the United States is not a desert island. We use 25 percent of \nall the energy in the world to produce about 25 percent of all the \nmoney, which we distribute among ourselves, 5 percent of the people in \nthe world. We ought to keep that high standard of living. We need to \nremember we are not a desert island. Someday, solar, wind, and the \nEarth may be an important supplement to our energy needs, but for \ntoday, we are not going to power the United States on electricity \nproduced by a windmill, a controlled bonfire, and a few solar panels.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of New Mexico). The Senator from \nKansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I appreciate my colleague commenting \nabout energy. There is a bipartisan energy bill that I hope the \nPresident discusses tomorrow. It came out of the Energy Committee on a \nbipartisan vote. It doesn't increase cap and trade.\n  I certainly agree with my colleague on nuclear power, although we \nhave some disagreement about wind. We have some nice places in Kansas \nfor wind energy generation. I talked with the operators of the Smoky \nHills Wind Farm last week. It operates between 40 and 45 percent of the \ntime--the highest operating unit in the world. This company is a global \nwind-producing company. It is a very nice operation. I am not saying \nyou can power it all off of wind. I am a nuclear supporter myself.\n  I also believe we have nice places to do wind power and a nice \ngeneration capacity that is complementary to the rest of the energy \ngrid in the United States. Kansas is the second windiest State in the \ncountry. There are many times I have been in Kansas and have wondered, \nwho else could be windier? We have a lot of consistent wind. There are \nplaces we can produce wind power on a very advantageous basis for the \nrest of the country. It is my hope that we can have those on a \ncomplementary basis but that we don't do a cap-and-trade system; \nrather, that we go with the bipartisan bill that passed the Energy \nCommittee.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5225-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5225-S5226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO MANUTE BOL\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Mr. President, I wish to speak about the untimely \npassing of a giant--a giant in the hearts of the Sudanese people but \nalso a literal giant. At 7 foot 7 inches, Manute Bol was a hero in his \nnative home of Sudan, not for the fact alone that he was a pro \nbasketball player in the United States or that he killed a lion with a \nspear while working as a cow\n\n[[Page S5226]]\n\nherder--no, Manute was a hero because of his advocacy for his fellow \ncountrymen, a true humanitarian.\n  Manute began his NBA career in Washington in 1985, when he was \ndrafted in the second round by the Washington Bullets. That year, \nManute set the NBA rookie record with a total of 397 blocks. He \ncontinued to break shot-blocking records throughout his career and is \nthe only player in NBA history to block more shots than points scored.\n  Manute coined the idiom or the phrase ``my bad,'' which quickly \nbecame the standard for those players owning up to their own errors on \nthe court. ``My bad.'' To own up to one's own mistakes is a true \nmeasure of one's character, and it is no surprise that Manute leaves \nthis legacy to the NBA.\n  Manute had a gentle nature and unmistakable humor. He was also a \nChristian, and his faith guided his advocacy for his fellow Sudanese \nbrothers and sisters.\n  Manute was the son of a Dinka tribal chief and was given the name \n``Manute,'' which means ``special blessing.'' He was, indeed, special, \nand what made him special was not his height but his heart. Manute \noften returned to Sudan to visit refugee camps, and he subsequently \ncreated the Ring True Foundation to assist those less fortunate than \nhimself.\n  Manute moved to Olathe, KS, in 2007 to be closer to his family and \ncontinue his advocacy for Sudan as a spokesman for a Kansas-based \nnonprofit, Sudan Sunrise, which raises money to build schools and \nchurches in Sudan. In 2006, Manute participated in the Sudan Freedom \nWork, a 3-week march from the U.N. building in New York to the U.S. \nCapitol in Washington, DC. He was admitted to the United States as a \nreligious refugee, and in his final years in Kansas, Manute was working \non a project to have Christians and Muslims work together to build a \nschool in his hometown of Turlie, Sudan.\n  The world needs more Manute Bols--individuals who dedicate their \nlives to others. Our thoughts and prayers go out to Manute's family, \nfriends, and the people of Sudan.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona is recognized.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to engage in a \ncolloquy with Dr. Barrasso.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5226-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5226-S5227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               HEALTHCARE\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, as I understand it, it is about 90 days \nsince the President signed the legislation known to some as ObamaCare \nand to others as the Medicare reform bill. But there have been some \ninteresting developments in the intervening 90 days.\n  To quote the Speaker of the House, she said at the time, ``We have to \npass the bill so that you can find out what's in it.'' We are finding \nout what is in it. Remarkable events have taken place, ranging from the \nimplementation that means that more than half--51 percent--of all \nemployees in 2013 will be in plans that aren't grandfathered, despite \nthe President's comment that if you like your insurance policy, you can \nkeep it. Nearly 7 in 10--69 percent employees, 80 percent of workers, \nand small businesses--would lose their current plan within 3 short \nyears.\n  Mr. President, I would like for my friend, Dr. Barrasso, to explain \nexactly how that happens. First, I would like to mention the issue du \njour which, of course, is headlined on Politico this morning: \n``Medicare Tussle Stymies Hill. Rift between Pelosi and Reid stands in \nthe way of funding compromise.''\n  I think it is important to recognize the reason we did not do the so-\ncalled doc fix is because the majority did not want to do the doc fix, \nwhich means not implementing the 21-percent cut in reimbursement for \ndoctors who treat Medicare patients. The reason we did not was because \nthey had cooked the books on the cost of ObamaCare.\n  The fact is, they kept counting into the cost--in order to keep their \ncommitment that it would cost less than $1 trillion--they kept counting \nin that there would be the 21-percent cut, a $281 billion difference \nover 10 years.\n  The AMA and all of those people who signed up with this bill are now \nsaying: Why are you not doing the doc fix? We did the doc fix on \nFriday, I believe. It is now in the House, and we will probably do the \ndoc fix. But why the delay? The delay is simply because they did not \nwant to. On the floor of this Senate, they did not want to do the doc \nfix because of the budgetary impact on how they were selling this \nproposal to the American people.\n  I ask my colleague, Dr. Barrasso, to comment on that point and also \nwhat we are finding out as to how many Americans are actually going to \nlose the insurance policy they have. By the way, there is also an \narticle this morning in USA TODAY entitled ``Doctors limit new Medicare \npatients,'' which was also predicted by some of us.\n  One thing my friends on the other side of the aisle might have \nforgotten is we cannot force doctors--they have not enacted a law yet \nthat forces doctors to see Medicare patients. Therefore, a number of \ndoctors are voting with their fee in the respect that they are not \nenrolling new Medicare patients they would treat.\n  I ask my colleague, Dr. Barrasso, if he would comment on the doc fix \nand also maybe a better explanation than I have been able to give as to \nwhy so many people face the loss of their health insurance policy \nbetween now and 2013.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, my colleague from Arizona is absolutely \nright. There is a front-page story in USA TODAY. I was reading it as I \nwas coming back from Wyoming yesterday. In Wyoming over the weekend, I \nvisited with a number of seniors on Medicare. I visited with some \nfamily physicians who take care of families in Wyoming. I practiced \nmedicine for 25 years in Wyoming taking care of families and have lived \nunder the Medicare rules and regulations.\n  Here it is: ``Doctors limit new Medicare patients. Surveys point to \npayment concerns.'' Doctors will tell you the biggest deadbeat when it \ncomes to paying for health care is the Federal Government. It is \nWashington. More and more of my colleagues are opting out, as the \nSenator from Arizona said, from taking care of Medicare patients \nbecause what they get reimbursed is so limited that it does not keep up \nwith the growing cost of liability insurance, the mandates on them in \nterms of the expenses of running a business, and they try to provide \nhealth care for all their employees.\n  Item after item, those costs go up. But what the government continues \nto pay for taking care of patients on Medicare, which is an expanding \ngroup of people, is shrinking.\n  Think about how Washington works and does not get it. Patients around \nthe country on Medicare understand they are having a hard time finding \na doctor. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services was quoted in \nyesterday's USA TODAY saying 97 percent of doctors accept Medicare. \nWhat is the reality? In North Carolina, since January 1, this article \nsays 117 doctors have opted out of Medicare. In New York, since the \nbeginning of the year, about 1,100 doctors have left Medicare. The \npresident of the State of New York Medical Society is not taking new \nMedicare patients.\n  Mr. McCAIN. As well as the Mayo Clinic.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mayo Clinic said: We cannot afford to keep our doors \nopen if we are taking Medicare patients. Specifically in Arizona, where \nthey have a wonderful clinic, the best care in the world in many ways \nin the sense that early on in the health care debate, President Obama \nsaid we should use the Mayo Clinic as a model of what works, they do \nnot want to take Medicare patients. They do not want to take Medicaid \npatients. But this health care law is cramming 16 million more \nAmericans on to Medicaid. What the President is proposing for the \nAmerican people is something less than what he has previously said is \nthe best in care.\n  One of the other promises the President made is, if you like the \nhealth care you have, you can keep it. As a matter of fact, he gave a \nspeech about a year ago at the American Medical Association meeting:\n\n       If you like your health care plan, you will be able to keep \n     your health care plan. Period.\n\n  He went on to say:\n\n       No one will take it away. Period. No matter what. Period.\n\n  Now the White House has come out with new rules and regulations about\n\n[[Page S5227]]\n\nwho really will be able to keep their health care plans. In the \nanalysis that has come out from the administration, over 100 pages--I \nhad it on the Senate floor last week--what they have shown is, over the \nnext few years more and more Americans who have health care right now \nthrough their jobs that they like, they understand, they know how to \nuse--and as a doctor I have worked with these patients. I know what it \nmeans to them to have a health care plan they are comfortable with, \nthat they understand, that they use, that all of the work has been done \nwith the doctor's office, hospital, and the patient, they understand \nthe whole thing. To have that change is very distressing for people. It \nis unsettling. But yet this government report out from the \nadministration says within the next couple of years, for people who \nhave their insurance through small business plans, almost four out of \nfive of them may lose the coverage they have.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask, is that because of a minor change in the \ninsurance policy they now have that then forces them out of the policy, \neven though there is a minor change? Maybe Dr. Barrasso can give us \nsome of those examples of how minor they are, how they basically force \nthem out of the policy they have into the ``exchanges.'' Is that what \nhappens?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. I agree with my colleague completely. What is happening \nis any sort of a change to a policy, whether they change the \ndeductible, change the copay or any of those things, then that policy \nis disallowed as something you can keep.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Some of those changes would simply be driven by pure \neconomics and the escalating cost of health care on which clearly this \nlegislation has no effect.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Let's say you change your job. Let's say you move from \none employment situation to another. You may change your insurance. \nMost people do because most people get their insurance through their \nwork. We will have a situation where over the next couple of years, a \npromise that the President made to the American people--another promise \nthat the President made to the American people will be broken.\n  We have not just seen it with regular insurance. My colleague from \nArizona is in a State with many people who are seniors, a number of \nthem on Medicare Advantage, a special program that speaks specifically \nto preventive care, coordinated care. People signed up for Medicare \nAdvantage because there are advantages to being on Medicare Advantage. \nYet this health care law that was crammed through this Senate is going \nto cut massively from Medicare Advantage.\n  One out of four people on Medicare is on Medicare Advantage, and they \nknow why they have signed up for it. It is because of the advantages to \nthem.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask one more question of my friend? This is kind of \na hometown issue, but 330,000 Arizona citizens who are enrolled in \nMedicare, who paid into Medicare all their working lives and have \nenrolled in this Medicare Advantage program which gives them choices \nare now going to have that severely impaired or eliminated. How does \nthat happen? How is it when a program is offered to people who have \npaid into the system all their lives and they have chosen that Medicare \nAdvantage program, and now it is going to be taken away from them. How \ndoes that work?\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. It works when a Senate and a House of Representatives \nand a President think they know more than the American people. They \nsay: We know what is best for you. We don't care what you think. That \nis what has happened.\n  Mr. McCAIN. They have pledged basically to dismantle the Medicare \nAdvantage program?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Cut the funding so people on Medicare Advantage--who \nlike it, who like the preventive medicine activities of it--are going \nto lose those opportunities.\n  Just since 2003, the number of seniors on Medicare Advantage grew \nfrom a little over 4 million to 11 million. That is because the seniors \ntalk to one another, and they know what the best deal is for them, for \ntheir money, and for their health.\n  The seniors I know in Wyoming who signed up for this program said \nthey want to make sure they have a number of these preventive services. \nOnce they lose this, they are going to lose preventive services. They \nwill have to pay more. The cost for people will go up, in spite of the \npromise made by the President that he was going to get down the cost of \ncare.\n  Experts who have looked at this said: No, I am sorry, it is not going \nto work that way.\n  Mr. McCAIN. May I ask the Senator one more question. Did he have a \nchance to examine the $14 million--I believe it was $14 million, $18 \nmillion----\n  Mr. BARRASSO. The mailer.\n  Mr. McCAIN. The mailer. I was trying to find a polite word--the \nmailer that was sent out to all Medicare enrollees and what conclusions \nhe drew from that infomercial?\n  Mr. BARRASSO. To my colleague from Arizona, I did. I had a chance to \nlook at that mailer sent out by the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices. I found it very misleading. Some have described it even as \nbeing a piece of propaganda.\n  The sad part is, it was paid for by the American taxpayers. The \nestimates for the cost have been $16 to $20 million of taxpayers' money \nto send out this piece of mail that essentially misleads, or tries to \nmislead--as my colleague from Arizona knows, the American people are \ntoo smart to be misled by this--it tries to mislead them into saying \nthat this whole health care law is actually going to strengthen \nMedicare.\n  The seniors of this country clearly understand, as I know they do in \nWyoming and Arizona, if you cut $500 billion--a $\\1/2\\ trillion--out of \nMedicare, not to save Medicare, not to save the program that is there \nfor our seniors but to start a whole new government program, that is \nnot going to improve Medicare. That is money seniors planned for, know \nit is in their system, and it is being taken from Medicare to start a \nwhole new government program. It is not for them. It is not going to \nimprove Medicare. It is not going to strengthen Medicare.\n  That is why from the beginning, to my colleague from Arizona, I said \nthis bill, now the law for 90 days, is bad for patients, bad for \npayers--the American taxpayers who are going to end up stuck with the \nbill--and bad for the providers--the nurses and doctors who are trying \nto take care of these people.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I thank Dr. Barrasso for his leadership on \nthis issue. Those who are interested in his Web site, which is titled \n``Second Opinion,'' might be interested in gaining more information \nfrom that Web site. My colleagues might be interested in that.\n  I thank Dr. Barrasso for his leadership on this issue, for his in \ndepth knowledge of it. I noted the luncheon we had with the President \nof the United States. I applaud Dr. Barrasso's attempts to inform the \nPresident on this issue. I am not sure how receptive the audience was \nto it, but what he had to say made a lot of sense to me.\n  I know Dr. Barrasso shares my view that we are not going to quit on \nthis issue. We are not going to quit on this issue. It is going to be \nrepealed and replaced because we are not going to do this to the \nAmerican people.\n  Still the overwhelming majority of the American people disapprove of \nthis proposal. As the Speaker of the House said, we have to pass the \nbill so we can find out what is in it. As they are finding out what is \nin it, more and more Americans dislike it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that I be allowed \nto engage in a colloquy with my colleague from Arizona.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, there has been a lot of conversation about \nthe issue of illegal immigration and the results of different meetings. \nI\n\n[[Page S5228]]\n\nknow my colleague from Arizona wishes to discuss that aspect of the \nissue, but I take to the floor with my friend and leader from Arizona \nto discuss the overall issue of immigration in light of a meeting and a \ntrip he and I had to the border on Saturday, where we visited with \nranchers, with citizens, with Border Patrol, and where we had a \nthorough trip throughout the area. So we come to the floor to share our \nconclusions and concerns with our colleagues.\n  Let me begin by saying that unfortunately--or fortunately--the head \nof the Customs and Border Protection recently said that parts of \nArizona were like a ``third country.'' You know, in some respects--in \nsome respects--he may have been correct. Let me quote him. This is \nDavid Aguilar, the Acting Deputy Commissioner of U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection. He was quoted in the Arizona Republic as saying:\n\n     the border is not a fence or a line in the dirt but a broadly \n     complex corridor. It is . . . a third country that joins \n     Mexico and the United States.\n\n  A third country that joins Mexico and the United States is obviously \nnot as secure as the United States of America. If my colleagues will \nlook at this map here and see this area here, this is the sign that is \nposted as far away as 50 miles from the Arizona-Mexico border.\n\n       Danger. Public Warning. Travel Not Recommended. Active Drug \n     and Human Smuggling Area. Visitors May Encounter Armed \n     Criminals and Smuggling Vehicles Traveling at High Rates of \n     Speed. Stay Away From Trash, Clothing, Backpacks and \n     Abandoned Vehicles. If You See Suspicious Activity, Do Not \n     Confront. Move Away and Call 911. BLM Encourages Visitors to \n     Use Public Lands North of Interstate 8.\n\n  North of Interstate 8 is the area north of this shaded area. In other \nwords, visitors are encouraged not to go south of the interstate, which \nis a huge part of the State of Arizona. That is the posted sign put up \nby the Federal Government.\n  Then the Secretary of Homeland Security says, ``The border is secure \nas ever.'' If the border is as secure as ever, then you have to draw \nthe conclusion that it isn't secure, because otherwise you wouldn't \nhave to be posting signs such as this 50 miles north of the border, if \nthe border was secure. Our whole point is that we need to get the \nborder secure. We don't see the necessity in the United States of \nAmerica placing a sign such as that.\n  If we are doing fine on border security, why would it be necessary to \nput up a sign such as that all the way up to the interstate?\n  Here is another sign from our Park Service in the Coronado National \nForest. This is in our national forest, from the Park Service.\n\n       Smuggling and/or Illegal Entry Is Common in This Area Due \n     to the Proximity of the International Border.\n\n  If we had a secure border, why would we have to put up signs such as \nthat? If we had made such great progress at that time the Secretary of \nHomeland Security was trumpeting this, why in the world would we have \nto put up signs such as that? That is the question.\n  I will let my colleague discuss the results of our visit, but I can \ntell you that the citizens residing in the southern part of our State \ndo not feel secure. When you have 241,000 illegal immigrants \napprehended last year, that means that, depending on who you talk to, \nit is nearly a million people apprehended in just that part of the \nborder. When you have 1.2 million pounds of marijuana intercepted in \nthe Tucson sector, it is not a secure border. When you have the \nviolence--the incredible violence--that continues to rise on the other \nside of the border, you know it is just a matter of time before it \nspills onto our side of the border.\n  Unfortunately, just south of the Arizona-Sonora border resides the \nmost vicious of all the drug cartels--the Sinaloa cartel--headed by \nJuan ``El Chapo'' Guzman, who walked out of a Mexican prison a few \nyears ago and, unfortunately, this cartel has corrupted officials at \nvery high levels.\n  I report to my colleagues that the people living in the southern part \nof the State of Arizona do not feel secure. They see signs such as this \none, which I mentioned; and they see the destruction of our wildlife \npreserves; they see the in-home invasions. And, yes, our Border Patrol \nand the men and women who are serving in it are doing a magnificent \njob. We are proud of the job they are doing. But they do not have the \nassets in order to complete the job of securing our border.\n  Senator Kyl and I have a 10-point plan that, if implemented, will do \nthe job.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, the stories we heard were human tragedies, \nand statistics don't tell the story adequately. Let me cite a few of \nthe statistics and then ask my colleague to recount some of the \nheartrending stories that we heard from families in the area. When we \ntalk about that, he can point to the extreme southeast corner of the \nState of Arizona, where we were, primarily, on Saturday, and where most \nof these folks live on ranches--places that used to be very safe. \nToday, these folks do not feel they can sleep at night or move around \nwithout carrying weapons. They need to travel in pairs. This is the \narea in which an extraordinarily difficult tragedy occurred when a \nlong-time resident of the area was slain, it is believed by one of the \ndrug cartels or other smugglers who frequent the area.\n  The human tragedy is the real heart of this, but let me cite some \nstatistics, because when the Secretary of Homeland Security says we are \nsecure as we have ever been, I think these statistics would at least \nbelie part of that claim.\n  About 50 percent of all illegal immigrants enter through Arizona. In \nfact, they enter through essentially the eastern one-third of that \nparticular map. The number of illegal immigrants living in Arizona \nincreased over the last decade about twice, up to over 600,000 people. \nIt is estimated that about 12 percent of Arizona's workers are illegal \nimmigrants. According to the Maricopa County Attorney's office, about \n12 percent of the county's population and about 22 percent of felony \ncrimes committed are committed by illegal immigrants.\n  My colleague has talked frequently about the fact that Phoenix, AZ, \nour hometown, is the second largest kidnapping capital of the world, \nand the largest in the United States--second in the world only to \nMexico City.\n  We can go on and on about the statistics. We have the highest rate of \nproperty crime among the 50 States in the last year for which the FBI \nreported the statistics in 2008. Our sheriffs and other law enforcement \ntell us that between 15 and 20 percent of the individuals apprehended \nat the border have criminal records or are wanted for crimes in the \nUnited States.\n  Phoenix is a primary originating city, where drugs are brought from \nthe border and held in Phoenix and then transported to other cities. We \nlead the Nation in marijuana seizures--50 percent. Heroin is \nincreasingly found in Arizona, and on and on and on.\n  The statistics don't lie, of course. But the real tragedy is the \nhuman tragedy--the fear that people have; people who are fourth or \nfifth generation ranch families in the area; people in town, who are \nincreasingly the subject of break-ins and property crimes and the like.\n  But none of this even begins to talk about what happens when the \npeople who are smuggled into the country, are held in drop houses--\ngenerally in the Phoenix area--for transport either west to Los Angeles \nor anywhere east in the country. They are essentially victimized by the \nvery people who smuggle them in and who demand ransom from their \nfamilies in Mexico, El Salvador, or Guatemala, or wherever they might \nhave come from. And until they pay that ransom, they are brutalized and \nassaulted and become victims of crime themselves. And, of course, they \nrarely report that crime.\n\n  So the human tragedy here is the real story. But it is important for \nus to at least cite the statistics and show our colleagues the signs \nthat the U.S. Government itself feels constrained to post in order to \nwarn people to stay out of an area which encompasses probably about 20 \npercent of the State of Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. And may I also make the comment that my colleague from \nArizona points to about the terrible and unspeakable treatment that is \ninflicted upon these individuals who are brought in by human smugglers. \nAlmost all are brought up by human smugglers. Where are the human \nrights advocates and activists? Shouldn't they be standing up and \nsaying: You have to have a secure border so that these unspeakable \nindignities--the\n\n[[Page S5229]]\n\nrape and ransom and all these things--will be stopped?\n  Secondly, I want to point out very quickly to my colleagues that in \nrecent years, 80 percent of the wildfires in our Coronado National \nForest have been human caused--75 percent of those are attributed to \nundocumented aliens who fail to properly extinguish fires started to \nsignal for rides, cook food, or dry clothing. The Coronado National \nForest now has to send armed officers to clear wildland fire areas and \nto provide security for firefighters. The Forest Service has reported \naccounts of armed smugglers walking through the middle of active \nfirefighting operations. And now, in its fourth week today, as we \nspeak, the human-caused Horseshoe fire is burning in the Chiricahua \nMountains in the Coronado National Forest, 5 miles from the town of \nPortal, AZ. It is the site of very heavy drug trafficking and border-\ncrossing activity.\n  With the few minutes we have remaining, I want to engage Senator Kyl \nin a conversation about what we need to do and why we need to secure \nthe border first. There has been a lot of publicity in the last 24 \nhours about a conversation that Senator Kyl had with the President of \nthe United States. I was not there, but I was there a few weeks ago \nwhen the President of the United States came and had lunch with \nRepublican Senators and gave a list of the issues that he was concerned \nabout, with immigration being one of the items he mentioned. So Senator \nKyl and I responded to the President of the United States.\n  It was made very clear to me in the conversation we had--and I am \nsure our 39 other colleagues who were there will recall--that the \nPresident basically conditioned his support for border security to \noverall comprehensive immigration reform. We went back and forth. I \ntried to explain to the President that we gave amnesty back in the \n1980s. Somewhere around 3 million illegal immigrants were given \namnesty, but the promise was that we would secure the border. \nObviously, we didn't secure the border and we now have 12 million \npeople in the country. As Senator Kyl mentioned, there are some \nhundreds of thousands in the State of Arizona illegally.\n  So our point is that even if we went through comprehensive \nimmigration reform, if we don't have a secure border, then some time \nfrom now we will have another group of illegal immigrants we will have \nto address, and so the issue argues for getting the border secured \nfirst. It can be done in 1 or 2 years. It isn't that expensive, when \nyou look at the costs of a wildfire and all of the things, drugs and \neverything else associated with it, not to mention a violation of human \nrights.\n\n  There is a big stir about the conversation the President and Senator \nKyl had. It was clear to me in the conversation, in front of 39 \nRepublican Senators, that the President of the United States said yes, \nhe would secure the border, but we had to have ``comprehensive \nimmigration reform.'' This is the difference between our position and \nthat of the President. We say secure the border, have the Governors of \nthe border States certify it is secure, and then we can certainly move \non. But the American people have to have the assurance that we are not \ngoing to revisit this issue time after time. Every nation has the \nobligation to secure its borders.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, when Senator McCain and I asked the acting \nhead of the Border Patrol in the area where we were on Saturday, what \ndo you need, he basically said, ``More of everything.'' He talked about \nthe need for 800 more Border Patrol agents. He talked about the need \nfor more surveillance--something Senator McCain has talked about a lot, \nsurveillance to cover a very big area where you are probably never \ngoing to have enough personnel even if we bring in National Guard \ntroops. He welcomed the National Guard troops to the area. He said we \nare going to have to have consequences for people crossing. I talked to \nhim about Operation Streamline. In the Yuma sector of the border, which \nis on the western part of the Arizona border, the Yuma sector is very \nclose to being operationally clear of illegal immigration issues \nbecause they have enough agents, they have enough fencing. By the way, \nhe talked about the need to repair and replace a lot of the fencing in \nhis sector. But they also have a policy that, instead of catch and \nrelease, where the people are simply put on a bus and sent back to \nMexico, they actually are prosecuted and have to spend at least 2 weeks \nin jail.\n  That is a huge deterrent. Because if you are a criminal, obviously \nyou don't want to be caught and go to jail, and if you are here to work \nand send money back to your family, you are obviously not doing that if \nyou spend time in jail. He said there have to be consequences. We \nbelieve the expenditure of somewhere between $1 billion and $3 billion \nover the next couple of years could provide adequate resources--this is \nour 10-point plan--adequate personnel, the fencing that is required, \nthe surveillance, the technology, and also the extra prosecutors, \ncourtroom, and detention spaces that would be necessary to provide the \ndeterrent or the consequences, as he put it. There is no doubt the \nborder can be secured. What we need is the will to do it.\n  Mr. McCAIN. What Senator Kyl and I are trying to report to our \ncolleagues is, No. 1, the border is not secure. The border is not \nsecure. No. 2, it can be secure. How could someone claim our border is \nmore secure than ever if the Federal Government has to put up that kind \nof warning to American citizens on American soil? If nothing would \nconvince my colleagues that we need to do a lot more, it is the actions \nof the Federal Government. That is not a private landowner who put up \nthat sign. That is the Bureau of Land Management. So have the \nDepartment of Interior and other agencies.\n  The point is, we are trying to tell our colleagues it is not secure. \nWe can secure it. Our citizens deserve that.\n  But the second point we want to make as forcefully as possible is: \nLet's get this border secure, which we can do, and then we can move \nforward with comprehensive immigration reform and work together with \nour colleagues on the other side of the aisle. But for us to go back to \nour constituents and to the American people, and say: Hey, we moved \nforward with this legislation, yet we still are having to put up signs \nsuch as this, that people should avoid being in an active drug and \nhuman smuggling area, in the United States of America, is not a \nconvincing argument that they are ``as secure'' as ever.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, might I inquire how much time remains on our \nside?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There remains 6 minutes 18 seconds.\n  Mr. KYL. That is the time remaining on our side.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, what I wish to do is take about 3 more \nminutes and then my colleague can close.\n  As he said, if you need a different kind of reason to want to secure \nthe border, then look at what is happening to our environment. I know \nthe Presiding Officer--and his father before him--is keen on protecting \nthe great national treasures of our country, our environment. Coming \nfrom adjoining States, we share a lot of the same kind of country. The \narea in the extreme southwestern part of his State and the extreme \nsoutheastern part of our State is known for some of the best birding in \nthe world. The part of northern Mexico that borders our States provides \na sanctuary for birds that are not found anywhere else in the world. \nThis fire my colleague mentioned is burning right up to the creek which \nis one of the watersheds that represents the prime area for these birds \nto exist. Their habitat will be destroyed if we continue to have fires \nset by illegal immigrants in the area that destroy the habitat.\n  If you look at the environment of the area from the air, you see that \nthere are thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of paths that are \nworn in parts of the desert that are basically off limits to American \ncitizens and even to our law enforcement officials, but the smugglers \nuse these trails and they deposit their trash. Everybody knows that \nonce you have cut the desert, it takes hundreds--hundreds--of years for \nthat desert to respond. That is just one reason.\n  Obviously the human tragedy is the one that is of most concern. If my \ncolleagues would hear this one plaintive cry, we were told on numerous \noccasions on Saturday: Please, go back to Washington and tell your \ncolleagues what it is like. Tell them how we are\n\n[[Page S5230]]\n\nsuffering. Tell them what we have to go through just to live here. \nCan't our Government at least provide basic protection from crime? \nThese are members of the family of Robert Krantz, who was brutally \ngunned down, and fellow ranchers in the area and other citizens who \nlive in the small communities there. They believe their government has \nabandoned them. They look right into our eyes and say: What are you \ngoing to do about it?\n  The best we can do is to tell you the fear they have, the suffering \nthey have gone through, the difficulty they have continuing to live in \nan area, as I said, in which some of their families have lived for four \nand five generations, to pass that message on to my colleagues and say: \nOK, if it is the environment you care about, there is a reason to be \nthere; if it is crime, there is a huge reason to be there; if it is the \ncost to the Federal and State government, we need to get hold of this \nproblem. But if you just care about the people who are there, we have \nan obligation as their representatives to assure their protection, and \nthat is the message we are coming to the floor today to convey to our \ncolleagues. Please listen, if not to us, to our constituents, and \nremember we all work for all of the people of the United States of \nAmerica. We are all Senators. So every one of us here has an obligation \nto the folks--yes, in your State but also to the folks in our State--to \nat least provide them the basic protection and give them a sense that \nthey do not live in a Third World country between the United States and \nMexico; that they are American citizens deserving of the protection of \nthe U.S. Government.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, there is no way I can elaborate on that \nvery strong statement, so I yield the remainder of our time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5230-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5230]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HOMELESS WOMEN VETERANS AND HOMELESS VETERANS WITH CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise today in support of S. 1237, the \nHomeless Veterans and Other Veterans Health Care Authorities Act of \n2010.\n  I just had the opportunity to meet with an amazing woman named \nNatalie and her two children who are actually here in Washington right \nnow.\n  Natalie is currently living in Issaquah in my home State of \nWashington--but she has been through some tough times over the past few \nyears.\n  She is a Navy veteran and a single mom. But she became homeless in \n2007 when she couldn't find work and had to move out of the house she \nwas staying in.\n  Like most moms, Natalie wanted nothing more than to provide her two \nchildren with the stable and loving home every family deserves--so she \nfought to secure transitional housing, and she was very fortunate to \nfind a program called Hopelink in Washington State that gave her the \nsupport she needed to get back on her feet.\n  Natalie is now back in stable housing, taking care of her children, \nand advancing in her nursing career--and she is here in Washington, DC, \ntoday to help make sure no other family has to face the challenges she \novercame so bravely.\n  Unfortunately, not every family gets the support that Natalie's did.\n  Homeless women veterans and homeless veterans with children are two \nterribly vulnerable groups that are growing by the day.\n  Back in my home State of Washington, veterans service organizations \nand homeless providers have told me they are seeing more homeless \nveterans coming for help than ever before.\n  And, unfortunately, more and more of these veterans are women, have \nyoung children, or both.\n  In fact, female veterans are between two and four times as likely to \nbe homeless than their civilian counterpart and they have unique needs \nand often require specialized services.\n  That is why I introduced the Homeless Women Veterans and Homeless \nVeterans with Children Act with Senator Jack Reed and Senator Tim \nJohnson.\n  This legislation would take three big steps forward toward tackling \nthe serious problems facing this vulnerable group.\n  First of all, it would make more front-line homeless service \nproviders eligible to receive special needs grants.\n  This would help organizations in Washington State and across the \ncountry help support families like Natalie's.\n  It would also expand special needs grants to cover homeless male \nveterans with children, as well as the dependents of homeless veterans \nthemselves.\n  And it would extend the Department of Labor's Homeless Veterans \nReintegration Program to provide workforce training, job counseling, \nchild care services and placement services to homeless women veterans \nand homeless veterans with children.\n  It is so important that we not just provide immediate support--but \nthat we also make sure our veterans have the resources and support they \nneed to get back on their feet.\n  In addition to helping homeless veterans, S. 1237 also includes a \nnumber of other provisions aimed at supporting our nation's heroes.\n  It extends eligibility to health care for certain veterans with \ndisabilities who served in the Persian Gulf war.\n  It would establish a medical center report card to allow veterans and \ntheir families access to transparent performance comparisons between VA \nfacilities and between VA and non-VA sites.\n  And it would direct the VA to enable State veterans' homes to admit \nparents who had a child die while serving in the Armed Forces.\n  This is a very personal issue for me.\n  Growing up, I saw firsthand the many ways military service can affect \nboth veterans and their families.\n  My dad served in World War II and was among the first soldiers to \nland on Okinawa. He came home as a disabled veteran and was awarded the \nPurple Heart.\n  Like many soldiers of his generation, my father didn't talk about his \nexperiences during the war. In fact, we only really learned about them \nby reading his journals after he passed away.\n  And I think that experience offers a larger lesson about veterans in \ngeneral. They are reluctant to call attention to their service, and \nthey are reluctant to ask for help.\n  That is why we have to publicly recognize their sacrifices and \ncontributions.\n  It is up to us to make sure that they get the recognition they have \nearned.\n  And it is up to us to guarantee that they get the services and \nsupport they deserve.\n  This bill passed through the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee with \nstrong bipartisan support, and that is how it should be, because \nsupporting our veterans shouldn't be about politics--it should be about \nwhat kind of country we want the United States to be and about what our \npriorities are as a nation.\n  In his second inaugural address in 1865, President Lincoln said our \nNation had an obligation to ``care for him who shall have borne the \nbattle and for his widow, and his orphan.''\n  Now, in 2010, I believe we not only need to care for him--we need to \ncare for her and for his and her families and for every man and woman \ncoming home after serving our country so bravely.\n  That is why I am proud to stand here today for Natalie, her children, \nand families just like hers across the country--to urge my colleagues \nto support S. 1237, the Homeless Veterans and Other Veterans Health \nCare Authorities Act of 2010.\n  I hope we can pass this expeditiously off the floor and get these \nservices out to the men and women who have served us all so well.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent to speak as in morning \nbusiness.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

What morning business this is. For those of us in the \nNational Capital region, this is indeed a very solemn day. One year ago \ntoday, nine people died on Washington's\n\n[[Page S5231]]\n\nMetro. We were shocked and horrified when a red line Metro train struck \nanother train. Eight passengers were killed, including one Marylander \nfrom Hyattsville. A train operator also died, and over 50 passengers \nwere injured.\n  Those men and women died not as a result of a terrorist attack or of \nsabotage, these deaths happened because of Metro. It was a failure of \nmanagement, it was a failure of technology, and it was a failure of the \nculture of safety at Metro.\n  Today our hearts go out to those families, those who lost loved ones \nand those who bear the permanent injuries of that fateful day. Since \nthat day there have been 4 more deaths at Metro. This brings the total \nto 13 deaths in the last year. Let me repeat that--13 people died by \nMetro in the last 12 months.\n  After that June 22 crash 1 year ago, four Metro employees died on the \njob. One last August was a track repairman from Silver Spring who was \nhit by maintenance equipment. In September, another employee died. A \ncommunications technician was hit by a train. In January, two more \nMetro employees died. They were automatic train control technicians \nwhen they, too, were struck by a maintenance truck.\n  Well, in December, I said enough is enough. We always say a grateful \nnation will never forget after a terrible accident and we go to a \nmemorial service. Well, for me what happened at Metro was not a \nmemorial service, it was a call to service and for action by us. The \nbest way we can honor the memory of those who died and those who were \ninjured is to reform Metro.\n  I have called for that reform. In December during my testimony on \nrail safety legislation I introduced, I spoke out and said it was time \nfor change at Metro. They needed new leadership. They needed a fresh \napproach. They needed to adopt a culture of safety that was unrelenting \nin terms of their focus on the details to protect the people who work \non the Metro and the people who ride the Metro.\n  I was shocked to learn there are no Federal safety standards for any \nMetro. So whether we are talking about the National Capital region \nMetro or New York's subway system or California's subway system, there \nare no Federal safety standards.\n  That is why I worked with NTSB and the Federal Transit Administration \nto develop legislation that would do two things: give our own U.S. \nDepartment of Transportation the authority to establish and enforce \nFederal safety standards so we would have uniformity, conformity, and \nmetrics for measuring safety on the Metro that we help fund. It also \nwould require the U.S. Department of Transportation to implement the \nNational Transportation Safety Board's recommendation list which \nincludes requiring that railcars have crashworthy standards, emergency \nentry and evacuation standards, and regulations for train operator \nshifts.\n  We have safety standards for commercial airplanes. We have safety \nstandards for buses that carry passengers. But we do not have safety \nstandards for railcars that are used in subways. I think that is wrong.\n  What we also found was that safety inspectors that are part of a \nunique governing system were denied access to the Metro tracks. That is \nwhen we said we needed to find out what was going on. I called for a \nFederal audit of Metro, a Federal investigation of just what was going \non there.\n  Thanks to Secretary LaHood and FTA leader Peter Rogoff, well known to \nthose of us in the Senate, they did an outstanding audit which was \nindeed an outstanding service for us all. Their findings were shocking, \nhair-raising, and chilling. What did we find out?\n  Supervisors and train operators did not exactly know where Metro \nworkers might be doing maintenance on the tracks until they actually \nsaw them. Can you imagine? People driving the train had to see with \ntheir own eyes their workers to make sure they did not hit them.\n  There was no technological warning system. Operators weren't given \nthe exact location of workers on the tracks. Information was \ngeneralized and workers were often in different locations than what \noperators were told. So the Metro itself was a lethal tool. Metro did \nnot have the manpower to implement its own safety programs. It did not \nhave a list of the top ten safety hazards and concerns. The list goes \non and on about the audit.\n  I held a very vigorous oversight hearing, both Senator Cardin and \nmyself. We pushed Metro to come up with a checklist for change. We \ninsisted that they come up with this checklist. I demanded that they \ngive it to us right then and there.\n  They told me they were going to be working on it, and I said: Look, \ntell me what you are going to do. Well, listen to how ground shaking it \nwas: Replace the oldest railcars on the fleet, develop a realtime \nautomatic train control redundancy system, strengthen the expertise of \nthe safety department, complete the roadway worker protection program, \ndevelop a training and certification program for bus and rail \npersonnel, strengthen employee knowledge of rules and rules compliance, \ndevelop an accident and investigation database, create a strong \ninternal training tracking database, fill vacancies in the safety \ndepartment, and improve the agency's safety culture.\n  Imagine, it took a Senator holding a public hearing to get a must-do \nlist on the safety list for change. This is unacceptable. We have to \nmake sure we have Federal legislation. We need to do two things: We \nneed to have Federal legislation, and we need to have Federal funding.\n  I want to make sure we save lives on the Metro. This is why I \nintroduced safety reform legislation. I understand the Banking \nCommittee is considering it. Well, the Banking Committee needs to pass \nit, and the Banking Committee needs to pass it before the July 4 work \nbreak.\n  I know the Banking Committee has a lot on their plate. I know they \nare trying to regulate Wall Street. Good for them. Three cheers for \nthem. We want that. But while we are making sure people do not lose \ntheir money on Wall Street, we have to make sure they do not lose their \nlives on Metro. So I ask our friends on the Banking Committee, could we \nkind of get this done this week, next week, before the July 4 break?\n  The bill does three things: It gives the Secretary of Transportation \nthe authority to establish and enforce safety standards, including \nthose standards for railcars and making sure there is an employee \nsafety certification training program; it also requires oversight of \nthe agencies monitoring safety to be independent; it funds federally \napproved State oversight agencies to make sure they have the rules of \nthe road and the resources to do it because we regulate so much of this \nat the State level.\n  I am pretty worked up about this. I hope we move the bill. I hope we \nmove it before the break.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I come to the floor, as I did yesterday \nand last week, to talk about the economic and environmental disaster in \nthe Gulf of Mexico and the lack of response by this government in \ndealing with the disaster. Everything that can be done should be done \nto stop this oil from coming on our beaches, from going into our \ncoastal waterways, and from damaging our way of life on the gulf coast.\n  I specifically come to talk about what is happening to Florida. For \nthe last week, I have been making statements and questioning why there \nare not more skimmers off the coast of Florida. I have been asking for \nmore skimmers to be sent to the Gulf of Mexico for many weeks.\n  A week ago today, I met with the President, ADM Thad Allen, and other \nState and local officials in Pensacola to address many issues \nconcerning the response to the oilspill. At that time, we were told \nthere were 32 skimmers off the coast of Florida. Today, we are told \nthere are 20. It makes no sense\n\n[[Page S5232]]\n\nthat there are not more skimmers. Admiral Allen has told us there are \n2,000 skimmers in the United States. We have heard reports of offers of \nforeign assistance of skimmers that are still under consideration or \nhave been declined. Why are there not more skimmers in the Gulf of \nMexico skimming up the oil before it comes onshore? We can't even get a \nstraight number as to how many skimmers are off the coast of Florida.\n  I have two documents, which I ask unanimous consent to have printed \nin the Record. One is the Deepwater Horizon response of Monday, June \n21, from the State of Florida. The second is the National Incident \nCommand response for June 21 from the Coast Guard.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5233]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS22JN10.001\n\n\n\n[[Page S5234]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS22JN10.002\n\n\n\n[[Page S5235]]\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. The first of these, the Deepwater Horizon response from \nMonday, June 21, says there are 20 skimmers off the coast of Florida. \nThe second, from the National Incident Command, says there are 108 off \nthe coast of Florida. Last week, we had this same discrepancy between \nthese two reports. We questioned the Coast Guard. The Coast Guard told \nus the information contained in the national incident report was not, \nin fact, correct. We can't get a straight answer as to how many \nskimmers are currently off the coast of Florida, but it appears from \nthe most reliable information--and I am still waiting for a straight \nanswer--that there are only 20. One percent of the skimmers of the \nUnited States are off the coast of Florida, with the worst economic and \nenvironmental catastrophe looming off our shores. Huge swathes of water \nare washing up tar balls all the way from Pensacola Beach, now to \nPanama City, FL.\n  We received a briefing this morning from the Navy and the Coast \nGuard. I thank Secretary Mabus of the Navy, who provided RADM John \nHaley as well as a captain from the Coast Guard and other folks from \nthe Navy to brief me on the status of what skimmers the Navy has and \nwhat they are doing in the gulf. We found out there are 23 naval \nskimmers, relatively small skimmers that can fit on the back of a truck \nor be put on a train or in an airplane. That is how they were \ntransported to the gulf. They are welcome. We are happy they are there. \nThere are 6 on the way and 29 skimmers total.\n  There are another 35 skimmers they would like to bring down, but they \nare under a category called legally constrained. What does that mean? \nThat means that for some reason, the law is prohibiting the Navy and \nthe Coast Guard from getting these skimmers here. Why hasn't this been \nwaived? Why hasn't the President signed an Executive order? Where is \nthe sense of urgency 62 days into this to get these skimmers to the \ngulf coast? We are going to look into what Federal law may be \nprohibiting and legally constraining the Navy and the Coast Guard from \ngetting the skimmers. I will offer legislation, if need be, to waive \nthat. I have already offered legislation to waive the Jones Act, which \nhas been cited as a prohibition or perhaps an obstacle to bringing in \nskimmers from foreign countries.\n  Let's talk about that issue. We know there are 2,000 skimmers in the \nUnited States. Yet only 20 are off the coast of Florida, if that is the \ncorrect information. We know the Navy wants to bring an additional 35 \nskimmers, but they are legally constrained and we have not yet undone \nthat or secured those skimmers, some 62 days after the oil started \nflowing.\n  Let's talk about foreign offers of assistance. There was a State \nDepartment report last week: 17 countries have made 21 offers of \nassistance. The Associated Press reported that they had not been \nresponded to or had been declined. We have more current information \nthan that. The State Department reports about 56 offers of assistance \nfrom 28 countries and international groups. Of the 56 offers of \nassistance, 5 have been accepted. That includes booms--people could use \nthe Internet to send a message about navigation in the gulf--and \nskimmers or skimmer equipment. BP has accepted three offers of \nassistance, including booms and skimmers. Two offers are categorized as \n``unknown'' or ``declined.'' Forty-six offers are currently under \nconsideration, 62 days into this incident. Where is the urgency? Where \nis the alacrity of the response to get this done and get these skimmers \nin the gulf?\n  I have a document, ``U.S. Department of State Chart on Deepwater \nHorizon Oil Spill Response: International Offers of Assistance from \nGovernments and International Bodies,'' dated June 18, 2010. I ask \nunanimous consent that it be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5236]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS22JN10.003\n\n\n\n[[Page S5237]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS22JN10.004\n\n\n\n[[Page S5238]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS22JN10.005\n\n\n\n[[Page S5239]]\n\n[GRAPHIC] [TIFF OMITTED] TS22JN10.006\n\n\n\n[[Page S5240]]\n\n  Mr. LeMIEUX. This document goes through the various offers of \nassistance and what is the current status of the response. So if we go \nto the European Maritime Safety Agency, skimmers, under consideration. \nMay 13 is the date of the offer. As of last Friday, no response. \nRepublic of Korea, skimmers, under consideration. May 2, the offer is \nmade. As of last Friday, no response. Sweden, April 30, skimmers; more \nskimmers offered on June 15. Under consideration. No response. United \nArab Emirates, skimmers, under consideration, offer made May 10. No \nresponse. Why are we not welcoming all of these offers of assistance to \nbring these skimmers and put them in the Gulf of Mexico to suck up the \noil?\n  I wish to show an example of an offer of assistance made to the \nUnited States. The ship here is from a Dutch company called Dockwise. \nThe name of this vessel is the Swan. Unlike some of the skimmers being \nused and deployed by the Navy, which can be put on a train car or flown \non an airplane to the location--and although very welcome are \nrelatively small--this is a massive ship that could take in 20,000 tons \nof oil or an oil-water mixture off of the water. They rig the ship with \nskimming equipment that hangs off the sides.\n  So on May 7, Dockwise offered the Swan to the United States. The \noffer went under consideration. After 48 days, the offer for this \nmassive ship with 20,000 tons of skimming capacity is still under \nconsideration. But the ship is not available anymore because Dockwise \nnow has employed the ship for other purposes because the U.S. \nGovernment, from all the information we have, never got back to them. \nHere is a Dutch company offering us a massive ship to skim 20,000 tons \nof oil and water off the top of the Gulf of Mexico, and the U.S. \nGovernment doesn't return the phone call. They never hear whether we \nwant the ship. People involved with the situation believe the Swan was \nrejected due to Jones Act considerations and that a similar vessel, the \nSEAcorp vessel named the Washington, was chosen instead. The Washington \nis an American flag vessel. Its capacity is 1,000 tons, one-twentieth \nthe capacity of the Swan. I am for America first, but why aren't we \nusing both of them? There is plenty of oil to skim up. Use the American \nvessel, but don't fail to respond to the Dutch company that has this \nmassive ship that has a 20,000-ton skimming capacity. Why would we not \nemploy both?\n  I could not be more frustrated with the lack of response. I could not \nbe more frustrated with the lack of a sense of urgency from this \nadministration in getting this job done.\n  The people of the State of Florida are scared to death about the \noilspill. When I was in Pensacola last week, I met a woman who works at \nthe pier on Pensacola Beach. I asked her how things were going. She \nserves food at the pier.\n  She said: It has been very harrowing for us.\n  I asked her: Are people coming out?\n  She said: People from north Florida are coming to the beach. These \nare people who haven't been to the beach in a long time.\n  I said: Why are they coming?\n  She said: They are coming to see the beach one last time, as if they \nwere going to visit a friend who was on his or her deathbed. They don't \nbelieve the beach will ever look the way they remember it looking.\n  Why we are not deploying every available national asset, military \nasset, and accepting every offer of assistance from foreign countries \nis beyond belief, and it is not acceptable. I will continue to meet \nwith the Coast Guard and the Navy. When I see the President tomorrow at \nthe White House, I will raise this issue with him. I will do everything \nI can to keep clamoring for this. It is not acceptable that in this, \nthe greatest country in the world, our response would be this anemic.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5240-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5240]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, the Reid-Baucus tax extenders bill before \nthe Senate includes several provisions that, to my knowledge, have \nnever been vetted by congressional tax writers either in the Senate \nFinance Committee or in the House Ways and Means Committee. As an \naccountant with practical expertise in tax matters, this disturbs me \ngreatly. It should also disturb the small business owners because there \nis a provision in this bill that would slap them in the face with a 15-\npercent tax increase. I am talking about the provision that would apply \na 15.3-percent self-employment tax to the distributions of certain \nsubchapter S corporations. Those are the small business corporations. \nThis self-employment tax would apply when 80 percent of the gross \nincome of the small business is attributable to three or fewer \nprofessionals in a professional services corporation. We are talking \nabout the smallest of the small businesses.\n  This is a $9.1 billion hit on a small subset of small businesses \nengaged in a service trade. I wonder, the next time an offset is \nneeded, will the Senate go after all the small businesses, changing the \nTax Code this same way?\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle call this a ``loophole \ncloser'' or an ``anti-fraud provision.'' I assure my colleagues this is \nneither. These words are convenient labels my colleagues use to defend \ntax-and-spend policies. The small business corporation provision is, \nhowever, a massive tax increase on small business.\n  This new payroll tax on nonwage income would hurt the ability of \nsmall businesses to reinvest and to create jobs. At nearly 10 percent \nunemployment, I don't think the Federal Government is in any position \nto pursue job-killing tax increases. Small businesses are the lifeblood \nof our economy. It is imperative that we nurture their growth, not \nhinder it, so they can create jobs and get our economy back on track.\n  None of us is in favor of fraud, but that is not really what we are \ntalking about.\n  If the IRS wants to improve compliance with the self-employment tax, \nthey have the right tools. They just need to use them. For example, the \nIRS Revenue Ruling 74-44 that specifically addresses the tax treatment \nof dividends in lieu of compensation gives them all they need.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the IRS revenue ruling printed in the \nRecord following my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. ENZI. I also have pages and pages of case law of which the IRS \nhas successfully litigated the issue of dividends in lieu of \ncompensation and the applicability of employment taxes.\n  Plus, Congress has codified the economic substance doctrine which \nsays a transaction must have an economic purpose aside from the \nreduction of tax liability in order to be considered valid. In my \nopinion, this is the IRS's ace-in-the-hole card. The IRS can close any \nloophole--real or imagined--with the power of the new law.\n  Why can't the IRS do its job with the volumes of legislative \nregulatory and judicial tools it already has? For example, the IRS \nrevenue ruling could be codified somehow, but then it wouldn't provide \nan offset for new programs, would it? Nor would it permit my colleagues \nacross the aisle to reduce the tax on venture capitalists for their \ncarried interest. I don't like the carried\n\n[[Page S5241]]\n\ninterest provision, but to soften the impact of that policy on the \nbacks of small businesses is just plain wrong.\n  Even the Government Accountability Office agrees the IRS should be \ndoing more with what it has to crack down on fraud. In a 2009 report, \nthe GAO stated: ``IRS efforts to enforce the rules on paying adequate \nwage compensation to small business shareholders have been limited,'' \nand the IRS provides only ``limited guidance in determining adequate \ncompensation'' guidelines for taxpayers.\n  A 2002 report by the Treasury's inspector general found that ``IRS \nagents did not always address officer compensation, even when little or \nno compensation was paid.''\n  Clearly, the IRS isn't doing its job. That is the loophole. The IRS \ncan and should do more with what they already have.\n  As a former accountant, I find this small business corporation \npayroll tax totally unworkable. For example, the tax would apply when \n80 percent or more of gross income of the S corporation is attributable \nto three or fewer shareholders in the S corporation. How are taxpayers \nsupposed to track the attribution of gross income? Let me give an \nexample.\n  My friend, the senior Senator from Massachusetts, has introduced S. \n144 that would exempt cell phones from the recordkeeping requirements \nunder the listed property rules. Why? Because the paperwork burden is \ntoo costly and time consuming for business. I think it is a good bill, \nand I am proud to be a cosponsor. In fact, the bill has 72 cosponsors. \nThat is a supermajority of the Senate who agree it is a good bill. But \nif a supermajority of the Senate agrees the bookkeeping burden of \nparcelling out an itemized cell phone bill between business and \npersonal use is too onerous, why would we think that itemizing the \nsource of gross income across shareholders and employees in an S \ncorporation would be any easier?\n  This new payroll tax on small business was written without any input \nfrom the tax-writing committees, and it shows. Although I am sure it \nwas unintended, this new law has the potential to reduce Social \nSecurity benefits. Since the new payroll tax would reclassify income \nfrom certain small businesses as wage income, it could trigger the \nearnings test for folks receiving early retirement benefits from Social \nSecurity.\n  Even Senator Baucus admitted the payroll tax provision needs \n``modifications.'' I remember it well because he made this statement \nduring a Treasury hearing a few weeks ago when I raised this issue as \nan onerous tax increase.\n  Not only is this a job-killing tax, but the manner in which it was \nconcocted is appalling. The original tax extenders bill raised the \ntaxes on Wall Street bankers, but when their lobbyists howled, \nlawmakers went looking someplace else--small businesses--for the \nrevenue they needed. Small businesses aren't as able to defend \nthemselves when the tax man cometh, and in the end it results in a new \ntax that robs David to pay Goliath.\n  The outrageousness of this new tax led me and my colleague, Senator \nSnowe from Maine, to file an amendment that would strike the S \ncorporation payroll tax from the underlying tax extenders bill.\n  If my colleagues across the aisle seriously believe that \nnoncompliance with the self-employment tax among S corporations is a \nproblem, then the best, most workable solution is to codify the \n``reasonable compensation'' standard into law. This S corporation \n``attribution of gross income'' basis isn't workable. If you don't \nbelieve me, again, I refer you to the experts.\n  I have a letter I wish to submit for the Record. It is a letter from \nthe AICPA, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants. In \nthe letter they say:\n\n  We are concerned that there may be unintended consequences that have \nnot been fully aired and discussed. Accordingly, we strongly support \nthe amendment being offered by Senators Snowe and Enzi which would \nstrike Section 413.\n\n  I ask unanimous consent this letter be printed in the Record at the \nend of my statement.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 2.)\n  Mr. ENZI. Again, this seemingly small provision in the tax extenders \nbill would have a $9 billion impact, and that is just on a subset of S \ncorporations, these small businesses.\n  This payroll tax provision ought to be stripped and sent back to the \ntax-writing committees where it can be addressed in the proper fashion. \nI strongly urge my colleagues to support the Snowe-Enzi amendment in \nour efforts to remove this misguided, outrageous new tax. I think there \nis support on both sides of the aisle for doing that.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n                           [From taxanalysts]\n\n             Federal Research Library: IRS Revenue Rulings\n\n                   (Rev. Rul. 74-44; 1974-1 C.B. 287)\n\n\n                            rev. rul. 74-44\n\n       Advice has been requested whether, under the circumstances \n     described below, an electing small business corporation \n     incurred liability for the taxes imposed by the Federal \n     Insurance Contributions Act, Federal Unemployment Tax Act, \n     and the Collection of Income Tax at Source on Wages (chapters \n     21, 23, and 24, respectively, subtitle C, Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1954).\n       The corporation is a small business corporation with two \n     shareholders, that has elected, pursuant to section 1371(a) \n     of the Code, not to be subject to corporate income tax, but \n     to have all its income taxed directly to its shareholders.\n       In 1972, the shareholders performed services for the \n     corporation. However, to avoid the payment of Federal \n     employment taxes, they drew no salary from the corporation \n     but arranged for the corporation to pay them ``dividends'' of \n     100x dollars, which is the amount they would have otherwise \n     received as reasonable compensation for services performed.\n       Sections 3121(a) and 3306(b) of the Federal Insurance \n     Contributions Act and the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, \n     respectively, define the term ``wages,'' with certain \n     specific exceptions not material here, as ``all remuneration \n     for employment.'' Section 3401(a) of the Code, relating to \n     the withholding of income tax, contains a similar definition.\n       In the instant case, the ``dividends'' paid to the \n     shareholders in 1972 were in lieu of reasonable compensation \n     for their services. Accordingly, the 100x dollars paid to \n     each of the shareholders was reasonable compensation for \n     services performed by him, rather than a distribution of the \n     corporation's earnings and profits. Such compensation was \n     ``wages'' and liability was incurred for the taxes imposed by \n     the Federal Insurance Contributions Act, the Federal \n     Unemployment Tax Act, and the Collection of Income Tax at \n     Source on Wages.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                               Exhibit 2\n\n                                             American Institute of\n\n\n                                 Certified Public Accountants,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 14, 2010.\n     Hon.

Amendment 4342\n\n       Dear Chairman Baucus and Ranking Member Grassley: The \n     American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) \n     opposes Section 413 of the American Jobs and Closing Tax \n     Loopholes Act of 2010 which we believe threatens to result in \n     a significant increase in taxes and complexity for S \n     corporations and their shareholders, and for certain limited \n     partners. Section 413 represents a major change in \n     longstanding tax policy that has never been the subject of \n     public hearings, thus, we are concerned that there may be \n     unintended consequences that have not been fully aired and \n     discussed. Accordingly, we strongly support the amendment \n     being offered by Senators Snowe and Enzi, S. Amendment 4342, \n     which would strike Section 413. The proposed Section 413: \n     Fails to take into account a fair and reasonable return on \n     the human and investment capital of the owners; may reduce \n     Social Security benefits for early retirees; may create \n     unintended consequences to qualified and non-qualified \n     retirement plans of owners that would now have both wages and \n     self-employment income; and ignores the fact that the IRS \n     currently has the appropriate enforcement tools it needs to \n     re-characterize the distributions of S corporations as salary \n     subject to employment taxes under FICA.\n       The AICPA would like to work with Congress and the IRS to \n     address the best way to collect S corporation shareholders' \n     and partners' fair share of employment/self-employment taxes. \n     Such a provision should not be rushed through the legislative \n     process without due process and deliberation. Thank you very \n     much for taking time to consider our serious concerns and \n     suggestions regarding Section 413 of this Act, and the much \n     needed Snowe-Enzi amendment.

Mr. President, I rise today to share an incredible story \nabout a community working together in the aftermath of a powerful storm \nin Billings, MT.\n  The storm that occurred on Father's Day spawned at least one tornado \nthat touched down in Billings Heights, blowing apart several businesses \nand one of the city's most familiar buildings.\n  If my colleagues will take a look, this is a picture of what the \ninside of Rimrock Auto Arena looks like today. You can see the tornado \nripped off the roof. Thousands and thousands of folks have memories \nfrom inside this building, from concerts to sporting events to \ngraduations.\n  This picture was taken by Larry Mayer, a photographer for the \nBillings Gazette. Minutes after the tornado tore through, emergency \nresponders, as my colleagues can see, arrived on the scene to keep \nfolks away from the debris in the streets.\n  The wind twisted guardrails around light poles. The rain turned \nstreets into rivers. Golf ball-sized hail came crashing down.\n  In our part of the country, we are used to extreme weather--subzero \ncold, drought, snow, and severe thunderstorms--but a tornado tearing \nthrough the middle of Montana's largest city is pretty darn rare. \nThrough it all, only one minor injury was reported, and that was due to \nhail.\n  While we stand together in support of the folks who lost their \nbusinesses and their property last Sunday, we are grateful no one died. \nNobody lost their home. I attribute that to a lot of luck and to quick \naction and smart decisions by emergency responders in Billings and in \nYellowstone County.\n  Immediately after the clouds lifted, officers kept onlookers out of \nharm's way. More than a dozen National Guardsmen immediately secured \nthe area, answering a late night call on Father's Day. News reporters \nwent to work sharing the story. Unelected leaders, from councilmen to \ncommissioners, buckled down to hammer out the next steps.\n  This week, people across the country opened their newspapers and \nturned on their TVs to see the incredible pictures from Billings, MT. \nThey saw what happens when a community works together in the aftermath \nof a storm such as this. Everyone lived to share their story, and the \ncommunity grew stronger because of it.\n  It is not just Billings that felt the force of wild weather this last \nweek. Further north, the community of Rocky Boy's Indian Reservation is \nstill trying to tally up the damage after a powerful rain storm last \nThursday night. In the nearby Bear Paw Mountains, there is word that \nwater wiped out entire roads. Dozens of families in the area were \nforced out of their homes, and roads were destroyed.\n  Last week, a microburst destroyed a home near Froid, MT. Ramona \nRyder, the woman who lived in a residence there, died in that storm.\n  Of course, Montana is a State where agriculture is not just the top \nindustry, it is the livelihood of thousands of families. Weather takes \nits toll on crops and soil and irrigation. But over the past week, we \nhave seen unusual weather across the Big Sky State, and we can expect \nmore of it. From farmers to tribal communities to folks who live in \nMontana's biggest cities, it impacts everyone.\n  Now we begin the process of rebuilding the businesses and the \nfamiliar buildings destroyed by these storms.\n  I ask the Presiding Officer and all of my colleagues to stand with me \nto offer any support we can to the Billings and Rocky Boy's communities \nand to those folks up in the Bear Paw Mountains and especially to the \nfolks who have to start from scratch because, as we know all too well \nin Montana, it takes working together to rebuild, and we will become \nstronger.\n  With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor. I suggest the absence of \na quorum, and I ask unanimous consent that the time during the quorum \ncall be divided equally between the Democrats and Republicans.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5242-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5242-S5243]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             HAMAS IN GAZA\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the current \nsituation in the Gaza Strip.\n  In 2007, Hamas, a State Department-designated foreign terrorist \norganization, forcibly seized control of Gaza. Hamas continues to \nrefuse to recognize Israel's right to exist and, in fact, has \nperpetrated terrorist attacks against Israel, launching countless \nrockets from Gaza into Israel.\n  Hamas calls for the elimination of Israel and Jews from Islamic holy \nlands. No Hamas leader has publicly expressed a willingness to disarm \nor to stop attacks on Israel and Israelis.\n  Israel, like every other country in the world, has a right to defend \nitself. With a sworn enemy on its border, Israel must protect her \ncitizens against potential attacks every single day. Under the \nblockade, Israel directs ships to the port of Ashdod, where they are \ninspected for arms and other dangerous items before Israel allows off-\nloading and assists in the delivery of legitimate goods to Gaza.\n  We know that Israel's concerns about arms transfers to Gaza are \nlegitimate because both weapons and raw materials are smuggled into \nGaza through tunnels from the Sinai in Egypt. Thousands of rockets and \nmortars have been fired from Gaza into Israel over the last decade.\n  Just last week, Israel has shown signs of compromise, announcing its \nintention to ease the blockade and allow more civilian goods and \nhumanitarian aid to enter the Palestinian territory by land, including \nconstruction materials for civilian projects.\n  It is important to note that Hamas has made no such compromises and \ncontinues to maintain its vehement and violent stance against Israel's \nexistence. Hamas also continues to endanger Gaza's civilian population \nby using hospitals, schools, mosques, and residential neighborhoods as \ncommand and operations centers or as weapons storage facilities.\n  While Hamas claims to be the popular representatives of the \nPalestinians in Gaza, their actions show that they hardly care for the \nplight of the average Gazan, as their rule deprives their own people of \na transparent democracy, civil rights and freedom.\n  The best way to ameliorate that and to fix the broader current crisis \nand prevent future ones, of course, is Israeli-Palestinian peace and \nthe creation of an independent Palestinian state that lives side-by-\nside with Israel, providing security and economic stability for the \nPalestinian and the Israeli people.\n  Today, it is Israel that continues to acknowledge the necessary \nframework for any peace agreement.\n  Israel has shown willingness for direct negotiations, but the \nPalestinians continue to insist on proximity talks. Israel is seeking \nto make peace with a partner whose parliament is controlled by Hamas, \nan organization still sworn to the destruction of Israel.\n  The only way to achieve peace is for Hamas to give up its militancy, \nforego terrorism and violence against innocent civilians, recognize \nIsrael's right to exist and become a legitimate partner in Palestinian \ninstitutions. The more than 1 million Palestinians living in Gaza \ndeserve that, the millions of Israelis who are subject to Hamas rockets \nand terror deserve that and frankly, the world deserves a stable, \nsecure Middle East.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before coming to Washington, I ran a \nshoestore in Gillette, WY. I stocked the shelves. I worked with \ncustomers to fit them with shoes. I ran the cash register. I placed the \norders with suppliers. I swept the floors. I cleaned the toilets. I did \nthe bookkeeping. In short, I was a one-man show. That is not quite \naccurate. My wife was there, and we had a couple of clerks. We all had \nthe same responsibilities. My wife helped and actually grew the \nbusiness while I was mayor of Gillette. We were a one-family show. I \nknow firsthand the struggles and challenges America's small businesses \nface. We faced them on a daily basis. That is why I am so concerned \nabout the recent action by the Obama administration.\n  Earlier this week, the administration published a 121-page interim \nfinal rule that will have a major negative impact on millions of small \nbusinesses across the country. This new rule, which implements just two \npages of the health care law pertaining to grandfathered health plans, \nwill increase the costs these businesses will pay for health insurance. \nThis new rule violates the President's repeated promises from last year \nand the year before that under the new health care law, if you like \nwhat you have, you can keep it.\n  A chart on page 54 of the rule states that the Departments of \nTreasury, Labor, and Health and Human Services estimate that between 39 \nand 69 percent of the businesses will lose their grandfathered health \nplan status. This means these businesses' health plans will not be able \nto keep their current plans but, rather, will be required to comply \nwith one of the expensive mandates included in the new law. This will, \nin turn, drive up the costs for these plans, making them even more \nunaffordable for small businesses. As a former small business owner, I \nunderstand how small businesses are struggling every day to find the \nresources to provide health insurance to their employees. Rather than \nmaking it easier for these businesses to continue to provide this \ncoverage, the new regulation will actually make it more likely that \nemployers will simply drop their health insurance coverage altogether.\n  I have a copy of the chart to show the folks back home. This chart \nshows the administration's own estimates, which indicate that only \nabout half of Americans will be able to keep what they have. The \npicture, of course, is even worse for small businesses. Health and \nHuman Services estimates that by 2013, up to 80 percent of small \nbusinesses could lose their grandfather status. The plans that do lose \ntheir grandfather status will have to abide by a whole slew of new \nFederal mandates, many of which have not even been written yet.\n  These are the low estimates of how many people are going to take it \nagain. This is a midrange estimate by the administration and then a \nhigh estimate for small employer plans, large employer plans, and all \nemployer plans. The low-end estimate is 49 percent of them will have to \ngo to something different if they cannot be grandfathered, the midrange \nestimate is 66 percent, while the high-end estimate is 80 percent of \nsmall employer plans will have to give up what they have right now \nbecause there are more federally mandated requirements they have not \nbeen meeting. In my home State, more than 50 percent of the people will \nhave to change to a different insurance. I have to tell you, almost all \nof them who have insurance are happy with the insurance they have and \nreally thought they could keep what they have if they like what they \nhave. This chart shows that is not going to be the case.\n  During my days as a shoestore owner, I would not have had the luxury \nto read a 121-page interim final rule and try to determine what I \nneeded to do to keep my health insurance plan. And if my small business \nwas one of the 80 percent of small businesses that the administration \nthinks will lose their current status, then I would be forced to pay \nfor a lot more coverage.\n  One of the most disturbing aspects of this new rule is it will \nactually make it harder for employers to make changes that could hold \ndown the cost of their health care. Once this interim final rule \nbecomes effective, which will be July 12 of this year--less than a \nmonth from now--large and small businesses will have few options for \nboth keeping costs in check and maintaining their grandfather status. \nIf an employer does any one of the following things to manage their \ncosts, they lose the health care they have: If they eliminate any \nbenefits, they lose their grandfather status. If they increase \ncoinsurance rates, they lose their grandfather status. If they increase \ndeductibles or out-of-pocket limits beyond minimum levels, they lose \ntheir grandfather status. If they increase copayments beyond minimum \nlevels, they lose their grandfather status. If they decrease the \nemployer share of the premium by more than 5 percent, they lose \ngrandfather status. If they add an annual limit or decrease the \nlifetime or annual limit, they lose grandfather status. If they change \ntheir health insurance carrier, they lose their grandfather status.\n  Which is the most important one of those? The very last one. If they \nchange their health insurance carrier, they lose their grandfather \nstatus. The only way you have a chance of holding those costs down is \nto bid out the insurance. It made a huge difference in our business. \nThe first time we bid it out--and we were several years staying with \nthe same company and having very huge increases--the first time we bid \nit out, we found out we could save very substantially, and so we bought \nthe lower bid insurance.\n  Then the company we had been dealing with for several years came to \nus and said: Why did you change?\n  I said: We got a much lower price.\n  They said: Why didn't you come back to us and ask for a lower price?\n  I said: That is not the way we sell shoes; that is not the way you \nshould sell insurance.\n  If they change their health insurance carrier, they will lose their \ngrandfather status even if they provide the same things the other one \nwas providing, which is what you do in a bid. In an attempt to keep \nhealth care costs down and avoid having to do the other things we \nmentioned, you would lose your grandfather status. In short, if \nemployers do anything to help slow the growth of their health insurance \ncosts, they will lose the limited protections against the expensive new \nmandates in the bill.\n  It is worth noting that 2 pages in the law--just 2 pages; it was \n2,700 pages, but 2 pages are causing all this--that create the \ngrandfathered plans are a blank slate. The law does not say anything \nabout cost-sharing requirements or coinsurance rates.\n  The administration made up all these provisions and requirements. \nThey did not have to write these rules that preclude half of Americans \nfrom keeping what they have. The reality is that the administration \ndoes not want you to keep what you have. They certainly like that \ntalking point--it keeps people from getting very nervous--but they do \nnot actually want you to keep what you have. They do not want \ngrandfathered plans to exist. They want to force all Americans to buy \nonly insurance plans that are defined and approved in Washington. It is \njust one more Washington takeover.\n  Throughout the rule, the administration makes the assumption that a \nlarge number of plans will place a high value on the remaining \ngrandfathered plans. Why do they make this assumption? Because the \nadministration recognizes that employers realize the mandates and \nburdens included in the health care bill will drive up premiums and \ndrive up costs for large businesses, small businesses, and individuals. \nThe Congressional Budget Office estimates that costs will increase 10 \nto 13 percent for Americans purchasing coverage on their own. That \nrepresents a $2,100 increase for families purchasing coverage.\n  Page 112 of the rule lists the 13 new mandates included in the health \ncare law that do not apply to grandfathered plans. However, based on \nthe administration's own calculations, it looks as if 39 to 69 percent \nof employers will now be forced to comply with these new 13 mandates \nwhen they lose their grandfather status.\n\n  Even for the small number of plans that manage to keep their \ngrandfather status, the reality is that the new law will still impose \nexpensive new mandates that will increase their costs. The new health \ncare law requires all plans, including grandfathered health plans, to \ncomply with certain provisions in the new health care law. Page 112 of \nthe interim final rule has five\n\n[[Page S5244]]\n\nsections detailing the new mandates that apply to grandfathered health \nplans for plan years beginning on or after September 23 this year. \nAnother section becomes effective in 2014.\n  This bill was sold as letting people keep what they have, but the \ndevil is always in the details. Do a little digging and it is clear \nthat Americans will not be able to keep what they have.\n  I would like to read a paragraph from page 112 of the regulation. It \nsays:\n\n       Provisions applicable to all grandfathered health plans. \n     The provisions of Public Health Service Act section 2711 \n     insofar as it relates to lifetime limits, and the provisions \n     of Public Health Service Act--\n\n  And it lists several of them--\n\n     apply to grandfathered health plans for plan years on or \n     after September 23, 2010. The provisions of Public Health \n     Service Act section 2708 apply to grandfathered health plans \n     for plan years beginning on or after January 1, 2014.\n\n  This means health plans are now prohibited from having lifetime \nlimits on the dollar value of benefits for any participant or \nbeneficiary. Even though this section becomes effective after September \n23 of this year, the Department has not issued any regulations or \nguidance telling plans how to implement this new requirement.\n  Section 2712 says that health plans shall not rescind such plan or \ncoverage, except that this section shall not apply to a covered \nindividual who has performed an act or practice that constitutes fraud \nor makes an intentional misrepresentation of material fact. We have not \nseen any guidance or regulations on that section either.\n  Section 2714 says that all kids under the age of 26 can stay on their \nparents' health insurance policy. This popular provision got a lot of \nattention from the media and the administration. Because of the \npopularity, this is one area where the administration has actually \nwritten an interim final rule which becomes effective July 12 this year \neven though the comments are not due until August 11 of this year. The \nfinal rule goes into effect July 12, but the comments are not due until \nAugust 11. In other words, they are not going to read any of the \ncomments before that goes into effect.\n  In the rule, the administration includes an analysis saying that this \nprovision is expected to increase premiums by 1 percent. That might not \nsound like a lot on its own, but remember that this is only one of the \nsix provisions with which all health plans, even grandfathered plans, \nwill be forced to comply. If each of the other five provisions also \ndrives up premiums by similar amounts, that would equal a 6-percent \nincrease on top of whatever increase results from normal medical \ninflation.\n  Section 2715 says all plans must give enrollees a government-approved \nsummary of benefits and coverage explanation describing the benefits \nincluded in the plan.\n  The interesting thing about this section is that Secretary Sebelius \nhas until next March to publish the standards the plans have to use \nwhen they draft these documents, but the plans have to give their \nenrollees the documents this September. How is that possible? If plans \ndo not have these documents ready, they can be fined up to $1,000 per \nenrollee. The standards will not be ready until next year, but the \nplans have to comply this year or face a $1,000-per-enrollee fine. \nCommon sense rode a horse right out of Washington. Maybe it was never \nhere to begin with.\n  Section 2718 says all plans for big businesses have to spend at least \n85 cents out of every premium dollar they get paying claims, and plans \nfor small businesses and individuals have to spend at least 80 cents \nout of every premium dollar they get paying claims. This may sound like \na good idea, but, again, the devil is in the details.\n  The National Association of Insurance Commissioners is responsible \nfor defining the terms used in these calculations and coming up with \nsome recommendations about how to implement this section. The Secretary \nasked them to make these recommendations earlier than when the law \nsays, but they have been having some difficulty. The difficulty is that \nStates know that implementing these provisions will put health plans \nout of business--out of business. When the plans go out of business, \nthe Americans enrolled in these plans will lose their coverage. This is \na real problem with which the insurance commissioners are grappling. \nUnfortunately, Republicans warned our colleagues on the other side \nabout this problem last December but we were ignored.\n  Section 2708 becomes effective in 2014 and says that plans cannot \napply waiting periods that exceed 90 days. Again, this provision sounds \nlike a great idea, and some States are already doing this, but this is \none more thing that will drive up costs.\n  No single raindrop thinks it is responsible for the flood. These \nprovisions may sound like good ideas when looked at by themselves but, \nwhen taken together, they drive up premiums to the point health care is \nunaffordable.\n  All these sections I have been talking about are mandates that apply \nto all plans, even grandfathered plans. There is a whole list of \nmandates that do not apply to grandfathered plans but apply to the new \nplans. Page 112 of the rule. I would refer you to that. I won't read it \nhere. It has a lot of references again, and even though these sections \naren't supposed to apply to grandfathered plans, as this rule points \nout, about half of all Americans will lose their grandfathered plan and \nthey will be forced to buy a plan that includes the additional \nmandates.\n\n  But if you are enrolled in a union health plan, have no fear. \nDifferent rules apply to you. The administration's favorite special \ninterest group gets special treatment under this rule. This is exactly \nthe kind of political cynicism this administration campaigned against 2 \nyears ago. Page 48 of the rule says:\n\n       This estimate does not take into account collectively \n     bargained plans, which can change issuers during the period \n     of collective bargaining agreement without loss of \n     grandfather status.\n\n  Keep reading, because page 50 says:\n\n       For fully insured group health plans, another change that \n     would require a plan to relinquish grandfather status is a \n     change in issuer.\n\n  The bottom line: Big labor can change issuers, but small businesses \ncannot change issuers. The ability to change issuers is something that \nkeeps insurance companies competing against each other to see who can \noffer the best product at the lowest price.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. ENZI. I ask unanimous consent to speak for 2 more minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENZI. I thank my colleagues.\n  The ability to change issuers is something that keeps insurance \ncompanies competing against each other to see who can offer the best \nproduct at the lowest price. Take that competition away, and prices \nwill go up--for everyone but union plans.\n  The simple truth is, because this new rule will drastically tie the \nhands of employers, few employers are expected to pursue grandfather \nstatus. That means more than half of Americans who like what they have \nwon't be able to keep it. As I said earlier, this is not a mistake. \nThis is exactly what the President and the majority controlling \nCongress want. They want all Americans to be forced to buy the kind of \nhealth insurance they think you should have. Never mind that you can't \nafford it. Never mind that employers faced with the choice of either \npaying for health insurance or paying a new penalty will be less likely \nto hire new workers and will probably even lay off workers. Simply put, \nthis rule States: Washington knows best. Never mind the President \npromised Americans who like what they have can keep it. This new rule \nis pretty clear: If you like what you have, you can't keep it.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that we \ncontinue in morning business and that Senator Brown of Ohio and myself \nbe allowed to engage in a colloquy for the next 15 minutes.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, Senator Brown and I have come to the\n\n[[Page S5245]]\n\nfloor today to talk about the estate tax. Today's discussion was \nprompted by a recent New York Times report that an estate of a Texas \nnatural gas tycoon--Mr. Duncan of Houston--is worth $9 billion. That is \na nine with nine zeros after it. It is a big number, and it is going to \ngo without tax to his heirs. Without any tax at all. It is hard to know \nwhat his tax planning is, but if the ordinary rates applied, the tax \nthat would be paid by this estate might be as much as $4 billion.\n  I think it is important to put that in counterpoint with the \ndiscussion we have been having on the floor today, where our friends on \nthe other side of the aisle are blocking unemployment insurance for \nAmericans who, through no fault of their own, lost their jobs. Because \nof what Wall Street did to wipe out the economy, they are out there on \ntheir own. They can't find work. In Rhode Island, we have 70,000 people \nunemployed in our small State. Our unemployment rate is 12.3 percent. \nAnd if you don't have unemployment insurance to protect you at a time \nsuch as that, you are stuck. Unemployment insurance goes to pay for \nfood. It goes to pay for gas in the tank, to look for the next job. It \ngoes to pay for shoes for your children. It goes to pay for clothing \nand rent and heat or electricity--all the basics. They are blocking it. \nThey are blocking it because it is not paid for, as if this were not an \nemergency.\n  But they are perfectly happy--in fact, we haven't heard a peep out of \nthem--with the Duncan estate going tax free to his heirs. I don't know \nhow many of them there are, but if there are any less than nine, they \nall just became billionaires, tax free. That is the kind of contrast \nthat is so remarkable about this building. We have an entire party that \nis dedicated to preventing working people, who have lost their jobs \nthrough no fault of their own as a result of this economic meltdown, \nfrom getting unemployment insurance, and that has actually already \nexpired and we are trying to backfill it for that period, but they are \ncompletely satisfied with an oil tycoon worth $9 billion having his \nestate go completely tax free to his heirs. That situation is happening \nbecause of a glitch in the Tax Code that we could not fix. It is part \nof the Bush tax cuts having run to their conclusion.\n  The estate tax goes back to 1789 in its first incarnation. It has \nbeen permanent since 1916. John D. Rockefeller paid estate taxes in \n1937 when he died. He was taxed at a 70-percent rate. Today, we are \nhaving a debate about whether we should continue at a rate of only 45 \npercent. The Duncan estate went through at zero percent.\n  This cut, which took $4 billion out of the economy to pay this one \nfamily with a tax-free estate, was pushed through by the Republicans \nusing reconciliation. If you have been listening on the floor, you have \nheard a lot of critique about what a terrible procedure reconciliation \nis when it is used to do anything to help regular Americans. But when \nit comes to cutting the estate tax so that the Duncan family can have a \n$9 billion estate pass tax free, well, that is a perfectly fine use of \nreconciliation, according to our Republican friends.\n  At this point, at exemption levels of $3.5 million per individual, $7 \nmillion per couple, only a few thousand estates each year pay any \nestate tax at all. It is a tax that only hits not the rich but the \nsuperrich--the billionaires, such as the Duncan family. And while we \nare in this period of economic turmoil, while we are in this period \nwhere one party is trying to keep regular workers from getting access \nto unemployment insurance in the middle of this economic disaster, they \nare all for an unpaid-for zeroing out of the estate tax so that a $9 \nbillion estate passes completely tax free.\n  I think that is wrong. I think it shows priorities that are \ncompletely topsy-turvy--completely upside-down. I know that Senator \nBrown wanted to join me, and I have gone on for a bit, so I will quiet \ndown for a second so he can be heard. But it is immensely frustrating \nthat that is the priority around here--let the working family lose the \nbasic paycheck that holds the family together but have the billionaires \nget $9 billion tax free.\n  Mr. BROWN of Ohio. I thank Senator Whitehouse for his comments. As \nSenator Whitehouse said, I have been in this body only since January of \n2007. Most of the damage from the estate tax was done prior to our \nbeing here. But I spent some years before being elected to the Senate \nin the House of Representatives, and anytime we talked about the estate \ntax in the House, my Republican colleagues would use two terms. They \nwould talk about the ``politics of envy'' and they would talk about \n``class warfare;'' that Democrats were envious of success and that we \nwere engaging in class warfare, wanting to turn one social class \nagainst another.\n\n  But the issue here isn't any strong desire for us to engage in \nretribution against anybody or any class envy. The situation is this, \nand let's start with this chart. This is a percentage of estates \nsubject to tax. The estate tax, which the Republicans called the \n``death tax,'' does not impact 99.3 percent of people who die in this \ncountry. Their families pay zero estate tax. It is only, as Senator \nWhitehouse said, the absolute mega superrich. It is not people worth \njust a few million but only seven-tenths of 1 percent. That means it is \n7 out of 1,000 who will pay any estate tax at all. And so this issue--\nnot aimed at any one person--raises the question of: What do we do \ninstead?\n  The Duncan family--this is Mr. Duncan, whom Senator Whitehouse talked \nabout--died with $9 billion, and his family pays no estate tax \nwhatsoever. Senator Whitehouse pointed out that if there are fewer than \nnine members of that family, they all woke up the next morning \ncertainly very sad about their father or their uncle or their brother, \nbut they also woke up as billionaires the next day, and our condolences \ngo out to that family, but something has to replace this. If the estate \ntax was where it should have been, he would have--his family would \nhave--paid the Federal Government $3 billion or $4 billion.\n  What does that mean? It means that during this previous Congress--the \n2002 and 2003 Congresses--when the Bush administration ran up this huge \ndebt, with tax cuts for the rich, not paid for but passed on to our \nchildren and grandchildren; the Iraq war, not paid for and passed on to \nour children and grandchildren; the giveaway to the drug and insurance \ncompanies in the name of Medicare privatization, passed on to our \nchildren and grandchildren; and the billions of dollars of cost that \nwas added to the bill, this would have helped pay for some of that.\n  The $3 billion or $4 billion that would have been generated by the \nDuncan estate, where does that money come from? What do we replace that \nwith? We either continue to tax middle-class people in this country too \nheavily or we cut programs for that $3 billion or $4 billion or we \ncharge it to our grandchildren. And that is what has happened. As \nSenator Whitehouse said, it is a contrast.\n  What do we do? We can do as Republicans do: We can deny unemployment \ncompensation; deny COBRA insurance coverage, so people can keep their \nhealth insurance; deny Pell grants for people, which could be paid for \nby this $3 billion or $4 billion, or should we tax more people to pay \nfor it? The Republicans didn't care about the budget deficit when it \nwas the Iraq war. They didn't pay for the Iraq war. They didn't care \nabout the budget deficit when it was the giveaway to the drug \ncompanies. Now all of a sudden they do.\n  This is the face of people we deal with. This is a General Motors \nauto worker in Lorain, OH, somewhere near Dayton, where this GM plant \nclosed in the last 2 years. These workers waiting here are losing their \nunemployment insurance because people on the other side of the aisle--\nour Republican colleagues--simply would rather protect the super \nwealthiest people in our society--they would rather protect these \nseven-tenths or 7 out of every 1,000 people--and helping them pay no \ntaxes, rather than taking care of this unemployed worker. That is the \ntragedy of the choices they have made.\n  Those contrasts, as Senator Whitehouse said, are very clear, between \nRepublicans wanting to protect the superrich and Democrats wanting to \nmake sure that unemployment compensation is extended. These are human \nbeings, each with a story. You can bet in this crowd some of these \npeople not only lost their job but they lost their insurance, and some \nof them have lost their home as well. Because I\n\n[[Page S5246]]\n\nknow what has happened in the Dayton area, in Miami Valley. Far too \nmany people have lost their homes.\n  So while the Republicans are trying to protect the Duncan estate, \nwith billions and billions of dollars in that estate, people such as \nSenator Whitehouse, Majority Leader Reid, who is on the floor, and \nSenator Kaufman want to see us take care of the unemployed workers, \ntake care of those who have lost their insurance, take care of those \nwho are faced with foreclosure because of the economic situation. As \nSenator Whitehouse said, these people didn't choose to be in this \nsituation.\n  As Warren Buffett said in 2007:\n\n       The average American went exactly nowhere on the economic \n     scale in the last 20 years. They have been on a treadmill \n     while the super rich have been on a space ship.\n\n  That is exactly what happened in this country. The wealthiest people \nhave done better and better as their tax rate went down and down. Those \nmiddle-class kids who need Pell grants, the middle-class families who \nlost their jobs who are now on the unemployment line, those workers who \nhave lost their insurance through no fault of their own--they lost \ntheir jobs--they are on this downward spiral which simply is not what \nour country stands for.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Two points I would like to make. One is echoing what \nSenator Brown just said. We always hear about the debt and the pay-for \nfrom the other side when it is convenient, when they are trying to stop \nsomething the administration wants to do. When it helps regular people \nwho have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, then it becomes \nan international incident if it is not paid for. But when an estate of \n$9 billion is allowed to pass tax free because of a loophole, that is \nOK. That is a $4 billion unpaid-for loss to the government, through its \nrevenues. That is just fine.\n  There is a disconnect there. If you are serious about the deficit, \nyou have to be serious about it when it is billionaires and not just \nserious about it when it is regular working families. There is a one-\nsidedness and a convenience for their concern about the deficit. When \nit is their President in the White House, Katey, bar the door. By my \ncalculation they blew $9 trillion during the Bush administration. Now \nthey suddenly have had an epiphany about debt, but it does not quite \nextend to billionaires who are allowed to pass their estates through \ntax free. So much for the debt and the pay-for concern.\n  The other group they are very concerned about all the time is \ncorporations. In this year, corporations have paid less tax compared to \nhumans than ever before, since 1983, where there was a glitch and \ncorporations paid less taxes relative to what humans pay than now. But \nother than that, 1 year, 1983, more than a quarter of a century ago, \ncorporations are paying an all-time low in taxes compared to what \nhumans pay.\n  If you go back, it is 70 years--1983 was just a 1-year exemption. So \nall this battle has driven down tax rates for corporations, tax rates \nfor billionaires, and here we are with a deficit and they do not care \nabout the billionaires.\n  I will close. I see the majority leader on the Senate floor, and I do \nnot want to take time. I will close. America is a place of which we are \nvery proud. It is the greatest country ever. It is a place where people \ncan get fabulously rich. Not only is it a place where you can get \nfabulously rich, when you get fabulously rich you can still live a \nrelatively normal life. You don't have to live like some Third World \nthug behind armed guards driving around in convoys with armed SUVs. You \ncan live a normal life as a very rich person.\n  Everybody has a chance to get rich. Everybody has a chance to become \na millionaire, a multimillionaire, a billionaire. But when they do, \nthey have to pay their share.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The time of the Senator has \nexpired.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE.

Mr. President, I rise to speak on behalf of nearly 1 \nmillion people who have lost their jobs, who have now also lost their \nunemployment insurance benefits because of the extensive obstacles and \nobjections that have been put forward in the Senate to extending this \nimportant program. I wish I could say this was the first time that had \nhappened. It seems that every time we come to the floor in the middle \nof these very difficult economic times, even though things are getting \nbetter, every time we come to the floor on behalf of people who are out \nof work, who want to work, who have worked their entire lives but at \nthis point can't find a job, all we get are objections and delays and \nweeks and weeks and weeks of people sitting on pins and needles, \nholding their breath, trying to figure out what is going on: Will they \nhave the ability to pay the rent, the mortgage, put food on the table, \nbe able to care for their kids while they are looking for work. Here we \nare, right back in that very same position.\n  Right now we have over 15 million people who are on unemployment \nbenefits. That doesn't count those who are working part-time jobs or \nhave fallen off of the system completely because they haven't been able \nto find a job and have been out of work longer than the insurance \nbenefits will allow. We have 15 million people looking for work, and we \nare told there are about 3.1 million jobs available. That means there \nare five people looking for every one job opening. This is not a \nsituation of people not wanting to work. In the State of Michigan, we \nknow how to work. We work hard. We make things. We grow things. We work \nhard. Yet through no fault of their own, people find themselves in a \nsituation where we have seen an economic tsunami go through our \ncountry, lasting in Michigan longer than any other place across the \ncountry. And even as we climb our way out--and it is getting better; we \nhave turned the corner; the economic recovery provisions we have put in \nplace we\n\n[[Page S5247]]\n\nknow are beginning to make a difference--we still are in a situation, \neven as we are moving and turning the corner, where there are five \npeople out of work for every one job opening. That is real life for too \nmany people I represent.\n  We have had legislation in front of us. We have been spending weeks \nnow on a jobs bill, a bill to create jobs, to invest in innovation, to \nhelp small businesses, to help manufacturers get the capital they need, \nbut to also, in that bill, help people who don't have a job while they \nare waiting for all this to take effect, for all of this to work, \npeople who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own, who find \nthemselves in a situation where they are desperate and depending on us \nto understand what is happening to too many working families, middle-\nclass families, people who never in their wildest dreams thought they \nwould find themselves in this situation but here they are. They want to \nknow that we get it, that we understand what is happening in their \nlives and that we are not going to play politics or use people who are \nout of work somehow as pawns in a political chess game that is going on \nhere in the Senate.\n  The normal unemployment insurance benefits only last for 26 weeks, \nbut thanks to the recovery act, we have been able to bridge the gap for \nmillions of Americans by extending it. That is very important. But we \nare at a point now where the recovery has not fully been actualized. \nPeople are still in a situation where they need to have help on a \ntemporary basis while they are looking for work.\n  Since this recession started in 2007, there are now 8 million fewer \njobs in America, too many of those in manufacturing. I could spend \nhours talking about fair trade and what we need to do to make sure \nmarkets are open abroad for our products to be sold so we are exporting \nour products, not our jobs, and how we can have a fair trade policy. I \nam pleased that in the recovery act we have focused on making things \nagain in America, battery manufacturing facilities and the advanced \nmanufacturing tax credit, both of which I was pleased to be a part of \nleading to create jobs.\n  We are creating jobs. But it takes time to turn this around. We find \nourselves in a situation where nearly 1 million people who have lost \ntheir jobs are going to lose their unemployment benefits because of \nwhat has been going on here. They don't have time to wait and hold \ntheir breath as we continue to work to turn this economy around. These \nare families trying to make ends meet. They are applying for jobs every \nday. They are putting in applications. I get e-mail after e-mail--and I \nwill share some this evening--from people who are trying to find work, \nputting in applications, going back to school. We have all said to \nthem: Maybe you need to go back to school. They have gone back to \nschool to get retraining, but they have to keep a roof over their heads \nwhile they are doing that. They have to keep food on the table, keep \nthe electricity on for their families while they are doing that. That \nis what unemployment benefits allow them to do.\n  The last time Congress cut off emergency unemployment insurance \nbenefits was after the terrible recession in 1985, when the employment \nrate was 7.3 percent. Today, 33 States and the District of Columbia now \nhave unemployment that is higher than 7.3 percent. These are red \nStates, blue States, Republicans who are out of work, Democrats who are \nout of work. It doesn't matter what party one is; if they lose their \njob, it is an emergency for the family. They expect the Senate to \nunderstand that and to act. In 16 of those States, unemployment is \nstill higher than 10 percent. Many States haven't seen this many people \nout of work since the Great Depression.\n\n  When we look at the States where there are more than 1 in 10 people \nwho have lost jobs through no fault of their own, we see a picture that \nis, in fact, America. I know one of those great States is the State of \nmy colleague who is from Rhode Island. He has come to the floor on \nnumerous occasions to speak about the people of Rhode Island, just as I \nhave come on numerous occasions to speak about the people in the great \nState of Michigan. I am pleased the Senator from Rhode Island is here.\n  I yield the Senator up to 10 minutes to speak at this time.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I am delighted to be here with Senator \nStabenow. I know from the experience of Rhode Island how difficult \nthings are in Michigan. I have seen over and over the passion and \nenergy with which she comes to the floor to argue on behalf of the \npeople of Michigan. I join her this evening on behalf of the people of \nRhode Island.\n  The unemployment insurance obstruction we are getting is simply cruel \nunder the circumstances in Rhode Island. I know my friends on the \nRepublican side like to argue that if we cut off people's unemployment \ninsurance, that will motivate them to get back out there in the \nworkforce where they should be, as if they were just idling around, as \nif they were not out looking for work.\n  In Rhode Island, we are at 12.3 percent unemployment. We have been \nthe third or fourth highest unemployment State in the country for \nmonths and months now. This is not some sudden glitch in the \naccounting. This is a persistent economic nightmare in Rhode Island. We \nhave been 15 straight months--more than a year--with double-digit \nunemployment. If we go back to 8 percent unemployment, we go back 22 \nmonths, nearly 2 years. This is a persistent problem. The notion that \nwe will cut off somebody's unemployment insurance and have them go out \nand find a job is plain nuts in a State such as Rhode Island or a State \nsuch as Michigan, because the job just isn't there to be found.\n  As Senator Stabenow said about Michigan, her folks are hard workers. \nRhode Islanders are hard workers. We have a tradition of working hard \nin a whole variety of industries. There aren't a lot of people lying \naround enjoying the luxury of unemployment insurance payments. They \nwant to be out getting work. Unemployment insurance payments let them \nsearch for work and feed their family, pay the rent, put gas in the \ncar, buy shoes for the kids, put food on the table, all in the \nmeantime. Our colleagues want to take that away.\n  Let's scroll back for a minute to why we are here in the first place. \nWe are here in the first place because the people who were supposed to \nbe regulating Wall Street were asleep at the switch. The people who \nwere supposed to be regulating Wall Street were asleep at the switch \nbecause they were told to be asleep at the switch. It is the Republican \ntheory of governance that regulation should have a light hand and that \ncorporations know better and should really run the show. So the folks \nwho were supposed to be regulating Wall Street were the captives of the \nbig Wall Street financiers. They took all the breaks off. They let them \nrun with crazy leverage ratios, new instruments such as derivatives and \ncollateralized debt obligations, and they went right to sleep, the way \nthey were supposed to. The result was a catastrophic Wall Street \nmeltdown that could have been prevented if there had been a different \ntheory of governance and not the theory of governance that we let the \ncorporations run the show and that is the best thing for Americans.\n  But that is what happened. They let the corporations run the show. \nThat theory of governance prevailed. There was a massive meltdown. That \nmassive meltdown sent a tsunami of misery across this country into \nplaces miles from Wall Street, completely different from Wall Street, \nincluding States such as Rhode Island and Michigan. We have 71,000 \npeople unemployed in my little State of Rhode Island. Those people need \nto get unemployment insurance while the economy recovers. We are not a \n4-percent unemployment State or a 6-percent unemployment State. We are \nnot even an 8-percent unemployment State. We are over 12 percent \nunemployment. There is not a job for these people. To take away the \nbread and butter, to take basic sustenance off the table is, frankly, \nunfair. We have even tried to get an extra 25 bucks added to the \nbenefit. Republicans have objected to that.\n  Mr. President, 25 bucks does not seem like much, and indeed it is not \nmuch, but if you are just getting by with unemployment insurance \nbecause your State has been in recession for so long, as ours has, that \nextra 25 bucks is a meal the family does not have to skip; that is a \ntrip to the doctor they do not have to duck because they cannot afford \nthe copay; it is an important\n\n[[Page S5248]]\n\nlittle thing; and it is just symbolic of the attitude on the other side \nof the aisle that: Sorry, not interested. Tough bounce. We don't care.\n  We were on the floor earlier talking about how when it is a $9 \nbillion family and there is no estate tax on that because of the way \nthe Republicans have driven this and $4 billion in revenue is lost to \nthe government as a result of this colossal estate being exempted from \nthe estate tax, that is OK. But when it is 25 bucks for a working \nfamily to buy a pair of shoes for their daughter, no, that is too much. \nNow we have to get serious about the recession. Now we have to get \nserious about the debt. But when it is a $9 billion family with a huge \nestate, no, different rules apply when it is very rich people.\n  Well, I am here for people like Dan of East Greenwich. He worked in \nsales. He has been unemployed since April 2009. His wife is disabled. \nHe is out looking for work, but the jobs are not there, and he has not \nbeen able to find one. If he loses his unemployment insurance, Dan has \nlet us know he will be evicted from their apartment. He and his \ndisabled wife will be evicted from their apartment. That should not be \nhappening. That is just bluntly wrong.\n  Bill of North Kingstown contacted me. He is 56 years old. He has been \nunemployed since January of 2009. He used to work in engineering. He \nhas now been faced twice with eviction when the unemployment insurance \nhas lapsed, and he is looking at eviction again. It is staring him in \nthe face if we do not act. He has received only $200 over the last 3-\nweek period as his benefits have expired, and he has lost his COBRA \nbenefits, but he needs medication. So he is stuck because we have not \nacted.\n  Nancy, from Portsmouth, is 59 years old. She has been unemployed for \n21 months. She has a bachelor's degree. She has a whole variety of \nindustry certifications. She has a background in sales and marketing. \nShe is a talented woman who has worked all her life. Until she got \nswamped by the tsunami of misery that originated on Wall Street and has \nwashed through all of our States, she was fine. But now, after 15 years \nof working in insurance, she cannot find a job, and she will soon lose \nher unemployment insurance benefits as the Republicans continue to \nblock the extension.\n  So I would urge them to reconsider. I understand the point about the \ndebt and the deficit and the spending. But, to me, that does not have \nan enormous amount of credibility because when President Clinton left \noffice, he left an annual surplus and he left a budget trajectory that \nthe nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said was going to have us \nbe a debt-free nation by 2008, I believe it was--a debt-free nation.\n  On the day George Bush was sworn into office, we were on a trajectory \nto be a debt-free nation during his term. There was even discussion in \neconomic texts about whether that was really a good idea. He solved \nthat; at the end of his term, we were $9 trillion in debt. We were not \ndebt free. He were $9 trillion in debt, and we had this economic \nmeltdown that required government intervention to protect people, and \nthat made it even bigger. But we would have none of this if it had not \nbeen for the Republican debt orgy they went through--fair-weather debt, \nI would add, an orgy of fair-weather debt--and then a huge hole because \nof their theory of governance and their theory of economics that has \nhad to be filled in because of that tsunami of misery. That is why we \nare here. So it is a little late in the game and a little disingenuous \nto hear lectures from that side of the aisle about economic sobriety \nafter that wild spending through those Bush years and the cleanup we \nhave had to do since then. And these guys who are out of work and who \nneed the help--folks such as Ron, Bill, Dan, and Nancy--should not be \npaying the price. We should take care of the people who are out of work \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  I thank Senator Stabenow.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank Senator Whitehouse very much for \nhis passion, his leadership.\n  Just to emphasize what the Senator was talking about on the floor in \nterms of where we have come from, I remember being in the House of \nRepresentatives in 1997, I believe, when we voted to balance the budget \nfor the first time in 30 years under President Clinton. It was tough. \nWe had to make tough decisions, but we did that, and we were on a \ntrajectory so that by the year 2000--when I was elected to the Senate \nin 2001 and came into the Budget Committee--the big debate was what to \ndo with the biggest surplus in the history of the country. We saw that \nbig surplus, during the 8 years of President Bush, go red with red ink, \ndown, down, down, down, so much so that when President Obama came in, \nthe job loss was at about 750,000 jobs a month. We were losing 750,000 \njobs a month. So we went to work and we focused on people in the middle \nclass, on innovation and investing in businesses and creating \nopportunities and so on, and these numbers now, on jobs per month, have \ngone from a negative now up to a positive.\n  The challenge is--we are not done yet--do not stop what we have been \ndoing. This jobs bill on the floor is to get us to a point where those \nnumbers keep going up and up and up, so everybody who wants to work can \nwork. We have turned this around in terms of job loss. The numbers are \ngoing up. But it is not enough. We are not there yet, and too many \npeople are caught in the middle. In fact, even though the numbers are \nbetter and we are moving in the right direction, we still have five \npeople out of work for every one job opening.\n  In a moment, I am going to ask for unanimous consent. I will let my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle know that I will do that in \nabout 5 minutes, to give them a heads-up. But in the meantime, I want \nto read a few letters and then turn things over to another colleague \nfrom Oregon who cares passionately about this.\n  I want to share with you what have been literally thousands of e-\nmails and phone calls we have been getting from people in Michigan. I \ngo home every weekend, and I am constantly talking to people who find \nthemselves in very tough situations--people who have never been out of \na job before in their lives, never, and now they are in their fifties \nand trying to figure out what they are going to do, and they find \nthemselves in a situation where they are having to depend upon \nunemployment benefits, which is the last thing they have ever wanted.\n  Judith from Taylor:\n\n       Both my husband and I have been unemployed for over a year \n     now. We have been trying desperately to find work and haven't \n     even gotten call backs for jobs we have applied for. It has \n     been frightening and discouraging but we keep trying.\n       Because of our situation, we have been forced to sell our \n     home and we will be closing this month, at a considerable \n     loss!\n\n  That is the other piece of this. It is not just about a job. The next \nthing is you lose your house, and then the ripple effect goes from \nthere.\n\n       The bank we have our equity with has refused to settle and \n     has told us they reserve the right to come after us for the \n     balance. We will be having to break into our retirement funds \n     again with penalty. On top of all this, our youngest son, \n     Nathaniel, is a combat medic with the 101st Airborne and \n     will be one of the 30,000 that are being deployed to \n     Afghanistan. Needless to say, my husband and I are on \n     overload!! Please help the unemployed workers in Michigan \n     by extending the emergency funds. PLEASE don't leave so \n     many people literally out in the cold.\n\n  That is what is happening. That is what is happening right now by \nthese efforts to block, to say no. We have come to the floor multiple \ntimes on individual bills to extend unemployment, plus the two times \nnow we have voted to stop filibusters on the jobs bill. All we get from \nthe other side is no, no, no. As my friend from Rhode Island said, when \nwe get to the estate tax, it will be yes, yes, yes. And it will not \nmatter where the funds come from, if they add to the deficit--oh, no, \nnot for the few hundred people in our country who are the wealthiest.\n  When somebody is out of work, that is something different. When \nsomebody is out of work, we have a set of rules that say: No, this is \nnot an emergency. We have always said it is an emergency, with \nemergency funding. This is not an emergency? Well, I tell you what, \nwhen 15 million people are out of work, I would consider that an \nemergency. That is as much of an emergency as a flood, a hurricane, \nanything else we have seen in this country. Tens of millions of people \nout of work is an economic emergency and deserves emergency status here \nin this body.\n\n[[Page S5249]]\n\n  Let me share one other story before asking unanimous consent. Michele \nfrom Suttons Bay:\n\n       I am a 50-year-old journeyman carpentry foreman who was \n     laid off by a small construction company in December 2008 \n     after 10-plus years with them. I have been looking for a \n     full-time job ever since. I went through the state's \n     retraining program last summer and am now a BPI certified \n     energy efficiency auditor. But I can't afford to buy the \n     equipment to start my own business. And no companies are \n     hiring energy efficiency auditors right now. I have been \n     looking for any kind of work that allows us to pay the \n     mortgage and our other very basic bills.\n       My wife has a full-time job in retail. We have two sons--\n     one is 16, and the other is 12. We have been surviving with \n     the aid of my unemployment [insurance]. I have already gone \n     through the state unemployment benefits, and I am now in the \n     second period of [the] federal . . . program.\n       Please don't forget about us.\n\n  Well, that is what this is about this evening. That is what the \nlegislation is about that we are focused on. That is what all of our \nefforts are focused on--jobs, creating good-paying jobs, partnering \nwith business, manufacturers, small businesses, creating the atmosphere \nfor private sector jobs, and remembering the people who, through no \nfault of their own, cannot find work today.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3520\n\n  So, Mr. President, on behalf of the close to 1 million people right \nnow who have lost their jobs and are now losing their unemployment \nbenefits, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of S. 3520, the Unemployment Extension Act of \n2010; that the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table with no intervening action or debate; \nand that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the Record.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I offered an \namendment a week ago during the debate on the extenders legislation \nthat is still on the floor of the Senate that would have paid for all \nthe things the Senator from Michigan would like to see paid for, and we \nhave things we need to do, such as unemployment insurance, an extension \nof that. We need to deal with the issue of these expiring tax \nprovisions.\n  What we would do is simply say we start paying for things around \nhere. So I offered an amendment that would do that. It was defeated \nhere in the Senate. But at 8:15, I intend to come back here and offer \nthat again as an alternative because I think probably everybody in the \nSenate agrees we need to address the concern of people who are \nunemployed in this economy, but we should do it in a way that is \nfiscally responsible. That is what my amendment will do. So, Mr. \nPresident, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, before I yield to my friend from Oregon, \nlet me say the question before us is whether we take dollars from a \njobs bill, from a Recovery Act, where we are creating jobs right now, \nwhich is what has been proposed over and over--that we basically take \nit out of one pocket and put it in the other. We want to make sure we \nare creating jobs and allowing the recovery--or what has been called \nthe stimulus--to be able to work to do that, and it is beginning to do \nthat. So taking dollars out of that pocket, which is what has been \nproposed by the other side of the aisle in order to be able to address \nunemployment benefits, doesn't make sense.\n\n  I would state one more time: We have always viewed the extension of \nunemployment benefits in times of economic hardship to be an emergency, \njust like any other emergency in this country. Our colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle are refusing to acknowledge that this is an \nemergency. It is an emergency. When over 15 million people are out of \nwork, it is an emergency, and we should do as we have done under every \nRepublican and every Democratic President. We have called it an \nemergency. We should continue to call it an emergency, and we should \nallow those benefits to continue.\n  I now yield 5 minutes to my colleague from Oregon.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, we have a chance on the floor of this \nChamber to come and debate issues that are important to the success of \nour families across this Nation. There are some who will come to this \nfloor and they will argue that we should do everything possible to help \nthe most successful; that we should do everything possible to help the \nmost powerful; we should do everything possible to help the wealthiest, \nthose who already have secured the American dream. They have it in \ntheir hands.\n  I come tonight to argue a different case: that we should put our \nenergy behind helping the working families of this Nation, families who \nare struggling in an economy where jobs have been disappearing left and \nright; where families are looking for work but there are multiple \napplicants for each and every job; where someone may be clinging to a \njob and then losing it when another firm goes under.\n  I am delighted we have arrested the slide into another Great \nDepression. We didn't know a year ago whether we were going to see \nevery single month a 1-percent increase in unemployment until we were \nat 25 percent unemployment or 30 percent unemployment. So we did what \nwe could to break that cycle, and it has been broken. But we remain at \na very high level of unemployment--10 percent plus, on average, across \nthis country and much higher in my home State of Oregon. I have Crook \nCounty in eastern Oregon, central Oregon, 17 percent unemployment; \nHarney County, nearly 16 percent unemployment; Deschutes County, 15 \npercent unemployment; Josephine, 14.5, and so forth.\n  Folks are struggling. I have been hearing a lot of stories from \npeople back home, and I thought I would share a couple of those stories \ntonight to put a face on the challenge.\n\n       Dear Jeff: I have worked for 42 years and will lose my \n     unemployment benefits after 6 months without your help. I \n     have 3 girls in college and unemployment benefits are helping \n     to keep us current on basic needs. We need your help in the \n     Senate. This is our only lifeline. Please convince your \n     fellow Senators to do the right thing for everyday families \n     and not throw us under the bus.\n\n  That is Mike from Happy Valley. When Mike is saying ``don't throw us \nunder the bus,'' he is saying don't spend our time and energy helping \nthe already successful, the wealthy and the powerful; strengthen the \nfinancial foundations of our working families.\n  Before us tonight is a key measure in that, which is the extension of \nunemployment benefits for families who are working, doing everything \nright.\n  Let me share another story.\n\n       Dear Senator Merkley: I have now been without unemployment \n     benefits since May 16. I have been unable to buy food, gas, \n     or pay bills. My son is home from college for the summer and \n     I can't provide for him, either. There are essentially no \n     jobs in Central Oregon. I apply daily. I would go to work \n     tomorrow given the opportunity. Thank you.\n\n  That is Donald writing to me from Redmond. He has been without the \nability to buy food, gas, or pay bills since May 16. Extension of \nunemployment benefits is a very real method to help families when we \nare in times of great economic duress.\n  It is intriguing to me that my colleagues across the aisle want to \ntake away from the job creation efforts to pay for help for those who \nare unemployed. In other words, they want to create more unemployed in \norder to pay unemployment benefits.\n  Let's step back and realize that it is the policies of my colleagues \nacross the aisle that created this economic crisis. They deregulated \nWall Street. They allowed the leverage of major financial firms to \ndouble in a single year. Bear Stearns went from 20 to 1 leverage to 40 \nto 1 leverage in a single year. They allowed retail mortgages to become \na form of scam upon working families with prepayment penalties and \nsteering payments, which is a very polite term for payments that are \nmade to brokers so they will sell a mortgage that is wrong for the \nfamily but which creates a big bonus for themselves.\n  They allowed the corruption of the most important financial document \nthat is central to building the financial foundations of our families. \nThey allowed Wall Street to put those into securities and poison all of \nthe financial foundations of the firms that bought those securities.\n  All this built a house of cards that came down, and now they want to \ntake away from job creation as a way of saying: well, we do care about \npeople who are unemployed. We are just going to create more unemployed \nin the process. The logic of that escapes me.\n\n[[Page S5250]]\n\n  Kate from Covallis writes to me:\n\n       I am 62 years old and was laid off my job a year ago last \n     March.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's 5 minutes has expired.\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Thank you, Mr. President. It is an honor to come and say \nwe need to do right by working families in America, and we need to not \ndo it by creating more unemployment.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I wish to again thank my friend from \nOregon who consistently has come to the Senate floor to fight for jobs \nand to fight for people who are looking for work. I thank him very much \nfor sharing those stories.\n  I now wish to turn to Senator Bernie Sanders who has been another \nchampion in this fight.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the Senator for all she is doing for the \nunemployed in this country.\n  I wish to briefly quote from an e-newsletter we sent out from our \noffice which is sanders.senate.gov, and this is what the newsletter \nsaid recently in discussing the unemployment situation in Vermont:\n\n       Adrian Keyser is one of more than 200 people who applied \n     for eight licensed nursing assistant positions at \n     Burlington's Fletcher Allen Health Care earlier this month. \n     She has been unemployed since November.\n\n  Eight jobs, 200 people applying for those jobs. This is what she \nsays:\n\n       I have been desperately seeking work. Just so many people \n     are looking for jobs. It's very frustrating. It kind of gets \n     on your self-esteem because you are trying so hard and \n     nothing comes through. I know a lot of people that are out of \n     jobs right now.\n       As Congress debates whether to extend benefits for the \n     seriously and long-term unemployed, an estimated 23,000 \n     Vermonters were jobless in April. Of those, 6,600, or 29 \n     percent, were unemployed for 6 months or longer, according to \n     preliminary data from the Vermont Labor Department.\n       Thousands of Vermonters who are looking for full-time jobs \n     are only working part-time. The Labor Department estimates \n     24,100 are working part time, largely because jobs aren't \n     available.\n\n  By the way, the recession has not hit Vermont as badly as it has hit \nmany other States, but we have just heard of a situation where eight \njobs were being offered, and 200 people were lining up for those jobs.\n\n  I wish to make a point about the priorities of many of my Republican \nfriends, which I don't quite understand. When Senator Stabenow, a \nmoment ago, asked for unanimous consent so that we can provide the \ndesperately needed unemployment compensation for almost 1 million \nworkers out there, there was an objection. The objection was, well, we \nhave to pay for that. We have a large deficit.\n  I understand we have a large deficit and that we have a large \nnational debt, but what I don't understand is that when it comes to tax \nbreaks for billionaires, my word, we don't have to pay for that.\n  My understanding is that every member of the Republican caucus \nwithout exception voted to repeal completely the estate tax. That would \ncost the government over $1 trillion over a 10-year period--$1 trillion \nover a 10-year period--and how was that going to be paid for? Oh, it \nwasn't going to be paid for--but not to worry.\n  What Senator Stabenow is talking about now is 1 million workers who \nare in desperate need of help in order to put food on the table, in \norder to put gas in the car so they can look for work. On the other \nhand, when you repeal the estate tax, you are not talking about 1 \nmillion unemployed workers, you are talking about the top three-tenths \nof 1 percent of our population, people who are millionaires and \nbillionaires.\n  Our Republican friends say: Oh, it is OK. We can give them $1 \ntrillion in tax breaks. We don't have to worry about how we pay for \nthat.\n  Actually, within a couple of weeks there is going to be another \nversion of providing huge tax breaks for the wealthiest people in this \ncountry as another form of repealing the estate tax coming before the \nCongress. I wonder how much concern our Republican friends will have \nwhen that bill comes to the floor about how we are going to pay for \nthat.\n  Right now, interestingly enough, there is no estate tax. For the \nfirst time since 1916, you could be a multibillionaire and your family \nwill not have to pay any taxes when you die. Last month, it turned out \nthat the wealthiest person in Houston, TX, a gentleman named Dan \nDuncan, became the first multibillionaire to pass along his entire \nestate, estimated to be worth $9 billion, to his family without paying \nany Federal estate taxes.\n  Now, I don't know, I may have missed it, but what that family would \nhave been paying in Federal taxes is probably between $3 billion or $4 \nbillion. That is a lot of money. That can provide a lot of unemployment \ncompensation to workers who have lost their jobs and are living in \ndesperation. Maybe my friend from Michigan, Senator Stabenow, can \ncorrect me, but I don't recall hearing any of my Republican friends \ncoming to the floor and saying: Oh, my word.\n  We have a huge deficit problem. Yet right now billionaire families \nare not paying any taxes at all for the estate tax--the first time \nsince 1916. I don't know. Did my friend from Michigan hear any great \nlaments about that crisis? No. But when it comes to unemployed workers: \nOh, my word, we have to pay for that.\n  The last point I wish to make is I get a little bit tired of being \nlectured by our Republican friends for the deficit we are in. Let's go \nover how we got to the deficit--or a good part of the deficit--right \nnow. I voted against going to the war in Iraq. Most, or all, of my \nRepublican friends voted for it. That war will cost approximately $3 \ntrillion by the time the last veteran gets the benefits he or she is \nentitled to. They voted for it, but they forgot to tell us how they \nwould pay for it.\n  During the Bush era, our Republican friends pushed for hundreds of \nbillions of dollars in tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans. They \nvoted for it; I didn't. The point is, please don't lecture us on the \ndeficit that you largely caused.\n  With that, I yield the remainder of my time.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend from Vermont for his \npassion. I now yield 5 minutes to the distinguished Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Reed, who is a true leader on this issue. He has been \ncoming to the floor and standing up for working men and women. It is a \npleasure always to work with him on this issue.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. President, I am proud to be here with Senator Stabenow who is \nleading this effort to remind all of us of our obligations to the most \nvulnerable Americans--those who have lost their work in this economic \ncrisis, who are looking desperately for work. They have to maintain \ntheir families in this very difficult time. Traditionally, we always \noffer extended unemployment benefits, but memories are too short around \nhere.\n  Let me take my colleagues back a few years to March of 2002 when the \nunemployment rate was 5.7 percent and we authorized extended \nunemployment benefits for 2 years and 1 month. I can't recall any great \nbattles month to month about extending the benefits. I can't recall the \n``perils of Pauline'' episodes where, as soon as we finish the 30-day \nextension, we have to literally begin the debate on the next one \nbecause we understand there will be five or six or seven procedural \ndelays built in to prevent us from doing that.\n  Today, we are looking at, in my home State of Rhode Island, 12.3 \npercent unemployment. That is the official numbers. The unofficial \nnumbers are much higher because the underemployment rate--people who \nare working part time, working odd jobs just to get by--adds \nsignificantly more people to the under- and unemployed rolls. We have \nnever in this country declined to extend unemployment benefits as long \nas the unemployment rate was at least 7.4 percent nationally. Today, \nthat rate is about 9.7 percent. We are more than two percentage points \nabove what is traditionally--going back to the Eisenhower \nadministration--the standard of when we can sort of release and \ndispense with extended unemployment benefits.\n  By any proportion, we are in the midst of a very serious economic \ncrisis. What we have done routinely is extend unemployment benefits. \nYet, we have had fierce opposition. Even in those times when we have \nbeen able to extend them, it has been after numerous procedural votes. \nThat was not the situation in other administrations--Eisenhower, Nixon, \nKennedy, Clinton administration, and the most recent Bush \nadministration.\n\n[[Page S5251]]\n\n  The reason, as my colleague from Vermont so passionately and \neloquently pointed out, was we have to get hold of the deficit. Well, \nwe are the people who got hold of the deficit. I can recall being a \nrather junior Member of the House of Representatives and voting for \nPresident Clinton's proposal, with not one Republican vote in the House \nor the Senate. Yet, that policy, together with the monetary policy of \nthe Federal Reserve, resulted several years later in a budget surplus. \nThen President George Walker Bush walked into Washington with a $236 \nbillion budget surplus. But it weighed heavy. President Bush felt that \nhe had to move that money out as quick as possible through significant \ntax cuts, which benefited the wealthiest Americans. Part of that tax \nbill was the estate tax, which has been dispensed with this year--a tax \non the books since 1916.\n  All of that dissipated, undercut the surplus, and now we are in a \nsignificant deficit. Add the cost of the war in Iraq and other \noperations, and the cost of the Part D Medicare entitlement program \nthat left many seniors without coverage--unpaid for, but a huge boon to \nthe drug industry--all of that was on their watch. Now, suddenly, they \nare deficit hawks again. It doesn't ring true to people out there who \nare desperately looking for work and need something to support them.\n  There is also a very pernicious sort of argument that is made--\nsometimes between the lines and sometimes explicitly--that people want \nto be on unemployment because they are doing much better, and they are \ninherently lazy and they want to collect that money. In Rhode Island, \nunemployment benefits are about $360 a week, or about $15,000 a year. \nThat doesn't buy much in terms of gasoline, in terms of food for your \nfamily; and it doesn't take care of those bills, such as a health care \nbill that comes up, or tuition, if you are trying to send your children \nto school.\n  One of the phenomenons today of this economic crisis is that it is \nnot just affecting young workers entering the workforce, or transient \nworkers, those who have a record of working and being laid off; this is \nhitting at people in their forties and fifties, who have had good, \nhard, high-paying jobs, relatively speaking, who have a mortgage and \nare trying to send children to college. That, unfortunately, is the \nface too often of unemployment today in the United States. Those people \nwant to live on $360 a week, and they don't want to work? I think that \nis nonsense. We have to extend unemployment benefits. We always have in \nthe past, and we have to do it now.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I yield 5 minutes to the senior Senator \nfrom New York, and I thank him for his passionate leadership on behalf \nof our country.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Mr. President, I compliment my friend and colleague, \nSenator Stabenow from Michigan, not only for putting this together but \nfor being a clarion voice to the American people. She is one of those--\nand it is sometimes all too rare here--who talks through all the miasma \nand the fog, and all the barriers, directly to the average American. \nThat is a rare talent and one that she shows repeatedly. I thank her \nfor that.\n  I want to follow up on something my colleague from Rhode Island just \nmentioned, Senator Reed, which is this idea that people don't want to \nwork, and if we extend their unemployment benefits, we are going to \ndevelop a lazy class of people.\n  Let me tell you my experience. It is not that the rate of \nunemployment is the highest it has been since World War II, although it \nis far too high. That dubious honor goes to 1982, when it was 10.8 \npercent in that recession. The difference with this recession is that \npeople are employed for a much longer period of time and, second, it \ngoes way up into the middle class and upper middle class--people who \nhave worked hard their whole lives.\n  When I go around my State, I often meet with the unemployed. I make a \nspecial effort to sit down and talk to them. I want to share a story or \ntwo, in case anybody is unconvinced of the anguish they go through and \ntheir desire to find work.\n  I met a woman upstate named Dorothy, from the Rochester area. She was \nabout 50, not married and spent her whole life in her company. It was \nher life. She had risen to be the third highest person in the human \nresources department at Xerox, which had a big plant over in Webster. \nShe lost her job in May of 2008. My guess is--she never said how much \nshe made--it was probably between $80,000 and $100,000 a year--a nice \nsalary. She told me that every day--I met her January 2010, or \napproximately then--she went online to look for another job--day after \nday after day. She still had not gotten a job. It was very poignant \nwhen she told me, with tears in her eyes, almost dripping down her \ncheeks--she said that the first thing she did when she woke up \nChristmas morning was not go to church or to visit her family but, \nrather, she went online for 2 hours, in the hope that there might be a \njob that had been posted the night before, Christmas Eve, and no one \nelse would be going online and looking for the job then and she could \nget first dibs. Is this a lady who is in the habit of laziness, of \nwishing to get $350 or $400 a week in unemployment benefits? Absolutely \nnot. She is looking every day.\n  I met a man named Clay. Unlike Dorothy, he was a blue collar worker. \nHe had six children. His wife didn't work. He is the only breadwinner \nin the family. The children were ages 2 to 14. He had ridden to the top \nof his trade in the machine tools area. He lost his job in the summer \nof 2008. He said that here is what he does every week: Sunday night, he \ngets in his car and drives to Virginia, looks for a job in Virginia on \nMonday. Tuesday, he goes to the Washington area. Wednesday, he goes to \nBaltimore. Thursday, he goes to Philadelphia. Friday, he goes to New \nYork City. And late Friday night, he drives home. Then he starts the \nprocess again on Sunday night. He still cannot find work. He is \ndesperate for work. He told me that now his children keep asking about \nthe family's livelihood, because he is the breadwinner.\n  Are we going to cut Clay and his family off? Are we going to tell \nthose children to go on welfare? This is a proud man and a proud \nfamily. To cut off benefits will affect 67,000 people in New York \nState; 60,000 will lose their benefits and another 6,000 to 7,000 will \nbe prevented from moving to tiers. It is wrong. It doesn't look at the \nproblem as is and is virtually inhumane and not part of the great \ntradition we have established in this country. I hope we will be able \nto pass this bill. I hope people such as Dorothy and Clay will not be \ncut off as they desperately look for work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank my friend from New York for \nthose very stirring words about the families he talked with. I think \nall of us can relate to that, as he was talking about someone from New \nYork each day going to a different city and State to look for work.\n  I go back home every weekend. I go home Fridays and come back on \nMondays. I am very frequently now on a plane with somebody who is \ncoming to work in DC--or to look for work--from Michigan. Every week \nthey are going back and forth. People are willing to get on planes to \nfind jobs and to work. People are getting on planes now from Michigan \nand going across the country. I have talked to people who go from one \nend of the country to another on an airplane because they want to work. \nPeople want to work.\n  The idea that somehow we should treat this economic recession \ndifferently than any other recession in the history of our country--\ndifferent than any other Republican President or any other Democratic \nPresident, any other Republican Congress or any other Democratic \nCongress, by somehow saying we are not going to categorize it as an \nemergency--which it is--to make that change, which is what we are \ntalking about here on our side with our colleagues--to make that \nchange, to allow that to happen would be to say to these individuals \nthat we do not understand what is happening in their lives.\n  I want to take the final couple of moments of my time, before \nyielding to colleagues, to read a couple more letters. One is from \nSusan from Grand Rapids, who writes:\n\n       My husband has been out of work since September of 2009. \n     His benefits will expire\n\n[[Page S5252]]\n\n     soon. He has worked all his life, since he was 13 and he had \n     a paper route. He is a veteran. We are 60 years old now. He \n     applies for jobs every [single] day. He has a Bachelor of \n     Science Degree and has worked for the past 20 years in the \n     construction industry. He has had one interview. One. Out of \n     hundreds of jobs he has applied for, not just in Michigan but \n     all over the [country]. Please help us by extending the \n     Federal unemployment benefit. I am frightened that we will \n     lose our house. Sixty year old people should not have to be \n     frightened of becoming homeless [in this country]. This is \n     something you can do right now for hundreds of thousands of \n     desperate people. Not a fix for future but helping the people \n     that are struggling right now.\n\n  That is what this is about. Tonight, we can fix this by getting \nunanimous consent to do what every other White House and Congress has \ndone--to declare that this is an emergency and fund this as an \nemergency, as we have done year after year after year in this country, \ngiven what is happening to millions of people in this country.\n  We care about the deficit. Some of us have voted to eliminate the \ndeficit, as we voted for balanced budgets and put ourselves into a \nsituation of economic prosperity under the Clinton administration, \nbefore it was wiped out in the last administration with deficit \nspending. But in caring about deficits, it is important to emphasize \nthat we will never get out of deficit with over 15 million people out \nof work or 20 million or whatever the real number is. We will never get \nout of deficit with that many people not working and contributing. We \nwill never get out of deficit, which is why we focus on jobs.\n\n  We have a jobs bill in front of us. So far not one Republican \ncolleague--not one--has voted with us on this jobs bill to create jobs, \nto invest to create capital for manufacturers and small businesses, to \ninvest in innovation and, yes, to help those who are currently without \na job through no fault of their own. So far not one Republican \ncolleague has been willing to join with us.\n  We are desperately concerned about the almost 1 million Americans who \nlost their jobs and now are losing their unemployment benefits. We are \nsimply saying it is time to extend those benefits and to understand \nwhat is happening to people all over this country who have worked hard \nand played by the rules and find themselves in a situation where the \nworld is just tumbling down around them--just tumbling down around \nthem--no matter how hard they are looking and trying to find work.\n  Claudia from Commerce Township:\n\n       I worked hard all my life and this is the first time I have \n     ever had to accept unemployment benefits to help me get by. \n     Believe me, I do not want to be in this situation . . . I \n     would like nothing more than to be working again. I was laid \n     off in January of 2009 from a company that lost multiple \n     contracts with the automotive manufacturers and fell on hard \n     times.\n\n  A lot of folks in Michigan are in this story.\n\n       I have a great deal of experience in my field of expertise \n     (Human Resources) and I hold a bachelor's degree. I have been \n     looking for a job for the past year. At times, I have been \n     encouraged by success in assessment testing and interviews \n     I've completed, but I always seem to lose out in the end. I \n     have taken classes to brush up on my job search skills and \n     believe I do well with my resume and in interviews. I even \n     enrolled and paid for a course to assist me in getting an HR \n     certification to make me more marketable. However, I am 56, \n     and the fact is that in this economy--\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. If I may have 30 more seconds to complete the sentence.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. STABENOW. She said:\n\n       I am 56 . . . and employers are opting for the person with \n     a master's degree--or frankly, someone younger . . . I am a \n     hard worker, intelligent, efficient, trustworthy, honest, \n     dependable and upbeat.\n\n  Mr. President, these are the folks we are talking about and for whom \nwe are fighting this evening.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Tennessee is recognized.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I have listened very carefully to my \ngood friend from Michigan. It is puzzling to me to hear her say what \nshe said because she voted against the amendment by Senator Thune last \nweek which would have extended the expiring unemployment provisions \nuntil November and not added a penny to the debt. I want to say more \nabout that in a minute.\n  What we are arguing about, what the debate is about is we want to \nextend unemployment insurance. We want to make sure the State and local \ntax deductions continue. We want to make sure tuition deduction and the \nvarious disaster relief credits and the research and development tax \ncredits all stay in place. But we want to make sure it is done without \nadding to a Federal debt that we believe is out of control.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3347\n\n  Mr. President, before I speak about that issue, I wish to make a \nrequest which I hope is a request to which my colleagues could all \nagree. It is a bipartisan request on behalf of myself, Senator Nelson \nof Nebraska, and Senator Vitter of Louisiana to extend the Flood \nInsurance Program in Tennessee.\n  The largest natural disaster since President Obama took office is the \nflood of 2010 in Tennessee and a very severe flood in Rhode Island too.\n  On June 1, the Flood Insurance Program expired. This request I am \nabout to make would permit that to be reinstated so small \nbusinesspeople could get flood insurance and get their loans. I will \nspeak more about it in just a minute.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of Calendar No. 372, S. 3347, a bill that \nextends the National Flood Insurance Program through December 31, 2010; \nthat the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. I certainly understand the concern about this \nparticular program. This is something I support, and it is, in fact, in \nthe broader jobs bill we have. Hopefully, within the next 2 days, we \nwill get another vote to complete this along with unemployment \nbenefits.\n  Given the fact that we are still in a situation where we have almost \n1 million people whose unemployment benefits are running out and that \nis not included in this request, I have to object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I am deeply disappointed. What I have \ndone is ask to extend the Flood Insurance Program so that Tennesseans \nwho are recovering from the worst natural disaster since President \nObama took office could qualify for flood insurance so they could get \ntheir loans so they could operate their businesses again.\n  This does not add a penny to the debt. The money is there; the \nauthority to do it is not. If you are in Rhode Island, if you are in \nTennessee, if you are in New Orleans, if you are in any other place \nwhere you are waiting for flood insurance, you should know that \nRepublicans just asked to extend the Flood Insurance Program so you \ncould buy insurance, and Democrats just objected.\n  That is a very simple request. It does not add a penny to the debt. \nIt is deeply disturbing to me this cannot be done in a simple way.\n  Tennesseans have not been looting and complaining despite the fact \nthe flood of 2010, as I said, was the largest natural disaster since \nPresident Obama took office. Nashville alone had $2 billion of damage, \nmaybe more than that. There were 45 counties the President eventually \ndeclared disaster areas. He declared other counties as disaster areas \nbecause of agricultural crops that were washed out. Thousands of homes \nin Nashville alone--people lost everything in their basements. That \nmeans their heating and cooling and all of that equipment. But in many \nplaces, in Bellevue, in Nashville, in Millington outside of Memphis, in \nClarksville, TN, they lost much more than that. Twenty-nine people lost \ntheir lives in this flood--29 people. This was a huge natural disaster.\n  The President did not ask for extra funds for Tennessee. No one is \ncomplaining about that either. FEMA has done a good job with what it \nhas done, but what good does it do for FEMA to be on the site and \navailable, for small business loans to be available, and for flood \ninsurance money to be available, and for Congress to object to a \nunanimous consent request to allow new policies to be written?\n\n[[Page S5253]]\n\n  I am deeply disappointed. Let me address a couple of other things I \nheard said on the floor of the Senate tonight.\n  I heard some talk about jobs. From our point of view, the American \npeople are concerned about jobs, debt, and terror. That is why the \nferment in the country. That is why the people think the country is \nheaded in the wrong direction. Jobs, debt, and terror. We have 10-\npercent unemployment. If we continue to grow at the rate we grew in the \nfirst quarter, we will be at 10-percent unemployment in the last \nquarter of this year. Jobs, debt, and terror.\n\n  Why do we have fewer jobs? Why do we have 10-percent unemployment? \nThe distinguished Senator from Michigan talks about Republican actions, \nbut I am thinking about what the Democrats have been doing the last \nyear and a half. Every step they seem to take talks about jobs but \ncauses us to have fewer jobs. For example, take the health care law \nwhich was passed in this Chamber by a purely partisan vote. The health \ncare law taxes job creators and investors. That means fewer jobs.\n  The financial regulation bill that is being debated today, passing in \na partisan way, puts higher tax rates on small business owners. Higher \ntax rates on small business owners means fewer jobs.\n  The debt is going up. That is the real argument we are having. We \nreached $13 trillion. There are various ways to describe what has \nhappened, but one way to describe it is this: All the Presidents from \nGeorge Washington to George W. Bush ran up a debt of about $5.8 \ntrillion. President Obama, in his two terms--if he has two terms--is \ngoing to double that debt all by himself. That is what his budgets say. \nDoubling the debt in 5 years and nearly tripling the debt in 10 years \nmeans less credit, higher interest rates, less capital, and fewer jobs.\n  The financial regulation bill I just discussed--one can watch it \nbeing dealt with during the day on television. If one listens carefully \nto what is being said, it amounts to a Washington takeover of Main \nStreet credit; another big Washington agency telling banks and credit \nunions, automobile retailers, and dentists what to do about credit.\n  What is the inevitable result? They are going to shrink away from \nproviding that credit. It is going to be harder to get a loan, harder \nto get credit, so this financial regulation bill, which was supposed to \nbe tough on Wall Street, is going to be hard on Main Street because it \nmeans fewer jobs.\n  When it comes to jobs, the difference between our friends on the \nother side and the Republicans on this side is that we are focused on \ncreating an environment for growing private sector jobs. They are \nfocused on creating more government jobs. About the only place the job \ncreation plans and stimulus plans they have enacted are working are in \nWashington, DC, where incomes are up and jobs are up. But not in the \nsmall towns of Tennessee and not in the small towns across this \ncountry, people are out of work. They are out of work because of higher \ntaxes, higher debt, higher spending, too many Washington takeovers, too \nmuch focus on more government jobs, and not enough focus on an \nenvironment in which to create more private sector jobs.\n  I mentioned a little earlier there was talk earlier about the \nunemployment provisions we want to be extended. Senator Thune will be \nhere in a few minutes to talk about his amendment he offered last week \non June 17.\n  Let's be very clear. The Thune amendment, which every Republican \nvoted for and attracted a Democratic vote but Democrats voted it down, \nwould have extended the expiring employment provisions until November. \nIt would have extended for 1 year dozens of tax provisions. It would \nhave extended the State and local tax deduction, the tuition deduction, \nthe various disaster relief credits, the flood insurance provision that \nwas just objected to. It would increase the payment the government \nmakes to doctors for treating Medicare patients.\n  The American Medical Association said a little earlier this week that \n30 percent of doctors, family physicians, will not see new Medicare \npatients. This would have taken care of that.\n  I see the Senator from South Dakota on the Senate floor, and I am \nsure he will speak more to that when he has the opportunity.\n  In my concluding remarks, let me say one word about debt and \nspending. Our policies, the policies of this Congress and this \ngovernment, are shortchanging our children. The Democrats' runaway \nspending and debt is a serious crisis ruining the future of our \nchildren. That is why we do not want to pass even an unemployment \ncompensation bill that adds to the debt. We want to pass it, but we \nwant to make sure it does not add to the debt.\n  Why do I say it piles up a debt on our children? In January of 2009--\nif you divide the national debt across each child under 18, in January \nof 2009 each child's debt was $85,000. By June of 2010, it was \n$114,000. By January of 2017, it will be $196,000. Because of budgets--\nand these are the budgets proposed by a Democratic President--during \nthe next 7 years, each child's share of the national debt will more \nthan double, going from $85,000 to $196,000.\n  Here is another way to think about it. All the Presidents combined \nfrom George Washington to George W. Bush took 232 years to build up a \n$5.8 trillion debt. President Obama's budgets will double that debt in \n5 years and triple it in 10. What that means is all 43 Presidents \ncombined, from George Washington to George Bush, ran up a $5.8 trillion \ndebt in 232 years. In 8 years, President Obama will add twice that much \nto the national debt, tripling the debt.\n  We on this side of the aisle and a growing number of Democrats, I am \nsure, and I know across this country a growing number of Americans are \nsaying this national debt is a serious crisis. So we are grateful to \nthe Senator from South Dakota and to others who recognize the real \nneeds of this country, whether it is unemployment compensation, whether \nit is flood insurance, or whether it is important for doctors to be \nproperly paid, reimbursed for dealing with Medicare payments. We can \nafford that in this country, but we need to pay for it. We need to do \nit without adding to the debt.\n  So I am deeply disappointed that Democratic Senators have objected \ntonight to providing flood insurance to Nashvillians and other \nTennesseans who need it. The money is here; the authority is not. It \ncould have been given tonight. We could have passed it. Tennesseans \naren't looting or complaining; they are helping each other and cleaning \nup. This is an unfortunate slap in the face to Americans who are \nhelping themselves get out of trouble, and I regret that it happened.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4853\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4853; that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the text of the Thune amendment 4376 be \ninserted; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time and passed, \nand the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object, Mr. President, my \ncolleague's proposal takes money out of job creation to pay for helping \npeople who are out of work. One of the provisions in his proposal would \ntake $37.5 billion away from creating jobs in order to create help for \nthe unemployed and then create more people who are unemployed. So I \nregret to say I will have to object to this request.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, I would like to speak to the amendment I \njust proffered to the other side which was objected to.\n  I think there is a consensus in the Senate that we need to fix some \nof these problems we are facing, one of which is the expiration of \nunemployment insurance for people who are unemployed. There are a lot \nof tax provisions that are expiring that need to be extended, things \nsuch as the research and development tax credit, which is critical to \ninnovation and competitiveness in this country, and a whole range of \nother tax credits which affect a broad range of our economy.\n  Also, I believe it is important that we provide some certainty to \npeople who depend upon Federal policy, and one of those groups would be \nthe physicians in this country who rely upon\n\n[[Page S5254]]\n\nMedicare reimbursements for much of their survival because they treat \nso many Medicare patients. Much of the patient base for many of the \nphysicians in my area of the country, where we have a high elderly \npopulation, is Medicare. Obviously, physicians have been facing--up \nuntil last week--a 21-percent cut. That was addressed for 6 months, so \nwe have fixed that. We have dealt with it for 6 months. Obviously, that \nis an issue that will come up again. What my amendment would have done \nwas to solve that issue not just for the next 6 months but to the end \nof the year 2012. So physicians in this country would have gotten an \nadditional 2 years of relief, so to speak, with regard to their \nreimbursement.\n  So I would suggest that inasmuch as these are all things we agree \nneed to be done, the real basic disagreement here revolves around how \ndo we do that.\n  What the other side has put forward is a series of proposals, \nstarting with the first one, that had $70 billion in tax increases and \nalmost $80 billion added to the Federal debt. The last proposal that \nwas put forward by the Democratic majority had $50 billion in tax \nincreases and $55 billion added to the Federal debt. We hope that this \nweek we are going to see that slim down even further, and I would \nsuggest we are making progress in the right direction. But I think it \nis still fair to say these things need to be paid for.\n  As many of my colleagues have pointed out, we have $13 trillion in \ndebt that we owe. That includes debt that is owed between governmental \nagencies--we call that intergovernmental debt--as well as debt held by \nthe public. If you can find it, the debt held just by the public is \nabout $8.6 trillion. But remember, we are talking about trillions and \ntrillions of dollars.\n  As my colleague from Tennessee just pointed out, it took 43 \nPresidents 232 years to get to $5.8 trillion. The amount of debt we \ncompiled and accumulated between 1776 and 2008--232 years of American \nhistory--was $5.8 trillion. Now, under this President's budget, we will \nequal that amount in the next 5 years and double it in 10. In other \nwords, we will double the Federal debt today in 5 years and triple it \nin 10. That is an astounding number. If you think about all of American \nhistory up until the year 2008--232 years and 43 Presidents to get to \n$5.8 trillion--we are going to double that amount in 5 years and triple \nit in 10. Staggering.\n  Under this new administration, we have already racked up enormous \namounts of new debt because we added $1 trillion to the debt to pay for \na stimulus bill which has not shown any evidence of job creation other \nthan jobs that have been created here in Washington, DC, at the Federal \nGovernment level. I think you could argue that Washington's economy has \nbenefited because we have created some government jobs, most of which \nare temporary census jobs. But if you look at the overall job \nstatistics, we have lost somewhere in the neighborhood of 3 million \njobs since the passage of the stimulus bill.\n  We passed health care expansion, which was sold as health care reform \nbut, frankly, does little to reform health care and certainly doesn't \ndo anything consequential to reduce health care costs. I think most \nAmericans now realize, as insurance premiums continue to go up and as \nthe Actuary and the Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Tax \nCommittee all attest to the fact, we are going to see the cost curve \nbend up, not down, as a result of the passage of health care reform. \nThis is a $2\\1/2\\ trillion expansion over a 10-year period, when it is \nfully implemented.\n  That is a massive new entitlement program on top of the entitlement \nprograms that are already bearing down on us and leading us toward a \nsituation where, in a very few years if we don't take some serious \nsteps, this country is going to be bankrupt. We are going to be belly-\nup. It is as simple as that. You cannot continue to sustain trillion-\ndollar deficits year after year after year, which is what we are facing \nfor the foreseeable and long-term future, and expect that we are not \ngoing to completely drive this country into the ditch.\n  So the amendment I offer pays for things. It says: Let's change the \nway we do things around here. Let's quit handing the bill to our \nchildren and grandchildren. Let's quit putting it on the credit card \nand saying to the next generation: You pay this.\n  There is certainly nothing wrong with the things the other side is \ntrying to accomplish. As I said, I think there is consensus about \naddressing these serious needs in our economy right now. But the \ndifference of opinion exists here about, how do you do that? We are \nsimply saying: Let's pay for things. Let's start doing something \ndifferent here in Washington. Let's do what the American family has to \ndo, what the American small businesses have to do. Let's pay for \nthings, for crying out loud. That is what my amendment would do. It \nwould say: Here are some ways we can shave some savings and we can cut \nspending here in Washington, DC, and do all these things we think we \nought to do without adding to the debt and without raising taxes in the \nprocess.\n  A few months back, here in the Senate, we passed legislation which \nwas labeled as historic and passed to great fanfare. It was called pay-\ngo legislation, and it created pay-go rules that suggested that from \nnow on we are going to start paying for things. What has happened since \nthe passage of pay-go? The Senate has approved, if you count the not-\npaid-for portions of the bill that is on the floor right now--of \ncourse, that hasn't been approved yet, but assuming it were--nearly \n$200 billion of new debt. From the time we said we are going to start \npaying for things, which was a few short months ago, we have waived the \nvery rules that were going to put us on a path to fiscal responsibility \nand fiscal discipline, declared everything an emergency, and added \nalmost $200 billion to the Federal debt.\n\n  So here we are today debating yet again another measure that will add \nmore to the Federal debt, that will impose taxes on small businesses in \nour economy at a time when they are trying to get some momentum to help \nchurn us out of this recession, get us back to where we are creating \njobs and to a period of economic growth. All we are doing is piling new \ntaxes on them--taxes on investment, taxes on small businesses, and \ntaxes, of course, with the recent passage of the health care bill, \nliterally on everybody because all those tax increases are going to get \npassed on to the American consumer.\n  So where are we? Here is where we are. There are a number of things \nthat can be done that would do what the other side wants to do--to pay \nfor the extension of unemployment benefits. One of those things would \nbe that we could save the necessary amount of money to pay for this \nnow.\n  The cost of extending unemployment benefits in the Democratic \nproposal, by the way, is $33 billion. That is a substantial amount of \nmoney, but there are many ways in which that could be paid for, all of \nwhich were included in my amendment last week, but let me suggest a \ncouple of discrete parts of that amendment that might be stripped out \nand used to pay just for the unemployment insurance.\n  We can pay for the extension of the unemployment benefits by \nreturning unspent stimulus funds, which would save $34.5 billion. So \nthe $33 billion in unemployment benefits that need to be extended to \npeople who have lost jobs in the recession could be paid for by \nreturning unspent stimulus funds to the tune of $34.5 billion. So there \nwould be enough to pay for the unemployment benefits and some left \nover.\n  It could also be paid for through a 5-percent cut to the 2010 \nappropriations and an expansion of the affordability exemption to the \nindividual mandate in the health care reform law, which together would \nsave $33.5 billion. So that would give the $33 billion that would be \nnecessary to pay for the extension of unemployment benefits.\n  Alternatively, it could be paid for with the rescission of other \nunspent Federal funds, which would pay for it by saving $56 billion. So \nyou could take care of the unemployment benefits, you would have $33 \nbillion that is necessary to pay for that and $23 billion left over, \nhopefully to be put toward the Federal debt, which would be the best \nthing we could do for our children and grandchildren.\n  Finally, it could also be paid for with the inclusion in this bill of \nmedical malpractice reform, which was also included in my amendment \nlast week. That would save about $50 billion. So you would have $50 \nbillion to pay for\n\n[[Page S5255]]\n\nthe $33 billion in unemployment benefits and have $17 billion left over \nto put toward the Federal debt, which again would be the best thing we \ncould do for our children and grandchildren.\n  So all these arguments that are made by my Democratic colleagues that \nthese things are Draconian just aren't true. These are commonsense \nthings that would give us the necessary resources to take care of the \nproblem that is in front of us today but do it in a way that doesn't \nadd billions and billions of dollars to the Federal debt, exacerbating \nwhat is already a very serious circumstance facing our children and \ngrandchildren, which the Senator from Tennessee did a very good job of \noutlining. If you are a child under 18 in America today, the amount of \ndebt you own is about $85,000. By the year 2017, that is going to be \n$196,000. So if you are a young person in America today who is under \nthe age of 18, your share of the Federal debt is $85,000. Ten years \nfrom now, that will be $196,000--in fact, less than 10 years from now; \nin the year 2017.\n  I think all that leaves us with a very clear choice when it comes to \nhow we solve problems here in Congress, here in the Senate, and how we \ndeal with the immediate question before us this evening: How do we \nextend unemployment benefits to those who have lost jobs in the \nrecession?\n  The other side has come forward with a proposal, again with billions \nand billions and billions of dollars that are not paid for, and that \ndoes go on the debt and that does get passed on to our children and \ngrandchildren.\n  What we are offering are some commonsense ways, which means the \nCongress and the Federal Government may have to live on a little bit \nless. They are things that would require the Federal Government to go \non a diet, if you will, in the same way the American people are having \nto go on a diet. The American people are being asked, because of this \ntough economy, to make hard choices with regard to their family \nbudgets, with regard to their individual and personal lifestyles, with \nregard to their businesses. Everybody in this country is having to make \ndecisions about cutting back a little bit. We could address this issue \nby just asking the Federal Government to take a little bit of a \nhaircut, put the Federal Government on a little bit of a diet. We can \nachieve the savings necessary to pay for the proposal that is before \nus.\n  Again, as I said, $33 billion fixes the unemployment benefit issue, \nand I have just named four ways that could be paid for, with money left \nover that could be put toward the Federal debts. That is what this is \nabout. That is what the discussion here is. This is very \nstraightforward.\n  My colleagues on the other side have come up here this evening and \nwill continue to offer unanimous consent requests to go ahead and do \nthis but not pay for it, and people on our side are getting up and \nsaying: Wait a minute. No, I object, and here is why. And the reason is \nbecause we believe in a very straightforward way that we ought to start \ndoing what I think the American people expect of us, and that is for us \nto live within our means in the same way they do.\n  Unfortunately, regrettably, today, that is not what is happening here \nin the Congress. Year over year over year, we continue to spend and \nspend and spend and borrow and borrow and borrow like there is no \ntomorrow. Well, the chickens are going to come home to roost. Someday, \nthe bills have to be paid. People where I come from in South Dakota \nunderstand that. There is no free lunch. When you borrow money, it has \nto be paid back. You can't spend money you don't have.\n  Those are all things that are happening here in Washington, DC today. \nWe are spending money we don't have and we are borrowing money we don't \nhave any idea about how we are going to pay it back. All we are simply \ndoing is giving it to the next generation so they will have a bill \nfacing them and a future that will shackle them with debt that they \nwill be dealing with for their lifetimes and probably the lives of \ntheir children and grandchildren as well.\n  By way of illustration, because I think it is important to put things \ninto perspective--sometimes I think it is very difficult to come to \ngrips with what is $1 billion, what is $1 million, what is $1 trillion. \nI tried to break that down, to put it in perspective for myself so I \ncan understand a little better what we are talking about. The numbers, \nthe number of zeros on the end of that number, can be almost mind \nboggling to the average person in this country. Most of us are not used \nto dealing with numbers that are in that ballpark of $1 trillion.\n  What a trillion seconds is--if you took a trillion seconds, what \nwould that translate into, by way of illustration and example--a \ntrillion seconds, if you broke that down into years, would be almost \n31,000 years; 31,746 years is what a trillion second is. If you take $1 \ntrillion and you make a second a dollar and try to put it into terms I \nthink the average American can understand, a trillion seconds \nrepresents 31,746 years.\n  Since most of us here are probably not going to live much more than \n80 years--hopefully if we are lucky, we will live beyond that. Most of \nus here are going to live under 100 years. When you talk about a \ntrillion seconds, which in the last--we have seen about 15 seconds pass \nhere, and you add that up to a trillion, that is 31,746 years. Think \nabout what $1 trillion represents, how much that is, the scale, the \ndimension we are talking about and what we are doing to future \ngenerations of Americans if we do not start taking the steps that are \nnecessary to pay the bills around here.\n  This amendment I offered and that was objected to by the other side \nwould have done that. It would have fixed the physician fee issue, not \njust until November of this year but for another 2 years beyond that, \nto the end of the year 2012. It would have addressed the issue of the \nexpiring tax provisions which we are all concerned about. It is an \nimportant tax policy that needs to be extended that has expired and \nneeds to be addressed. Also, as I said earlier, there is of course the \nissue before us this evening of unemployment benefits which, at a cost \nof $33 billion, could easily be offset by any of a number of things I \nsuggested this evening.\n  I see my colleague from Utah has arrived on the floor. I know he too \nhas an amendment he wishes to offer that I think makes a lot of sense. \nWhen it comes to creating jobs, he is someone with a small business \nbackground and understands what job creation is about and I understand \nhe will have a request he will make of our colleagues on the other side \nas well, so at this point I yield the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from South Dakota \nfor the comments he has made and appreciate the time he put into this \neffort.\n  We are talking about jobs. That is the issue. The House bill, H.R. \n4853, has to do with taxes that would supposedly increase the number of \njobs. In that atmosphere, I wish to revisit the Main Street \nRevitalization Act of 2010 which I offered some time ago, which has to \ndo with small business and tax activities with respect to small \nbusinesses.\n  Let me remind the Senate that small businesses are the economic \nengine of our economy. Historically, small businesses have been \nresponsible for all of the net new job creation in the United States. \nAt times when large businesses downsize, small businesses grow. Many \ntimes, small businesses are created by people who have lost their jobs \nwith the large business and, in an effort to find someplace to find \nwork, they create businesses of their own. I have had that experience. \nI have lost my job and said, somewhat facetiously but with more \naccuracy, I had to start my own business because nobody else would hire \nme. Many of the businesses I started or was involved with failed, but \nenough of them succeeded that we were able to create jobs, not only for \nme but for all of the other people who were involved with me.\n  When I was the CEO of a business that started out with four--I was \nthe fifth employee hired--we took it ultimately to the New York Stock \nExchange and hired 4,000 people. This was a demonstration of what could \nhappen with small businesses. With that business I was able to overcome \nall of the financial losses that occurred in the businesses I started \nthat didn't work.\n  As I pointed out before, we did that during what the New York Times \nhas called the decade of greed, because that was the period when Ronald \nReagan was President and the top marginal tax\n\n[[Page S5256]]\n\nrate was 28 percent. I understand the impact of a tax rate at 28 \npercent because we financed that business with internally generated \nfunds. Yes, we had a line at the bank but we didn't sell stock--because \nI am not sure anybody would have bought it. We got to keep 72 cents out \nof every dollar we earned during the decade of greed. That is what \nallowed us to go from 4 jobs to 4,000 jobs over about that 10-year \nperiod.\n  Today the top marginal rate, when you add the additions that have \nbeen made with respect to the Medicare taxes, is over 40 percent, a \nvery significant increase from the 28 percent we had during the time \nthe New York Times was so scandalized by the fact that small businesses \nwere not taxed enough. I can tell you they are not only taxed enough \nnow, they are taxed too much. This recession has hit small businesses \nparticularly hard.\n  One of the problems dealing with the challenge of creating a small \nbusiness as you try to get capital is not just the higher tax rate but \na lack of certainty in the capital marketplace. Unfortunately, this \nlack of certainty has been exacerbated by some of the activities of \nthis administration.\n  My bill, the Main Street Revitalization Act, tries to address these \nissues and make a circumstance where a business can have a degree of \ncertainty with respect to their tax position and an opportunity to grow \nthe business in an atmosphere that will move a little closer to that \natmosphere with which I was so familiar during the Reagan years. There \nare three targeted tax breaks in my bill that I wish to talk about in \ndetail.\n  The first one provides a 10-year net operating loss carryback \nprovision for qualifying businesses whose average gross incomes are $5 \nmillion or less. One of the things you learn when you start a small \nbusiness is that the only thing slightly better, but still bad, for a \nsmall business is earning a profit. The worst thing, of course, is a \nloss. But as soon as you earn a profit the tax man shows up and says \n``I want mine.'' I want my 28 percent, if you are in the Reagan years. \nI want my 42 percent now in the Obama years.\n  But I haven't got the cash, you say, if you are running a small \nbusiness. I can't pay the taxes. That money I have shown on a profit \nand loss statement is tied up in inventory and accounts receivable.\n  No, says the tax man, I want it now and I want it in cash.\n  If you have a net operating loss carryback, you can say let me go \nback and take those years in which we were not earning a profit and \napply them, average them in with this time when we have started to earn \na profit and thereby avoid paying that tax at this crucial time when I \nneed the cash to grow the business. That is the first thing. We provide \na 10-year net operating loss carryback provision for qualifying \nbusinesses. It is only, as I say, for businesses with average gross \nincome less than $5 million--genuinely a small business.\n  No. 2, the bill expands the definition of section 179 expensing to \ninclude structural changes to the physical property and it makes the \ncurrent $250,000 deduction limit permanent. Again, you are starting the \nbusiness. You have earned some money. You have had to put that money \ninto a physical improvement on your property. But the tax man says I \nwant it in cash. You can't do it, you can't make the business grow \nwithout investing it in your property. We expand the definition of this \nexpensing so that you get a tax advantage there.\n\n  No. 3, there is, under current law, a startup cost deduction of \n$5,000. That is fine but it is not enough in today's world to make a \ndifference for a business to survive. My bill would increase the \ncurrent startup cost deduction from $5,000 to $20,000. This would \nencourage entrepreneurs to invest now rather than wait for the economy \nto improve. This says we will exempt this amount up to $20,000. It will \nproduce a significant increase in the number of small businesses.\n  Nationally there are 5 million to 6 million small businesses that \nwould qualify and benefit from this bill. In Utah we have done the \nexamination. It would be about 70,000 small businesses. If the 70,000 \nsmall businesses that would benefit from this would each hire one \nadditional person, that is 70,000 more jobs in the State of Utah. If \nthey were to hire two additional persons, that would be 140,000 new \njobs, which is more than the national increase in hiring that occurred \nlast month. It is not a big deal, one employee per business, if we \nadopt this bill. It would be a very big deal for the impact on the \neconomy as a whole.\n  Because it is for only businesses with revenues of $5 million or \nless, we can be sure this is not going to be something that big \nbusiness is going to take advantage of. We can be sure that all of the \nconcern about bailout of large corporations--it does not apply; my bill \nwould not make any impact at all on that end of the economy.\n  I have a small business owner in Utah who wrote me a letter with \nrespect to all of his challenges. Let me share with you some of the \npoints he made in his letter that I think apply. He said:\n\n       I own a small business here in Utah . . . that had employed \n     20 people and now I am down to 4 people, as I cannot get \n     financing.\n       I have put close to $2 million into technology development \n     and we are ready to launch, but we have run out of funds and \n     can't find investor groups . . . willing to take a risk.\n       I would hire 25 to 30 new people if I could receive the \n     funding that I need to launch my product. Banks won't lend, \n     people are holding onto cash . . . and I don't want to \n     violate the SEC rules so raising funds is difficult.\n       I had hoped the government would have made Stimulus funds \n     easier to receive by those businesses that could make a \n     difference in the lives of so many looking for employment.\n       I have a lot of potential business . . . but may need to \n     shut the business down and layoff the rest of the workers, \n     due to lack of funding.\n\n  I believe the tax provisions that are in my bill would make it \npossible, or easier at least, for this particular small businessman to \nfind the funding he needs and to hire those additional people he talks \nabout. His business plan is sound but his financial circumstance is \nvery difficult.\n  What this letter tells me, and my own observation elsewhere, is that \nthe stimulus that was supposed to save our economy has not gotten down \nto small business one bit. This is exactly why I opposed the stimulus \nbill in the first place. Most of it has been spent in public arenas and \nhas not hit the small business world. The Main Street Revitalization \nAct will help enable this company to quickly and efficiently access the \ncapital they need to keep the business running, create new jobs, and \neventually help them grow and expand.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4853\n\n  With that background in mind, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate \nproceed to the immediate consideration of H.R. 4853, that all after the \nenacting clause be stricken and the text of S. 3083 be inserted; that \nthe bill as amended be read a third time and passed, the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I first \ncommend my friend from Utah for speaking about small business. This is \nsomething that we share a very strong passion regarding. In fact, we \nare operating right now under some small business reforms that have \nalready been passed this year and a 5-year net loss operating \ncarryback--not the 10 years my friend has talked about, but we have \nbegun that with 5 years.\n  The section 179 expensing was passed in the jobs bill, which is very \nimportant. I am hopeful we will be able to join together on a \nbipartisan basis when our leaders bring to the floor a small business \nbill that will exempt capital gains for small business, increase the \navailability of loans, and that we might work together on the other \nprovisions that my friend has suggested from his bill.\n  At this point, I will object but look forward to working with him on \nthese very important measures.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BENNETT. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Michigan for her \nspirit of cooperation. I am sorry she is required to object. I must \nconfess, I am not particularly surprised. But I appreciate the \nopportunity to have this discussion and deal with this challenge. If I \nmay close my presentation with, once again, making a comparison between \nwhat happened in the 1980s when we created the business that I \ndescribed and what we are dealing with now.\n\n[[Page S5257]]\n\n  I remember, in a business prior to the one I just talked about that I \nwas running, during the Carter administration, I went to the bank \nbegging--that is the operative word--begging for a loan, without which \nwe could not meet payroll. I was overjoyed when the banker finally \nagreed to give us a loan at 21 percent interest.\n  That was the circumstance through which we were living in those \ntimes. We talk about the Great Depression of the 1930s. I remember, \nvery vividly, the great inflation of the 1970s--21 percent interest so \nthat I could meet payroll. That business, to use Abraham Lincoln's \nwords for his store in New Salem, IL, winked out. We did repay the bank \nloan, but we could not keep the doors open. It was just a few years \nlater that we started the other business during the Reagan \nadministration when the tax circumstances had been changed \ndramatically.\n  The Reagan administration inherited the results of the great \ninflation from the Carter administration, much as the Obama \nadministration has inherited the results of the great housing bubble \nfrom the days of the Bush administration. I will not make any attempt \nto put blame on a partisan basis, but those were the time lines. It was \nthe Carter administration that was there during the time of great \ninflation; it was the Bush administration that was there when the \nhousing bubble burst. So each President had a dilemma thrust upon it.\n  Ronald Reagan approached his economic challenge with tax cuts, and it \nproduced the kind of job creation and ultimate economic growth that we \nare talking about. Reagan was very unpopular in the election that \nfollowed his election for President, and his party lost a considerable \nnumber of seats in that period. But 2 years later, the economy was \nroaring forward on such a strong basis, as a result of the Reagan tax \ncuts, that he was reelected in a landslide.\n  President Obama chose a different economic theory from that which \nRonald Reagan embraced. President Obama followed the advice of the \nKeynesians and instead of trying to have tax policy that would \nstimulate the economy, he went to a spending policy to stimulate the \neconomy.\n  The political pundits are saying President Obama will see losses in \nNovember the same way President Reagan did in the off-term election \nfollowing his Presidential inauguration. My fear is that we will not \nsee the recovery following that because of the Keynesian economics \nembraced by President Obama. My fear is this recovery will continue to \nbe sluggish, and the unemployment rate will stay very close to double \ndigits.\n  There are a lot of people who dismissed Ronald Reagan as something of \nan uneducated, almost simple-minded individual. I would point out \nRonald Reagan was the only President we have ever had whose college \ndegree, from his days in Illinois, was in classical economics, pre-\nKeynesian economics, back in the days when a college degree from any \nkind of college was something of a rarity. He brought that concept of \nclassical economics into the Presidency and saw a reversal and an end \nof the great inflation and set off a period of great prosperity for a \nlong time and is considered one of the pivotal Presidents of the last \ncentury.\n  I disagree with the economic policies of this President. I hope I am \nwrong and that the recession we are now in ends with the same kind of \nsuccess story that Ronald Reagan had. But I am afraid I am right and we \nwill see this recession drag on for a longer period of time.\n  With that little bit of nostalgia, I thank the Senators for their \nindulgence.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5257-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5257-S5258]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            KAGAN NOMINATION\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I just returned from spending a weekend \nin Wyoming talking to many people around the Cowboy State who are \nconcerned about our Nation, concerned about the growing debt, concerned \nabout jobs and the economy, and the concern that Washington has taken \nour eye off the ball.\n  They also have considerable concerns and questions specifically about \nthe nominee to the Supreme Court, Elena Kagan. I heard this when I was \nin Thermopolis, WY; when I was in Sheridan; when I was in Casper.\n  So what I want to do is spend a few minutes discussing and \nquestioning the views on the second amendment of Elena Kagan. The \nsecond amendment in Wyoming, as you know, is nothing we take for \ngranted. It is something we hold very dear. We do not take it for \ngranted because our lives depend upon it.\n  The second amendment allows us to defend ourselves from harm. It also \nputs food on our tables. These are the values and the virtues that make \nthis issue so important to Wyoming. I understand next week Ms. Kagan's \nhearings will begin. It is my hope we will have a clear picture of \nwhere she stands on the right to keep and to bear arms.\n  The window into her views is small. I hope the hearing will open that \nwindow wider for the American people. Her clerkship to Justice Thurgood \nMarshall and the documents connected to her time in the Clinton White \nHouse only crack that window a little bit. I want to hear from her.\n  I want to hear why Ms. Kagan recommended to throw out the Sandidge v. \nthe United States case from the Supreme Court. This is a case that \ninvolved an individual charged with possession of a handgun and \nammunition in the District of Columbia.\n  In a one-paragraph recommendation to Justice Marshall, Ms. Kagan \nwrote:\n\n       The petitioner's sole contention is that the District of \n     Columbia's firearms statutes violate his constitutional right \n     to keep and bear arms.\n\n  She went on to write:\n\n       I am not sympathetic.\n\n  I want to know why she was not sympathetic to Mr. Sandidge. The \nsecond amendment explicitly says:\n\n       A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security \n     of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear \n     arms, shall not be infringed.\n\n  Well, as we know today, the DC gun ban, the law, was clearly \nunconstitutional. The individual right to keep and bear arms has been \naffirmed by the Heller case. Mr. Sandidge's rights were violated. Ms. \nKagan had the opportunity to recommend that the Court hear the case, \nbut she did not recommend it.\n  Was this recommendation a legal opinion or was it a political \nopinion? The second amendment is pretty clear: The right of the people \nto keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.\n  During the Clinton administration, Ms. Kagan served as associate \nWhite House counsel. The role of the White House counsel's office is to \nprovide the President with the best legal advice possible. This is not \na political office.\n  According to a 1996 memorandum released by the Clinton Library, Ms. \nKagan raised concerns that certain organizations would be exempted from \nliability under the Volunteer Protection Act. This legislation was \naimed at providing protections to volunteers, to nonprofit \norganizations and governmental entities in lawsuits based on the \nactivities of volunteers.\n  In a memorandum she wrote, she branded some of these organizations as \n``bad guy orgs.'' I assume that is bad guy organizations. The bad guy \norganizations she was referring to she listed as the Ku Klux Klan and \nthe National Rifle Association. So in her capacity as counsel to the \nPresident, I want to know why she was concerned that the NRA, the \nNational Rifle Association, would be covered in the Volunteer \nProtection Act. I want to know why she grouped a violent racist hate \norganization with the NRA. The NRA, the national organization and \nchapters around the country, is very active in Wyoming. It teaches \nfirearm safety. It advocates for second amendment rights. Again, this \ngets to the question of whether Ms. Kagan is able to separate politics \nfrom policy.\n  We have seen Ms. Kagan's resume. Now we need to hear from her. Next \nweek I look forward to hearing her testimony. I also look forward to \nmeeting with Ms. Kagan to discuss these issues\n\n[[Page S5258]]\n\nand the importance of the second amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. How much time remains on this side?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 15 minutes 13 seconds.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5258-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5258-S5262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BIODIESEL TAX CREDIT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have a unanimous consent request but I \nwill wait until a Member from the other side is here to make it. As a \npredicate to that, I will make a statement on my reason for doing so.\n  As the majority continues to struggle in an attempt to pass another \nmassive deficit spending bill through Congress, biodiesel plants in \nIowa and throughout the country continue to lay off workers because the \nDemocratically controlled Congress has not extended the biodiesel tax \ncredit. This is a simple and noncontroversial tax extension that will \nlikely reinstate 20,000 jobs nationwide and about 2,000 jobs in my \nState of Iowa all by itself. These jobs have fallen victim to a tactic \nused by the Democratic leadership to hold this popular and \nnoncontroversial tax provision hostage to out-of-control deficit \nspending in Washington.\n  This past February, I worked out a bipartisan deal with Chairman \nBaucus to extend the expired tax provision, including the biodiesel tax \ncredit. However, the Senate Democratic leadership decided to put \npartisanship ahead of job security for thousands of workers in the \nbiodiesel industry. I am here again to try to put thousands of workers \nback to work, American workers, in the process of producing a clean and \nrenewable fuel. We already stripped out and passed the so-called doctor \nfix from the larger extenders bill last week. We should do the same \nwith the biodiesel tax credit right now.\n  Also there is a difference between the biodiesel tax credit and the \nother tax provisions in the tax extenders bill. The failure to extend \nthe biodiesel tax credit before it expires has ground the industry to a \nhalt, because biodiesel is now more expensive than gasoline and gas \nstations know they can't sell it. So, of course, naturally, they don't \nbuy it. Therefore, biodiesel producers have stopped producing it \nbecause they have nobody to sell it to. While the other tax provisions \nare important, they are not as time sensitive as biodiesel, because \nthey are not transactional tax incentives like the biodiesel tax credit \nbut instead are based on the taxable year.\n  I am going to reserve my unanimous consent request until the Senator \nfrom Michigan returns. I will go to other remarks I want to make at \nthis point.\n  I see the Senator has returned so I will make my unanimous consent \nrequest at this point.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4853\n\n  I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the immediate \nconsideration of H.R. 4853, that all after the enacting clause be \nstricken and the text of S. 3440, to extend the biodiesel fuel tax \ncredit, be inserted; that the bill, as amended, be read a third time \nand passed and the motion to reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, I thank \nmy colleague for his courtesy in allowing me to return to the Chamber \nand also indicate that this particular provision on biodiesel, which I \nstrongly support, is in the underlying jobs bill. We hope to have this \npassed in a couple of days. We will have another opportunity to vote on \nthis shortly. As a result of that, I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n\n\n                  Unanimous Consent Request--H.R. 4853\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I have a further unanimous consent \nrequest. I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to the \nimmediate consideration of H.R. 4853; that all after the enacting \nclause be stricken and that an amendment at the desk, which is the text \nof S. 3421, be agreed to; that the bill, as amended, be read a third \ntime and passed, and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Ms. STABENOW. Reserving the right to object, I again say to my \ncolleague, we will have an opportunity to address this. We had two \nopportunities last week to address it and did not get the votes. \nHopefully, in the next couple days, we will be able to resolve these \nissues. I object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, may I ask how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 10 minutes.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, this morning we saw yet another replay of a dialog \nbetween some of my friends on the other side and some on my side of the \naisle. It kind of goes like this. Republicans make a proposal to make a \npending Democratic leadership proposal such as the extenders bill \ndeficit neutral. The Democratic leadership marshals the votes and \ndefeats the deficit-neutral proposal on a largely party-line basis. \nAfter the vote, debate ensues. My friends on the other side define the \nproposal that they defeat in an incorrect way. They define it as a \nproposal to carry out the policy of a fiscally responsible manner as \nopposition to the underlying policy in the proposal. Republicans \ncounter that the Republican deficit-neutral proposal carries most, if \nnot all, of the policy contained in the Democratic leadership's \nproposal.\n  When the smoke clears, the true differences between the two sides' \napproaches become very clear. My friends on the other side want to add \nto the deficit to carry out the underlying initiative--be it an \nextension of unemployment benefits or a lot of other things in the \nbill. On this side, we want deficit neutrality at a minimum by rolling \nback future bloated spending. The Democratic leadership wants to keep \nin place the future bloated spending. Tax increases are OK, if they are \noffset. Bring on hundreds of billions of dollars of tax increase, \nwhether they hit individuals, small businesses, or what have you. As an \nexample, the latest tax is due to hit next week. Next Tuesday, July 1, \nusers of tanning bed services will face a new 10-percent tanning bed \nexcise tax. God help us if someone proposes to make the government even \na little bit leaner. That proposal will be met with a brick wall of \nresistance, even if it is a proposal to roll back future unobligated, \nunallocated stimulus spending, which stimulus spending has not \naccomplished what it was intended to accomplish, keeping unemployment \nunder 8 percent.\n  The upshot is this: For my friends in the Democratic leadership, \nkeeping the spending spigot all the way open trumps deficit reduction. \nKeep the spending going, in other words. Worry about our deficit \nsometime down the road. Let our grandchildren worry about it.\n  On the Republican side, we want to trim the spending and save some \ntaxpayers money by managing priorities. That is a worthwhile debate. It \nis an intellectually honest debate. It is the kind of debate that can \ninform fiscal policy judgments. But my friends in the Democratic \nleadership are not content to have the debate on that basis. Instead, \nwe have seen a pattern where they want to change the subject. Instead \nof focusing on the present and the future, my friends on the other side \nwant to revisit the past. In veering away from current choices and \nfuture fiscal consequences, my friends on the other side take the \ndiscussion in a whole different direction. My friends on the other side \nclaim they cannot deal with these problems in a fiscally responsible \nmanner because of Republicans. Republicans only left them with fiscal \nproblems.\n  People watching C-SPAN witnessed this back and forth last Thursday, \nand around lunchtime the Senate voted on Senator Thune's alternative to \nthe Democratic leadership's extender bill. The Thune amendment took the \nexact opposite approach to the Democratic leadership's substitute. It \ncut taxes by $26 billion by extending current law. It cut spending by \nover $100 billion and reduced the deficit by $68 billion. Those are not \nthis Senator's numbers. They come from the nonpartisan Congressional \nBudget Office and the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, the last version of the \nDemocratic leadership's extender substitute would have increased direct \nspending by about $105 billion through the year 2020, and raised \nrevenues by about $50\n\n[[Page S5259]]\n\nbillion over that period, resulting in a net deficit increase of about \n$55 billion. As an aside, last Friday Chairman Baucus and I prevailed \non the leadership to clear the deficit-neutral bill that extended the \nso-called Medicare doctor fix. That action will cut those numbers a \nlittle bit.\n  On the larger bill, however, the contrast could not be clearer. The \nRepublican Conference, along with one member of the Democratic caucus, \nvoted to change the bottom line fiscal effects of the Democratic \nleadership's extender substitute. If Senator Thune had prevailed, his \namendment would have reduced the deficit by $13 billion more than the \namount the Democratic leadership's extender substitute would have added \nto the deficit. The Thune amendment reached this better fiscal result \nby simple common sense of restraining Federal spending. All but one \nMember of the Democratic caucus then in attendance, 57 Senators, voted \nagainst the Thune amendment. One of the Senators who voted for the \nThune amendment came to the Senate floor to highlight the differences \nbetween the Democratic caucus and the Republican Conference in the \napproach to this extenders bill.\n  A Member of the Democratic leadership also made some comments on the \ncurrent fiscal problems. Instead of focusing on the question of whether \nto offset the policy or not, that Member decided to change the subject. \nAs we saw this morning, that Member of the Democratic leadership wanted \nto go back several years and talk about fiscal history.\n  This morning, like last week, there was a lot of revision or perhaps \nediting of the recent budget history. I expect more of it from some on \nthe other side.\n\n  The President signaled as much in an interview with George \nStephanopoulos a few months ago. I agree with the President that there \nis a lot of revisionism in the debate.\n  The revisionist history basically boils down to two conclusions: One, \nthat all of the ``good'' fiscal history of the 1990s was derived from a \npartisan tax increase bill of 1993; and, two, that all of the ``bad'' \nfiscal history of this decade to date is attributable to the bipartisan \ntax relief plans.\n  Not surprisingly, nearly all of the revisionists who spoke generally \noppose tax relief and--do you know what--support tax increases. The \nsame crew generally supports spending increases and opposes spending \ncuts.\n  In the debate so far, many on this side have pointed out some key \nundeniable facts. The stimulus bill passed by the Senate, with interest \nincluded, increases the deficit by over $1 trillion. The stimulus bill \nwas a heavy stew of spending increases and refundable tax credits, \nseasoned with small pieces of tax relief.\n  The bill passed by the Senate had new temporary spending that, if \nmade permanent, will burden future budget deficits by over $2.5 \ntrillion. That is not Senate Republicans adding that up. It is the \nofficial congressional scorekeeper, the Congressional Budget Office, \nnonpartisan as they are. In fact, the deficit effects of the stimulus \nbill passed a year ago March--passed within a short time after the \nDemocrats assumed full control of the Federal Government--roughly \nexceeded the deficit impact of the 8 years of bipartisan tax relief.\n  All of this occurred in an environment where the automatic economic \nstabilizers, thankfully, kicked in to help the most unfortunate in \nAmerica with unemployment insurance, food stamps, and other benefits.\n  That antirecessionary spending, together with lower tax receipts, and \nthe TARP activities, has set a fiscal table of a deficit of $1.4 \ntrillion for the fiscal year that ended several months ago. That is the \nhighest deficit, as a percentage of the economy, in post-World War II \nhistory.\n  It is not a pretty fiscal picture, and it is going to get a lot \nuglier with the budget put forward by the President this year. It is \nthe same result under the budget crafted last year by the Democratic \nleadership.\n  So for the folks who see this bill as an opportunity to ``recover'' \nAmerica with government taking a larger share of the economy over the \nlong term, I say congratulations. America has been recovered with a \nvast expansion of government and the American People have a lot of red \nink to look forward to.\n  Members who voted for the budget and the fiscal policy envisioned in \nit put us on the path to a bigger role for the government. But \nsupporters of that fiscal policy need to own up to the fiscal course \nthey are charting.\n  That is where the revisionist history comes from. From the \nperspective of those on our side, it seems to be a strategy to divert, \nthrough a twisted blame game, from the facts before us. How is the \nhistory revised? Let's take each conclusion one by one.\n  The first conclusion is that all of the ``good'' fiscal history was \nderived from the 1993 tax increase. To test that assertion, all you \nhave to do is take a look at data from the Clinton administration.\n  The much-ballyhooed 1993 partisan tax increase accounts for 13 \npercent of the deficit reduction in the 1990s--13 percent. That 13 \npercent figure was calculated by the Clinton administration's Office of \nManagement and Budget.\n  The biggest source of deficit reduction, 35 percent, came from a \nreduction in defense spending. Of course, that fiscal benefit \noriginated from President Reagan's stare-down of the Communist regime \nin Russia. The same folks on that side who opposed President Reagan's \ndefense buildup take credit for the fiscal benefit of the ``peace \ndividend.''\n  The next biggest source of deficit reduction, 32 percent, came from \nother revenue.\n  Basically, this was the fiscal benefit from pro-growth policies, like \nthe bipartisan capital gains tax cut in 1997, and the freetrade \nagreements President Clinton, with Republican votes, established.\n  The savings from the policies I have pointed out translated to \ninterest savings. Interest savings account for 15 percent of the \ndeficit reduction.\n  Now, for all the chest-thumping about the 1990s, the chest-thumpers, \nwho push for big social spending, didn't bring much to the deficit \nreduction table in the 1990s. Their contribution was 5 percent.\n  What is more, the fiscal revisionist historians in this body tend to \nforget who the players were. They are correct that there was a \nDemocratic President in the White House. But they conveniently forget \nthat Republicans controlled the Congress for the period where the \ndeficit came down and turned to surplus.\n  They tend to forget they fought the principle of a balanced budget \nthat was the centerpiece of Republican fiscal policy.\n  Remember the government shutdown of late 1995, my friends on the \nDemocratic side? Remember what that was about? It was about a plan to \nbalance the budget. We are constantly reminded of the political price \npaid by the other side for the record tax increase they put in the law \nin 1993. Republicans paid a political price for forcing the balanced \nbudget issue in 1996. But, in 1997, President Clinton agreed. Recall as \nwell all through the 1990s what the year-end battles were about.\n  On one side, congressional Democrats and the Clinton administration \npushed for more spending. On the other side, congressional Republicans \nwere pushing for tax relief.\n  In the end, both sides compromised. That is the real fiscal history \nof the 1990s.\n  Let's turn to the other conclusion of the revisionist fiscal \nhistorians. That conclusion is that, in this decade, all fiscal \nproblems are attributable to the widespread tax relief enacted in 2001, \n2003, 2004, and 2006.\n  In 2001, President Bush came into office. He inherited an economy \nthat was careening downhill. Investment started to go flat in 2000. The \ntech-fueled stock market bubble was bursting. After that came the \neconomic shocks of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Add in the corporate \nscandals to that economic environment.\n  And it is true, as fiscal year 2001 came to close, the projected \nsurplus turned to a deficit. But it is wrong to attribute the entire \ndeficit occurring during this period to the bipartisan tax relief. \nAccording to CBO, the bipartisan tax relief is responsible for only 25 \npercent of the deficit change, while 44 percent is attributable to \nhigher spending, and 31 percent is attributable to economic and \ntechnical changes.\n  At just the right time, the 2001 tax relief plan started to kick in. \nAs the\n\n[[Page S5260]]\n\ntax relief hit its full force in 2003, the deficits grew smaller. This \npattern continued up through 2007.\n  If my comments were meant to be partisan shots, I could say this \nfavorable fiscal path from 2003 to 2007 was the only period, aside from \n6 months in 2001, where Republicans controlled the White House and the \nCongress. But, unlike the fiscal history revisionists, I am not trying \nto make any partisan points, I am just trying to get to the fiscal \nfacts.\n  There is also data that compares the tax receipts for 4 years after \nthe much-ballyhooed 1993 tax increase and the 4-year period after the \n2003 tax cuts. I have a chart that tracks those trends.\n  In 1993, the Clinton tax increase brought in more revenue as compared \nto the 2003 tax cut. That trend reversed as both policies moved along.\n  Over the first few years, the extra revenue went up over time \nrelative to the flat line of the 1993 tax increase.\n  So, let's get the fiscal history right.\n  The progrowth tax and trade policies of the 1990s, along with the \n``peace dividend,'' had a lot more to do with the deficit reduction in \nthe 1990s than the 1993 tax increase. In this decade, deficits went \ndown after the tax relief plans were put in full effect.\n  No economist I am aware of would link the bursting of the housing \nbubble with the bipartisan tax relief plans of 2001 and 2003.\n  Likewise, I know of no economic research that concludes that the \nbipartisan tax relief of 2001 and 2003 caused the financial meltdown of \nSeptember and October 2008. I have a chart that shows what the \nPresident inherited from a Democratic Congress and a Republican \nPresident.\n  As I said, from the period of 2003 through 2007, after the bipartisan \ntax relief program was in full effect, the general pattern was this: \nrevenues went up and deficits went down.\n  That is the past. We need to make sure we understand it. But what is \nmost important is the future. People in our States send us here to deal \nwith future policy. They don't send us here to flog one another, like \npartisan cartoon cut-out characters, over past policies. They don't \nsend us here to endlessly point fingers of blame.\n  The substitute before us takes us in the direction of more deficits \nand debt. The Thune amendment, which was rejected by most of the \nDemocratic Caucus, would have put us on a path in the opposite fiscal \ndirection. My friends on the other side fool no one if they pretend \nthat the fiscal choices made by the Democratic leadership and the \nPresident over the last year have nothing to do with this rapidly \nrising debt.\n  President Obama rightly focused us on the future with his eloquence \nduring the campaign. I would like to paraphrase a quote from the \nPresident's nomination acceptance speech: We need a President who can \nface the threats of the future, not grasping at the ideas of the past.\n  President Obama was right.\n  We need a President, and, I would add, Congressmen and Senators who \ncan face the threats of the future. Grasping at ideas of the past or \nplaying the partisan blame game will not deal with the threats to our \nfiscal future.\n  It is not too late to correct the excesses of the stimulus bill or \nthe bloated appropriations bills that will come. The Senate missed an \nopportunity with a partisan rejection of Senator Thune's alternative.\n  We took a small, bipartisan step last Friday. The Senate unanimously \napproved a paid-for Medicare doc fix bill, led by my friend, Chairman \nBaucus. That was the way we need to go.\n  There are more bipartisan fiscally responsible efforts underway. \nSenator McCaskill's and Senator Sessions' amendment, which calls for a \ntimeout on the exponentially rising levels of appropriations spending, \nis a good start. The President called on the Democratic leadership to \ndo something similar.\n  That is what the American people want and need. There is a way to \nreach a real bipartisan compromise. It is right in front of the \nDemocratic leadership. Efforts to change the subject and blame \nRepublican Congresses of many years ago won't answer the questions \nabout what needs to be done now.\n  Efforts to blame every fiscal problem on a Republican President who \nretired a year and a half ago is no answer. It is a strategy that \navoids responsibility for the trillions of new spending that the \nDemocratic leadership and this President have muscled through with \nlarge majorities. It is time to match the power with responsibility. \nThe American People expect no less.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan is recognized.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, it is my understanding that the \nRepublican time has now ended.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Ms. STABENOW. We have 15 minutes to wrap up. Is that my \nunderstanding?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Ms. STABENOW. First, as a courtesy to my colleagues, I will offer a \nunanimous consent request at the beginning of our comments, and this \nrelates to the nearly 1 million people who have lost their jobs who \nhave now lost their unemployment benefits because of the inability to \nmove this forward in terms of extending unemployment benefits through \nthe end of November.\n\n\n                   Unanimous Consent Request--S. 3520\n\n  So, Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the Senate proceed to \nthe immediate consideration of S. 3520, the Unemployment Extension Act \nof 2010, that the bill be read a third time and passed, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table, with no intervening action or \ndebate, and that any statements relating to the bill be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Senator from Wyoming.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, reserving the right to object, the \nRepublicans have offered a bill, and it is fully paid for. We have the \nsame concerns. We think, though, we should not be adding to the debt \nand the deficit. We know the President's budget doubles the national \ndebt in 5 years, triples it in 10. The recommendation here being \noffered is one that would add to the burden of the debt on our children \nand grandchildren.\n  As a result, Mr. President, I do object.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Objection is heard.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I would like to now speak both in \nresponse to some of what my friends on the other side of the aisle have \nsaid and also to talk about why we are here this evening, why we \nstarted this whole discussion this evening.\n  I remember when we, in fact, balanced the budget. We passed a \nbalanced budget under President Clinton. I was against deficits then \nwhen I voted, for the first time in 30 years, to balance the budget. I \nwas against deficits when I supported a different way to go with the \nlargest surpluses created by the policies of President Clinton, when I \nsaid just focusing on the wealthy in this country and tax benefits for \nthe wealthy not only was not fair, but it was going to balloon the \ndeficit; that not paying for two wars was going to balloon the deficit; \nthat not paying for really any major policy during the 8 years of the \nBush administration would balloon the deficit. I was against deficits \nat that time as well, and I am still against deficits.\n  When we talk about what happened in the last 8 years, it is not to go \nback, but it is to learn from what did not work for the American \npeople. One of my friends on the other side of the aisle said they were \nfor private-sector jobs and we were for public-sector jobs. Well, the \nreality is, during the last 8 years, when deficits did not matter--I \nwill never forget the former Vice President saying deficits did not \nmatter. When they were trying to pass their policies that affected the \nwealthiest in the country, at the expense of the middle class, deficits \ndid not matter.\n  But we lost 6 million private-sector jobs during that time--6 million \nmanufacturing jobs--when there was a focus on cheap products instead of \nAmerican jobs. We lost jobs. Well, deficits mattered to me at that time \ntoo, as well as deficits in jobs, which is the main engine of our \neconomy: middle class jobs.\n  Well, it is true. When we came into the majority and President Obama \ncame into office, after that time of losing 750,000 jobs a month, we \ntook a different tack. We did. We said: Do you\n\n[[Page S5261]]\n\nknow what. Instead of focusing on big bailouts for Wall Street, and \nlosing 8 million jobs because of that, or people losing their pensions \nor 401(k)s, we think we ought to have a different set of priorities. We \nthink we ought to focus on the middle class in this country and working \npeople and people who spend all their lives playing by the rules who \nare saying: What about us?\n  So we did something different. We put in an investment jobs plan that \nour colleagues have spent the last year and a half trying to talk down, \ntrying to make sure it did not work. But we put in place a jobs plan to \nbegin to turn things around. And that 750,000 jobs that were lost a \nmonth that President Obama inherited went down to zero by the end of \nthe year.\n  As shown on this chart, this is where we were on jobs in the Bush \nadministration. If their approach had worked, I would say great. If \npeople in my State had not been hit by an economic tsunami during this \ntime, I would say great. I would be out here promoting it. I would be \npromoting what they are talking about--if it had worked for the \nmajority of Americans. The problem is it did not work.\n  Now, people listening I know get very confused because there are all \nkinds of back and forth and different versions of what happened in \nhistory. I would ask people just to think about their own lives.\n  As shown on this chart, it did not work here, starting in 2002, 2003, \n2004, 2005. I can tell you, in my State, where we lost a million jobs, \nthese policies did not work. So we tried something else, when we \nstarted focusing on people, investing in innovation, partnering with \nmanufacturers--private-sector jobs.\n  Yesterday, I went to a facility groundbreaking for a battery \nmanufacturing plant. We have 16 different battery manufacturing \nfacilities in Michigan now because of the Recovery Act that are \ncreating private-sector jobs. The manufacturing tax credit we put in \nfor alternative energies is creating private-sector jobs. Now, they are \nnot as fast as we want. They are not as fast as we need. But we are \nbeginning to turn this huge economic ship around. The ship that was \ngoing down, down, down--we are beginning to turn it around. We are \nbeginning to turn it around.\n  My colleagues say we should help people who are out of work by taking \nmoney away from this. Let's stop this. Let's take money away from \ncreating jobs to help people out of work.\n  Well, that does not make any sense. What we have said is we want to \ncontinue this. That is why we are saying no to the proposals. That is \nwhy I objected to proposals tonight on the floor that sound great on \nthe surface. They sound great. Well, why not just pay for it? Well, you \nare talking about taking money away from jobs in order to be able to \nput it into something that is desperately needed as well--both are \nneeded--helping people who are out of work.\n  We say no. Keep investing. Keep moving it forward, and at the same \ntime--at the same time--let's help people who are out of work in the \nsame way every President--Republican and Democrat--for decades has \ndone; that is, we call it an emergency. It is an emergency in this \ncountry when over 15 million people are out of work. And the reality \nis, from an economic standpoint, we will never get out of a deficit \nwith over 15 million people not working and contributing to the tax \nbase and contributing to the economy, buying things as consumers. We \nwill never get out of debt.\n  So, yes, we do have a different view. We do. We have a view that \nworked under President Clinton when 22 million jobs were created. We \nhave that same view now, that same view that says we are going to move \nourselves out of this by investing in the middle class of this country, \nworking people. We are going to invest in innovation. We are going to \npartner with our businesses. They are competing with countries around \nthe world right now to create good private-sector jobs.\n  And, yes, to support small business, we have done more in tax \npolicies related to small business, and we intend to do even more than \nI think at any other time I can think of in terms of support for small \nbusiness. All of that is true.\n\n  Mr. President, in order for my colleague from Pennsylvania to speak, \nwill you please tell me when there is 5 minutes left of our time. I do \nnot want to lose the opportunity for the Senator from Pennsylvania to \nbe able to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator has a minute and a half.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Before the 5 minutes?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. That is correct.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I thank you very much.\n  Let me conclude by saying we are moving in the right direction, but \nwe inherited a huge hole. By the way, the folks who created the hole \nwant us to give them more shovels to go back and create another hole, a \ndeeper hole. We are saying, do you know what. Take away the shovels. \nTake them away. We need to fill in the hole, not dig a deeper one.\n  So that is what we have been doing. But here is the reality. It was \nsix people out of work for every one job. Now it is five. OK, it is \nmoving in the right direction. We have a long ways to go. But five \npeople are looking and trying to find every one job. That is what this \ndebate is all about.\n  Millions of people--most of them worked all their lives, never been \nout of work in their entire life and are humiliated at the idea they \nhave to ask for help from anybody--find themselves in a position where \nthey are going to lose their house, they are not going to be able to \ncare for their kids, unless we give them the dignity of temporary help. \nThat is all this is, the dignity of temporary help, and the dignity of \nsaying, yes, this is an emergency; yes, we are not changing the rules \njust for you. We are not going to have a different set of rules for the \nwealthy in this country and separate rules for somebody who is out of \nwork who is 55 years old who has worked all their life.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  Ms. STABENOW. That is what this is about, and it is my great pleasure \ntonight, as we end, and as we continue to fight for these Americans, to \nturn our final 5 minutes over to the Senator from Pennsylvania, who has \nbeen a real champion standing up for working families in this country.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Senator, there are now 4\\1/2\\ minutes.\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, first of all, I commend Senator Stabenow \nfor her words tonight to put in perspective what this debate is all \nabout. It really is a question of jobs--not only creating jobs, as we \nhave been able to do, and still have a long way to go to get out of the \nditch, but also preserving jobs. Also, I commend the Senator for her \nstamina tonight. She has spent a lot of time on the Senate floor.\n  I want to make two points. One is about unemployment insurance and \none is about COBRA premium assistance for health care.\n  First, with regard to unemployment insurance--the debate we are \nhaving on the bill this week and last week, for a number of days now--\none of the real points of contention is what we do about those who are \nout of work through no fault of their own.\n  I can just tell you what it means for Pennsylvania. Here is the \nreality in Pennsylvania--and I will ask consent that the following \ndocument be made a part of the Record: Estimated Exhaustions of All \nAvailable Unemployment Compensation Benefits, calendar year 2010. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent that document be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n[[Page S5262]]\n\n\n\n               ESTIMATED EXHAUSTIONS OF ALL AVAILABLE UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION BENEFITS (UP TO A MAXIMUM OF 99 WEEKS) CALENDAR YEAR 2010\n  [These estimates reflect the total number of individuals in each month projected to exhaust all available state and federal unemployment compensation\n    (UC) benefits under current law--Regular UC, Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC), and High Unemployment Period Extended Benefits (HUP EB).]\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                               YTD\n                                             Through      May        Jun        Jul        Aug        Sep        Oct        Nov        Dec       Annual\n                                              April                                                                                              Total\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nEUC/EB phase-out beginning June 2 \\1\\.....     30,000      5,200    111,000     94,000     65,000     41,000     32,000     25,000     26,000    429,200\nEUC/EB phase-out extended to Dec 31 \\2\\...     30,000      5,200      4,800      5,600      5,900      6,600      9,100      7,300     64,000    138,500\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\\1\\ These projected exhaustions are based on current law, whereby the phase-out of EUC begins on June 2, 2010 (last payable week of EUC is week ending\n  November 6, 2010) and the last payable week of HUP EB is week ending June 5, 2010.\n\\2\\ These projections reflect the estimated number of exhaustions that would occur if the phase-out of EUC and EB was extended to December 31, 2010.\n\n  Mr. CASEY. What this says is if we don't act to extend unemployment \ninsurance, to give people some help, to get from joblessness to a job, \nto get across that long bridge, 111,000 Pennsylvanians will be out of \nunemployment insurance by the end of June. Unfortunately, that number \ngoes up by another 94,000 at the end of July if we do nothing. By the \nend of this year, 429,200 Pennsylvanians will have no unemployment \ninsurance.\n  We have to act on that. It makes all the sense in the world when we \nare recovering--and we are in recovery, thank goodness, but we have a \nway to go--that we give people the opportunity to at least have the \npeace of mind to know they have unemployment insurance.\n  Secondly, with regard to COBRA, if anyone has any doubts as to what \nthis means to real people, I would submit one part of one sentence from \na single Pennsylvanian by the name of Lisa. She sent a letter to me \ntalking about chemotherapy treatments she needs and the COBRA premium \nassistance. She said: ``COBRA benefits have kept me alive.'' That is \nexactly what we are talking about here--about life and death. Why \nshould a family--as they are trying to get a job, trying to find their \nway out of joblessness--why should they have to worry and have the \nadditional nightmare of having no health insurance? We can help so many \nAmericans as we did in the Recovery Act. Two million households across \nthe country were helped by the COBRA premium assistance program in \n2009. In our State, over 107,000 Pennsylvanians had the benefit of \nthat.\n  So as we wrap up this debate about preserving jobs and creating \njobs--and I think in a sense getting a sense of whose side you are on--\nare you going to be on the side of slowing things down and playing \ngames or are you going to be on the side of helping the unemployed get \na job and help them with their family's health care. As we wrap up this \ndebate, it is about saving jobs and preserving jobs and literally, in \nsome cases, saving lives, not only by way of health care but also by \nway of the additional debate we are having on Medicaid and what that \nmeans to vulnerable people as well as what it means to public safety \nand other priorities. We can get this right, but we need to have our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle recognize that this is a high \nstakes game they are engaged in and that the loser here in the end is \nnot going to be some political party. Those who will be left out are \nvery vulnerable people who, in addition, are without a job.\n  With that, I yield the floor to my colleague from Michigan.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 seconds remaining.\n  Ms. STABENOW. On that note, I will simply say again that we are here \nand we will continue to be here fighting on behalf of people who are \ncounting on us to do the right thing. We remember what it is like for \ntoo many families right now whose breadwinner cannot bring home any \nbread because there is no job. We want to remember them and we want to \nhelp them and support them as they are looking for work, as all \nAmericans want to be able to have a job and the dignity of work, and \nthat is what we are fighting for.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5262-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5262]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    TRIBUTE TO FRED ANVIL NEWTON III\n\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary \nwork of Fred Anvil Newton III, who is retiring this week. During his 28 \nyears with the Intergovernmental Program Office, his distinguished \ncareer elevated him to the highest levels of decisionmaking in one of \nour government's most sensitive programs. His work greatly enhanced the \nsafety and security of the United States Senate, staff, and visitors.\n  Mr. Newton dedicated his professional life to mission accomplishment, \nwhile always ensuring that the people he led were well-trained and \ncared for. He managed resources in the most efficient and effective \nmanner possible. Mr. Newton cultivated and maintained partnerships with \nthe U.S. Capitol Police, the offices of the U.S. Senate Sergeant at \nArms and the U.S. House of Representatives Sergeant at Arms. Regarded \nas the dean of the continuity community, he has been at the forefront \nof strategic continuity planning and his innovative approach to problem \nsolving has set the standard for many of today's continuity programs.\n  Mr. Newton has many significant accomplishments including the \noversight, response, and mitigation of the effects of the public \ndisclosure of a very sensitive national strategic continuity asset. He \ndeveloped a new strategy for effective use of private sector assets in \nfulfilling a strategic continuity mission; the result being minimal \ncost to government and maximum flexibility for planners.\n  Mr. Newton provided advice and counsel to national level emergency \nmanagers attempting to mitigate and recover from the effects of a \nbiological warfare attack on the United States Senate. Additionally, \nMr. Newton held a great ability to identify subject matter experts, \nwhich significantly reduced recovery time and expense.\n  During his tenure, Mr. Newton oversaw the acquisition, staffing, and \noperation of multiple relocation assets in support of the strategic \ncontinuity mission. He also advocated and oversaw the development of a \npurpose-built tactical waterborne evacuation asset whose capabilities \nsignificantly enhance the efficient and timely movement of essential \ngovernment personnel from threat zones.\n  He also oversaw a major chemical, biological, radiological and \nexplosives defense effort protecting a highly symbolic national asset. \nThis effort uniquely combines surveillance/identification technologies, \ndefensive measures, and incident management and mitigation capabilities \nto form a standard by which other large-scale protective efforts are \nnow measured.\n  I, along with my colleagues in the Senate, congratulate Fred on his \nwell-deserved retirement. We wish Mr. Newton all the best in his future \nendeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5262-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5262-S5264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        TRIBUTE TO ANDREA ROGERS\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today I honor Andrea Rogers, the CEO and \nfounding executive director of the Flynn Center for the Performing \nArts. I have had the privilege to congratulate Andrea over the years on \nher many accomplishments within the arts community, including her most \nrecent award from the Vermont Arts Council, the Walter Cerf Lifetime \nAchievement in the Arts award. Today, I once again recognize her \ndecades of invaluable service to Vermonters and I wish her future \nsuccess as she retires from her executive director position at the \nFlynn Center for the Performing Arts after 30 years of dedicated \nservice.\n  In 1980, Andrea led a campaign to purchase an old movie house in \ndowntown Burlington, with the hope of turning it into a home for \nperforming arts groups. She was successful, and the old building became \nan independent theatre. Andrea organized many fundraising efforts to \nrestore the antiquated space, and within the next 5 years, the Flynn \nsucceeded in hosting over 350 performances presented by 50 different \norganizations. Today, 30 years\n\n[[Page S5263]]\n\nlater, the Flynn Theatre is known as the Flynn Center for the \nPerforming Arts and is firmly embedded into Chittenden County and \nVermont's cultural landscape.\n  Since its founding, the Flynn has expanded and renovated its space, \nhosted thousands of diverse performances, opened an art gallery and \ncreated many educational programs. Because of Andrea's leadership, the \nFlynn has received several awards across the state, the country, and \neven the world. It was the only organization honored by both the Ford \nFoundation and the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation in 2000. The \nFlynn's educational program has also been recognized by the Dana \nFoundation as one of eight outstanding arts programs in the country, \nand has recently received the Outstanding Historic American Theatre \nAward at a national conference put on by the League of Historic \nAmerican Theatres.\n  I am proud to say that all of these accomplishments happened under \nAndrea's tenure. She is widely recognized for her passion for \nperforming arts and community development, and her dedication has had \nan extraordinary impact on the arts in Vermont. Marcelle and I have \nspent some of our most memorable evenings at the Flynn, and Andrea's \nenthusiasm for her work and for her colleagues will be dearly missed. I \nask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the following \narticle to permanently recognize Andrea's contribution to the State of \nVermont.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                    [From the Burlington Free Press]\n\n                Flynn Center Director Exits, Stage Right\n\n                           (By Sally Pollak)\n\n       A monoprint of a jazz trombone quartet hangs above Andrea \n     Rogers' desk in her office at the Flynn Center for the \n     Performing Arts. The piece is alive with color--golds and \n     purple--and appears at first to be an abstract work. But a \n     second look reveals players, instruments, music stands: art \n     and music in vibrant harmony. ``I love the alive feeling of \n     it,'' Rogers said. ``I have all this artwork, and no place at \n     home to put it.''\n       Rogers has until the end of the month to find wall space in \n     her Burlington house. The last day of June will be the final \n     day of Rogers' tenure as executive director of the Flynn. She \n     will be succeeded by John Killacky, who has been manager of \n     the arts and culture program for the San Francisco \n     Foundation. Rogers, who will turn 70 on July 14, has guided \n     the Flynn since before its creation--when she and other \n     community members recognized potential in a dilapidated Main \n     Street theater being used as a cinema. ``The Flynn was of \n     interest to me--the potential of the theater to serve as a \n     performing-arts center,'' Rogers said. She was intrigued by \n     the idea of preserving a historic building, one whose \n     existence was threatened, and adapting it to community use.\n       ``It's something that I saw that needed to be done. I never \n     dreamed I'd be the director. . . . ``Burlington was my home, \n     and I could see there was a need. If people want something, \n     and there's a reasonable chance that they can come together \n     to make it happen, it can happen. There were many times when \n     I cried, and wondered if we could pull it off. But I went to \n     the public: Every step forward we made, it was because the \n     community was behind us. It was very organic.'' Thirty years \n     after accepting the job she never dreamed of, Rogers is \n     stepping down as the only executive director the Flynn has \n     had.\n       She has both envisioned the nonprofit performing-arts \n     center, and guided its growth: The Flynn has a $6 million \n     endowment, an education department that presents student \n     matinees, offers classes and develops and implements arts \n     curriculums in local schools.\n       The theater presents its own season of shows, commissions \n     work and plays host to artists' residencies. The Flynn's own \n     programming has grown from about three shows a year to 50 to \n     60 annual performances, Rogers said. It serves as a \n     performance space for other organizations, such as the \n     Vermont Symphony Orchestra and Lyric Theatre. The smaller \n     FlynnSpace is a venue for more experimental pieces, where \n     about 40 percent of the shows are Flynn presentations.\n       ``I love the Flynn,'' said Jaime Laredo of Guilford, VSO \n     music director and a violinist and conductor who performs \n     around the world. ``It's one of the most vibrant arts centers \n     anywhere, not just in the state of Vermont. ``It's so amazing \n     what goes on there, the range of things--from symphonies to \n     country music to Broadway shows to recitals to jazz. I don't \n     know many places like that. I think it's fantastic. And I \n     think what Andrea has done is miraculous.''\n       Bob Dylan and Phish played at the Flynn in the 1990s; \n     Mikhail Baryshnikov has performed on its main stage three \n     times; the World Saxophone Quartet blew free jazz on a \n     winter's night in the late '80s. The contemporary dancer/\n     choreographer Bill T. Jones presented his first full version \n     of ``Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised Land,'' \n     outside of New York City, at the Flynn. The major work, co-\n     commissioned by the Flynn and addressing hot-button issues, \n     included workshops with Jones and dozens of community members \n     naked on stage as part of the performance.\n\n\n                           Art and community\n\n       The Jones piece could serve as Exhibit A in what people say \n     is Rogers' most important contribution to Burlington: \n     bringing together art and community, with each step of the \n     building of the Flynn a commitment to that ideal.\n       ``Andrea has allowed her life to be defined by the mission \n     of what the Flynn Center is all about,'' guitarist Paul \n     Asbell said. ``You do it out of love and a sense of mission. \n     It is her vision that has been implemented.'' Asbell knows \n     the Flynn as a performer and an audience member, and he knows \n     Burlington before the Flynn existed.\n       ``The contribution to Burlington is too deep to even count \n     it all,'' Asbell said. ``It's been remarked thousands of \n     times that for the size of the city, it's incredible the type \n     of cultural events and musical events and artistic awareness \n     in Burlington. It's unbelievable what we've grown accustomed \n     to.''\n       Along the way, the Flynn has earned a national reputation \n     among arts organizations and arts funders for its \n     programming, its audience-building and its community \n     engagement.\n       ``To this day, the Flynn stands as model of how to do it \n     right, how to have a strong artistic program and at the same \n     time be a central node for community,'' said Philip Bither, \n     senior curator of performing arts at the Walker Art Center in \n     Minneapolis. He is the former Flynn director of programming/\n     artistic director of the Burlington Discover Jazz Festival.\n       ``We talk about attempting to create cultural commons, \n     places that a diverse range of audiences can gather and \n     celebrate live performing arts,'' Bither said. ``The Flynn is \n     that. It's really a remarkable success story. Andrea has been \n     there from Day 1, and has really had the vision to see how to \n     get to that place.''\n       The audience ranges from wealthy patrons who attend \n     frequent performances to children in Burlington's Old North \n     End. Kids not only attend shows, but also participate in \n     mini-artist workshops: Third-graders at the Integrated Arts \n     Academy recently had a song swap with singers in the African \n     Children's Choir--trading and singing songs together.\n       ``For many children, the only time they walk down Church \n     Street is when they go with their class to the Flynn,'' said \n     Joyce Irvine, principal of IAA.\n\n\n                          Active till her exit\n\n       With retirement three weeks away, Rogers has little time to \n     think about her exit. In fact, pending retirement never \n     looked so active. She tracks jazz festival ticket sales every \n     day, comparing numbers with last year and the year before--an \n     activity that shows Rogers takes nothing for granted, \n     including next season's existence.\n       ``It takes a lot to keep this going,'' Rogers said. ``It's \n     not a shoo-in. We start from scratch every year, raising an \n     operating budget.'' Rogers is immersed in putting together \n     next season's sponsorship, and then comes the budget for \n     fiscal 2011. ``The biggest part of what I do is supporting \n     everybody else,'' Rogers said. She has evening jazz festival \n     events and shows to attend. ``That part never felt like \n     work,'' Rogers said. She notes a particular change that will \n     come with retirement: ``I have to pay now. I'm going to be a \n     good patron.''\n\n\n                         A community organizer\n\n       Rogers came to her work at the Flynn through community \n     organizing. She grew up in New Britain, Conn., and attended \n     college at the University of Michigan, where she studied \n     history, history of art and French. After college, Rogers \n     moved to New York City, where she lived for almost 10 years. \n     She worked for the American Field Service, doing community-\n     service work with teenagers.\n       She moved here in 1970, interested in living in a small \n     city and drawn to Burlington by a beloved great aunt and \n     uncle who lived here, and by her love for skiing and sailing. \n     Soon after arriving, Rogers started working in community-\n     based drug-prevention efforts. The job combined her interests \n     in community organization and working with young people. She \n     liked the community involvement, setting up and organizing \n     systems--but the core issue was not where her true interests \n     lay, Rogers said.\n       After four years working in drug-abuse prevention, Rogers \n     became founding director of the Church Street Center for \n     Community Education, a university-affiliated center that \n     preceded the Firehouse Center for Visual Arts. Her \n     involvement with a community effort, spearheaded by Lyric \n     Theatre, to purchase and renovate the Flynn led to her hiring \n     as its first director. She was writing grants for the project \n     and doing other organizational work when Rogers was asked if \n     she'd open an office, she recalled.\n       ``Well,'' she replied, ``you have to pay me.'' It was only \n     a ``pittance,'' she said, but it was enough to persuade her \n     to devote herself to the Flynn effort. Syndi Zook, executive \n     director of Lyric Theatre, was a Lyric performer when the \n     company endeavored to return the theater--then owned by \n     Merrill Jarvis--to a live performance space. ``We wanted to \n     put on plays,'' Zook said. ``We didn't want to be engaged in \n     the multimillion-dollar campaign that it would take to bring \n     that\n\n[[Page S5264]]\n\n     beautiful building back to its historic stature.'' That was \n     left to the newly created Flynn board, and to Rogers.\n       ``What we were trying to do was save it from the wrecking \n     ball,'' Zook said. ``What Andrea has done is save this \n     beautiful historic landmark that is just a jewel in the \n     center of the city.''\n       During her years at the Flynn, Rogers said her artistic \n     sensibility grew to include an appreciation for contemporary \n     dance. She had always enjoyed music--listening, singing and \n     playing piano--and contemporary art. ``I found the merging of \n     music and movement and abstract ideas to be really eye-\n     opening and exciting,'' Rogers said. ``I came to really \n     appreciate it, and not to feel the need to totally understand \n     it.''\n\n\n                          Courage and ambition\n\n       Ambiguity and complex, challenging works would become part \n     of the Flynn's programming. Although Rogers said she had the \n     authority to manage programming, she chose not to exercise \n     it. This is the purview of artistic director Arnie Malina and \n     Bither, his predecessor.\n       Bither came to the Flynn in 1988 from the Brooklyn Academy \n     of Music, where he curated experimental music and avante-\n     garde jazz. Conversations with Rogers before he was hired \n     indicated the direction she wanted to take the theater. It \n     was not necessarily what one might have predicted, given the \n     Flynn's previous programming, Bither said.\n       ``She said she wanted the kind of new thinking, and \n     sometimes provocative programming,'' Bither said. ``She \n     wanted the freshest, most interesting artists that are \n     happening, not just in New York City but around the world.''\n       The notion that this kind of programming would work in a \n     city the size of Burlington was ``a leap of faith, to say the \n     least,'' Bither said. In those days, management would pin up \n     fliers for Flynn shows on trips to the supermarket, part of \n     the effort to fill the house, Bither recalled.\n       A fund to honor Rogers, Andrea's Legacy Fund, was created \n     by the Flynn board to raise money for programming and \n     education, initiatives the board identified as key to Rogers' \n     tenure. Board chairman Fred ``Chico'' Lager said the goal of \n     raising $1.5 million in cash is nearly met. With deferred \n     donations, Andrea's Legacy Fund totals almost $2 million, he \n     said.\n       ``Andrea is fiercely committed that we not retreat in any \n     way, as is the board,'' Lager said. ``She's leaving us in \n     great shape. The legacy fund will ensure that we will be able \n     to sustain everything that we are doing, and actually \n     continue to grow.''\n       Rogers has her own ideas about her legacy, which she \n     believes is centered on connecting themes: artistic \n     excellence and community involvement. ``You never had one \n     without the other,'' she said. And though events are planned \n     around her retirement, including a free evening of \n     entertainment June 26 at the Flynn, called ``Exit Laughing,'' \n     Rogers has her own ideas about how she'd like to leave: \n     ``Personally,'' she said, ``I would've put a barrel on my \n     head and snuck out the door.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5264-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n            REMEMBERING CHIEF JUSTICE WILLIAM S. RICHARDSON\n\n Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, in Hawaii all beaches are public. It \nis one of the things that makes our State a special place, and it is \ndue to a landmark 1968 ruling by the Hawaii Supreme Court authored by \nChief Justice William S. Richardson. As a military veteran, attorney, \npolitical party leader, elected official, State supreme court justice \nand trustee of Hawaii's largest private landowner, Chief Justice \nRichardson's many contributions helped shape our Nation's youngest \nState. This great man, a dear brother and friend, died yesterday at the \nage of 90.\n  As Chief Justice of the Hawaii Supreme Court from 1966 to 1982, C.J., \nas many of us affectionately knew him, did so much to preserve Hawaii's \nrich culture and heritage. As he explained it:\n\n       Hawaii has a unique legal system, a system of laws that was \n     originally built on an ancient and traditional culture. While \n     that ancient culture had largely been displaced, nevertheless \n     many of the underlying guiding principles remained. During \n     the years after the illegal overthrow of the Hawaiian Kingdom \n     in 1893 and through Hawaii's territorial period, the \n     decisions of our highest court reflected a primarily Western \n     orientation and sensibility that wasn't a comfortable fit \n     with Hawaii's indigenous people and the immigrant population. \n     Thus, we made a conscious effort to look to Hawaiian custom \n     and tradition in deciding our cases--and consistent with \n     Hawaiian practice.\n\n  A self-described ``local boy from Hawaii,'' C.J. graduated from \nRoosevelt High School and the University of Hawaii at Manoa, and \nreceived his law degree from the University of Cincinnati. In World War \nII, he joined the U.S. Army and served as a platoon leader with the 1st \nFilipino Infantry Regiment. He was later inducted into the Infantry \nOfficer Candidate School Hall of Fame. C.J. served as the chairman of \nthe Hawaii Democratic Party and as the State's first Lieutenant \nGovernor of Hawaiian ancestry. Upon retirement from the Hawaii Supreme \nCourt, Chief Justice Richardson served as a trustee of the Kamehameha \nSchools.\n  C.J.'s modest beginnings influenced his future dedication to the \nunderrepresented, minority, and indigenous communities of Hawaii. His \nmixed heritage of native Hawaiian, Chinese, and Caucasian ancestry \nreflected the diverse culture and history of the people. He understood \nthe issues most important to the people and fought hard to ensure that \nthe legal system provided remedies for the most vulnerable populations. \nHe will also be remembered for his work to establish the State's only \nlaw school--The William S. Richardson School of Law. Chief Justice \nRichardson fought vigorously for its creation because he believed \nHawaii students who could not travel to or afford mainland law schools \nshould have an opportunity to study law nevertheless.\n  Chief Justice Richardson was a true son of Hawaii. He lived his life \nin service to others and did so with a warm and kind disposition. We \ncelebrate his life, achievements, and contributions to the State of \nHawaii.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5264-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5264-S5265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EMERADO, NORTH DAKOTA\n\n Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, today, I am pleased to recognize a \ncommunity in North Dakota that is celebrating its 125th anniversary. On \nJuly 10, the residents of Emerado, ND, will gather to celebrate their \ncommunity's founding.\n  When the railroad came to Emerado in 1882, a town began to take shape \non the Hancock homestead. The town site was platted in September 1885 \nby Henry Hancock, originally of Ontario, Canada, and by Lewis Emery, \nJr., from Bradford, PA. The village was named for Emery, owner of one \nof the first bonanza farms in North Dakota, consisting of 4,480 acres \nof land.\n  Among the early businesses were Fred Ludwick and Henry Raymond, \nblacksmith; Plup and Morgans Grocery Store; Emery Hotel, built about \n1882; the Virginia Hotel, built around 1915 by A.A. Hood; Dakota St. \nAnthony Elevator; Farmers Elevator; and Bill Hancock Hardware. The \nfirst post office was established on November 25, 1885, with Edmund \nGale, Jr., serving as the postmaster.\n  The mill was built in the late 1890s by J.R. Cooper. Over time, other \nbusinesses were developed. Among these were the Gritzmacher General \nStore; Seebart Brothers painters and decorators; S.S. Hood General \nMerchandise; William L. Sibell, barber; Charles Emery Ford Car and \nInternational dealer; George Dean Grocery; Fosnes Hardware and \nMachinery; Ralph Bosard, blacksmith; S.S. Grantham Coop Store; Mary \nKelly Cafe; and the ``Blind Pig'' pool hall and barber shop operated by \nNick Hickson.\n  Emerado was a thriving small town until the disastrous events of May \n9, 1928. Ashes cleaned out of a nearby locomotive ignited, leading to a \nfire that razed 24 structures, including the town's church, town hall, \nelevator, several businesses, homes, and barns. The church, elevator, \ntown hall, and one home were soon rebuilt.\n  Emerado is very proud of the Emerado Elementary School, home of the \nBulldogs. Students from kindergarten through eighth grade are \nprivileged to be taught by caring professionals who share the belief \nthat ``each student is the most important person in school.''\n  In honor of the city's 125th anniversary, community leaders have \norganized a parade, carnival games, an all-school reunion, and many \nother fun and exciting events.\n  I ask that my colleagues in the U.S. Senate join me in congratulating \nEmerado, ND, and its residents on their first 125 years and in wishing \nthem well in the future. By honoring Emerado and all other historic \nsmall towns of North Dakota, we keep the great pioneering frontier \nspirit alive for future generations. It is places such as Emerado that \nhave helped shape this country into what it is today, which is why this \nfine community is deserving of our recognition.\n  Emerado has a proud past and a bright future.\n\n[[Page S5265]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5265-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRIBUTE TO HARRIET O'NEILL\n\n Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, on June 20, Texas Supreme Court \nJustice Harriet O'Neill retired after a judicial career of more than 17 \nyears. On behalf of the people of Texas, I would like to take this time \nto recognize her many accomplishments.\n  After graduating with honors from the University of South Carolina \nSchool of Law and practicing for a decade in the field of complex \nbusiness litigation, Justice O'Neill was elected to Texas' 152 District \nCourt in 1992. On that court, her ability to conduct fair and impartial \nhearings was widely-recognized and won her the praise of lawyers on \nboth sides of the civil bar.\n  Less than 3 years later, Justice O'Neill's superior record in the \ndistrict court earned her an appointment and subsequent election to \nTexas' 14 Court of Appeals. As an appeals court judge, she once again \nstood out from the crowd. In the words of her colleague, Judge David \nWest, ``Harriet was considered one of the most reliable judges we had. \n. . She was absolutely flawless.''\n  After earning a 91 percent approval rating from the Houston Bar \nAssociation, the highest on her nine-member court, the people of Texas \nelected Justice O'Neill to the Texas Supreme Court in 1998, where she \nserved with honor ever since. In 2002, and again in 2006, the Texas \nAssociation of Civil Trial and Appellate Specialists named her the \nAppellate Justice of the Year. Even more profoundly, in the case of \nTGS-NOPEC v. Combs, Justice O'Neill broke down a long-term barrier when \nshe became the first woman ever elected to the Texas Supreme Court to \npreside as Chief Justice.\n  As a Judge in the Texas Court System, Justice O'Neill has been a \nmodel for judicial restraint and faithfully interpreting the law, as \nwritten. Her opinions have consistently explained the law and the \njudicial role in a manner accessible to the general public. Clearly, \nshe has provided an example for all judges to follow.\n  Justice O'Neill's service to the State of Texas, however, has \nextended far beyond the courtroom doors. Most admirably, she has been \nan unwavering champion for the legal rights of our society's most \nvulnerable citizens.\n  Since its inception in 2001, Justice O'Neill has been an active \nmember of the Texas Access to Justice Commission. Through her work with \nthis organization, she has helped to develop and implement initiatives \ndesigned to ensure that the court system is available to meet the basic \nlegal needs of low-income Texans. In particular, she was heavily \ninvolved in creating and distributing a self-help Protective Order Kit \nthat enables victims of domestic violence to file their own \napplications for court-ordered protection for themselves and their \nchildren. Because so many of our most important rights depend upon \njudicial enforcement, her efforts have ensured that countless Texans \nwill be able to enjoy the equal justice under the law so central to the \nAmerican dream.\n  Justice O'Neill has also worked to protect Texas' most innocent and \ndisadvantaged citizens through serving as the chairwoman of the \nPermanent Judicial Commission for Children, Youth and Families. After \nspearheading the creation of this commission in 2007, she has worked \ntirelessly to strengthen court practices in the Texas child-protection \nsystem. Thanks to her efforts, Texas' 30,000 abused and neglected \nfoster children can rest assured that they will be able to look forward \nto a better tomorrow.\n  Justice O'Neill's dedication to protecting the vulnerable has also \nbeen recognized at the national level. In 2006, she was appointed by \nAttorney General Alberto Gonzales to serve on the Department of \nJustice's National Advisory Committee on Violence Against Women. In \nthis capacity, she assisted with the implementation of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act and supplied policy advice on programs addressing \ndomestic violence, sexual assault and stalking. Because these crimes \nare so heinous and their victims are so defenseless, Justice O'Neill's \nwork in this area is particularly important and praiseworthy.\n  Although her professional accolades are impressive in their own \nright, Justice O'Neill's personal accomplishments are equally so. While \ndevoting countless hours to serving the people of Texas, she has \nsimultaneously managed to serve as a loving wife to her husband Kerry \nand a dedicated mother to her three children. Despite 17 years of full \ncaseloads, she has found the time to stay actively involved with her \nfamily, including a tenure coaching her daughters' youth basketball \nteams. In this busy day and age, Justice O'Neill has provided all of us \nwith an example of what it truly means to fulfill our duty.\n  While June 20 marked the end of her service on the Texas Supreme \nCourt, I have no doubt that Justice O'Neill will remain active in the \ncauses that she cares so deeply about. On behalf of the people of \nTexas, I thank her for her many contributions. We can only hope that \nher next 17 years will be as remarkable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5265-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO LINDA TYLER\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN.

I also send my \nheartfelt condolences to the families and loved ones of those who lost \ntheir lives.\n  Mr. President, I am also proud that Officer Neal's bravery and \nheroism were recently honored during a ceremony at the Arkansas Game \nand Fish Commission, where he was presented with the Medal of Valor by \nGovernor Mike Beebe. Officer Neal has received recognition from West \nMemphis-area legislators, the city of West Memphis and its police \ndepartment, and by the Crittenden County Quorum Court and sheriff's \noffice.\n  Officer Neal represents the best of Arkansas, and he is more than \ndeserving of these honors.

I am looking forward \nto attending this year's event, which will take place June 24-26 at \nMalvern City Park, complete with live entertainment, a 5K race, a car \nand tractor show, motorcycle show, and awards for best dressed brick, \nbrick toss, brick car derby, and much more.\n  Acme, now the only brick company operating in the Malvern area, \nprovides a display of its product, and every year it manufactures dated \nmini-bricks that are distributed as souvenirs.\n  I salute the entire community of Malvern and Hot Spring County as \nthey celebrate this historic milestone. I commend them for keeping the \nhistory and heritage of their community alive.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5266-1", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5266]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ARKANSAS' NATIONAL HISTORY DAY WINNERS\n\n Mrs. LINCOLN. Mr. President, today I congratulate the Arkansas \nelementary and secondary school students who recently joined students \nfrom across the Nation to participate in the annual Kenneth E. Behring \nNational History Day Contest in Washington, DC. This contest in our \nNation's Capitol is the final stage of a series of National History Day \ncontests throughout the school year at the State and local level.\n  Each year, more than half a million students, encouraged by thousands \nof teachers nationwide, participate in National History Day. Students \nchoose historical topics related to a theme and conduct research \nthrough libraries, archives, museums, oral history interviews and \nhistoric sites. The students then present their work in original \npapers, Web sites, exhibits, performances, and documentaries, which are \nevaluated by professional historians and educators.\n  I commend the commitment to learning so clearly on display from the \nyoung Arkansans who took part in this event. Their hard work and \ndedication represents the best of our State, and I am proud of their \nachievements. By participating in events like National History Day, our \nyoung citizens can develop critical thinking and problem-solving \nskills, along with confidence and self-esteem. These skills will \nprepare them for the future and help keep our State and Nation strong.\n  Arkansas students recognized in the annual Kenneth E.

Mr. President, today I wish to recognize the \nservice of COL Donald E. ``Ed'' Jackson, Jr., as the Commander of the \nLittle Rock District, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, from June 28, 2007, \nto June 15, 2010. Colonel Jackson has been assigned to serve as chief \nof staff of the 8th U.S. Army in Korea where I have no doubt he will go \non to serve our country in a proud and loyal fashion. He has been a \npleasure to work with and I wish him well on his next mission.\n  While Commander of the Little Rock District, Colonel Jackson \ndisplayed excellent leadership for one of the most diverse Army Corps \nof Engineer districts in the United States while managing roughly 730 \nemployees, 13 locks and dams, 12 multipurpose lakes and 7 powerplants. \nColonel Jackson showed exemplary skill in working with stakeholders, \nbuilding relationships, and providing necessary leadership to execute \nthe district's programs.\n  Under his command, the district initiated many major projects \nincluding construction on Ozark Hydro-electric powerplant \nrehabilitation and the landmark White River Minimum Flow Project along \nthe Upper-White River Basin. These were not easy assignments, but under \nhis leadership, Arkansas made significant headway. I also commend him \nfor the critical leadership he provided for his neighboring districts \nto improve quality of service at Corps of Engineers operated \ncampgrounds. And, he did an excellent job of implementing the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act funding for the Little Rock District, \nwhich provided much needed investments in aging infrastructure. He did \nthis while also overseeing the operation and maintenance of the \nMcClellan-Kerr Navigation Channel, which is one of our nation's best \nnavigation systems serving as a critical component of our economy.\n  To go along with his service on energy and water infrastructure \nprojects, he played a critical role in overseeing and executing a $750 \nmillion program of military construction for the Little Rock Air Force \nBase and Pine Bluff Arsenal to improve the quality of life and work for \nour soldiers. Colonel Jackson also developed strong relationships with \nthe Regional Veteran's Administration by assisting with $175 million in \nprojects critical to the healthcare system, and he assumed a new \nmission by managing the world-wide Air Force Medical Command O \nprogram with a $180 million budget.\n  In addition to his skills in managing scheduled operations, Colonel \nJackson exhibited adaptability and care for the people during local and \nregional emergencies in different major events. During record Arkansas \nflooding in the spring of 2008, Colonel Jackson successfully directed \nthe district's management and control of water in the Upper-White River \nBasin to minimize flood related losses. He also deployed to the State \nof Texas to assist in the recovery from Hurricane Ike in Galveston, TX.\n  Colonel Jackson is a proven leader of people and organizations. His \npassion, leadership, and influence have greatly increased the readiness \nand effectiveness of the Little Rock District. I fully believe that he \nhelped shape the district to meet the future needs of the people of \nArkansas. I appreciate his service to the people of Arkansas, and I \nwish him well in his continued service to our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5267-2", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     REMEMBERING CLARENCE WOLF GUTS\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I pay tribute to Clarence Wolf \nGuts, of Wanblee, SD. Clarence passed away on June 16, 2010, at the age \nof 86.\n  The last surviving Oglala Lakota code talker, Clarence Wolf Guts was \nan American hero. Serving in World War II as a Native American code \ntalker, Clarence helped win the war by transmitting critical military \nmessages in his native language, which the Japanese and German \nmilitaries could not translate.\n  Clarence enlisted in the U.S. Army on June 17, 1942, at age 18. One \nof 11 South Dakotan Lakota, Nakota, and Dakota Native American code \ntalkers, Clarence was recruited to help develop a phonetic alphabet \nbased on the Lakota language. This alphabet was eventually used to \ndevelop the Lakota code.\n  Serving as a code talker, Clarence's primary job was transmitting \ncoded messages from a general to his chief of staff in the field. \nCourageous and self-sacrificing, the efforts of Clarence and other code \ntalkers were essential for the Allied victory.\n  Honorably discharged on January 13, 1946, Pfc. Wolf Guts was a man \nwilling and able to serve his country. I have a great deal of respect \nfor Clarence and for the extraordinary contributions Mr. Wolf Guts made \nto our country. The efforts of the Lakota Code Talkers saved the lives \nof many soldiers, and Clarence Wolf Guts was a true American hero.\n  Today I wish to celebrate the life of an extraordinary man. As we \nmourn the loss of this great South Dakotan, I extend my thoughts, \nprayers and best wishes to Clarence's family, friends, and loved \nones.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "22"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2010/06/22/senate-section/article/S5267-3", "month": "06", "year": "2010", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5267-S5268]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXECUTIVE AND OTHER COMMUNICATIONS\n\n  The following communications were laid before the Senate, together \nwith accompanying papers, reports, and documents, and were referred as \nindicated:\n\n       EC-6301.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to improve the \nprocessing of claims for disability compensation filed with the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and for other purposes; to the \nCommittee on Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, as Chairman of the Senate Committee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I introduce the proposed Claims Processing \nImprovement Act of 2010, to focus on enhancements that can be made to \nadjudicate veterans' disability compensation claims in a more timely \nand accurate manner.\n  VA has seen a dramatic rise in the number of claims, driven by a \nnumber of factors, including the aging of the general veteran \npopulation and our prolonged involvement in two overseas conflicts. \nFurther complicating matters, many claims are increasing in complexity, \nas veterans seek service-connection for multiple disabilities and for \ndisabilities that are difficult to diagnose, such as traumatic brain \ninjury and post traumatic stress disorder.\n  Claims adjudication is an intricate process that has seen many \npiecemeal changes in recent years. Unfortunately, these changes have \nyet to produce the results that veterans deserve. My goal, a goal that \nI am sure is widely shared, is to ensure that veterans are provided \naccurate and timely resolution to their claims.\n  This legislation I am introducing today would make several \nimprovements in the claims adjudication process. Provisions in title I \nof the bill would establish a pilot program that would utilize ICD \ncodes to identify disabilities of the musculoskeletal system. Over \nfifty percent of Operations Iraqi and Enduring Freedom veterans that \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs has had some health care contact \nwith have a possible musculoskeletal diagnosis. ICD codes are standard \nmedical condition identification codes used in electronic records that \nhave been adapted by the Secretary of Health and Human Services for \nelectronic transmission of medical data.\n  This proposed pilot program would take place in six to ten regional \noffices and require VA to develop a new method of rating claims, which \nwould consider the frequency, severity, and duration of symptoms of the \ndisability in rating the claim, rather than the current rating schedule \npublished in the Code of Federal Regulations. The current rating \nschedule adds to the complexity of claims adjudication, because many \ndisabilities claimed are not exactly as described in the regulation and \nseveral rating codes may need to be considered. The new rating schedule \nwould focus on the impact of the disability, for example, an inability \nto walk normally, rather than a particular VA rating code \nclassification. All limitations resulting from all disabilities of the \nmusculoskeletal system would be combined to provide one rating, rather \nthan separate ratings for each individual disability. This information \nwould be placed into an organized and searchable electronic record. A \nveteran could elect to not participate in the pilot program. I believe \nthat such an approach will result in fairer, comprehensive ratings for \nthe entire musculoskeletal system.\n  Title II of the bill includes a number of provisions that are \nintended to yield some near-term changes to the claims processing \nsystem and should help reduce the overall time a claim is under \nconsideration by VA. During the last several years, the Committee has \nheld oversight hearings on the claims processing system. Many of the \nprovisions in this legislation were first suggested by veterans service \norganizations and other interested parties in connection with those \nhearings. Others have been recommended by the administration. The \nlegislation I am introducing today serves as a starting point to move \nforward in our effort to improve VA's claims adjudication process.\n  Provisions in title II would allow for VA to issue partial ratings of \nclaims that include multiple issues for those issues that can \nadjudicated expeditiously; give equal deference to private medical \nopinions during the rating process; and clarify that the Secretary is \nrequired to provide notice to claimants of additional information and \nevidence required only when additional evidence is actually required. \nIt would also modify filing periods for notices of disagreement from \none year to 180 days and require a claimant to file a substantive \nappeal within 60 days of the Department issuing a post-Notice of \nDisagreement decision both of these modifications would contain good \ncause exceptions to the filing deadlines.\n  Other provisions in title II would automatically waive the review of \nnew evidence by the agency of original jurisdiction, usually a Regional \nOffice, so that any evidence submitted after the initial decision would \nbe subject to initial review at the Board of Veterans' Appeals unless \nthe claimant or the claimant's representative requests in writing that \nthe agency of original jurisdiction initially review such evidence. \nThis legislation would also replace the Secretary's obligation to \nprovide a Statement of the Case with an obligation to provide a post-\nNotice of Disagreement decision. The post-Notice of Disagreement \ndecision would be in plain language and contain a description of the \nspecific facts in the case that support the decision including, if \napplicable, an assessment as to the credibility of any lay evidence \npertinent to the issue or issues with which disagreement has been \nexpressed; a citation to pertinent laws and regulations that support \nthe decision; the decision on each issue and a summary of the reasons \nwhy the evidence relied upon supports such decision under the specific \nlaws and regulations applied; and the date by which a substantive \nappeal must be filed in order to obtain further review of the decision. \nThe Secretary would also be required to send, with a rating decision, a \nform that if completed and returned, would suffice as a notice of \ndisagreement.\n  This is not a comprehensive recitation of all of the provisions \nwithin this important veterans' legislation but does, I hope, provide \nan overview of the changes encompassed in this bill.\n  Everyone involved realizes that there is no quick fix to solving the \nmyriad issues associated with disability claims processing, but the \nCommittee intends to do everything within its power to improve this \nsituation. To bring optimal change to a system this complicated and \ncritical, we must be deliberative, focused, and open to input from all \nwho are involved in this process.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3517\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 28, United States Code, to prohibit \nrecognition and enforcement of foreign defamation judgments in United \nStates Courts where those judgments undermine the first amendment to \nthe Constitution of the United States, and to provide a cause of action \nfor declaratory judgment relief against a party who has brought a \nsuccessful foreign defamation action whose judgment undermines the \nfirst amendment; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, two years ago the United Nations' Human \nRights Committee observed a problem that ``discourage[d] critical media \nreporting on matters of serious public interest, adversely affect[ed] \nthe ability of scholars and journalists to publish their work,'' and \n``affect[ed] freedom of expression worldwide on matters of valid public \ninterest.'' That problem was ``libel tourism,'' a troubling trend of \nforeign lawsuits that have stifled Americans' First Amendment rights. \nToday, I am introducing legislation to put a stop to this harmful \ntrend.\n  The First Amendment is a cornerstone of American democracy. Freedom \nof speech and the press enable vigorous debate over issues of national \nimportance, and enable an exchange of ideas that shapes our political \nprocess. Authors, reporters and publishers are primary sources of this \ninformation, and their ability to disseminate their writings is \ncritical to our democracy.\n  Over recent years, American authors, reporters and publishers have \nfallen victim to libel lawsuits in countries with significantly weaker \nfree speech protections that what our First Amendment affords. In many \ncases, the foreign plaintiff sought out that country, where there is no \nregard for freedom of the press, so that they could easily prevail. \nThese suits occur regardless of whether the plaintiff or the \npublication has significant connections to the foreign forum. On a \nbroad scale, this results in a race to the bottom, and causes U.S. \npersons to defer to the country with the most chilling and restrictive \nfree speech standard, to determine what they can or cannot write or \npublish. This is libel tourism. As the son of a printer, I consider \nthis a matter of great national importance.\n  Today, I am introducing with Senators Sessions, Specter, Schumer and \nLieberman legislation that will ensure American authors, journalists \nand publishers are shielded from the chilling effects of libel tourism. \nThis legislation guarantees that a foreign defamation judgment cannot \nbe enforced in the United States if that country's libel standards are \ninconsistent with American law. Our legislation also provides American \nvictims of unconstitutional libel suits the opportunity to clear their \nname by filing for a declaratory judgment in an American court.\n  Over the past several years, the problem of libel tourism has grown. \nToday, countries whose weak libel laws impact American authors are no \nlonger confined to a small number. England, Brazil, Australia, \nIndonesia, and Singapore are just a few of the countries whose weak \nlibel protections have attracted libel lawsuits against American \njournalists and authors. This threat to American free speech must end, \nand the time to act is now.\n  New accounts of libel tourism lawsuits emerge every day. This is \nbecause the dissemination of materials through the Internet, as well as \nthe increased number of worldwide newspapers and periodicals, has \ncompounded their threat. The likelihood that a book or story will have \nsome contact with a foreign country is simply that much higher, as is \nthe probability that a foreign court will determine that it has a basis \nfor asserting jurisdiction over an American author or publisher. As we \nheard at a recent Judiciary Committee hearing, this has a dramatic \nchilling effect on Americans' free speech.\n  The impact and extreme nature of these foreign libel lawsuits is best \nunderstood through examples. The most well known is the case of \nAmerican journalist Rachel Ehrenfeld, who wrote a book about the \nfinanciers of the 9/11 attacks. She did not market her book in England \nyet was sued for libel there by a Saudi businessman she linked to \nterrorism. The content of her publication would have been protected \nunder our laws, but a British court applying its laws issued a \nmultimillion dollar default judgment against her. Today, Ms. Ehrenfeld \ncontinues to experience reluctance from American publishers who fear \nthat plaintiffs will target her and bring another libel action against \nanything she writes on the subject of terrorism financing.\n  The scientific community has also been affected by libel tourism. An \narticle last year in New Scientist magazine notes that now \n``Challenging the scientific validity of a product or claim can be \nfraught with danger. . . [because] such challenges are leaving \nscientists and science writers [to] fac[e] an expensive libel action \nbefore the English high court. Many individuals and publications have \nbeen threatened with libel actions, and some have had proceedings \nlaunched against them. Many more writers have had their work edited \nbefore publication to avoid any risk of such legal action.'' \nPublications exposing financial improprieties, consumer protection \nissues, medical malpractice, and sexual abuse have all fallen victim to \nlibel tourism lawsuits around the world.\n  Even Roman Polanski sued Vanity Fair for libel in England. Mr. \nPolanski, a fugitive from justice who fled America after being \nconvicted of sexually abusing a young girl, filed the suit in 2004. He \nhas fought extradition while living in Europe. The Vanity Fair article \nrecounted a story of his alleged aggressive sexual advances made just \nafter his wife was murdered, and portrayed him as being insensitive to \nher death. The article was written in the U.S., edited in the U.S., and \nprimarily sold in the U.S., but the British court claimed jurisdiction, \nand ruled in favor of Mr. Polanski.\n  Foreign libel judgments impact American authors' livelihood, \ncredibility and employment potential. They also have the potential to \nlimit the types of books and articles that talented and reputable \nauthors can get published in the future. But most importantly, their \nsuppression limits the information that Americans have a constitutional \nright to access. Journalists writing about issues of national security \nand safety should not be chilled. These lawsuits are designed to stifle \nthe dissemination of that information in both the United States and the \nworld. Journalists willing to investigate and write about such \nimportant issues deserve protection.\n  I am encouraged that some countries have taken steps to strengthen \ntheir\n\n[[Page S5276]]\n\nlibel protections and jurisdictional requirements in the wake of these \nlawsuits, but that is not enough. As one country tightens its libel \nprotections, another may just emerge as the next-best-available forum \nof choice for libel plaintiffs willing to travel to file suit.\n  I want to thank the ranking member of the Judiciary Committee, \nSenator Sessions, for working with me on this legislation. I also want \nto thank Senators Schumer and Specter, for their support in moving \ntoward a legislative compromise on this important issue. Their bills \nprovided a valuable basis from which the bipartisan compromise that we \nare introducing today emerged.\n  We cannot legislate changes to foreign law that are chilling \nprotected speech in our country. What we can do, however, is ensure \nthat our courts do not become a tool to uphold foreign libel judgments \nthat undermine our First Amendment or due process rights. We can also \nprovide American authors and reporters the ability to clear their name \nin our courts.\n  I hope all Senators will support our bipartisan effort to pass this \nimportant legislation this summer to protect the free speech rights of \nall Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. SNOWE (for herself, Mr. Kohl, and Mr. Lieberman):\n  S. 3519. A bill to stabilize the matching requirement for \nparticipants in the Hollings Manufacturing Partnership Program; to the \nCommittee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, today I am introducing legislation, along \nwith Senators Kohl and Lieberman, to reduce the cost share amount that \nManufacturing Extension Partnership, or MEP, centers face in obtaining \ntheir annual funding. The MEP is a nationwide public-private network of \ncounseling and assistance centers that offer our nation's nearly \n350,000 small and medium manufacturers services and access to resources \nthat enhance growth, improve productivity, and expand capacity. In \nFiscal Year 2009 alone, MEP clients created or retained roughly 53,000 \njobs; provided cost savings in excess of $1.41 billion; and generated \nover $9.1 billion in sales. Similarly, clients of the Maine MEP \nreported saving or retaining 550 jobs, experiencing $8.3 million in \ncost savings, and generating over $78.3 million in sales in 2009. As \nsuch, the MEP's contribution to the health of American manufacturing is \nindisputable.\n  At present, individual MEP centers must raise a full 2/3 of their \nfunding after their fourth year of operation, placing a heavy burden on \nthese centers. The National Institute of Standards and Technology, \nNIST, at the Department of Commerce, in turn, provides one-third of the \ncenters' funding. MEP centers can meet their portion of the cost share \nrequirement through funds from universities, State and local \ngovernments, and other institutions.\n  In today's tumultuous economy, these centers are experiencing \nincreased difficulties finding adequate funding from both private and \npublic sources. As economic concerns weigh down on all of us, states, \norganizations, and groups that traditionally assist MEP centers in \nmeeting this cost share are reluctant to expend the money--or do not \nhave the resources to do so.\n  Our bill, which is a modified version of S. 695 that I and several of \nmy colleagues introduced last March, is simple and straightforward. It \nwould reduce the statutory cost share that MEP centers face to 50 \npercent for fiscal years 2011 through 2013 as a temporary stimulative \nmeasure. Frankly, the Nation's MEP centers are subject to an \nunnecessarily restrictive cost share requirement. And it is \ninequitable, as the MEP is the only initiative out of the 80 programs \nfunded by the Department of Commerce that is subject to a statutory \ncost share of greater than 50 percent. There is no reason for this to \npersist, particularly not during this trying economy when so many \nmanufacturers are trying to remain afloat.\n  Clearly, Congress must act swiftly to bolster our country's \nmanufacturing industry rather than sitting on the sidelines as other \ncountries surpass our nation's economic leadership in a variety of \nareas. Indeed, last Sunday's Financial Times included an article titled \n``US manufacturing crown slips'' highlighting that, ``The U.S. remained \nthe world's biggest manufacturing nation by output last year, but is \npoised to relinquish this slot in 2011 to China--thus ending a 110-year \nrun as the number one country in factory production.'' This news should \nbe a clarion call that investing in the manufacturing sector is \ncritical given the detrimental ramifications that losing our leadership \nwould have to our overall economy.\n  The MEP is an essential resource for the small and medium \nmanufacturers that will help reinvigorate our Nation's economy. With \ncenters in all 50 states, as well as Puerto Rico, its reach is \nunmatched and its experience in counseling manufacturers is unrivaled. \nIt is my hope that my colleagues will support this legislation as a \ndirect way to bolster an industry that is indispensible to our nation's \neconomy health.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. MURKOWSKI:\n  S. 3521. A bill to provide for the reestablishment of a domestic rare \nearths materials production and supply industry in the United States, \nand for other purposes; to the Committee on Energy and Natural \nResources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation \nin the Senate to help the United States minerals industry resume \nproduction of rare earths in this country. These metals are \nincreasingly important to our military, strategic, and economic \npriorities due to their use in clean energy technologies and many other \nhigh-tech applications.\n  For many years the United States was a leader in the mining and \nprocessing of rare earths--a group of 17 elements that, while \nwidespread in nature, are difficult to find in concentration, extract \nfrom the earth, and process for commercial use. Rare earths are \nincreasingly vital to a host of modern defense technologies, from radar \nand sonar systems to weapons systems and advanced lasers. They are \nessential to the production of clean energy technologies, including \nadvanced batteries, electric motors, high-efficiency light bulbs, solar \npanels, and wind turbines.\n  The U.S. is estimated to contain 15 percent of the world's rare earth \nreserves, but with the closure of the nation's only operating rare \nearth mine at Mountain Pass, CA, America has become dependent upon \nChina for imports of nearly all rare earths, oxides, and alloys. In \nfact, China now produces 97 percent of the world's rare earth supply.\n  More importantly, China recently moved to implement rules announced \nin March that will cut production and exportation of rare earths in an \neffort to raise world prices for the minerals. While the world demand \nfor rare earths tripled to 120,000 tons per year over the past decade, \nChina announced on June 2nd that it will stop issuing new domestic \nlicenses for rare earth production and cap production at 89,200 tons \nfor this year. As a result, only 35,000 tons of rare earths will be \nexported annually over the next five years, on average.\n  These actions may work out well for China, but they will harm the \nUnited States. Fortunately, we can do something about it. Rather than \nsit on our hands while China corners the market on these strategic \nminerals, we can and should pursue timely production of the rare earth \nsupplies that exist within our own borders.\n  Efforts are currently underway to reopen Molycorp Minerals' \nCalifornia mine and Ucore Uranium is continuing exploration of a large \nrare earth deposit found near Bokan Mountain in Alaska, about 37 miles \nfrom Ketchikan. Ucore's new Alaska subsidiary, Rare Earth One LLC, has \nbeen working to study the deposit on Dotson Ridge at Bokan Mountain \nsince 2007. The U.S. Bureau of Mines more than 20 years ago estimated \nthe site contains at least 374 million pounds of recoverable rare \nearths, which is more than enough to break China's stranglehold on the \nmarket and protect America's access to the rare earths that are vital \nto the production of cutting-edge technologies in this country.\n  So what should we be doing to reestablish domestic rare earth? My \nanswer is a companion measure to legislation introduced earlier this \nspring in the House by Rep. Mike Coffman, a fellow Republican from \nColorado. My bill would establish it as the policy of the\n\n[[Page S5277]]\n\nUnited States to take appropriate actions to increase investment in, \nexploration for, and development of domestic rare earths. To do that it \nwould require--under the leadership of the Secretary of the Interior--\nthe Secretaries of Energy, Agriculture, Defense, Commerce, and State \nalong with the Director of OMB and the Chairman of CEQ to expedite \npermitting, review supply chains, and consider strategic stockpiling of \nrare earths. The bill would also provide the rare earth industry with \naccess to federal loan guarantee programs meant to advance clean energy \ntechnologies.\n  There is a great deal of emphasis on the need for expansion of clean \nenergy manufacturing in the United States. Promises of ``green jobs'' \nabound, but they will only be realized if American industries have \naccess to the raw materials needed to produce these new technologies. \nThis legislation represents an important first step in our efforts to \ngrow domestic manufacturing of clean energy technologies. The bill will \nalso help to create more jobs in America's minerals industry, where \nfirms provide good, high-wage jobs and pay taxes that will help to \nreduce our deficit. Furthermore, decreasing our reliance on foreign \nminerals will reduce our balance of payments deficit and strengthen \nnational security.\n  I hope this bill advances quickly, and I encourage my colleagues to \njoin as cosponsors of the measure. We have an ambitious agenda given \nthe small amount of time that remains in the current Congress, but \nthere is too much at stake for our military strength and our clean \nenergy goals to ignore the problems we have in accessing affordable and \nsecure supplies of rare earths.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FRANKEN (for himself, Mr. Kohl, Mr. Menendez, Ms. \n        Klobuchar, Mr. Feingold, Mr. Durbin, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 3522. A bill to protect children affected by immigration \nenforcement actions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. FRANKEN. Mr. President, on December 12, 2006, Immigration and \nCustoms Enforcement staged raids on Swift & Company meatpacking plants \nin six states--Colorado, Iowa, Nebraska, Texas, Utah, and my home State \nof Minnesota.\n  Over 1,500 unauthorized immigrants were arrested in these raids. They \nalso left countless children--most of them citizens and legal \nresidents--without their parents and with no way of finding them. One \nsecond-grader in Worthington, MN--a U.S. citizen--came home that \nTuesday night to find his 2-year-old brother alone and his mother and \nfather missing.\n  For the next week, this boy stayed at home caring for his 2-year-old \nbrother while his grandmother traveled to Worthington to care for her \ngrandchildren.\n  On June 22, 2007, ICE agents staged another raid, this one in the \nJackson Heights Manufactured Home Park in Shakopee, MN. Early that \nFriday morning, around 6 a.m., Federal agents seized a husband and his \nwife for suspected immigration violations. Somehow, they didn't even \nnotice their daughter, who was sleeping. So later that morning, that 7-\nyear-old girl was found wandering the park, looking for her parents.\n  Stories like these happen every day. They are happening to innocent \nchildren, most of them United States citizens. Children who have \ncommitted no crime, who have hurt no one, but who have had their lives \ntorn apart because of the sins of their parents.\n  According to the U.S. Customs and Immigration Service, over 100,000 \nparents of U.S. citizen children were deported in the past 10 years. \nFour million U.S. citizen children in our country have at least one \nundocumented immigrant parent. Forty thousand of those children live in \nMinnesota.\n  Our country is not doing enough to protect these innocent kids. That \nis why Senator Kohl and I have crafted a bill to fix that.\n  So I am proud to stand today with Senators Kohl, Menendez, Klobuchar, \nFeingold, Durbin and Feinstein to introduce the Humane Enforcement and \nLegal Protections for Separated Children Act, or the HELP Separated \nChildren Act. This is a simple but strong bill to protect our Nation's \nkids from unnecessary harm from immigration enforcement actions.\n  I want to take a few moments to talk about what this bill does--the \nproblems it solves, and how it solves them.\n  But before I do that, I want to take a second to talk about what this \nbill does not do. This bill is strictly about protecting children. It \ndoesn't change our laws on immigrant admission, exclusion, or removal. \nNo one is going to get in or stay in this country because of this bill. \nIt has nothing to do with so-called amnesty or any decisions about \ndeportation.\n  So what does this bill actually do?\n  This bill fixes four problems in our immigration enforcement system.\n  The first problem is notice to State authorities. Invariably, in \nalmost all immigration enforcement actions, it is our local communities \nthat have to clean up after the government's dirty work.\n  It's state and child welfare services that take in kids who have lost \ntheir mom or dad in a raid. It's local shelters and churches that feed \nthose kids--again, most of whom are citizens--when their family \nbreadwinner is taken away. And it's local schools that have to take \ncare of kids when no one picks them up after soccer practice.\n  After the Swift raids, the Bush administration finally understood \nthis. And so in 2007, it put in place humanitarian guidelines that call \nupon ICE to reach out to state authorities and child welfare services \nbefore major enforcement actions. Again, that is the Bush \nadministration. President Obama expanded these guidelines in 2009 so \nthat they would cover more worksite actions.\n  But it still isn't enough. Local authorities still don't find out \nabout actions until way too late--and when they are notified, they \naren't given enough time to help. In 2008, after these guidelines were \nput into place, the New Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department \ntestified before the House of Representatives that they still did not \nreceive notice of enforcement actions before they happened.\n  State authorities in Massachusetts were notified months ahead of a \nraid in New Bedford. But almost immediately after it happened, the \ndetainees were transferred to Texas, leaving state agencies unable to \nhelp. Governor Deval Patrick called it a ``race to the airport.''\n  Our bill makes sure that whenever possible, the Governor, local and \nstate law enforcement, and child welfare agencies find out about raids \nahead of time. It also makes sure that schools and community centers \nare notified after these actions so that they too can help.\n  That brings me to the second problem. If they want to help, state \nchild welfare agencies and community organizations must be allowed to \nhelp identify detainees who have children at home. Mothers and fathers \ndetained in enforcement actions often don't tell ICE agents that they \nhave children at home--because they are afraid that ICE will detain \nthem, too.\n  As Troy Tucker, the sheriff of Clark County, Arkansas said after an \naction there, ICE is ``not doing their job by simply questioning \n[people] and asking them whether they have children and not contacting \nanyone locally.''\n  Even though the Bush administration guidelines allow state \nauthorities and local non-profits to help screen detainees, this is not \nhappening often enough. So our bill requires ICE and State agencies \nenforcing immigration laws to allow these groups to confidentially \nscreen detainees and identify those who have kids at home.\n  Our bill makes another critical fix in our immigration enforcement \nsystem. The Bush and ICE detention guidelines require authorities to \ngive detainees free emergency phone calls. But again, it isn't being \ndone enough, and it isn't being done right.\n  In the Swift raid in Worthington, one mother told ICE agents that she \nhad kids at home, but still wasn't allowed to call them or let anyone \nknow what had happened until later the next day. In Iowa, after a raid \nin Postville, some children went 72 hours without seeing their parents \nor knowing what happened to them.\n  Any parent knows how scared kids get just when you come home late. \nCan you imagine how scared they would get if you went missing for a \nwhole day? For 3 days? Can you imagine what would happen if they didn't \nknow who to call? Can you imagine what would\n\n[[Page S5278]]\n\nhappen if they didn't have anything to eat?\n  Our bill requires Federal and State authorities to allow parents, \nlegal guardians, or primary caregivers to make free phone calls to \ntheir family, to lawyers, and to child welfare agencies to make sure \nthat their kids aren't abandoned.\n  Finally, our bill averts one other major problem.\n  When a parent is detained, even if their kids know where they are, it \nis still extremely difficult for kids and parents to stay in contact. \nAnd it is extremely difficult for parents to participate in legal \nproceedings that affect their kids.\n  This means that parents can't tell a family court judge about a \nbrother or sister or neighbor that could take care of their child. \nChildren have actually been adopted by well-meaning families or put \ninto foster care because their parents were unable to participate in \ncustody proceedings.\n  Our bill makes sure that after they're detained, parents can continue \nto have access to phones to call their kids, their lawyers, and family \ncourts. Our bill also requires ICE to consider the best interests of \nchildren in decisions to transfer detainees between facilities, or put \nthem into reliable and cost-effective supervised release programs.\n  Our immigration system isn't broken. It is in shambles. And while our \nbill doesn't fix 99.9 percent of those problems, it takes a small but \nimportant step to make sure our kids don't suffer any more than they \nhave to already.\n  I am proud to say that because this is such a critical, albeit \nnarrowly targeted measure, our bill has gained the support of the top \nfaith, child welfare, and immigrant advocacy organizations in the \ncountry.\n  I'm also proud to say that it has won the support of faith leaders \nacross Minnesota, the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce, Chief Tom Smith of \nthe St. Paul Police Department, and countless immigrant advocacy groups \nin the State.\n  While immigration may be complicated, protecting our kids isn't. It's \nsomething we can all agree on.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill and \na list of supporters be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                S. 3522\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.
