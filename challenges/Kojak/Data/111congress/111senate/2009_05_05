Mr. President, Justice Souter's decision last week to \nretire from the Supreme Court presents us with an opportunity to \nprepare for an important debate about the role of the courts and the \nmeaning of the Constitution. Of all the Senate's duties, few have come \nto enliven our civic life as much as the consideration of a Supreme \nCourt nominee.\n  Justice Souter never made a secret of the fact that he prefers New \nHampshire to Washington, and the fact that he has served so long in \nspite of that preference speaks of a deep commitment to public service. \nAs Justice Souter returns to New Hampshire, we thank him for his many \nyears of dedicated service.\n  Now attention turns to the President's eventual nominee.\n  Republicans are hopeful that President Obama will choose someone with \nthe same qualities that have always characterized a good judge: superb \nlegal ability, personal integrity, sound temperament, and, above all, \nan evenhanded reading of the law.\n  These are the qualities Americans have always looked for in their \njudges. Any judge who has them can fulfill his or her judicial oath to \n``administer justice without respect to persons and do equal right to \nthe poor and to the rich.'' And these are the qualities that we should \nexpect of any nominee to the highest court in the land.\n  Over the years, there has been a growing tendency among some on the \nleft to pick or promote judges based on policy and political \npreferences, and President Obama's past statements on judicial \nappointments strongly suggest that he shares this view.\n  As a candidate for President, he said that his criteria for a \njudicial nominee would be someone who would empathize with particular \nparties or particular groups. This viewpoint was evident again last \nweek when, in describing a good nominee, the President seemed to stress \nempathy over and above a judge's role of applying the law without \nprejudice.\n  The problem with this philosophy is that it arises out of the \nmisguided notion that the courts are simply an extension of the \nlegislative branch rather\n\n[[Page S5088]]\n\nthan a check on it. Americans do not want judges to view any group or \nindividual who walks into the courtroom as being more equal than any \nother group or individual. They expect someone who will apply the law \nequally to everyone, so everyone has a fair shake.\n  Americans expect, and should receive, equal treatment whether they \nare in small claims court or the Supreme Court. And any judge who \npushes for an outcome based on their own personal opinion of what is \nfair undermines that basic trust Americans have always had and should \nalways expect in an American court of law.\n  The President is free to nominate whomever he likes. But picking \njudges based on his or her perceived sympathy for certain groups or \nindividuals undermines the faith Americans have in our judicial system. \nSo throughout this nomination process, the impartiality of judges is a \nprinciple that all of us should strongly defend.\n  In a nation of laws, the question is not whether a judge will be on \nthe side of one group or another. It is not ``whose side,'' the judge \nis ``on,'' as a senior Democrat on the Judiciary Committee framed the \nissue during another debate over a Supreme Court nominee. The issue is \nwhether he or she will apply the law evenhandedly.\n  Once the President chooses his nominee, Senate Republicans will work \nto ensure the Senate can conduct a thorough review of their record, and \na full and fair debate over his or her qualifications for the job. This \nis a responsibility we take seriously, and one that the American people \nexpect us to carry out with the utmost deliberation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/05/senate-section/article/S5088-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5088]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, my understanding is my friend and colleague \nfrom Tennessee has an amendment which is in order. I am prepared to \ndefer to him. Then when he completes his remarks, I will respond.\n  I believe Senator Martinez of Florida may be coming over as well. I \nunderstand we have an agreement to have a vote at 10:50. Is that \ncorrect?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield the floor.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1019\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I rise to speak on amendment No. 1019. Let \nme start by saying I appreciate the work Senators Dodd and Shelby have \ndone to bring the bill to the floor. I know they are trying to solve a \nnumber of problems that exist right now as relates to homeowners in our \ncountry trying to reposition where they are with their homes.\n  I know there are a number of issues with HOPE for Homeowners that was \npassed last summer that they are trying to solve. I say to the Senator \nfrom Connecticut, I appreciate his efforts. I appreciate the efforts of \nSenator Shelby.\n  The amendment I am offering and on which we will be voting tries to \nmake the safe harbor arrangement that exists in this bill something \nthat is fair to all folks involved in these loans. Most people are \naware of pooling arrangements where, in essence, there are servicers \nwho take care of the indebtedness against a homeowner. They pool these \ntogether through the securitization that has taken place in the past in \norder to deal with homeowners. There has been great difficulty in the \npast in trying to move programs along so we can modify these mortgages.\n  The problem with this bill, though, is that under the safe harbor \narrangement that has been put in place, it does not necessarily do what \nis best for the homeowner and doesn't necessarily do what is best for \nthe investors, as many Americans have these in their 401(k)s. What it \ndoes do is an excellent job of taking care of the large four banks that \ndo the bulk of the servicing: J.P. Morgan, Wells Fargo, Citigroup, and \nBank of America. This bill actually incents them. We are paying them \nmoney to do what is in their best interest.\n  Most of these large banks actually hold the second mortgages, not the \nfirst mortgages. The first mortgages are the ones I think most of us \nrealize have priority. Those are the loans that allowed you to go into \nand actually purchase the home in the first place. Then these banks \ncame along, in some cases unwittingly, and participated in predatory-\ntype lending. So these banks, in essence, own most of the second \nmortgages, the home equity loans. They also own a huge portion of the \ncredit card debt that many of these consumers have. We are paying them \nin this bill to actually deal with these mortgages in a way that is in \ntheir best interest. They have the lesser amount of security, but they \nalso have built-in conflicts of interest where, in essence, if they can \ndo things to cause these consumers to have the secondary debt taken \ncare of, it is in their best interest to do that.\n  I think this is a huge problem. I find it incredible that we, in \nessence, in this body would pass a bill where we, in essence, are \npaying the fox to guard a chicken house that is in their best interest. \nThat is what this bill does.\n  What our amendment would do is say to these servicers, these people \nwho are taking care of these mortgages, which is servicing the first \nand second mortgage--again, them owning mostly the second mortgages--\nwhat it would do is say they have to look at all options, not just the \nones cited in the bill.\n  For instance, if a homeowner would be better served by having \nforbearance, meaning for reduction of principal or something such as \nthat, or maybe a short sale, something else that might be in much \nbetter stead for the homeowner and for the investor, the servicer \ndoesn't have to do that. All the servicer has to do in this bill is \nlook at one of two programs--the Obama administration's modification \nprogram or the HOPE for Homeowners modification program, just one, not \nboth--and compare it to foreclosure. If it is better off going with one \nof these two programs, they move it into those programs, even though it \nmay not be in the homeowner's best interest and even though it may not \nbe in those many Americans across our country who have these first \nmortgages in their 401(k)s, not in their best interest. Typically, \nthough, it is going to be in the servicers' best interest, these four \nlarge banks that are being paid money by this bill to actually pursue \nthis servicing in a manner that is in their best interest.\n  I hope everyone will join me in asking these servicers to not just \nlook at what is in their best interest but to actually first look and \nsee what is in the best interest of those people who own the first \nmortgages and for those people who actually are in these homes who are \ntrying to stay in these homes. There are provisions here that actually\n\n[[Page S5089]]\n\nmake it worse for the homeowner, in that, basically, much of the debt \ngets pushed off into 5 years and actually defers their paying, actually \nmakes their situation even worse than it is today. But in the short \nterm, it might make it better, again, for these four large banks.\n  I am somewhat surprised the sponsors of this bill, whom I have a lot \nof respect for and work with on a number of issues, are not accepting \nthis commonsense amendment, which says to these servicers, who have a \ncontract, by the way, for those people whom they are servicing these \nmortgages for, to say that they have to look at everybody's best \ninterest, not their own self-interest, prior to making changes in these \nmortgages. It is pretty astounding to me. I am still not sure I \nunderstand.\n  Let me make one other point. Last week we, as a body, both sides of \nthe aisle in a bipartisan way, turned away something called cram-down, \nwhich gave judges around the country the ability to change the terms of \na first mortgage. This body, in a bipartisan way, said we should not be \nletting the courts change contracts. That is something that is foreign \nto an American way of thinking. By the way, courts, at least judges, \nare appointed or elected. They are in positions of public service. What \nthis bill does instead is, it pays servicers, many of which have \ncontributed to this problem in a huge way, to do things that in many \ncases are in their own self-interest, breaking contract law, and in \nmany cases hurting the homeowner and hurting the investors.\n  I hope everybody will see the commonsense nature of this amendment. I \nhope we can pass this amendment and cause the work that Senators Dodd \nand Shelby have done to improve the situation that exists, to make it \neven fairer to all involved.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I see our colleague from Florida has \narrived. I will take a few minutes and then ask unanimous consent that \nhe be recognized as the original author of the safe harbor provision so \nhe has a chance to explain his point of view.\n  Let me begin. Again, it is not necessarily the most compelling of \narguments, but I think it is worthy of note that those organizations \nwho are opposed to the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee include \nthe Consumer Federation of America, the National Community Law Center, \nthe National Association of Consumer Advocates, the Housing Policy \nCouncil, the Financial Roundtable, the Center for Responsible Lending, \nthe Mortgage Insurance Corporation, mortgage bankers, and the ABA. This \nis a pretty rare collection, when we get the major consumer groups that \nwatch all this stuff very carefully, as well as some of the major \nlending institutions. They never come together on anything. It is a \nunique moment on this proposal.\n  Let me say to my friend from Tennessee, I don't like the situation we \nare in either. This is not the ideal world because his point about \ncontracts is a valid one. There is no question. I pointed out there are \ncontracts with second homes and vacation homes and the like as well. We \nhad no problem with the cram-down with mortgages involved there. We \nhave a prohibition on primary residences, but we make the exception \nwith other properties. Frankly, had we taken the Durbin amendment, that \nmight have minimized the importance of what we have here.\n  Here is the problem: 10,000 people a day are losing their homes; \n20,000 a day are losing their jobs. The question is, How can we \npossibly get the kind of incentives so the bankers, the servicers, the \nlenders, and the borrowers can modify these mortgages? We now have 11 \nmillion homes in this country where the mortgage exceeds the value of \nthe property. If we don't step up soon, those numbers will explode. We \nhave a moratorium on foreclosures in certain areas, and that is just \nbuilding up a backlog that if we don't end up with some means by which \nthat borrower and lender can work out an arrangement that they can \nmodify the mortgage, we will face a cascading effect which most people \nagree is the root cause of our financial difficulties, beginning with \npredatory lending and subprime lending that helped create this problem \nwith no-documentation loans, the liar loans and the like.\n\n  What we have crafted is a rather narrow answer. They have a safe \nharbor provision which is very broad and, frankly, it can be narrowed. \nThat is what Senator Martinez has done with his proposal. What we are \ntalking about are loans in the private label securities. That \nrepresents about 16 percent of what we are talking about. Yet within \nthat 16 percent, in excess of 62 percent of those loans, are seriously \ndelinquent loans. So while it is a relatively small number compared to \nthe total mortgages being written, in terms of delinquent mortgages, it \nrepresents a fairly significant majority. We are narrowly dealing with \nthose.\n  Then we are talking about two circumstances in which they voluntarily \ncan move. That is with the Obama plan or the HOPE for Homeowners. We \nare not limiting it. If people don't want to do it, there is no \nrequirement that they do it. We are trying to remove one of the great \nbarriers, and that is the fear of litigation. The servicers are saying: \nWe would like to do this. We understand the value of it. We want to get \npaid. Banks want to get paid. Borrowers want to stay in their homes. \nEverybody seems to agree on that. Here is the problem: If we end up \nmodifying this, the investor, not an illegitimate point, says: Wait a \nminute, we had a contract with you, Mr. Servicer. You are going to now \nmodify this, violating our interests as an investor. Therefore, we are \ngoing to sue you.\n  That is the fear. So the servicer says: I am not going near this. I \nrespect the fact the borrower would like to get out of this situation \nin an affordable mortgage. I would like to get paid something in the \nprocess. But I will not go through the kind of litigation that will \noccur if there is not a safe harbor. Hence, the Martinez amendment.\n  In these narrow circumstances involving 16 percent of this market, \nand of which 62 percent are the delinquent mortgages, under two fact \nsituations, the HOPE for Homeowners and the Obama mortgage modification \nplan, we provide for that safe harbor, saying to that servicer, if, in \nfact, you move forward, we will provide you with that harbor and avoid \nthe potential of litigation, in some cases even frivolous litigation.\n  Again, in a perfect world, would I like to avoid that and do what my \nfriend from Tennessee wants? Absolutely. But there are no perfect \nchoices, and yet there are some potential dangers. I don't like setting \na precedent. We narrowly define this in time and circumstance, only \ninvolving those that already occurred, and the problem dies or is \nsunsetted in December of 2012. So this is not a perpetual program. It \nis limited to the fact situation, limited to opportunities in order to \ntry and provide some relief primarily to the consumer, to the person \nholding that mortgage or the person having that mortgage who runs the \nrisk of losing their home.\n  We have tried, for a year and a half, all sorts of different ways. My \nfriend from Tennessee and the former Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, Senator Martinez, who knows something about these issues, \nwill recall we tried, in the spring of 2007, to get these people \ntogether to try and work out things. They promised they would try. They \nnever did. Then we drafted legislation, far from perfect because we are \nback today talking about it, called HOPE for Homeowners. We tried all \nsorts of means by which we could slow down the foreclosure problem.\n  Regretfully, we have not been as successful as we would like. There \nis no guarantee this will work as well as we would like either. I say \nthat as a coauthor of this bill overall, and I appreciate my \ncolleague's fine comments about the effort. But it is an attempt to try \nand provide some space, in these very delinquent mortgages, to provide \nan opportunity for a modification so people can stay in their homes, \nborrowers can keep their homes, lenders get something back, rather than \ngoing to foreclosure in which the implications for everyone are \ndevastating.\n  Again, the investor does not have an illegitimate complaint, but in \nthe context of balancing these interests, where, again, no one is going \nto come out of this perfect, in a way I think it is in our interest to \ntry and do what we can to keep people in their homes and have the \nlenders be able to get something back. Hence, that is why you see this \nvery unique coming together of\n\n[[Page S5090]]\n\nvarious interest groups, from the consumer advocates to the major \nlending associations, saying on this point, they think this is the \nright--at least worthy of our attempt to get this right.\n  Again, I respectfully say to my colleague from Tennessee, I \nappreciate his points. He and I talked about this. But I honestly \nbelieve in this case this would be a mistake to accept this amendment \nand to run the risk of losing the opportunity to get that safe harbor \nopportunity.\n  With that, I yield to my colleague from Florida.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, if the Senator from Florida would allow me \nto speak for 1 minute.\n  Mr. DODD. Yes.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I wish to make it clear because I think \nthe Senator from Connecticut, in doing a good job in talking about his \nposition, made it seem as if we are against loan modifications. Look, \nthere were 134,000 loan modifications last month. I am all for loan \nmodifications.\n  But what this bill does now is it gives those four largest banks, and \nmany others, the ability--we are paying them, we are giving them the \nability to do things that are in their self-interest and not in the \nhomeowners' self-interest--let me say that one more time: not in the \nhomeowners' self-interest--and be totally obligation free, with no \nlegal recourse whatsoever against them.\n  What this amendment does is say we are giving them safe harbor, but \nthey have to look at a variety of ways to make sure the homeowner and \nthe investor both are being treated fairly. This bill is very narrow. \nIt allows them to wash their hands and do things that are in their best \ninterest alone, and we are paying them to do that with no legal \nrecourse. To me, that is far, far, far more than we should be doing in \nlegislation such as this.\n  I thank the Senator.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, a quick response.\n  The homeowner gets to keep their home, hopefully, at a rate they can \nafford to pay. That is not insignificant, I say with all due respect. \nThe idea there is nothing in here that benefits homeowners--and I am \nnot interested in helping out the four big banks at all. I am \ninterested in making it possible for this to avoid litigation. That is \nwhat the concern is; that if we are going to do this, we run the risk \nbecause it violates a contract potentially, and if you do that, you are \nsubject to a lawsuit; hence, nothing happens.\n  That is the fear: nothing happens. If the servicers do not act, then \nyou end up with the borrower losing their home, the lender ends up \ngetting nothing out of it at all; and, hence, the reason why this safe \nharbor is designed to get us to the point where both the borrower and \nthe lender--again, we are not interested in anyone coming out of this \nsituation with some enrichment, but the idea of slowing down this \ncascading problem of foreclosures, I think is in everyone's interest, \nas my colleague has pointed out.\n  Several Senators addressed the Chair.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Thank you, Mr. President.\n  Let me make one more point. I will be brief.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Point of order, Mr. President.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, if I could inquire of the Chair----\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee has the floor.\n  Does the Senator from Tennessee yield to the Senator from Florida?\n  Mr. CORKER. Certainly. Yes.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I would like to be heard and have an \nopportunity to join in the discussion regarding this very important \nissue. I appreciate the fact that the Senator from Tennessee has \nspoken, rebutted, and wants to speak again. I appreciate that. But I \nwould like to have an opportunity to express my point of view at some \npoint. If the Chair could keep that in mind, I would like to do that at \nsome appropriate point.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, unless I am rebutted, this will be my \nfinal point.\n  I would like to make a point that from the standpoint of the \nhomeowner, in many cases, they would be much better off if they were \ngiven the opportunity to refinance, given the opportunity to refinance \nat a lower rate and a longer amortization with organizations that \nprovide that opportunity today.\n  The servicer has no obligation to even look at a refinancing such as \nthat, for which in many cases the homeowner and the investor would be \nbetter off. That is not a part of this bill. I find that to be a major \nflaw.\n  I yield my time, Mr. President.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida for being so patient.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I did not want the opportunity to pass \nto be heard on this issue, and I would be pleased to have the Senator \nfrom Tennessee make a rebuttal after I make my comments. But at some \npoint I did wish to have an opportunity to express my point of view on \nthis issue.\n  Here is the situation we are in. As the chairman of the Banking \nCommittee has said, this is not a perfect world. We are in a heck of a \nmess. The people in Florida, by the thousands, are having their homes \nforeclosed. Unemployment is almost 10 percent because about 25 percent \nof Florida's economy is dependent on building homes and on the \nconstruction industry, which is completely stopped, for the most part.\n  We are in a situation now where if I hold a forum in a city such as \nFort Myers, 450 people show up desperate for a solution to their \nproblem to stay in their home. We have some banks there, and we have \nsome people from HUD, from HOPE for Homeowners--all these people coming \ntogether--to try to work things out, and many times it happens. It is \nnot nearly keeping up with the rate of foreclosures going on across the \ncountry, but some are getting worked out.\n  How many more would be worked out if we had a safe harbor provision--\nbalanced--that keeps the investor community from being able to bring \nlegal action against the servicers? I think we would have thousands \nmore. Would the country be better off? Absolutely. Would the homeowner \nbe better off? Absolutely. Would everyone involved in the business of \nhousing and housing finance be better off? I submit to you it would be \nso.\n  One of the reasons many of these loan modification programs we have \nhad--and they began in the Bush administration; they have continued now \nin the Obama administration but they have not worked because of the \nsafe harbor need, because of the legal ramifications once a servicer \nperceives the threat of litigation. The safe harbor provisions of this \nlegislation remove that perceived risk.\n  This bill, which includes a safe harbor that is lots narrower than \nthe one in the House version of this bill, makes it clear that so long \nas a mortgage servicer concludes that, from the perspective of the \ninvestors, an approved loan modification is better than foreclosure; \nthat is, modification will yield greater value than foreclosure--in \nother words, the investor is protected to a degree--then the servicer \ncannot be held liable for choosing to modify the loan and not \nforeclose.\n  This legislation strengthens the current Federal loan modification \nguidelines to assure that only deserving homeowners benefit from a \nmodification. Individuals with a net worth of more than $1 million \ncannot qualify for a modification. Individuals who have been convicted \nof fraud would also be barred. Any participant must certify that he or \nshe has not intentionally defaulted on any other debt before a \nmodification is going to be permitted.\n  Unlike the safe harbor provision in the House bill, this bill's safe \nharbor would still permit investors to hold a servicer liable if the \nservicer acts unreasonably or improperly fails to maximize investor \nvalue through instigating a foreclosure. In other words,\n\n[[Page S5091]]\n\nthere will still be a foreclosure if, in fact, it is in the best \ninterest of the investor.\n\n  The safe harbor provisions in this bill would help to strike the \nproper balance between the future health of residential mortgage credit \nin this country and the rights of investors.\n  I think what we need to understand a little better is that the intent \nof the Corker amendment--while it is good; and I hate to disagree with \nthe Senator from Tennessee, whom I so often find myself in full \nagreement with, but in this instance, I must because he requires that \nall potential alternatives to foreclosure be evaluated and to select \nthe one that is best for the investor, regardless of whether that is in \nthe best interest of the homeowner, before the safe harbor litigation \nprotections are triggered. So before the safe harbor litigation \nprotections are triggered, all other options would have to be reviewed \nand considered. Basically, there is no safe harbor at all. I do not \nthink, if the Corker amendment was adopted, we would see a lesser \nnumber of foreclosures.\n  There are two problems with this amendment.\n  The language of the amendment appears to fail to achieve its stated \nintent. The current language appears to require that a servicer \nevaluate all possible alternatives to foreclosure but only provides a \nsafe harbor if the servicer chooses a government-sponsored loan \nmodification.\n  The second problem is it fails to strike the proper balance among the \ninterests of the servicers, the investors, and the homeowners. We tried \nto strike a balance among all these competing interests in what we \nacknowledge is an imperfect world.\n  The current language of the bill is better because it forces \nservicers to make a reasonable determination about whether an investor \nwould be better off with a loan modification or foreclosure. It allows \nthe current loan modification efforts--that allow homeowners to remain \nin their homes--an opportunity to actually work.\n  This allows investors to benefit from a modification, where it is \nappropriate, while decreasing the number of foreclosures and increasing \nthe number of families who can remain in their homes.\n  Some have alleged constitutional concerns about this legislation, and \nI have to tell you, in these kinds of moments, I think we do not want \nto violate our Constitution, but it is necessary sometimes we step \noutside a comfort zone, and it is undisputed Congress has the power to \nregulate the residential mortgage industry. We believe we are on safe \nlegal grounds in that and that this does not constitute a taking or \neven come close to that.\n  I believe the well-intended Corker amendment would not improve the \ncurrent situation as it relates to the number of workouts that are \ntaking place, and foreclosure would still be the rule of the day. I \nbelieve the language in the bill is superior. It strikes a better \nbalance. It is not as broad as the House language, it is not as \nrestrictive as the Corker language, but it hits it just about right.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Who yields time?\n  The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. CORKER. Mr. President, I thank my colleague from Florida, who has \nserved our country well both as a Senator but also as Secretary of HUD \nand has tremendous amounts of experience in this area. We disagree on \nthis issue.\n  My amendment does not just seek to do what is best for the investor. \nIt seeks to do what is best for the homeowner and asks the servicer to \nnot just compare one alternative to foreclosure but an array of \nalternatives to foreclosure.\n  I have to tell you, I know of people in financial distress, as most \nof us do. I think I would like for these major banks that basically are \nservicing credit card debt and home equity loans, I would like for them \nto have to look after the interests of the homeowner and the investor \nin every way they can prior to moving to foreclosure. That is what this \namendment does.\n  It is a commonsense amendment. I think we have moved ourselves into a \nsituation now that is potentially worse, as I said before, than what we \ndid the other day, which was that the other day we rejected giving \njudges the ability to unilaterally change contracts. Now we are going \nto be paying, in large portions, the four largest banks in the country, \nwe are going to be paying them our money, taxpayer money to do things \nthat in many cases are in their best interest and not in the \nhomeowner's best interest and the investor's best interest. I find that \nproblematic.\n  In years to come, if this legislation passes without this amendment, \nwe are going to look back and realize we did some things that may have \nsounded great in the middle of a crisis but we did some things that 4 \nor 5 years from now we are going to wake up and realize have done great \nharm to the very homeowners this bill seeks to help.\n  Mr. President, I thank you for the time.\n  I thank the Senator from Florida and the Senator from Connecticut for \nthe thoughtful conversations they have put forth. I think this \nlegislation is flawed. I know there are some other components of this \nbill that are very good. As a matter of fact, I have authored, with the \nmajor proponent, the Senator from Connecticut, large portions of this \nbill. But this safe harbor agreement has many problems. I think it is a \nshame, if this amendment is not adopted, we are going to end up with a \npiece of legislation that does a lot of good but also does a lot of \nharm and sets precedents in this country we are going to live to \nregret.\n  Mr. President, I yield my time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will take a minute. Let me just say again \nthat I have great respect for my colleague from Tennessee. He and I \nwork closely together on a lot of issues. He is invaluable as a \ncolleague, as is Senator Martinez, former Secretary of Housing, who \nunderstands a lot of these issues well, not just from a senatorial \nperspective but from his previous job as Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment in Washington.\n  Again, this is a program that is limited in time, limited in scope.\n  As both the Senator from Florida and I have said, this is far from a \nperfect world in terms of how we have to balance the various interests \nin all of this. I am not unmindful of the fact that we are in uncharted \nwaters. We all recognize as well that we are in uncharted waters in a \nlarger sense. We are in a time that none of us in this Chamber--with \nthe exception of my colleague from West Virginia and a couple others--\ncan recall. Our parents and grandparents talked to us about times like \nthese almost a century ago.\n  While we are taking action here--and I hear my colleague from \nTennessee, who made a legitimate point that we establish precedent \nhere, and I understand that. People will look back, as we have looked \nback, to previous decades to seek ideas that might help us get back on \ntrack again and restore that optimism and confidence in our country. So \nwe are moving into an area that is new, but as the Senator from Florida \npointed out, we are in a time that is new as well.\n  We have tried, as we know, in numerous ways over the last many months \nto figure out ways to get at the root of this foreclosure problem. \nEvery idea you can come up with has its shortcomings. We have yet to \nfind the perfect one that everybody agrees on. If somebody has it, \nplease let us know because we are looking for it to get us to the point \nwhere we can put the brakes on foreclosures, not because you impose a \nmoratorium but because people can afford their mortgages, lenders are \nbeing paid, the economy is moving, credit is flowing, businesses are \ngrowing, and joblessness is no longer increasing but declining--all of \nthe things we want to see.\n  This proposal we have advocated here, the safe harbor, in a narrowly \ncrafted way, limited in time, scope, and circumstance, we believe will \nhelp in that regard. Is it perfect? Far from it. Is it necessary? \nAbsolutely. That is why I think you see the collection of \norganizations. I don't want to overemphasize this point, but they have \ncome together to say this is an idea worth trying. Rarely do you get \nthat kind of cooperation.\n  At least there is some indication that the other body might be \nwilling to accept our language and take this bill, and the other \nprovisions of the bill--\n\n[[Page S5092]]\n\nmy colleague is correct--really are important and are needed \nimmediately. We don't need to delay this further. That is not a reason \nto be for or against the amendment, but I just point out that the other \nside would agree to the Martinez idea.\n  I ask our colleagues to, at the appropriate time, oppose this \namendment--and I say that respectfully--so that we can move on to the \nother amendment and see if we can reach a final vote this evening or \nsometime in the morning.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Florida is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Two minutes 16 seconds.\n  Mr. MARTINEZ. Mr. President, I wish to conclude and follow up on \nsomething the chairman said.\n  The situation we are in is critical. Striking some balance that \nreduces foreclosures is worth the risk. The corrosive effect of \nforeclosures--and all of the things we have tried have nipped at the \nissue but have not fixed it. The corrosive effect of foreclosures \ncontinues this downward spiral of home prices, which escalates the \nproblem the banks have. Assets were becoming toxic yesterday, and are \ntoday and tomorrow, because of the decline in home values. There is a \ndramatic decline in my State, and the biggest reason for that is \nforeclosures.\n  The foreclosures set a new floor on what the prices in the \nneighborhoods are, and that floor then begins to be what other \npurchasers are willing to pay. That, in effect, then reduces home \nequities, reduces the opportunities for folks to stay in their homes, \nand it is a downward spiral we have to stop. This is an effort to try \nto stop it.\n  I am delighted to hear the Senator say that the House may take our \nlanguage. I think their language is very broad, frankly. What Senator \nCorker has raised in his concerns would be heightened by the House \nlanguage. I think our language, in its imperfection, strikes a decent \nbalance among the interests of all parties and perhaps will increase \nthe number of workouts and reduce the number of foreclosures.\n  I also speak in opposition to the Corker amendment, and I would be \nexcited to see our bill move forward with this provision and the many \nothers that are helpful.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. All time has expired.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, so the pending matter is the Corker \namendment?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the \namendment.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``Protecting Tenants at \n     Foreclosure Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 502. EFFECT OF FORECLOSURE ON PREEXISTING TENANCY.\n\n       (a) In General.--In the case of any foreclosure on a \n     federally-related mortgage loan or on any dwelling or \n     residential real property after the date of enactment of this \n     title, any immediate successor in interest in such property \n     pursuant to the foreclosure pursuant to the foreclosure shall \n     assume such interest subject to--\n       (1) the provision, by such successor in interest of a \n     notice to vacate to any bona fide tenant at least 90 days \n     before the effective date of such notice; and\n       (2) the rights of any bona fide tenant, as of the date of \n     such notice of foreclosure--\n       (A) under any bona fide lease entered into before the \n     notice of foreclosure to occupy the premises until the end of \n     the remaining term of the lease, except that a successor in \n     interest may terminate a lease effective on the date of sale \n     of the unit to a purchaser who will occupy the unit as a \n     primary residence, subject to the receipt by the tenant of \n     the 90 day notice under paragraph (1); or\n       (B) without a lease or with a lease terminable at will \n     under State law, subject to the receipt by the tenant of the \n     90 day notice under subsection (1),\n     except that nothing under this section shall affect the \n     requirements for termination of any Federal- or State-\n     subsidized tenancy or of any State or local law that provides \n     longer time periods or other additional protections for \n     tenants.\n       (b) Bona Fide Lease or Tenancy.--For purposes of this \n     section, a lease or tenancy shall be considered bona fide \n     only if--\n       (1) the mortgagor under the contract is not the tenant;\n       (2) the lease or tenancy was the result of an arms-length \n     transaction; or\n       (3) the lease or tenancy requires the receipt of rent that \n     is not substantially less than fair market rent for the \n     property.\n       (c) Definition.--For purposes of this section, the term \n     ``federally-related mortgage loan'' has the same meaning as \n     in section 3 of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of \n     1974 (12 U.S.C. 2602).\n\n     SEC. 503. EFFECT OF FORECLOSURE ON SECTION 8 TENANCIES.\n\n       Section 8(o)(7) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 \n     (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(7)) is amended--\n       (1) by inserting before the semi-colon in subparagraph (C) \n     the following: ``and in the case of an owner who is an \n     immediate successor in interest pursuant to foreclosure--\n       ``(i) during the initial term of the lease vacating the \n     property prior to sale shall not constitute other good cause; \n     and\n       ``(ii) in subsequent lease terms, vacating the property \n     prior to sale may constitute good cause if the property is \n     unmarketable while occupied, or if such owner will occupy the \n     unit as a primary residence''; and\n       (2) by inserting at the end of subparagraph (F) the \n     following: ``In the case of any foreclosure on any federally-\n     related mortgage loan (as that term is defined in section 3 \n     of the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act of 1974 (12 \n     U.S.C. 2602)) or on any residential\n\n[[Page S5093]]\n\n     real property in which a recipient of assistance under this \n     subsection resides, the immediate successor in interest in \n     such property pursuant to the foreclosure shall assume such \n     interest subject to the lease between the prior owner and the \n     tenant and to the housing assistance payments contract \n     between the prior owner and the public housing agency for the \n     occupied unit, except that this provision and the provisions \n     related to foreclosure in subparagraph (C) shall not shall \n     not affect any State or local law that provides longer time \n     periods or other additional protections for tenants.''.\n\n     SEC. 504. SUNSET.\n\n       This title, and any amendments made by this title are \n     repealed, and the requirements under this title shall \n     terminate, on December 31, 2012.\n\n  Mr. DODD. I thank the Chair, and let me just say to my colleagues--\nand I see my friend, Senator Shelby, on the floor of the Senate as \nwell--that we are open for business, as the expression goes. We have a \nnumber of amendments--a significant number--on which I think we might \nbe able to reach agreement. We are not quite there on those, but we can \ndo that. There are several that require votes, and the leadership would \nobviously like to complete this bill this evening, if it is possible.\n  My good friend from Alabama has been a good partner in all of this, \nin working on this, and so we invite all those with amendments to come \nover. We can offer them, debate them, and possibly reach agreement on \nthem as well and adopt them as part of the bill. So I would just make \nthat point.\n  I see one of my colleagues on the Senate floor but who is maybe not \nready yet, so I will suggest the absence of a quorum until we get \nsomeone to show up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The \nSenator from Idaho is recognized.\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, I am coming to the floor to thank \nChairman Dodd for working with us on some important pieces of this \nlegislation. Included in this legislation is the increased borrowing \nauthority for both the FDIC and the NCUA, so they can immediately \naccess the necessary resources to resolve failing banks and credit \nunions and provide timely protection for insured depositors. Earlier \nthis year, Senator Dodd and I joined in introducing legislation that \nwould increase the borrowing authority of the FDIC, and since that time \nwe have expanded that legislation to provide parallel authority for the \nNCUA, for credit unions, and to include an assumption in the budget \nresolution about the need to pass legislation to ensure adequate \nresources are available to the FDIC and the NCUA.\n  This legislation is similar to what is included in the Dodd-Shelby \nsubstitute that was passed by the Banking Committee on a voice vote in \nan amendment to the credit card legislation we will be looking at later \non.\n  I come to the floor simply to make note of how important it is that \nwe continue to pursue this legislation and to thank Senator Dodd for \nworking so closely with me to make sure it happens. When you look at \ntoday's economic climate and the threats facing us in the financial \nindustry, we have to provide the necessary tools to our financial \ninstitution regulators so they can protect us as best they can. One \nimportant piece--and I am glad to say one of those pieces about which \nthere is very little controversy--is the need to make sure we \nstrengthen the FDIC and NCUA to make sure they can undertake their \nstatutory responsibilities in the context of failing institutions.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't say I wish to be sure that both the \nFDIC and NCUA are very careful in the exercise of these authorities, to \nmake sure they do not do more harm than good and harm institutions that \ncould otherwise have survived, by stepping in. But when the true need \ncomes, they need to have the authority.\n  This language deals with significant reforms that need to be \nundertaken, and undertaken as soon as possible, so our regional banks \ndo not face very significantly increased levies and requirements for \nfunding the FDIC and NCUA operations.\n  It would permanently increase the Federal Deposit Insurance \nCorporation's borrowing authority from their current level of $30 \nbillion to $100 billion, with additional authority, that is temporary, \nto allow them to get up to $500 billion in the case of emergency \ncircumstances.\n  It would permanently increase the borrowing authority of the NCUA \nfrom the current $100 million, with authority for a temporary increase \nup to $30 billion. The temporary authority for both the FDIC and the \nNCUA could only be used if determined necessary in the FDIC Board of \nDirectors' written recommendation and support of two-thirds vote; the \nBoard of Governors for the Federal Reserve system, with written \nrecommendations and support of two-thirds vote; and the Secretary of \nthe Treasury, in consultation with the President.\n  The FDIC and NCUA need to have access to sufficient resources to deal \nwith the potential costs for seizing failing institutions we are facing \nin our country right now. Assets in the banking industry have increased \nsince 1991 from $4.5 trillion to $13.6 trillion at the same time that \nno increases in this borrowing authority have been authorized. The \nassets in the credit union industry have also significantly increased \nsince their borrowing authority levels were established.\n  It is important to note that this borrowing authority is not coming \nfrom taxpayer dollars. The levies and the assessments that are made on \nthe participants in the financial industry themselves, the depository \ninstitutions, are the source of the dollars that would cover this loan \nauthority. I think most people understand, but what happens in the case \nof a failing institution is the FDIC steps in immediately and protects \nall depositors so the depositors can have that assurance of the Federal \nguarantee of their deposits in these depository-protected institutions. \nThen the FDIC basically works out the resolution of the remaining \nassets of the failed institution and the banking institution itself. \nOther depositors, through their assessments, pay for the cost of the \noperation of this program. We are simply increasing the borrowing \nauthority to make sure the FDIC and the NCUA have the resources \nnecessary to deal with these very difficult and challenging times.\n  In addition, the borrowing authority would allow the FDIC and the \nNCUA to lower their recent special assessments that went out to the \nbanking and credit industry. In other words, this would allow us to \nkind of smooth out that process by which the depository institutions \nthemselves fund this process and not create huge liquidity and \nfinancial pressures on the banks that are not facing the potential of \nany kind of FDIC intervention but which are being looked to to bear the \ncost of these problems as we move forward.\n  The language ensures that the FDIC and the NCUA have the resources \nnecessary to address future contingencies and to fulfill the \nGovernment's commitment to protect America's depositories.\n  As I said at the outset, I wish to be sure the NCUA and the FDIC are \nvery careful in the utilization of the authorities we have given them. \nThere are some concerns already being raised about the fact that \nperhaps the stress test and some of the other analysis that is being \nput into place and the evaluation of the solvency of our banks need to \nbe fine-tuned so we do not unnecessarily utilize these authorities \nwhere a better resolution, better activities can be pursued. But when \nit does become necessary, we need to be sure our depositors are \nprotected. Once again, I thank Senator Dodd for his strong support and \nwork on this issue.\n  There is another issue I have been working on with Senator Dodd. I \nwish to make it clear that the frustration I am going to share right \nnow is not directed at him because he has been working very hard to \naddress this same issue and trying to resolve it. But I do believe it \nneeds to be said that there is another piece of the issue we must \nresolve.\n  Earlier, on previous legislation, language was included dealing with \ndepository institutions that gave the FTC much broader jurisdiction \nthan it should have had with regard to depository institutions. The \nlanguage was intended to give broader jurisdiction and clarification of \njurisdiction to the FTC's regulation of other, nondepository \ninstitutions, but the way the\n\n[[Page S5094]]\n\nwording in the bill was written it included depository institutions--\nwrongly.\n  We identified that issue at the time. We stood on this floor, a \nnumber of us Senators stood on this floor and pointed out that was not \nintended by the bill and that we would correct it. In fact, we said we \nwould correct it at the first available opportunity. Now we are seeing \nopportunities arrive, and we cannot reach a conclusion with regard to \nthe necessary correction of the legislation that gives unnecessary and \nconfusing dual jurisdiction to the FTC now over depository \ninstitutions, which was not intended by this Congress and which will \nnot be helpful, in terms of creating a duplicate regulatory system with \nwhich our regulatory institutions must deal.\n  Again, I stand and call for us to do what we agreed to do, which is \nto fix the FTC issue and make sure we carefully clarify the \njurisdiction of the appropriate committees and the jurisdiction of the \nappropriate regulators over depository institutions.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, before my colleague leaves the floor, I \nthank him as well. He has been a senior Member of the Banking Committee \nand has been an invaluable asset and partner on these issues. He \nunderstands regulatory reform as well as anyone and has dedicated a \ngood part of his service on the committee to that issue. It was a \npleasure to work with him on the issues he has mentioned in this bill, \ndealing with the FDIC and the National Credit Union Association. We are \nproviding these resources. We think we have built in some pretty good \nsafeguards so these guidelines will not be exceeded, but the best \nsafeguards are for the institutions themselves to be cautious and \nprudent in utilization of these resources as well.\n  I underscore and endorse his comments on that point and I thank him \nimmensely for his work on the bill, making it possible for us to arrive \nwhere we are this morning.\n  Lastly, I join him as well in his concerns about the Federal Trade \nCommission issue that I thought we successfully resolved in the \ncolloquies we had here. Unfortunately, that was not, apparently, the \ncase. We are still working at this. I want you to know Senator Crapo's \noffice is directly involved with ours and others we are negotiating \nwith and will obviously pursue this matter. I am hopeful we can resolve \nit amicably but, if not, there will be a moment in the not-too-distant \nfuture we will have to vote. I would like to work things out to \neveryone's satisfaction without that, but if that is the case, we will \nhave to do that. I join with him. I think the jurisdiction is clear on \nthat matter, and I think most agree with us, but, obviously, from time \nto time, you need to bring these matters to a head and actually have a \ndecision by the body. Again, I hope we can avoid that, but if not, I \njoin him in that effort to provide that legislative effort. I thank him \nvery much, and hopefully we will, this evening, complete work on this \nbill and send it off.\n  I am hopeful about the other body which, I am told, has looked on our \nefforts here with approving eyes, so we may be able to get it signed \ninto law pretty quickly.\n  Mr. CRAPO. I thank the Chairman. I look forward to working with him.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1030 to Amendment No. 1018\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to call up and \nmake pending amendment No. 1030.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the pending amendment is \nset aside. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Dakota [Mr. Thune] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1030 to amendment No. 1018.\n\n  Mr. THUNE. I ask unanimous consent that the reading of the amendment \nbe dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To require the Secretary of the Treasury to use any amounts \n  repaid by a financial institution that is a recipient of assistance \n under the Troubled Asset Relief Program to reduce the reauthorization \n                         level under the TARP)\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n\n                  TITLE V--TARP REDUCTION PRIORITY ACT\n\n     SEC. 501. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This title may be cited as the ``TARP Reduction Priority \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 502. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) On October 7, 2008, Congress established the Troubled \n     Asset Relief Program (TARP) as part of the Emergency Economic \n     Stabilization Act (Public 110-343; 122 Stat. 3765) and \n     allocated $700,000,000,000 for the purchase of toxic assets \n     from banks with the goal of restoring liquidity to the \n     financial sector and restarting the flow of credit in our \n     markets.\n       (2) The Department of Treasury, without consultation with \n     Congress, changed the purpose of TARP and began injecting \n     capital into financial institutions through a program called \n     the Capital Purchase Program (CPP) rather than purchasing \n     toxic assets.\n       (3) Lending by financial institutions was not noticeably \n     increased with the implementation of the CPP and the \n     expenditure of $218,000,000,000 of TARP funds, despite the \n     goal of the program.\n       (4) The recipients of amounts under the CPP are now faced \n     with additional restrictions related to accepting those \n     funds.\n       (5) A number of community banks and large financial \n     institutions have expressed their desire to return their CPP \n     funds to the Department of Treasury and the Department has \n     begun the process of accepting receipt of such funds.\n       (6) The Department of the Treasury should not reuse \n     returned funds for additional lending for financial \n     assistance.\n       (7) The United States Constitution provided Congress with \n     the power of the purse hence any future spending of TARP \n     funds, or other financial assistance, should be determined by \n     Congress.\n\n     SEC. 503. TARP AUTHORIZATION REDUCTION.\n\n       Section 115(a)(3) the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act \n     of 2008 (12 U.S.C. 5211 et seq.) is amended by inserting \n     ``minus any amounts received by the Secretary for repayment \n     of the principal of financial assistance by an entity that \n     has received financial assistance under the TARP or any \n     program enacted by the Secretary under the authorities \n     granted to the Secretary under this Act,'' before \n     ``outstanding at any one time.''\n\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, the amendment I offer today essentially \nfollows along with the bill I introduced earlier called the TARP \nReduction Priority Act. Essentially, this amendment reduces TARP \nauthority by any amount of principal returned by a financial \ninstitution to the Treasury.\n  Again, by way of background, I spoke to this amendment a little bit \nlast week. On October 7, 2008, as we all know, Congress passed the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, as part of the Emergency \nEconomic Stabilization Act, authorizing $700 billion for the purchase \nof toxic assets from banks with the goal of restoring liquidity to the \nfinancial sector and restarting the flow of credit in our markets.\n  The Department of the Treasury, without consultation with Congress, \nchanged the purpose of TARP and began injecting capital into financial \ninstitutions through a program called the Capital Purchase Program \nrather than purchasing toxic assets.\n  Financial lending was not increased with implementation of the CPP, \nand $218 billion, I believe, has been allocated thus far, despite the \ngoal of the program. These institutions receiving funding through the \nCPP are now faced with additional restrictions related to accepting \nthose funds.\n  A number of community banks and financial institutions have expressed \ntheir desire to return the CPP funds to the Department of the Treasury, \nand Treasury has begun the process of accepting receipt of these funds. \nHowever, because of the financial stress test that Treasury is \ncurrently conducting, it is possible Treasury will restrict banks from \nreturning funds they received from the Capital Purchase Program.\n  In his testimony before the TARP Congressional Oversight Panel on \nApril 21, 2009, Secretary Geithner stated that Treasury estimates \n$134.6 billion of TARP funds are still available. In that figure, he \nincludes $25 billion which Treasury expects to receive back from banks \nunder the CPP.\n  Geithner also stated that he believed the $25 billion is a \nconservative number and that private analysts predict more\n\n[[Page S5095]]\n\nwill eventually be returned. Section 120 of the Emergency Economic \nStabilization Act terminates the authority for TARP funds on December \n31, 2009, and the Secretary can request an extension to the deadline \nnot later than 2 years after enactment, which was October of last year, \n2008. So keep in mind this restriction applies only to Treasury's \nissuance of new loans and does not cover the reuse of previously issued \nassistance that was returned to the Treasury.\n  So, essentially, my argument for why this piece of legislation, this \namendment, is important is, until the December 31, 2009, expiration \ndate or possibly longer, as I said earlier, if the Secretary is granted \nan extension, without this legislation Treasury can continue to use \nTARP funds, including those repaid, in any manner they see fit.\n  This is certainly not what Members of Congress envisioned when this \nlegislation passed last year. These are taxpayer dollars. They should \nnot become a discretionary slush fund for Treasury. Under the \nConstitution, Congress controls the power of the purse, and there are \nmajor concerns regarding the Treasury's handling of TARP funding. If \nthe Treasury Department believes it needs additional funding to address \nproblems in the financial sector, they should come to Congress to get \nthat authority.\n  The inspector general, Neil Barofsky, stated in his quarterly report \nto Congress that 12 separate programs are being funded under TARP \ninvolving up to $3 trillion of Government and public funds. Amazingly, \nthis is the equivalent to the size of the entire Federal budget, \ncertainly not what Congress was told the funding would be used for.\n  Mr. Barofsky also mentioned on April 4, 2009, the CBO report which \nestimated that TARP will cost the Government $356 billion, meaning the \nTreasury will only be able to recover about $344 billion, or \napproximately 49 percent of the $700 billion that was originally \nauthorized. When this program, as I said earlier, was initially pitched \nto Congress, Secretary Paulson argued that the Government could end up \nmaking money once the toxic assets were sold, after the economy \nrecovered.\n  Clearly, based on what the inspector general is saying, that does not \nappear to be the case.\n  Because if the numbers CBO is using are correct, they are estimating \nthat TARP will cost the Government $356 billion, and therefore only \nabout $344 billion or 49 percent of it will actually be recoverable of \nthe original $700 billion.\n  Barofsky's report spans 247 pages. It says that:\n\n       The very character of the program makes it inherently \n     vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse, including significant \n     issues related to conflicts of interest facing fund managers, \n     collusion between participants, and vulnerabilities to money \n     laundering.\n\n  It would seem irresponsible to continue recycling money in the TARP \nif the very nature of the program makes it susceptible to fraud. In \nfact, the special investigator's office already has 20 criminal \ninvestigations underway.\n  What amendment No. 1030 does is amend the underlying bill to say that \nTARP funds that are repaid by financial institutions, if they choose to \ndo it--and that is going to be in consultation with Treasury--if the \nfunds come back in--and according to Secretary Geithner, about $25 \nbillion of the amount they say is available under TARP, still available \nto lend, consists of moneys being paid back by financial institutions--\nthat when those moneys come back in, they should reduce the amount, the \nprincipal amount of TARP available to be used.\n  Again, I offered a similar amendment to the fraud recovery bill a \ncouple weeks ago. In that case, I offered it with the intention of \nhaving any funds paid back under TARP by financial institutions to be \ndedicated to paying down the public debt--in other words, to debt \nreduction. Under that arrangement, it was considered not to be germane. \nSo when cloture was filed, it fell postcloture. It was not, therefore, \nable to be voted on. We worked with folks who are involved in trying to \nmake sure this is germane, that it fits within the parameters of the \nbill under consideration. It addresses it in a slightly different way; \nthat is to say, whatever TARP funds are repaid, it reduces the amount \nof TARP authority available to be used.\n  I hope my colleagues will support this amendment. It is a responsible \nthing to do. These are taxpayer dollars. Many of us, when we supported \nthis last fall, had an understanding about how the funds would be used. \nThey were used differently. It would appear at this point that much of \nthe moneys put out under the program, which at the time we were told \nwould be paid back, that will not be the case. As much as half or more \nof this is probably going to be lost.\n  It seems to me the dollars that are paid back should not be recycled \nor reused. They ought to reduce the amount of TARP lending authority \nthat is available.\n  It is a fairly straightforward amendment. I urge colleagues to \nsupport it. At the appropriate time, I will ask for the yeas and nays.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I thank my colleague from South Dakota. I \nappreciate his cooperation in getting the amendment up and having a \nchance to debate it. It is my understanding, even though the debate may \nnot last long on this, there will be a vote probably sometime around \n2:15. That is the plan right now. So while we may not exhaust a lot of \ntime when we come back at 2:15, I ask unanimous consent that there be 2 \nminutes equally divided between the Senator from South Dakota and \nmyself for the benefit of our colleagues before a vote, to explain the \namendment once again before we actually have a vote. I ask unanimous \nconsent for that.\n  Madam President, I withhold that request.\n  Let me address the substance of the amendment. What all of us want, \nwithout exception, is to have this TARP money come back. This is \ntaxpayer money that went out last fall to shore up the financial \nsystem, to make it possible for the financial system to get stabilized \nand provide resources to either purchase toxic assets or legacy assets, \nas well as to make capital investments in order to provide stability to \ninstitutions that were at risk of becoming completely insolvent or \ngoing out of business entirely. History will ultimately judge whether \nthat decision was the right one or the wrong one. I happen to believe \nit was right. Most people concluded that it was, that had we not taken \nthat step, as difficult as it was, with the warnings of the Federal \nReserve Board and others that the financial system, in fact, globally, \ncould melt down if we did not act quickly--it was awfully difficult in \nthat environment to know exactly what was best. But given the time \nconstraints and the importance of the issue, this body acted. I think \nwe did so appropriately and properly.\n  The good news is that it is showing some glimmer of hope. I don't \nwant to overstate the case, but there are some indications that this is \nbeginning to work. Not that it will resolve itself overnight, but \ncertainly it is beginning to show the possibility of getting credit \nonce again moving.\n  The Senator from South Dakota offers an amendment that has a certain \nattractiveness, the idea that TARP money now coming back, as much as \nmaybe $25 billion, maybe more--certainly, we hope a lot more ultimately \nwill come back into the coffers of the Government--what do we do with \nthat TARP money at this juncture? If we adopt the amendment of the \nSenator from South Dakota, it would take those resources off the table. \nWe couldn't use them. What does that mean? It would mean that just at a \ntime when the so-called stress tests are being conducted--and none of \nus knows and won't know until this Thursday how many of these 19 \ninstitutions will actually need additional capital. We hope none do, \nbut I suspect some will. If that is the case, where does it come from?\n  I know this much about our colleagues: Whether you serve on one side \nor the other, none of us would rather go back and have to vote again on \nyet another tranche of TARP money. Wouldn't it be wiser, since the \npreviously passed legislation allows for any money that comes back into \nthe Government from these institutions repaying the TARP money, to \nrecycle that money rather than coming back again and asking for \nadditional money, which we may very well be asked to do very quickly?\n\n[[Page S5096]]\n\n  My concern with the amendment is, just at the very hour that we may \nneed some additional resources to either further capitalize or purchase \ntoxic assets, in either case to allow our economic recovery to move \nforward, we would be removing those resources altogether, once again \nforcing this institution to allocate additional resources. The more \nprudent step to take would be to utilize these resources coming back at \nthis critical moment in order to get this program working.\n  Why is that important? It isn't just about the financial \ninstitutions. In fact, if it were only about that, I suspect I know \nwhere 99 or 100 of us would be on that issue. The question isn't so \nmuch what happens to these major institutions in and of themselves; it \nis what happens to the people who depend upon them, those small \nbusinesses, midsize businesses that need credit lines in order to buy \ninventory, to pay employees. What happens to people who are seeking a \nmortgage, buying an automobile, dealing with student loans, dealing \nwith credit card debt? All of these issues are affected by what happens \nin the financial system as a whole. These are not separate entities \ndisconnected to the overall well-being of the economy. If you could \ndivorce them from the well-being of the economy, most would say amen \nand do so. But to suggest so is to not understand how the financial \nsystem has to operate.\n  At the very moment that we as a nation need to keep this ball moving \nin a direction that allows for the financial system to shed the toxic, \nclogging assets that are freezing up the circulatory system \nfinancially, we would be stepping back and forcing an institution to \nvote for additional resources. My political barometer tells me there \nare not the votes. I think most of my colleagues know that. At this \njuncture, we need to see a lot more about how this program is working \nbefore this institution is likely to vote again for an additional \nallocation of taxpayer money for the program. It may come to a point \nwhere the President will ask us for that. But I don't think we want to \njump to that option, particularly if we have resources coming off the \nTARP program that could be recycled for the next 11 months or so and \nthat we can properly use at a moment that it is needed.\n\n  That is the reason I will ask my colleagues to respectfully reject \nthis amendment. At this very hour, the last thing we need to be doing \nis deny the Treasury Department and others the resource capacity to \nrespond to a situation.\n  It is in one sense, on one level, about the financial institutions. \nBut in a far more profound and important way, it is about the people \nwho depend upon these institutions for their economic livelihood, their \neconomic well-being, their economic survival. That is not an \nexaggeration. Most businesses need credit in order to operate. If you \nstrangle credit and it does not move, then the people whom we care most \nabout--the small businesses on Main Street, that home purchaser, that \nother person out there struggling at this hour, when you are losing \n20,000 jobs a day, 10,000 homes every day through foreclosure, not to \nmention retirement accounts and other problems--at the very hour that \nthings seem to be just limping ever so slightly in the right direction, \nto deny these moneys to reinvest in the program and make it work and \ndepend upon the outcome of a vote here to provide additional resources \nwould be the wrong step in the wrong direction. The very people we want \nto see get back on their feet again would be the victims.\n  We have a tendency to focus on whether these institutions are \ndeserving of help. My colleagues may be divided on that point. I don't \nthink we are divided on whether we want to see the people who need the \ninstitutions get help. There, I think we all agree. So at the very hour \nwe agree about helping them, we deny them the ability to get the help \nthey need by depriving these resources to be reinvested in the \nacquisition of the very assets that are making it difficult for credit \nto move. That is the reason I am asking my colleagues to reject the \namendment when the vote occurs at 2:15.\n  Again, we will know on Thursday how many of these lending \ninstitutions are so-called ``passing the stress test.'' My hope is that \na majority of them are and that there would be very few, if any, that \nneed more capital. I suspect there will be some that do. Which is the \nbetter choice at that moment--to take some of this TARP money that has \ncome back and put that to use or take that off the table and have to \ncome back up here and seek a majority vote or a 60-vote margin? What is \nthe likelihood of that occurring? If it is not likely to occur and we \nstall out in this recovery, all of us would regret that.\n  So I appreciate very much the spirit with which Senator Thune offers \nthe amendment. We all agree we would like this money back. We would \nlike it back with interest. We would like to strengthen our economy, \nrestore that confidence and optimism that is critical for the success \nof the Nation. But we also recognize, as do most Americans, that we \nhave a time to go before this is going to result in the recovery we \nwould all like to see. This decision, at this juncture, could stall or \nset that effort back, not just days and weeks but months. None of us \nwants to be a party to that.\n  With those thoughts, at the appropriate time I will ask my colleagues \nto vote against the Thune amendment and move on to the remaining \namendments which we hope we can clean up this afternoon and finish \nvoting on this very important bill. This is a bill that is very \nimportant to our community bankers, to our folks out there trying to \nresolve how they can stay in their homes. It is very important to the \nFederal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the insurance fund, as well as \nto the national credit unions across the country. There are a lot of \nentities that do need this kind of help. It is a major step in getting \nour economy moving in the right direction. This amendment would set \nthat effort back and jeopardize this legislation from being adopted \nquickly at a time when we need it. With respect to the author of the \namendment, knowing his intentions and his motivations are certainly \nunderstandable, I think it is the wrong choice at this hour.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Dodd). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I commend the debate and the \nPresiding Officer's amendment and Senator Kerry for his amendment on \naddressing these issues of foreclosure. They are so significant in New \nYork, and we need action from Congress and the leadership of President \nObama on this issue.\n  This year, Congress and the administration have taken a number of \nactions to help our homeowners weather this housing crisis. We have \nworked to expand foreclosure counseling services, provide homeowners \nwith incentives to write down their debts, and to give local \ngovernments and States the tools they need to tackle this housing \ncrisis.\n  These efforts will help thousands of homeowners in my home State of \nNew York avoid losing their home. Homeowners are also not the only \nfolks affected by this housing crisis. Across the country, thousands of \ntenants who rent their homes have also been affected.\n  I remember talking to one friend up in Warren County, and he said to \nme: Can you please look out for the renters? We suffer in these times \nas well. And that is exactly right.\n  More than 30,000 renters across New York who are dutifully paying \ntheir rent on time every month may face eviction because they live in a \nbuilding that is about to be foreclosed. It is estimated that as much \nas 50 percent of foreclosures have renters involved in those \nproperties.\n  These tenants have almost no rights when a bank seizes their home. \nFamilies without the means to find temporary housing or to move into \nanother unit can literally get kicked out on the street because the \nlandlord has failed to meet his payments or his or her obligations.\n  For any family this is a horrible tragedy and something that is very \ndifficult to manage. For a low-income family with limited resources and \nwithout another place to stay, it is catastrophic. Families without the \nmeans\n\n[[Page S5097]]\n\nto find a temporary housing arrangement or to move into another unit \ncan be kicked onto the streets just because their landlord failed to \npay on time.\n  This is wrong, and I am proud to partner with the Presiding Officer \nand Senator Kerry to pass new protections for those families. This \namendment would allow any tenants in a foreclosed building the right to \nlive out their lease, providing them with the same protections any \nother renter would have. For a family without a lease, the amendment \nwould guarantee a minimum of 90 days' notice so that renters have the \ntime and the resources to find a new home.\n  As the housing crisis becomes more and more widespread, we need to \nmake sure we are not just helping homeowners stay in their homes but \nalso helping the thousands of tenants who are hit just as hard or even \nworse as a result of this crisis.\n  Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Under the previous order, there is \nnow 2 minutes of debate equally divided on amendment No. 1030 offered \nby the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune.\n  Who yields the time? The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, very briefly, to summarize, what my \namendment does is reduce TARP authority by any amount of principal \nreturned by a financial institution to the Treasury Department. This \namendment, as I said before, is necessary because until the December \n31, 2009, expiration date, and possibly longer if the Secretary is \ngranted an extension without this legislation, Treasury can continue to \nuse TARP funds, including those repaid, in any manner they see fit.\n  These are taxpayers' dollars. They should not become a discretionary \nslush fund. These are dollars that, when they are repaid to the \nTreasury by the financial institutions, ought to be used to reduce the \namount of TARP funding authority that is available.\n  As of May 1, the new administration has accumulated $580 billion of \nnew debt. That is about $5.5 billion new debt per day. I understand we \nshould not be tying Treasury's hands when we are still in the midst of \na financial crisis, but Congress has the responsibility to decide how \nthe tax money is spent, not the administration. If more money is needed \nin the financial sector, then Treasury needs to present a plan to the \nCongress and let those of us elected by the taxpayers decide whether \nadditional tax dollars should be placed at risk or spent.\n  That is what the amendment would do. I urge my colleagues to adopt \nit.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I want to take 1 minute. Let me say to my \ncolleagues, all of us would like to see the TARP money come back and we \nrecapture all of it. The danger in all this right now, with the stress \ntest coming out on Thursday, is to be utilizing the TARP money rather \nthan having to appropriate more money, it seems to me, to utilize TARP \nmoney to buy toxic assets and make the capital investments is what we \nwant to do. The last thing we want to do is come back here and vote for \nadditional money. Here is a moment when it is critically important that \nwe take advantage of the resources to continue the program, so that we \nbuy the assets, invest the capital necessary to get us out of this \nmess. At the very moment we want to be doing that, we will be back here \nvoting. I do not need to tell my colleagues, if we need new TARP money, \nhow difficult that would be. To avoid going down that road, utilizing \nthe money that has come back from these interests that have gotten \ntheir money makes a lot more sense to me, I respectfully say to my \nfriend from South Dakota.\n  This amendment could not come at a worse time. We are going to need \nthe capital for institutions that need help. They need help. I am not \ninterested in them. I am interested in their ability to provide credit \nto homeowners, small businesses, and student loans. The credit system \nis frozen. We need to unfreeze it. If you deny the ability to invest \nthese TARP dollars into buying assets and providing capital, it seems \nto me you slow down or set back that process considerably.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote against the \namendment. I thank my colleague for the intention behind it.\n  Have the yeas and nays been ordered?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The yeas and nays have been \nordered.\n  The question is on agreeing to amendment No. 1030. The clerk will \ncall the roll.\n  The legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus), \nthe Senator from South Dakota (Mr. Johnson), the Senator from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. \nRockefeller) are necessarily absent.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, we are waiting for someone to come with an \namendment. In the meantime, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BOND.

Reserving the right to object, and I will not object, if \nthe Senator could amend that to say Senator Boxer will be called on to \ntalk about a couple of amendments following his remarks, I would really \nappreciate it.\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, it will be an honor to ask that Senator \nBoxer, the chair of the EPW Committee on which I am proud to serve, be \nrecognized after my remarks are completed.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I thank the Senator.\n\n\n                             Guantanamo Bay\n\n  Mr. BOND. Mr. President, keeping the American people safe is the \nGovernment's highest priority. Keeping our Nation safe should not be a \npolitical issue; it is an American one. That is why I was disappointed \nwhen the White House made an early national security decision based on \npolitics and not what is in the best interests of keeping Americans \nsafe. I am talking about the President's plan to close the terrorist \ndetention center at Guantanamo Bay without a backup plan.\n  I have been sounding the alarm over this rash decision since the \nPresident announced it in January. But it is not just my side of the \naisle, the Republicans, who are questioning the President's decision to \nclose Guantanamo with no plan on how to handle the detainees, the \nterrorists housed there. Yesterday, Democratic House Appropriations \nCommittee chairman David Obey said, ``So far as we can tell there is no \nconcrete program.'' That is my point exactly.\n  This is a classic example of ``ready, fire, aim.'' That is a strategy \nwe cannot afford. I prefer aiming before shooting, which is why I keep \ncalling on the President to tell the American people how his plan to \nclose Guantanamo without any plans right now to deal with the detainees \nwill make our Nation safer.\n  The President needs to honor his pledge of transparency and provide \nthe American people with answers to these questions. How the President \nanswers these questions is even more important now that some of the \nterrorists could be coming soon to a neighborhood near you. That is \nright. Some of the terrorist-trained detainees could be coming to \nAmerican communities.\n  Last week the Obama administration admitted as much. Defense \nSecretary Gates testified before our Senate Appropriations Defense \nSubcommittee that as many as 100 Guantanamo detainees could be coming \nto the United States. Whether these terrorists are coming to a prison \nin nearby Kansas or a halfway house in a city in Missouri or any other \nState, I can tell you this: Americans do not want terrorists in their \nneighborhoods.\n  That is why, when we put it to a vote, the Senate voted 94 to 3 \nagainst importing detainees to American soil, even if that meant \ndeporting them to a maximum security prison.\n  Americans also do not want these terrorists sent back to the \nbattlefield to kill our troops. We know the terrorists detained at \nGuantanamo have gone back to fight even the ones who were supposed to \nbe less dangerous, less likely to do so. The Pentagon has confirmed \nthat at least 18 detainees who were released have gone back to the \nfight, and 43 more are suspected of doing the same.\n  There are no easy solutions. So instead of meeting an arbitrary \ndeadline to close Guantanamo Bay, I sincerely hope the White House will \nreconsider. I hope the President will realize that closing Guantanamo \nBay without having a plan to deal with the terrorists currently there \nand future terrorists captured on the battlefield is not in our \nNation's best interest. Closing Guantanamo with no plan, no plan, is \none campaign promise that cannot hold up to national security \npriorities.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado.) The clerk will call \nthe roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1035\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I will be offering two amendments, one of \nwhich is going to be second-degreed by Senator Ensign, a friendly \namendment we have worked with him on. So we will have a vote on that \namendment.\n  Then the final vote on the other Boxer amendment can be a voice vote \nwithout problem. But these are two amendments that are very important \nto the financial security of the country. One deals with the toxic \nasset purchase program, the other one deals with making sure our people \ncan actually renegotiate their mortgages if they are in trouble. I will \nstart with that one first.\n  It seems like common sense if you have a mortgage on your home, you \nought to know who holds the mortgage. But in today's real estate \nmarket, where the original lender often sells the loan to another \nentity, you can lose track and not know who actually owns your \nmortgage. So we are doing a very simple amendment--and I thank Senator \nDodd and staff, because they have worked so closely with us to draw \nthis up in a good way. It is very easy: When your mortgage is sold or \ntransferred, the homeowner must be informed who owns that mortgage. \nThis is the way it used to be years ago. I remember many times \nreceiving those notices but suddenly it stopped happening.\n  I want to give you the example of James and Mary Meyers, who took out \na high-rate home loan with Argent Mortgage in 2004. Because the loan \nviolated the truth-in-lending laws, they later attempted to exercise \ntheir Federal rights to cancel the loan. But the servicer, who happened \nto be Countrywide at the time, refused to identify who owned the loan. \nSo by the time the Meyers discovered that the current noteholder was \nDeutsche Bank, the deadline for canceling the loan had passed. The \ncourt dismissed the Meyers' claim, even though it found that there were \ngrounds, legitimately, for the Meyers to cancel the loan.\n  So this kind of hide-and-seek situation has real-life ramifications. \nIt certainly does with the President's plan now that says, if someone \nhas a mortgage that is under water, they can renegotiate, they have a \nchance. But if they do not know who holds the mortgage, it is a hollow \nkind of plan. We know that current law does require homeowners be \ninformed when the servicer of their loan has changed. That is in the \nlaw. And Federal law does require that the servicer tell the homeowner \nthe identify of the person holding their mortgage.\n  But servicers routinely ignore requests from homeowners for \ninformation on the noteholder. So this is pretty simple. Simply put, it \nis worth saying, if someone new is holding your mortgage, the servicer \nhas 30 days to inform you as to who that person is.\n  While servicers are required to disclose this information, there are \nno penalties in the law for noncompliance and no remedies for a \nhomeowner faced with a recalcitrant servicer.\n  The law has also failed to protect homeowners because there is no \nspecific requirement that servicers identify the agent or party with \nthe authority to act on behalf of the note holder.\n  The Boxer amendment provides borrowers with the basic right to know \nwho owns their loan by requiring that any time a mortgage loan is sold \nor transferred, the new note owner shall notify the borrower within 30 \ndays of the following: the identity, address, and telephone number of \nthe new creditor: the date of transfer; how to reach an agent or party \nwith the authority to act on behalf of the new creditor; the location \nof the place where the transfer is recorded; and any other relevant \ninformation regarding the new creditor.\n\n[[Page S5099]]\n\n  To be clear, the amendment does not require borrowers to receive a \nnotification every time a mortgage backed security with a slice of \ntheir mortgage changes hands. Those are transactions between investors \nand do not involve a change in ownership of the physical note.\n  This amendment only provides transparency and gives borrowers an \nadditional tool to fight illegitimate foreclosures or to negotiate loan \nmodifications that would keep them in their homes.\n  I do not understand why we have to have a vote on this. I know \nSenator Dodd has signed off on this. It is a very important amendment. \nI will read into the Record a list of those supporting this. It is a \nwhole list of consumer groups. I want to list who has endorsed this \namendment: the National Consumer Law Center, the National Association \nof Consumer Advocates, Consumer Action, the Consumer Federation of \nAmerica, Consumers Union, the National Association of Neighborhoods, \nthe National Council of La Raza, and the National Fair Housing \nAlliance.\n  This is a very narrowly targeted amendment with little cost to the \nindustry. But the benefit to homeowners and communities would be \nabsolutely enormous. So it is a simple amendment, common sense. I hope \nwe will have an overwhelming vote for it.\n  I want to make my statement at this time, and however the chairman \nwants to dispose of the amendment, if it is accepted by voice, that is \nfine with me. But if we have to do to a rollcall because we cannot \nclear it, I ask that we have a rollcall vote.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1038\n\n  The second amendment I will be offering is one that Senator Ensign \nwill be offering a second-degree amendment to. It is a very friendly \nsecond-degree amendment. Again, I thank the Banking staff on both sides \nof the aisle for working with us--Senator Dodd, in particular--to make \nthis a very good amendment.\n  What we are basically saying is, as we go into a new program which is \nthe Public-Private Investment Program, which basically says that when \nwe take toxic assets off the books of the banks, we want the private \nsector to come in and give a value to those assets, we do not want the \nGovernment doing it.\n  The private sector plays a very important role. What Senator Ensign \nand I believe is very important, and Chairman Dodd has agreed, is to \nmake sure it is a very clean process, and there is not a process for \ncollusion between the parties, and no chance to defraud, frankly, the \ntaxpayers.\n  How could that happen? Hypothetically, you can have a bank that is \ntrying to unload a toxic asset. They want the most they can get for it. \nThey can go to a private party and say: Hey, between us, bid a little \nbit more for this toxic asset, we will give you a kickback later. They \ncould not call it that. We will take care of you later. That is clearly \na no-no. You cannot do that.\n  Under the Boxer-Ensign language, that would not be allowed. The \nTreasury would put forward regulations to make sure it is not allowed. \nWe would give the TARP inspector general $15 million to perform audits \nof selected recipients so we can make sure we are following up with \naudits and making sure there is no collusion.\n  We would guarantee there is access to financial data from the Public-\nPrivate Investment fund that is necessary to perform these audits, and \nwe would require regulations that are very clear, so that--listen to \nthis--the private sector cannot use money they have borrowed from other \nFederal programs to pump into the system.\n  They might be able to use some loans, but we do not want 100 percent \nof that money being recycled again. In other words, they could take a \nloan from the Government, then they go buy an asset, and all of the \nmoney being used in the program is Government money.\n  The Boxer-Ensign amendment, which is endorsed by Senator Dodd, and I \nbelieve Senator Shelby, I believe has been signed off by both. If I \nmisspeak, I am sure I will be told that. It is a very ``good \ngovernment'' amendment.\n  It essentially says as we begin to buy these toxic assets from the \nbanks, we are going to make sure there is no collusion, no fraud, no \nconflict of interest. We are going to give the inspector general the \nability to get the information he or she needs to go in, perform an \naudit, and keep this program clean.\n  The last thing taxpayers want is another scandal that revolves around \nthese banks and all of the things they did before. So this is an \nimportant amendment.\n  At this time, I think I have explained both of my amendments. I await \nhearing from the chairman as to a time to come back and speak for \nperhaps a minute to generally summarize both of them.\n  Again, my deepest thanks to Senator Dodd. He has worked so hard. \nWithout his help, we could not be at this point on both these important \namendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Let me first thank our colleague from California for her \nleadership on this issue. They are very commonsense, straightforward \nproposals that we think can improve the legislation.\n  And it is almost, in a way--I was thinking, as my colleague and \nfriend was talking, it is almost sad that we have to have an amendment \nsuch as this. You would almost think that there has got to be some law \nsomeplace that would say what she is suggesting by her amendment would \nbe covered.\n  In a way it is a tragic commentary on the times we are in, the idea \nwhere we have to say that, by the way, collusion is not permissible. I \ndid not think it was anyway. But her amendment makes it certain in this \nlegislation that that is the case.\n  I am not sure the of order, but the first comments my colleague gave \nregarding information about their mortgages, again this is pretty \nstraightforward.\n  I see Senator Ensign is on the floor, and I will be brief, because I \nwant him to be able to offer his amendment so we can move forward.\n  But the idea that you can find out who owns the mortgage is pretty \nstraightforward. Those of us with a little gray hair on our head--and \nmy colleague from California has none, I want the Record to show.\n  Mrs. BOXER. It turned blond.\n  Mr. DODD. I do remember when I bought my first home, an old 1710 \ncenter chimney cape house in Connecticut. I went down to the Old Stone \nBank and got a mortgage. I could go down every day for as long as that \nmortgage was around and look at it, see it, and pick it up if I wanted \nto and hold it and do whatever I wanted to do with that mortgage.\n  Today, of course, because the world has changed, people buy a home--\nand, of course, put aside the issue of predatory lending and subprime \nmortgages and the rest--and that mortgage, within 8 to 10 weeks, on \naverage, is sold off. It is securitized, as they call it. This is true \nof a lot of debt. It is student loans, it is credit cards, it is all \nkind of debt that gets securitized.\n  By the way, that is not a bad thing, because that provides liquidity, \nthat provides assets for people so more people can afford to buy homes.\n  But the Senator from California has pointed out that you ought to \nknow who that is. That seems to me a logical request. If that mortgage \nhas been sold off, who owns it? So if a borrower wants to be able to do \nsomething with it, you ought not to have to go through and hire a \nprivate investigatory agency to find out who holds your mortgage.\n  So while we respect the idea that securitization can actually be \nbeneficial to the community at large, if it deprives that owner of the \nmortgage the opportunity to determine who is the holder of that \nmortgage, obviously then we have lost something in the process. The \nSenator from California has proposed a very worthwhile amendment.\n  The New York Times story of April 24, 2009, notes:\n\n       Advocates wanting to engage lenders ``face a challenge even \n     finding someone with whom to begin the conversation,'' \n     according to a report by NeighborWorks America. . . .\n\n  That is exactly what the Senator from California addresses with her \namendment. With whom do you begin the conversation? The conversation \nought to be with the person who is holding that instrument.\n  I endorse her amendment and urge my colleagues to do so as well.\n  Regarding the second amendment, the other amendment offered by \nSenator Boxer deals with the collusion\n\n[[Page S5100]]\n\nissue. I briefly addressed that previously by saying, in a way, I was \nalmost sad to hear her offering the amendment. I was under the \nimpression that was against the law anyway. The idea we are offering an \namendment to further corroborate that collusion in these matters ought \nto be against the law. If it is not, it ought to be.\n  I commend the Senator from California and her colleague from Nevada \nfor offering the amendment, along with Senators Pryor and Snowe. This \namendment is clearly a step in the right direction from where we were \nlast week. I do want to say the administration has some concerns. My \ncolleagues know that. They have talked about them. I have listened to \nthem.\n  I am not suggesting their concerns are illegitimate, but I believe \nthe value of the amendment trumps their concerns. I think we have done \nenough to continue to move forward, and it is the right step to be \ntaking. This is an important effort. I support the Ensign second-degree \namendment to the Ensign-Boxer amendment however that amendment is \ndescribed.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1038 to Amendment No. 1018\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, my understanding is we are ready to go on \nthe Ensign second-degree amendment. So is it not appropriate for me to \nsend the Boxer amendment to the desk at this time?\n  Mr. DODD. Certainly.\n  Mrs. BOXER. I call up my amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from California [Mrs. Boxer] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1038 to amendment No. 1018.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER.

I rise to talk about the Ensign-Boxer-Pryor-Snowe \namendment. The four of us have worked on this amendment. It is a \nsecond-degree amendment, but it is a friendly second-degree amendment \nto the Boxer amendment. I commend all four offices and our staffs that \ndid superwork over the last several days to come up with the language. \nIt is not compromising language; it is strengthening language. This is \ngreat bipartisan work to increase the oversight of this program known \nas the Public-Private Investment Program or as some call it, PPIP.\n  The special inspector general of TARP has stated that PPIP is \n``inherently vulnerable to fraud, waste, and abuse.'' Our amendment \nwould go a long way to protect taxpayers from such fraud, waste, and \nabuse.\n  Most of my colleagues would agree Congress gave far too long of a \nleash to the Treasury when it created TARP. I know few people who \nbelieve the program has been completely successful so far. The PPIP \nwould represent the most ambitious and complex undertaking yet for TARP \nand by far the riskiest use of TARP funds to date. Let's not make the \nsame mistakes with PPIP that we have made with the rest of the TARP \nfund so far.\n  Our amendment would establish key oversight, transparency, and \nconflict-of-interest safeguards before the program begins, not after. \nOur amendment will impose strict conflict of interest rules to prevent \nPPIP fund managers from inappropriately using the program to benefit \nthemselves or their clients. It will require these rules be in place \nbefore any Government funds can be used in the new program. The \namendment requires rigorous investor screening procedures and robust \nethics policies for the Public-Private Investment Program funds. It \nwill require Treasury to issue regulations governing how the program \nand the Federal Reserve's TALF Program can interact to avoid excessive \nand dangerous over-leveraging.\n  Lastly, our amendment calls for significant and improved oversight \nand transparency of PPIP. The amendment also preserves the language \nfrom the underlying Boxer-Snowe amendment that provides the special \ninspector general of TARP with an additional $15 million to conduct \naudits and investigations of this new program.\n  The American people are demanding more accountability and \ntransparency from their Government. President Obama campaigned over and \nover on change and promised to lead the most open administration ever. \nLet's send a message to the country that we are backing up that \nrhetoric with action. Let's shine sunlight on the TARP's newest program \nfrom its inception, not once mistakes have been made. Let's put the \nsafeguards in place from the start of PPIP to protect against fraud and \nwaste rather than waiting until after abuses occur.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of the Ensign-Pryor-Boxer-\nSnowe amendment.\n  I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There appears to be a sufficient second.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. I yield the floor.\n  Mr. DODD. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1026 to Amendment No. 1018\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and bring up DeMint amendment No. 1026.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered. The clerk \nwill report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from South Carolina [Mr. DeMint] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1026 to amendment No. 1018.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the use of Troubled Asset Relief Program funds \n       for the purchase of common stock, and for other purposes)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. __. LIMITATION ON USE OF TARP FUNDS.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, on and after \n     April 22, 2009, no funds made available to carry out the \n     Troubled Asset Relief Program may be used for the acquisition \n     of ownership of the common stock of any financial institution \n     assisted under title I of the Emergency Economic \n     Stabilization Act of 2008, either directly or through a \n     conversion of preferred stock or future direct capital \n     purchases.\n\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I would like to take a few moments to \nexplain this amendment. I appreciate the chairman allowing me to offer \nthis amendment. It relates to what we call\n\n[[Page S5102]]\n\nTARP funds or troubled asset funds we passed last year.\n  If I can take my colleagues through a little bit of history on how \nthis happened, at the end of last year, the President and the Secretary \nof the Treasury came to us and explained a very dire crisis, not only \nin the United States but the world, that the whole financial system was \non the verge of collapse, and if we did not pass this $700 billion \nTroubled Asset Recovery Program, it was very likely we would have \nfinancial chaos and even depression in the United States and around the \nworld.\n  It was a pretty stunning presentation. It curiously lacked a lot of \nfacts. There were no PowerPoint slides or statistics or graphs. It was \nmore: Trust us, we know this is going to happen. We need to pass this \nimmediately.\n  What they were going to do with the funds--and Secretary Paulson was \nvery specific--was they were going to take this money and buy troubled \nassets in financial organizations that were too big to fail, that if \nthey failed, it would cause severe problems all around the world. We \nwere being told that unless we pass this money and use it immediately--\nand they were talking within 24 to 48 hours--to buy troubled assets, \nthe financial system in this country so many depended on would \ncollapse.\n  At this point, after hearing a number of stories, we started this \ntime last year mailing out checks, mortgage bailouts, all kinds of \nspending programs. None of it worked. None of it had been done exactly \nlike they said it would. I did not trust the whole process. This was a \nRepublican President. I voted against it, but many of my colleagues \nvoted to pass the troubled asset funds to buy toxic assets, troubled \nassets in this country and around the world.\n  It passed, and the President signed it. Not one of these troubled \nassets has been purchased. Not one. A funny thing happened. The world \nfinancial system did not collapse. The people who told us it would \neither did not have the facts or they were not telling us the truth.\n  What they did with the money was loan some to the banks. Some of the \nbanks had to have it immediately, apparently, or they would fail. They \nwere too big to fail. We had to have the money.\n  What our Government did was go to a whole lot of other banks that \nwere doing OK and say: You have to take this too. If you don't take it, \nthen it will be harder for these other banks to take it. We need to \nhave this money spread around. They did not buy the toxic assets. They \nloaned it to banks and put a lot of pressure on other banks to take it. \nAs soon as they did, we got more and more involved with their business, \nregulators on the banks' backs. Some of the banks want to give it back. \nGuess what. We won't let them unless they pass some kind of test.\n  The Government has moved closer and closer--it kind of reminds me of \nthe children's story, ``The Gingerbread Man.'' It is was one of my \nfavorite stories growing up. If you remember, an older couple did not \nhave any children. The husband was out working in the garden. The wife \nwas making some gingerbread. She had a little left over and made a \ngingerbread man and put him in the oven. An hour or so later, she heard \nsome rattling in the oven, opened it, and out jumped a gingerbread man. \nThe gingerbread man ran around. She couldn't catch it. It ran out of \nthe house. The husband tried to catch him. All they heard from the \ngingerbread man was: Run, run, run as fast as you can, you can't catch \nme, I am the gingerbread man.\n  Long story. The gingerbread man ran through the whole community. The \ntownspeople were chasing him. The horses and the mules and everyone \nwere chasing the gingerbread man, who kept saying: Run, run, as fast as \nyou can, you can't catch me, I am the gingerbread man.\n  The gingerbread man came to a wide river and not accustomed to \nswimming--gingerbread probably doesn't hold up real well in a river--he \nwas stuck with all the town running behind him. Then appeared a fox \nthat offered to give him a ride across the river. The gingerbread man \nwas real suspicious. He knew that fox would probably eat him. The fox \nsaid: Don't worry, you can sit way back on my back on my tail way away \nfrom my mouth. No trouble, not to worry. Gingerbread man didn't have a \nlot of choice. He jumped right on his back.\n  As the fox got out farther and farther in the river, he sank a little \ndeeper and deeper. Gingerbread man howled and jumped up a little closer \non his neck. Out a little farther, the fox went down a little bit \ndeeper. Gingerbread man jumped right up on his head. As he got close to \nthe other side, he started sinking his head down and gingerbread man \njumped right up on his nose, and as soon as he did, slap, gingerbread \nman was in the mouth and gone.\n  Gingerbread man is a lot like our free market system, free enterprise \nsystem, and what our whole free market system is in America--fast, \ndynamic, made our country exceptional and prosperous. Our banking \nsystem is the same way. Some of the greatest people in our communities \nare running banks.\n  With this TARP program, what we did is similar to a fox. We invited \nour whole financial system to jump on the back of the Federal \nGovernment. What they told us they were going to do they did not do, \nand each time the Government took another step, a different step, like \nthe gingerbread man and the fox, the gingerbread man jumped closer and \ncloser to the mouth.\n  What our whole free market system is doing now is sitting on the nose \nof the fox, the Federal Government, which keeps taking us deeper and \ndeeper into this river. The Federal Government did not buy toxic \nassets. They kind of pushed loans out into the market. They said they \nhad to do that.\n  Now we see where they are, telling us this does not look good on the \nbooks of banks for it to be a loan. So we are going to just change the \nbalance sheet from a loan to an asset. We are going to turn these loans \ninto common stock, equity, which will make the Federal Government \nowners in the banks, voting owners.\n  Folks, there is kind of a sacred line in this country we had not \ncrossed. There is a separation between what the Government does and \nwhat the private sector does, and this Government does not own private \ncompanies. But just like this fox, we have been led into this thing \nwith misinformation--I hope that is all it is and not outright \ndeception--but we are at the point where the Government is now telling \nus they are going to own a lot of these banks. They will not let them \ngive it back. They are going to convert it to ownership. All these \nprivate companies out there are going to be owned, in part, by the \nFederal Government.\n  What we are hearing from investors--Chairman Bernanke said it at \nlunch today--is when they are trying to get people to invest in \nfinancial institutions, what they are finding is a strange thing. The \nprivate investors, smart investors, do not want to get in bed with the \nFederal Government because they do not know what we are going to do. \nThey have every reason not to know what we are going to do because we \nhave yet to do what we said we were going to do with this $700 billion, \nwhich will ultimately be over $1 trillion, with which we are now \nplaying in the private stock market.\n  As we pass this bill that is supposed to protect homeowners, I am \noffering an amendment. It is an amendment that would force this \nGovernment to do at least part or keep it from going further than it \nalready has into the private sector. It would prohibit the Government \nfrom converting these loans, which are sometimes referred to as \npreferred stock now. It is not voting. It would prohibit them from \nconverting this to common stock, to ownership, to equity in these \nbanks.\n  It should not surprise anyone. We were told this would not happen in \nthe first place. We were told the money was going to buy these toxic \nassets. This amendment would at least put up a firewall that says: You \ncannot go any further, fox; you cannot take over private enterprise in \nAmerica.\n  A lot of my colleagues are going to give a lot of excuses why they \ncannot vote for this amendment, but I hope America is looking in at \nthis and remembering that it was not this Government that made this \ncountry great, that made us exceptional and prosperous and good, that \nput us on the top of the world in a lot of ways, the envy of the world. \nIt was not this Government. It was a limited government. It was free \nmarkets and free people.\n\n  This Government now has pushed and pushed and intervened in the \nprivate market to the point where it is not\n\n[[Page S5103]]\n\nworking. We wonder why people are not investing and why the markets are \nerratic. Because no one knows what the Federal Government is going to \ndo once it starts playing in the stock market in this country, once it \nstarts arbitrarily converting loans that were for a crisis to own our \nbanks, to own our private companies.\n  They took the TARP money and made loans to General Motors. What are \nthey going to do with that? They are going to convert it to common \nstock so this Federal Government owns General Motors.\n  That is not America. That is not free markets. That is not free \nenterprise. That is not what we signed up for, and we shouldn't allow \nit.\n  This amendment is pretty simple: Government, you cannot go any \nfurther. Enough is enough. You cannot convert these loans to common \nstock. We are going to have a firewall between where you are now and \nwhere you want to go.\n  Folks, we cannot let them go any further. We have lost the line \nbetween Government and the private sector. The Government is not set up \nto manage things and control things. Everything we try to do, we mess \nup. What we are here for is to develop a framework of law and \npredictable regulations so free markets and free people can operate. We \nare not set up to manage auto companies.\n  I was in a meeting this morning talking about how we were going to \nmanage General Motors and Chrysler. I have been in a lot of boardrooms \nbecause I have done a lot of strategic planning for private companies \nin my lifetime. It is so obvious, we do not have the capability to \nmanage a dynamic, complex, global marketplace. That is central \nplanning. That is what Karl Marx thought we could do. But every time it \nhas been tried in the history of the world, it has failed because there \nis no way a legislative body and a large national government such as \nthis can manage the private sector.\n\n  What happens, though, is we get involved, we make things worse, and \nthen we say we need more government to solve the problem. We are doing \nthat now with AIG, the largest insurance company in the country. We \nhave gotten in, we own most of the stock, mismanagement is rampant, and \nwe are talking about we need more government, we need more money. \nFolks, it doesn't work.\n  I would encourage my colleagues to consider what I think we are \nhearing from all across America: Enough is enough. We can't do this \nunder the guise of one crisis after another. Let's stop this rampage of \nthe Federal Government into our private lives, the free markets, the \nwhole concept of America. Please support this amendment that would stop \nthe conversion of loans--TARP money--into common stock. It is a simple \nconcept. We shouldn't be able to excuse our way around this one.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield back, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                             Climate Change\n\n  Mr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, a recent Wall Street Journal op-ed \nhighlighted a dangerous game that is being played right now by this \nadministration and by the Environmental Protection Agency, and it is a \ngame that is being played with the American public about which I have \ngreat concerns. The piece in the Wall Street Journal was entitled \n``Reckless Endangerment: The Obama EPA plays 'Dirty Harry' on cap and \ntrade.'' The article refers to the Russian roulette style of \nnegotiating that is going on right now by cap and tax advocates who \nwant to pass the President's energy tax in this Congress.\n  The administration and the majority of the leadership in the House \nand the Senate have created a regulatory ticking timebomb. It is called \nthe Environmental Protection Agency's endangerment finding. Well, they \nwant to use this ticking timebomb as a threat to get the President's \nenergy tax passed. They are putting this regulatory timebomb on the \nkitchen table of Americans all across the country. The message to \nAmericans: Your tax money or your livelihood. This is not an idle \nthreat. If allowed to proceed, the irresponsible use of the Clean Air \nAct will require the EPA to regulate any building, any structure, any \nfacility, any installation that emits above a certain amount of carbon \ndioxide. The result would be thousands of lost jobs, with no \nenvironmental benefit to be seen from it. Hospitals, schools, farms, \ncommercial buildings, and nursing homes will be required to obtain \npreconstruction permits for their activities.\n  Further, when you talk to the legal scholars, they will tell you that \nthe statutory language is mandatory and does not leave any room for the \nEPA to exercise discretion or to create any exceptions. That is the \nproblem. The only jobs this option will create are in law firms, as the \nlitigation bonanza begins. EPA is going to be sued by environmental \ngroups wanting to eliminate exempted sectors. The EPA will also be sued \nby industries that are not exempted. How is the EPA going to respond to \nall these legal challenges? I asked EPA Administrator Jackson. She says \nshe can target what she taxes. She claims she is only going to target \ncars and trucks. Well, that really is setting a precedent of choosing \nwinners and losers. We don't know what standards will be applied to \nmake those decisions. We do not know what role politics will play in \nthe decisions. Jackson's statement also ignores the regulatory cascade \nthat the endangerment finding in the motor vehicle emission standards \nwill trigger. Litigators and courts will drive much of this job-killing \nregulation.\n  We now have a nominee to head up the EPA's Air Office--Mrs. Regina \nMcCarthy. We have an Administrator of the EPA and a climate and energy \nczar who is supposed to coordinate climate change policy for the \nadministration. Well, Carol Browner, the climate and energy czar, has \nnot been confirmed by Congress--not by this Congress--at all. We do not \nknow who is developing this roadmap for how to hijack the Clean Air Act \nto regulate climate change. What jobs and what industries will be kept? \nWhat industries will be penalized? Who will be held accountable for \nmaking the decisions? The American people--the people at home in \nWyoming whom I talk to--are demanding answers to these questions.\n  The economic consequences will be devastating. By the EPA's own \nestimate, the typical preconstruction permit in 2007 cost each \napplicant $125,000. And how much time do they have to put into this \nwork? Well, on average, 866 hours just to fill out the paperwork. If \nyou are a small business, a farm, or a private nursing home, you have \nno background in this area. It takes a lot of time and effort, so you \nneed to hire lawyers and you need to hire experts. That costs thousands \nof dollars that are nowhere in your budget. You are taking time out of \nthe day to figure out all this redtape. While you are spending that \ntime and that money, you are not running your business.\n  This is going to create such a fog of uncertainty--uncertainty with \ninvestors, uncertainty with small businesses. It is going to make it \nthat much harder for small businesses to borrow money, to get a \nbusiness loan. Nobody is going to know how much this is going to cost \ntheir business. If you take a look at our economic situation, with \nlending in this country having slowed down significantly, this is \nhardly the right move now for our country and for our economy.\n  According to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, there are 1.2 million \nschools, hospitals, nursing homes, farms, small businesses, and other \ncommercial entities that are not currently covered under these \npreconstruction permits, and they are going to be vulnerable to the new \ncontrols, to new monitoring, to new paperwork, and to new litigation. \nIf even 1 percent of these 1.2 million have to get preconstruction \npermits, well, that would mean 12,000 new preconstruction permits this \nyear. By the EPA's own analysis, if permitting is increased by just \n2,000 to 3,000, that would impose what they call significant new costs \nand an administrative burden on permitting authorities. How much of a \nburden? How much cost? Those permitting authorities are the EPA and the \n43 States that participate in the program.\n\n[[Page S5104]]\n\nThe EPA said that the burden ``could overwhelm permitting \nauthorities.''\n  The net result of all of this is going to be thousands of jobs lost. \nAccording to the Heritage Foundation, the job losses are estimated to \nreach 800,000. Well, if Carol Browner, Administrator Jackson, or Mrs. \nMcCarthy cannot tell us how they will protect American jobs from court \nchallenges, if they can't tell us by what legal authority--legal \nauthority--they can pick the winners and losers, if they cannot provide \neconomic certainty to lenders and small businesses, if they do not know \nhow they will process all the thousands of new preconstruction permits, \nthen they should take this option--this option they have proposed, this \noption that kills jobs--and they should take it off the table.\n  I have tried to get answers to these questions from the nominee who \nwill most directly oversee this process--Mrs. McCarthy. I placed a hold \non her nomination because these are questions that still need to be \nanswered. I am committed to working with her in a constructive way to \nget answers to the questions because I believe we do need to chart a \nnew course, a course that makes America's energy as clean as we can, as \nfast as we can, without hurting small businesses and without raising \nenergy prices on American families.\n  We should start by not taking any clean energy source off the table. \nThat means fossil fuels fitting with new carbon capture technology. \nThat means exploring for oil and natural gas in an environmentally \nfriendly way, using new technologies. That means promoting carbon-\nneutral nuclear energy. That means funding renewable energies--wind and \nsolar, geothermal, and hydropower. We need it all. An all-of-the-above \nenergy approach is the key to solving our energy problem for this \nNation. I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to achieve this goal for America.\n  Mr. President, I yield floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I was listening to what my colleague, \nSenator Barrasso, said about the Environmental Protection Agency, and I \nknow it is a little bit off the work Senator Dodd is doing, but I hope \nhe won't mind if I take about 3 minutes to respond.\n  I think what is so interesting is that under the Bush administration, \nthe Environmental Protection Agency drafted the endangerment finding. \nThey found that pollution in the form of greenhouse gas emissions--this \nis the Bush administration--was absolutely an endangerment to the \nAmerican people. That is the Bush administration.\n  You may say: Gee, why didn't I hear about that? I will tell you why. \nThe EPA sent that endangerment finding, that proposed endangerment \nfinding, over to the White House, and it was labeled, as you get your \ne-mails, ``proposed endangerment finding.'' There was advice \nimmediately from the lawyers over at the Bush White House not to open \nthe endangerment finding--not to read it, not to look at it, not to \nconsider it, not to open it because, they said, once it was open, it \nwas in the public domain and the public would learn that, indeed, \nclimate change is an endangerment to the people of this country. We are \ntalking about extreme weather events. We are talking about organisms \nthat do not live in cold waters, but when the waters get warm, they \ncarry disease to our kids. We saw a case in Arizona where that \nhappened: organisms that never lived in these rivers and streams are \nnow living there. Heat stroke. And that is not to mention the issue of \nthe rising waters, that is not to mention the national security issues, \nand that is not to mention the fact that the way out of this economic \nmess is to say: We are going to look at this challenge and we are going \nto respond to it in a way that will create clean jobs, in a way that \nwill lead us out of this morass and lead us to economic prosperity.\n  Anyone who has read Thomas Friedman's book ``Hot, Flat, and Crowded'' \nknows that the country that gets on top of this issue of clean energy \nand clean energy jobs will lead the world. So for my colleague to get \nup and say: I am holding up the Obama nominees--that is the party of \nno. That is the party of no, no, no. They want to keep this information \nfrom the American people.\n  Then they talk about lawsuits and the rest. Well, the fact is that \nthe old EPA was sued repeatedly by community groups and environmental \ngroups because they weren't following the law, and every single time, \nthey lost. So the Supreme Court comes down on the side of cleaning up \npollution. I am not afraid of lawsuits because the fact is, the people \nwill win the lawsuits.\n  My message to the EPA is very simple. It is very different from \nSenator Barrasso, who is holding up qualified nominees--Republicans. \nThey are Republicans they are holding up whom President Obama wants to \nput into his circle of advisers on the environment. This one particular \nwoman I believe served, Senator Dodd, your State for Republican \nGovernor Rell, and they are holding her up. They are holding her up.\n  Why? Because they want to continue being the party of no. No, don't \nopen up the endangerment finding; no, don't trust the people with the \ninformation; no, don't think about making polluters pay; no, we are not \ngoing to go to clean energy and clean jobs and all the prosperity that \nwill come forward with that. It is a sad day.\n  My friend and I, John Barrasso and I, are very good friends. We like \neach other. We work together when we can. But on this one he will admit \nand I will admit we do not share a common view. My view is that science \nshould dictate what we do on the health front and the revival of this \neconomy should dictate what we invest in here, so we invest in these \nhigh technologies and we create good, clean jobs. I am very sad to hear \nthat my friend will be holding up, and saying no, to some good people.\n  I understand his point of view. He has every right to do it. But I \nhope we will file a cloture motion and I hope we will be able to say to \nthe party of no: Please, there was an election. President Obama won. He \ndeserves to have the people in place that he thinks will give him good \nadvice. If you do not like the advice, then legislate against it. But \ndon't hold up good people.\n  They are doing it every day. The party of no, no, no, no. The \nAmerican people want us to work together for their benefit and the \nbenefit of their children and their grandchildren. My message to the \nEPA is do not be bullied into not doing your job. The endangerment \nfinding you have made provisionally is very close to the same \nendangerment finding the scientists made under George W. Bush. The \ndifference is, this administration is not going to hide it from the \nAmerican people. We are going to look at it and we are going to figure \nout a way to respond to it in such a manner that jobs will be created, \nexports will be created, technologies will come to the fore. To the \nparty of no, I say look inside yourself. The days of the old energy are \ncoming to an end. They are too polluting, they are too costly, they are \nsubject to the whims of foreign dictators.\n  I remember when George W. Bush went over and kissed the Saudi \nprince--I was a little surprised at that--begging, begging Saudi \nArabia: Oh, please, please, let us have more oil. And the price went up \nand up and up. Frankly, it was not until the Democrats here demanded \nthat there be some remedy for price fixing--it was not until then that \nthe prices started going down, because there was manipulation. We know \nthat.\n  I am disappointed that Senator Barrasso, an important member of the \nEnvironment Committee--this is the Environment Committee he is from. It \nis not the polluting committee. Let's get on with our work. Let's do \nwhat is right for the health of the American people. Let's do what is \nright for the workers in America. Let's develop the technologies. Let's \nnot stand up here, hold decent people up, don't let them get a vote, \nstop them because you are a little angry that, yes, you did lose the \nelection; and yes, times are changing; and yes, you have to recognize \nthat Lisa Jackson is not Stephen Johnson--who came from a pesticide \nbackground, for God's sake.\n  One thing I found as I look at this administration that I admire--and \nI do not agree with every single thing they do or say--but I have to \nsay this, they are putting people in place who care about the issue \nthey are supposed to care about. You remember what happened over there \nwith, ``Brownie, you\n\n[[Page S5105]]\n\nare doing a great job at FEMA,'' and we had Hurricane Katrina. Brownie \nhad come from the Arabian horses industry. That was his expertise.\n  Stephen Johnson, EPA, came from a pesticide background. That was his \nbackground to head up the Environmental Protection Agency.\n  Then you had others. You had Spencer Abraham, a nice man. He voted to \neliminate the Department of Energy when he was a Senator, and he got to \nbe put in charge of--you got it--the Department of Energy.\n  I have a great committee I am privileged to chair, but I am \ndistressed that we have to file cloture and stop a filibuster on \nperfectly well-qualified people, some of whom are Republicans, who are \nbeing stopped here by my friend. It is discouraging. But I am \noptimistic and I know we will get these important nominees through, \neven though we have to take the time to fight a filibuster and file \ncloture and get 60 votes. I am convinced we can do it--in closing--\nbecause the American people do not want us to be the party of no, no, \nno. They want us to be the Senate that is going to bring about positive \nchange for the American people.\n  I say to Senator Dodd, thank you for your indulgence here.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1026\n\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am going to respond, if I may, to our \ncolleague from South Carolina, Senator DeMint, who offered an \namendment, No. 1026, a few minutes ago. Senator Barrasso and Senator \nBoxer were talking about the Environment Committee and the work that \ngoes on there a little bit, and I digressed a little bit when that \nsubject matter came up, but I want to bring it back to his amendment \nwhich we will vote on, I hope, in a few minutes--maybe a couple of \namendments. I notify my colleagues we will try to get at least two \nvotes together so we don't bring people over for just one vote, if we \ncan do that.\n  The amendment of the Senator from South Carolina, as I think I \nunderstand it--but correct me here--would prohibit the Federal \nGovernment from either purchasing or converting preferred stock to \ncommon stock. This is not a mandate as in present law, it is the option \nof converting preferred to common stock.\n  Why is that an important issue? My colleague from South Carolina went \non at some length to talk about the overriding issue, going back to \nlast fall, as to whether there should be any program at all of the so-\ncalled Emergency Economic Stabilization Act that provided the resources \nto try to get our financial system on its feet again. That was a very \nsignificant debate. Seventy-five of our colleagues in this Chamber, \nDemocrats and Republicans, agreed with President Bush at the time. \nCandidate Obama and our colleague John McCain, as well as many others, \non a bipartisan basis, called for the support of that effort. They \naccepted the notion as we were told by the chairman of the Federal \nReserve Board, Mr. Bernanke, along with the Secretary of the Treasury \nand others across the political spectrum, that acting at that point was \ncritically important if we were going to stabilize this economy and try \nto get it back on its feet.\n  History will probably write for many decades to come about that \ndecisionmaking process, of the wisdom of it or the lack thereof. I am \nconfident as I stand here today that, while certainly not a well-\nmanaged program for a good many weeks, the absence of doing anything, \njust doing nothing at the time, I think would have created a far bigger \nproblem, a far more serious problem, probably a problem it would be \nalmost difficult to imagine how it would be overcome had that action \nnot been taken. That in no way minimizes how the program was managed, \nfor those who raised serious issues, and still is the subject of \nsignificant debate here.\n  My friend from South Carolina says the Treasury Department should not \nbe allowed to convert preferred stock to common stock. Why is that an \nimportant issue in the context of what we are talking about?\n  First, understanding what preferred stock is, and common stock--\npreferred stock is almost a debt obligation on which dividends are \npaid. The whole point is the value of it is in the dividend. With \ncommon stock, of course, the value changes based on how well the \ncompany is doing. If the company is doing well, the common stock goes \nup. If they are not doing well, the common stock goes down, unlike \npreferred shares. So in terms of what is real capital, what is real \ncapital is common stock. Preferred shares are not seen as being real \ncapital.\n  I gather we have had today, as the Presiding Officer knows we have \nevery Tuesday, the respective two parties gather in our respective \nrooms to have lunch to talk about the issues of the day. I am told by \nseveral of my friends on the Republican side that Chairman Bernanke was \nthe guest at the Republican Conference lunch today and answered \nquestions from our Republican colleagues. I gather one of the questions \nwas--and certainly it was a question he received from us when we met, \neither alone or together--why aren't banks lending more? We put all \nthis capital up. Why aren't they putting more money out the door to \nsmall business and others to help our economy get moving?\n  I gather Chairman Bernanke expressed the same frustration, that the \nregulators are being overly restrictive, in some ways threatening these \nlending institutions, not doing enough to encourage them that they \nought to step up and get that capital out, get that credit moving \nagain.\n  My colleagues on the Republican side heard from the Chairman of the \nFederal Reserve today and raised a very good question, raised by one of \nmy colleagues--I don't know which one it was who raised the issue--but \na very good question: Why aren't the banks lending more?\n  It seems to me if we accept the DeMint amendment we are going to make \nthe answer even more difficult because what our lending institutions \nneed is obviously capital--whether private capital or otherwise, they \nneed capital. This is not a requirement under existing law that is \nmandating converting preferred to common, but at a time when we want \nlending institutions to get more capital, allowing the Treasury to make \nthat conversion where and if they see it as appropriate exactly \naddresses the question that was raised at the luncheon today: Why \naren't banks lending more? Why aren't they providing that kind of \nassistance to small businesses and others?\n\n  This is not about the Government taking over these entities. I don't \nknow of anyone who supports that idea. We are taking positions in these \ncompanies far larger than most of us would like, and I hope and I \nbelieve it to be the case that as soon as the moment is appropriate we \nare going to be selling this off and getting out of it as fast as we \ncan. My colleague from South Carolina is correct--I think all of us \nagree with him--it is not the business of Government to become bank \nmanagers or to run automobile companies or to run commercial \nenterprises. This country has not grown and prospered and done as well \nas it has in two-and-a-quarter centuries because Government has run \nthese entities. Quite the opposite.\n  But at a critical time such as this, when our economy is facing the \nworst crisis since the Great Depression, in almost 100 years, taking \npositions, getting capital moving on these legacy assets or toxic \nassets is absolutely essential if we are going to get back on track \nagain.\n  I am not suggesting that every idea we have had is one that is \nworking. But the idea of saying in this case you have no right, I am \ngoing to prohibit you, absolutely mandate that the Treasury Department \ncannot convert any preferred shares to any common shares, seems to me \nthe kind of overreaching, in a way, in a moment such as that, that my \ncolleague from South Carolina is arguing against and I agree with him. \nWe should not be restricting, in a sense, the ability of people to have \nthe flexibility to respond to a situation and allow this situation to \nimprove.\n  There is a second reason. We are talking about TARP moneys here. What \nare TARP moneys? TARP money is taxpayer money. That is the American \ntaxpayers' money. That is what TARP money is. We want to get back this \nmoney. We have been told these are loans. We hope they are, that we are \nactually going to get money back.\n  You don't get money back necessarily with preferred shares. You get \nit back with common shares. In any\n\n[[Page S5106]]\n\ncase, if we are looking to see the Government realize any gain on the \nsale of its common shares after the economy recovers, as we all hope \nand believe it will, the Government's upside potential is far greater \nwith common shares than it would be under an amendment offered by the \nSenator from South Carolina where we would not be allowed to convert \npreferred to common.\n  I want to make it clear I am not necessarily advocating this be the \ncase, but I don't want to so restrict the Treasury from making those \nmoves to adversely affect the taxpayer when we could have a far greater \nbenefit if in fact there are common shares coming back in. If that \ncompany or entity improves its value, the taxpayer is the clear \nbeneficiary of that if in fact we are holding common shares.\n  Not allowing the Treasury to make that conversion could directly have \nan adverse reaction for the American taxpayer who is expecting some \nreturn on this--not to mention, of course, the ability to get capital \ninto these entities which is essential if lending is going to occur.\n  We can go back and debate September and October and I presume history \nwill debate that. But we made that decision and these resources are \nbeing far better managed today than they were in the first 60 days or \nso of that program. Today, to restrict this Department, this Treasury \nfrom making these kinds of decisions would be a major blow at the very \nhour we are going to maybe need this capital in order to get these \nentities back on their feet.\n  Why is that important? It has little or nothing to do with the \nentities themselves. If that were the only argument, I would not be \nstanding here and making it. It is not about the institutions we are \ngetting the capital to, it is about the facilities, the businesses that \nrequire capital in order for credit to flow. So we spend a lot of time \ntalking about the capital that goes into these larger institutions. The \nonly reason we talk about it is because the financial system requires \nthat if credit is going to move to small businesses, to homeowners and \nthe like, when that small business shows up at their bank and says: \nLook, I have a great idea of expanding. I think the economy is \nimproving. I would like to get a loan. I would like some credit. I have \nsome people I need to hire. I have some inventory I need to purchase. I \nhave some improvements to expand my space, and the bank says: I am \nsorry, we cannot. No capital. Well, if we adopt the DeMint amendment, \nthat will be one of the reasons the answer is no because we absolutely \nprohibited the Treasury Department of our country from converting, \nwhere they think it is wise to do so, preferred shares to common \nshares. Not because we are requiring it but because we have the \nflexibility to do it.\n\n  When the American taxpayer wants to get a greater return on the \ninvestment we have made to get these institutions back on their feet \nagain, and all we were allowed to hold was preferred shares paying a \ndividend instead of the common shares that could be the upside benefit \nto the American taxpayer, we would have to look back on this amendment \nand say: That is the reason we are not doing better than we ought to be \ndoing.\n  That is really the argument I would give to my colleagues about why I \nthink the DeMint amendment is an unwise move at this juncture. Again, \nit is more ideological. If you, in a sense, believe we should not be \ndoing anything at all, let the market work its way through all of \nthis--and there is a school of thought that embraces that. I happen to \nbelieve that is a dangerous policy to follow, in my view. I think many \nwho looked at this issue from across the spectrum would agree. So that \nis the alternative. That is why I hope this amendment would be rejected \nwhen the time comes for a vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1040 to Amendment No. 1018\n\n   (Purpose: To amend the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act to \n              reauthorize the Act, and for other purposes)\n\n  Mr. REED. First, let me commend Chairman Dodd for his leadership on \nthis very important legislation that is going to address one of the \nmost significant issues facing America today; that is, restoring the \nvalue in our homes, but also giving people the hope that they can stay \nin their homes and helping those people who are displaced from their \nhomes to find adequate, suitable housing.\n  I hope to be able to offer an amendment which would address the issue \nof homelessness in the United States.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 1040 \nto S. 836 and ask that it be made pending.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment? Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Rhode Island [Mr. Reed], for himself, and \n     Mr. Bond, proposes an amendment numbered 1040 to amendment \n     No. 1018.\n\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n  Mr. REED. This legislation is cosponsored by Senator Kit Bond, \nSenator Boxer, Senator Collins, Senator Durbin, Senator Kerry, Senator \nLautenberg, Senator Levin, Senator Lieberman, Senator Schumer, and \nSenator Whitehouse. It embodies legislation I introduced earlier this \nyear, along with Senator Kit Bond, the Saving the Homeless Emergency \nAssistance and Rapid Transition to Housing Act, known in short as the \nHEARTH Act.\n  I want to particularly commend Senator Bond for his support, help, \nand leadership in this effort. He has been an advocate for sensible \nhousing programs, not only on the floor of the Senate but particularly \nin his duties as a member of the Appropriations Committee and as the \nRanking Member of the Subcommittee on Transportation and Housing and \nUrban Development.\n  He has been a great leader in advocating for the sensible, sound, and \nefficient use of taxpayers' resources to help people to find affordable \nhousing. I thank him very much for his assistance, along with all of \nthe other cosponsors.\n  This legislation is endorsed by the National Alliance to End \nHomelessness, U.S. Conference of Mayors, the League of Cities, NACo, \nHabitat for Humanity International, National Association of Local \nHousing Finance Agencies, LISC, Enterprise, National Low Income Housing \nCoalition, Corporation for Supportive Housing, the National Equity \nFund, NAMI, the Housing Assistance Council and the National Community \nDevelopment Association. It enjoys widspread support.\n  According to the Homelessness Research Institute at the National \nAlliance to End Homelessness, 2.5 to 3.5 million Americans experience \nhomelessness each year. On any one night, approximately 672,000 men, \nwomen, and children are without homes.\n  While strides have been made to reduce homelessness over the last \ncouple of years, the current economic decline has halted such progress.\n  Today I saw a front page article with a photograph in USA Today of a \ntent city going up. This is a phenenoman we thought was an artifact of \nhistory. Too often people are using any means to shield themselves from \nthe elements.\n  Organizations such as Amos House, a shelter in my home State of Rhode \nIsland, are seeing an increased demand for their services, while at the \nsame time they are facing budget cuts and the economic downturn has \ncurbed charitable donations.\n  I don't need to tell anybody in this Chamber how urgent this crisis \nis.\n  Across the country, we have already seen tent cities forming; \nshelters turning away people in need; and most major cities reporting \ndouble-digit increases in the numbers of families experiencing \nhomelessness.\n  There is a tendency to view homelessness as something that happens to \na few adults, men and women. But too many children are without homes.\n  As foreclosure and unemployment rates continue to rise, more families \nare being pushed out of their homes. Not everyone ends up on the \nstreets. Some are able to move in with friends or family members, but \nthey can not afford a home of their own and they can not find a job to \nget back on their feet.\n  America has not seen this level of displacement since the Great \nDepression and we simply cannot afford to ignore this problem.\n  That is why I am offering the Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid\n\n[[Page S5107]]\n\nTransition to Housing, HEARTH, Act of 2009 as an amendment to the \nHelping Families Save Their Homes Act.\n  The Banking Committee, of which I am a member, has worked long and \nhard on this legislation, which I believe has resulted in a very strong \npiece of legislation.\n  This amendment invests $2.2 billion for targeted homelessness \nassistance grant programs and provides local communities with greater \nflexibility to spend money on preventing homelessness.\n  While strides have been made to reduce homelessness over the last \ncouple of years, the current economic decline has halted that progress \nand threatens to overwhelm it.\n  As a result of the recession, 1.5 million additional Americans \nnationwide are likely to experience homelessness over the next 2 years \naccording to estimates by the National Alliance to End Homelessness. In \nRhode Island, the latest numbers show homelessness is up 43 percent \nsince February of 2008. And the number of shelter residents who cited \nforeclosure as their reason for becoming homeless tripled in the last 8 \nmonths.\n  This means more trauma for children and adults, more dislocation from \nschools and communities, and more of a drain on local community \nservices.\n  In addition to the $2.2 billion for HUD homeless assistance programs, \nthe HEARTH Act would also provide up to $440 million to be used to \nserve people who are not homeless yet, but are at risk of homelessness. \nThat, I think, is in accord with the spirit of the legislation Senator \nDodd proposed; to prevent people from losing their homes.\n  It would allow cities and towns to serve people who are about to be \nevicted, live in severely overcrowded housing, or otherwise live in an \nunstable situation that puts them at risk of homelessness. The money \ncould be used to make utility payments, security deposits, and provide \nshort- and medium-term rental assistance.\n  The HEARTH Act would increase the emphasis on performance by \nmeasuring applicants' progress at reducing homelessness and providing \nincentives for proven solutions like rapid re-housing for families and \npermanent supportive housing for chronically homeless people.\n  This is a measure not only to provide resources but also to insist \nupon accountability.\n  Today, more families than ever are living on the edge, but the \nnational safety net is not as big or as durable as it used to be.\n  This bipartisan legislation combines federal dollars with new \nincentives to help local communities assist families on the brink of \nbecoming homeless. It is a wise investment of federal resources that \nwill save taxpayers money in the long run by preventing homelessness, \npromoting the development of permanent supportive housing, and \noptimizing self-sufficiency.\n  Finally, I wanted to briefly talk about the definition of \nhomelessness.\n  The HEARTH Act expands the HUD definition of homelessness, which \ndetermines eligibility for much of the homeless assistance funding, to \ninclude people who will lose their housing in 14 days; any family or \nindividual fleeing or attempting to flee domestic violence, or other \ndangerous or life threatening situations; and families with children \nand unaccompanied youth who have experienced a long term period without \nliving independently, have experienced persistent housing instability, \nand can be expected to continue in such status for an extended period \ndue to a number of enumerated factors, such as a disability.\n  It also allows grantees to use up to an additional 10 percent of \ncompetitive funds to serve families defined as homeless under the \nEducation Department homeless definition, but not so defined under the \nHUD definition. For areas with low levels of homelessness, up to 100 \npercent of funds may be used for such purposes.\n  The HEARTH Act also provides communities with greater flexibility in \nusing funds to prevent and end homelessness. Whether it is the new \nEmergency Solutions Grant or the new Rural Housing Stability Assistance \nProgram, that would grant rural communities greater discretion in \naddressing the needs of homeless people or those in the worst housing \nsituations in their communities, this bill allows people to help people \nwho are not technically homeless, and keep them from becoming so.\n  I recognize there have been tensions on the definition issue. All of \nus want to be sure that we are providing services to homeless children \nand families, and those at risk of homelessness.\n  Our amendment does not change the definition of homelessness in the \nNo Child Left Behind Act for education programs that serve homeless \nchildren, nor does it seek in any way to hinder or limit these \nservices.\n  In fact, our amendment strives to reach an appropriate balance to \nmake sure that there are HUD funds available to help these families.\n  I hope that my colleagues can join Senator Bond and me, and support \nthis important amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I am very pleased to work with our colleague \nfrom Rhode Island on this matter and strongly urge the support of this \namendment as well. This is a good bill. We have an underlying bill that \nis a better bill because of what Senator Reed and Senator Bond have \nadded to it. This is a value added to the issue.\n  It is one that our colleague from Rhode Island has been involved in \nfor virtually the entire time he has been in the Senate, and cared \nabout. His earlier partner, Senator Allard of Colorado, worked with him \non the issue. Senator Allard retired from the Senate, so Senator Reed \nreached out to Senator Bond, who has a strong interest in housing \nissues, and became his partner, along with others. I am proud to call \nmyself one of those partners, as chairman of the Banking Committee.\n  As we move forward, I know in my own State of Connecticut, we have \nhad a 13-percent increase in homeless families in the last year and a \nhalf--that is really beginning in 2007 before this issue of \nforeclosures exploded in our communities. So I think those numbers are \nup beyond that.\n  The number of homeless children and families is now increasing. The \nfastest growing part of the population that is homeless is children in \nour country, and this is no longer just that person we see on a street \ncorner who is struggling in their lives. Shelters are jam-packed. You \ncan only stay so long. I know many of my colleagues have visited these \nfacilities and seen families who, only weeks before, owned a home or \nhad a place to live, are out of that situation and now are part of a \ngrowing number of people. So the timeliness of this legislation could \nnot be more important. We are talking about trying to stop \nforeclosures.\n  What an important corollary to that to make sure we are \nsimultaneously providing--Lord forbid people fall into that situation--\nan opportunity to have decent shelter.\n  So I thank my colleague from Rhode Island for his leadership. I \napplaud those of his cosponsors. This amendment would consolidate \nexisting HUD McKinney-Vento homeless assistance programs and make \nseveral improvements to cost effectively end homelessness.\n  I have to take note because I mentioned McKinney-Vento. Both \nindividuals are great friends of mine.\n  Stu McKinney was a Congressman from Connecticut for many years and \ntook on the issue of homelessness. He passed away many years ago. He \nhad a wonderful family. His son John is one of the Republican leaders \nin the Connecticut State legislature. His wife Lucy is a wonderful \nfriend. Stu McKinney was a remarkable human being.\n  Of course, Bruce Vento was a great champion. I served with him in the \nHouse as well. McKinney-Vento, we throw these names around, but know \nthat McKinney and Vento were two wonderful Members of Congress who \ncared deeply about what happened to people who fall on hard times.\n  We can add the name Reed to that group as well. I compliment my \nfriend and urge adoption of his amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. President, I thank the chairman for his kind words and \nsupport. I do also recognize Senator Wayne Allard of Colorado. Wayne \nand I worked together on this legislation for a number of years. In \nfact, we sort of rotated between subcommittee chairman of the Housing \nSubcommittee. Consistently and in a very bipartisan\n\n[[Page S5108]]\n\nfashion, we worked together. We have been joined by Senator Bond whose \nleadership on the Appropriations Committee is remarkable when it comes \nto housing issues. We benefited immensely by the contributions of \nSenators Allard and Bond. I did not have the fortune of knowing Stuart \nMcKinney. I knew him only by reputation. He was known as a sterling man \nwho worked hard when the issue of homelessness was not as central to \nour consciousness as it is today.\n  Bruce Vento was extraordinarily decent. These two gentlemen sort of \npointed the way. Now we have to take up the task and move it forward \nand further. I think we can with this legislation.\n  I thank the chairman for his support and urge all colleagues to join \nus in support of the amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, we understand how busy everyone is, but we \nhave to finish this bill tonight. We have people who have amendments \nthey say they want to have a vote on. If they want to debate the issue, \nthey will have to do it soon. We have two votes coming up. I have \nsuggested to the manager of the bill that if people don't come over and \nthere are amendments pending, he move to table them. If they don't want \nto bring the matters before the Senate, then we will move to third \nreading. We will finish this tonight. It is not fair for people to \nstand around waiting for all these great ideas to not come forward. If \npeople want to have their amendments debated and voted on, they better \ndo it pretty soon. We have two votes scheduled forthwith. After that, I \nhope the people who have amendments will come and speak to the manager \nof the bill and say: Here is how much time I would like or at least \ngive some indication, just don't ignore us because we will not be \nignoring them.\n  We have to move on. We have many things to do. After we finish this \nweek, we have 2 weeks until the Memorial Day recess. I have mentioned \nthere are certain days we will not have votes, but during the recess, \nwe will not have votes. We have things we have to finish. We have to \nfinish the procurement, credit cards, the supplemental, and this bill \nand some nominations. I hope everyone will cooperate with the managers \nof the bill. This is extremely important legislation. The longer we \ndelay in passing it, the more harm it will do to communities all over \nAmerica.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I believe this request has been agreed to by \nboth the majority and minority.\n  I ask unanimous consent that there now be 2 minutes prior to a vote \nin relation to the Ensign second-degree amendment No. 1043 to the Boxer \namendment No. 1038; that prior to the vote, the Ensign amendment be \nmodified with the changes at the desk; that upon the use or yielding \nback of the time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to the Ensign \namendment, as modified; that if the Ensign amendment is not agreed to, \nthen the Senate vote in relation to the Boxer amendment; provided \nfurther that if the Ensign amendment is agreed to, the Boxer amendment, \nas amended, be agreed to and the motion to reconsider be laid upon the \ntable; that there then be 2 minutes of debate prior to a vote in \nrelation to the DeMint amendment No. 1026, with the time equally \ndivided and controlled between Senators Dodd and DeMint or their \ndesignees; that after the first vote in this sequence, the second vote \nbe 10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I wished to respond to \nSenator Reid and ask a question to the chairman. I have another \namendment that has to do with simply letting a homeowner know when his \nmortgage has been sold. We have objection on the other side. I wished \nto make it clear to everyone, I am willing to take that on a voice vote \nand not have to go through a recorded vote. I wished to make that \ncomment. I hope Senator Shelby and his side will allow us to move \nforward on that.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to the Senator's request?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                        farm loan restructuring\n\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, the Treasury Department has committed to \nprovide almost $250 billion in financial assistance to banks and \nfinancial institutions as part of TARP, which has become more commonly \nknown as the bank bailout. Based on 2007 figures, 40 percent of all \nsmall farm loans come from banks and financial institutions that \nreceived more than $1 billion each under TARP. Those loans represent a \nthird of the monetary value of commercial farm credit in these types of \nloans. So it is clear that a sizable portion of farm loans have been \nprovided by entities that received significant TARP funding.\n  The Treasury Department's Making Home Affordable program that was \ndetailed on March 4 requires TARP recipients that provide home loans to \ntake steps to avoid unnecessary foreclosures. The idea behind the \nprogram is that institutions that benefit from taxpayer funds should, \nin turn, be required to help home owners as much as possible, by making \nforeclosure the last resort when loan modification is not a viable \nalternative. This plan does not apply to farm loans, even though most \nfamily farmers and ranchers reside on their farms, and their homes are \ncommonly listed as security on their farm loans. So a foreclosure on a \nfarm loan is also commonly a foreclosure on a home.\n  Like many other businesses, farmers and ranchers are struggling due \nto the ongoing economic troubles. The prices they receive have dropped \nby as much as 50 percent since last year. At the same time, input \nprices for many farmers remain relatively high. This squeeze from both \nsides has impacted dairy farmers in Wisconsin and across the country \nespecially hard but is a growing concern in other segments of \nagriculture as well. Even when national prices have held up, in some \nlocalized areas the closure of animal processing facilities has \nvirtually eliminated the market for some farmers' production. These \nfactors beyond their control have meant it is increasingly difficult \nfor many farmers to keep up with their payments, including farm loans.\n  Given that TARP has injected almost $250 billion to support the \nfinancial stability of lenders, it seems reasonable to expect them to \noffer restructuring as an alternative to foreclosure for farm loans--\njust as they are required to do already for home loans and similar to \nthe existing requirements for the farm credit system and direct Federal \nfarm loans.\n  While Senator Gillibrand and I believe our amendment to extend \nrequirements to provide loan restructuring as an alternative to \nforeclosure for farm loans is a sensible approach, we are willing to \nreview the issue further and work with Chairman Dodd on the issue. I \nappreciate the chairman's willingness to accept an alternative \namendment we crafted to require a special report by the TARP \nCongressional Oversight Panel on farm loan restructuring. This report \nwill analyze the current loan modification policies used by TARP \nrecipients and examine the alternatives that could be used for a farm \nloan. Additionally, Chairman Dodd has agreed to work with Senator \nGillibrand and me to pull together a meeting of USDA and Treasury \nofficials to hear from farm groups and farmer advocates to explain the \ngrowing need and how the existing restructuring program works currently \nunder USDA direct loans and the farm credit system.\n  Mr. DODD. I appreciate the Senator from Wisconsin raising this issue \nand I will be pleased to work with him to arrange such a meeting, and \nto ensure that the Treasury Department looks into the concerns raised \nin the Senator's amendment.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. I appreciate the chairman's support and assistance. I \njust want to note that this is an issue where instead of running from \ncrisis to crisis, we have a chance to be a little proactive and get \nahead of what could become a serious crisis in farm country if \nconditions do not improve. That is why there was such extensive support \nfor my initial amendment from across the spectrum of agriculture-\nrelated organizations including the American\n\n[[Page S5109]]\n\nFarm Bureau Federation, Dairy Farmers of America, Midwest Dairy \nCoalition, National Farmers Union, National Family Farm Coalition, \nNational Milk Producers Federation, National Sustainable Agriculture \nCoalition, Rural Advancement Foundation International--RAFI-USA--and \nalmost 60 others. I will continue working to ensure that their concerns \nabout farm loans are addressed.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1032, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. On behalf of Senator Feingold, I call up amendment No. 1032 \nand ask that the amendment be modified with the changes at the desk; \nthat upon modification, the amendment be agreed to and the motion to \nreconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 1032), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To require the Congressional Oversight Panel to submit a \n               special report on farm loan restructuring)\n\n       At the end, add the following:\n\n                   TITLE __--FARM LOAN RESTRUCTURING\n\n     SEC. _01.

Under the previous order, the Ensign amendment \nNo. 1043 is modified by the changes at the desk.\n  The amendment (No. 1043), as modified, is as follows:\n\n       On page 1, strike line 6 and all that follows through page \n     6 line 5, and insert the following:\n       (a) Short Title.--This section may be cited as the \n     ``Public-Private Investment Program Improvement and Oversight \n     Act of 2009''.\n       (b) Public-Private Investment Program.--\n       (1) In general.--Any program established by the Federal \n     Government to create a public-private investment fund shall--\n       (A) in consultation with the Special Inspector General of \n     the Trouble Asset Relief Program (in this section referred to \n     as the ``Special Inspector General''), impose strict conflict \n     of interest rules on managers of public-private investment \n     funds to ensure that securities bought by the funds are \n     purchased in arms-length transactions, that fiduciary duties \n     to public and private investors in the fund are not violated, \n     and that there is full disclosure of relevant facts and \n     financial interests (which conflict of interest rules shall \n     be implemented by the manager of a public-private investment \n     fund prior to such fund receiving Federal Government \n     financing);\n       (B) require each public-private investment fund to make a \n     quarterly report to the Secretary of the Treasury (in this \n     section referred to as the ``Secretary'') that discloses the \n     10 largest positions of such fund (which reports shall be \n     publicly disclosed at such time as the Secretary of the \n     Treasury determines that such disclosure will not harm the \n     ongoing business operations of the fund);\n       (C) allow the Special Inspector General access to all books \n     and records of a public-private investment fund, including \n     all records of financial transactions in machine readable \n     form, and the confidentiality of all such information shall \n     be maintained by the Special Inspector General;\n       (D) require each manager of a public-private investment \n     fund to retain all books, documents, and records relating to \n     such public-private investment fund, including electronic \n     messages;\n       (E) require each manager of a public-private investment \n     fund to acknowledge, in writing, a fiduciary duty to both the \n     public and private investors in such fund;\n       (F) require each manager of a public-private investment \n     fund to develop a robust ethics policy that includes methods \n     to ensure compliance with such policy;\n       (G) require strict investor screening procedures for \n     public-private investment funds; and\n       (H) require each manager of a public-private investment \n     fund to identify for the Secretary each investor that, \n     individually or together with its affiliates, directly or \n     indirectly holds equity interests in the fund acquired as a \n     result of--\n       (i) any investment by such investor or any of its \n     affiliates in a vehicle formed for the purpose of directly or \n     indirectly investing in the fund; or\n       (ii) any other investment decision by such investor or any \n     of its affiliates to directly or indirectly invest in the \n     fund that, in the aggregate, equal at least 10 percent of the \n     equity interests in such fund.\n       (2) Interaction between public-private investment funds and \n     the term-asset backed securities loan facility.--The \n     Secretary shall consult with the Special Inspector General \n     and shall issue regulations governing the interaction of the \n     Public-Private Investment Program, the Term-Asset Backed \n     Securities Loan Facility, and other similar public-private \n     investment programs.

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, there is now 2 minutes equally divided on \nthe Ensign amendment; is that correct?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator is correct.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I am here to say this is a very friendly \namendment to the underlying Boxer amendment. I hope everyone will \nsupport it. I am very proud of the work we did in a bipartisan way. I \nthank our staffs for doing this. It is a very significant amendment. \nWhat we are saying is, as we begin this new program, this Public-\nPrivate Partnership to buy toxic assets from the banks, Senator Ensign \nand I wish to make sure there is no collusion in the dealing, that \nthere is no conflict of interest as this goes by. We wish to make sure \nthe inspector general has the funding required to audit this program in \na timely fashion. I am very pleased we have had this bipartisan coming \ntogether because we were a little bit far apart. But we worked hard for \nactually a couple weeks on this.\n  I urge everyone to vote for the Ensign-Pryor-Boxer second-degree \namendment, and then we will move for adoption of the Boxer amendment, \nas amended.\n\n[[Page S5110]]\n\n  I yield back the time.

Under the previous order, amendment No. 1038, \nas amended, is agreed to, and the motion to reconsider is considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1026\n\n  Under the previous order, there will now be 2 minutes of debate, \nequally divided, prior to a vote in relation to amendment No. 1026, \noffered by the Senator from South Carolina.\n  Who yields time?\n  The Senator from South Carolina is recognized.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, if I could have my colleagues' attention, \nthe next amendment is one that would prohibit the Federal Government \nfrom converting TARP loans to common equity. Millions of Americans are \ntelling us that enough is enough. We were told that the TARP money \nwould be used one way, and it hasn't been used that way. It has been \nused for loans. We cannot let it go further to let these loans convert \nto common stock.\n  I urge my colleagues to support at least some firewall between what \nthe Federal Government does and the private sector. We didn't approve \nTARP funds so the Government could become common equity shareholders in \nbanks across the country. Let's let them give this back when they are \ncapitalized, but let's not get the Government in the business of owning \nbanks.\n  My amendment would prohibit the conversion of these loans to common \nequity. I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, briefly, let me thank my colleague from \nSouth Carolina. The reason I oppose this amendment is because we ought \nto have the flexibility. It is not a mandate. Today, the Treasury has \nthe right to be able to convert preferred shares to common shares. \nThere is a reason for that. The markets react in terms of real capital \nto common shares, not preferred shares. Preferred shares are a form of \ndebt. If you are trying to get capital into lending institutions, which \nis critical to be able to provide loans, you need to have capital. \nCommon shares allow you to make that determination.\n  Secondly, on the upside for taxpayers, and TARP money coming back, \nthere is a greater likelihood we will benefit if we have common shares. \nI am not advocating that kind of conversion, but you ought to have the \nflexibility to move from preferred to common. You may want to bifurcate \nthat in some of these tranches. The Senator's amendment would prohibit \nthat in any case. I think that is the wrong move to make.\n  I oppose the amendment and urge my colleagues to vote against it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. All time has expired. The question is on \nagreeing to amendment No. 1026.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?

The Senator from Massachusetts.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1036\n\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, I call up amendment No. 1036, with a \npossible modification, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amendment is pending and, without \nobjection, it is the pending amendment.\n  Mr. KERRY. I thank the Chair.\n  Mr. President, I am offering this amendment to address the needs of \nrenters in properties that have been foreclosed. This amendment is \ncosponsored by Majority Leader Reid, Senate Banking Committee Chairman \nDodd, and Senators Kennedy, Boxer, Gillibrand, and Merkley.\n  Congress has already taken extraordinary measures to help troubled \nborrowers in communities where they have abandoned foreclosed \nproperties, but Congress has done very little to help renters who have \nbeen paying their rent regularly on time but, unfortunately, they have \nlandlords who are losing their property to foreclosure. So these \nrenters are absolutely blameless victims in the foreclosure catastrophe \nthat has hit the country.\n  It is estimated that as many as one in every six mortgages in America \nis going to be lost to foreclosure in the\n\n[[Page S5111]]\n\nnext 4 years. In Massachusetts, more than 12,000 homeowners lost their \nhomes to foreclosure last year, an increase of 62 percent in just 1 \nyear. About 3,300 of those foreclosures involved homes with two or \nthree units, and most of those homes had tenants who were evicted.\n  These renters often have absolutely no idea that their home is about \nto be foreclosed. Depending on the State they live in, they may be \nevicted with absolutely no notice. Obviously, this could be \nparticularly difficult for low-income renters who don't have the \nresources to relocate or even to do so very quickly.\n  Under this amendment, tenants in any federally related mortgage loan \nor any dwelling or residential real property with a lease have a right \nto remain in the unit until the end of the existing lease. If a new \npurchaser intends to use the property as a primary residence, then the \nlease may be terminated, but the tenant has to receive 90 days' notice \nto vacate.\n  So what we believe is that this provides an appropriate level of \nprotection. It doesn't take away the right of someone who takes over \nthe home in foreclosure to be able to then transition that property or \nit decides if that person is going to keep the property as a rental \nproperty, the person who already has a legitimate lease has a right to \nbe able to stay.\n  The provisions of this amendment would sunset. I wish to make that \nclear. This sunset is based on the notion that this is to deal with the \ncurrent crisis, and it would sunset on December 31, 2012. Furthermore, \nit states specifically that none of the provisions here would affect \nany State and local law that provides a longer time period or other \nadditional protections to renters. So there is nothing here that \nreduces the protection renters get.\n  Let me give my colleagues a couple graphic examples. A landlord \nshould not be allowed to come in, change the locks, and force out \ntenants who were there completely legitimately, with an expectation \nthat they were coming home to their same old home. A recent story in \nthe Boston Globe shows how devastating and, frankly, absurd this can be \nat times.\n  A Dorchester, MA, man returned to the home he had been renting for \nthe past 4 years. He found that the locks had been changed and a \nforeclosure notice had been placed on the door. With a neighbor's help, \nhe managed to crawl through a second-floor window to get into the \napartment. When the police arrived, he had to beg them not to be \narrested. Fortunately, he was not but only because he was able to show \nproof he rented the apartment. Then for the next 4 months, he had to \nbattle with the bank that then owned the building, enduring no heat, no \nelectricity, and no water while he went through that 4-month process.\n  This is disgraceful. Unfortunately, it is not an isolated incident. \nIn early January, a 45-year-old former factory worker from China came \nhome to her third-floor walkup in east Boston to find a crew of moving \nmen removing all of her furniture. She thought she was being robbed. \nShe didn't speak English. She pleaded with them in Chinese to stop. She \nended up on the street with all of her possessions until a city clerk \nnoticed that the eviction paperwork, which the renter had never \nreceived, had expired. A judge issued an order that allowed her to move \nback. But for how long and under what circumstances?\n  These kinds of incidents show how completely vulnerable renters are \nto this foreclosure cycle we are witnessing. It is well documented how \nforeclosure is already overpowering countless numbers of homeowners who \nare unable to pay their mortgages, but foreclosure is also causing a \nrampage of sudden evictions of renters. My amendment would stop that \nrampage and help unsuspecting renters from falling victim to \nforeclosure in which they played absolutely no part.\n  I thank the Senate Banking Committee chairman, Senator Dodd, for his \nsupport of this amendment. It will very plainly help families stay in \ntheir homes. It is a way of preventing an already grave situation being \nturned into one that is even more egregious and more insulting. I think \nSenator Dodd understands this. No one has worked harder than he has to \nfight against the level of foreclosures that are taking place.\n  I appreciate his leadership and his support for the families across \nthe Nation who are facing this kind of foreclosure problem.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1033 to amendment No. 1018\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Madam President, I call up amendment No. 1033.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Madam President, this amendment deals with the \nNeighborhood Stabilization Program, a very important part of our \nstrategy to fight the battle against foreclosure throughout the \ncountry. So many States have had a terrible time with record numbers of \nforeclosures. The State I am from, the State of Pennsylvania, \nfortunately has not had as big a problem as some States, but we still \nhave a major challenge on our hands.\n  The good news is we have strategies to deal with it and we have a lot \nof locally grown, so to speak, strategies in big cities such as \nPhiladelphia and smaller communities where people at the local level \nare dealing with it on the front end and the back end.\n  On the front end, that means having strategies in place for \ncounseling and other ways to prevent people from getting into a problem \nof foreclosure.\n  This amendment is very simple. What it says is that dollars allocated \nunder this program, some of those dollars should be allowed to be used \nfor foreclosure prevention, as well as mitigation. Basically, what we \nare asking for in this amendment and what it would do is allow up to 10 \npercent of the funding under the Neighborhood Stabilization Program to \nbe used for foreclosure prevention programs, activities, and services, \nand then, secondly, in another category, foreclosure mitigation \nprograms, activities, and services.\n  I believe it is critically important to give local officials and \npeople running programs at the local level the discretion--a very \nlimited amount of discretion but some discretion--on how they spend \nthose dollars. We hear a lot of discussion in this Chamber all the time\n\n[[Page S5112]]\n\nabout empowering people at the local level. This is one way to do it. \nThey know how to fight this battle. They have strategies in place to \nprevent people from falling into foreclosure, but also how to mitigate \nit if foreclosure comes about.\n  That is what this amendment is all about. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport it. It is the right thing to do for a lot of local communities. \nIt is also the right thing to do for people who are expert at dealing \nwith foreclosure prevention, as well as mitigation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the Reed \namendment be the pending amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 1042 to Amendment No. 1040\n\n (Purpose: To establish a pilot program for the expedited disposal of \n                         Federal real property)\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I call up my amendment to the Reed \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The bill clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Oklahoma [Mr. Coburn] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 1042 to amendment No. 1040.\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The amendment is printed in today's Record under ``Text of \nAmendments.'')\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1036\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, I am going to spend a minute talking \nabout the Kerry amendment. I am sitting over here listening to him. \nThere is no question he is right on what should happen in terms of \nnotifications on evictions. But we are about to make the same mistake \nwe make all the time. That is a State issue. State laws apply, and we \nare going to pull that in and make it a Federal issue. Anybody who has \nany connection with Federal insurance, FHA, anything else, we are now \ngoing to start writing the laws on contract law in my State, in his \nState, and every other State. That is exactly how we got into the \ntrouble we are in today.\n  I hope the American people will look at how we got where we are. We \ngot where we are because we are putting our nose into States' business. \nWe think we have a nexus, no matter what the problem is, we ought to be \nsolving it, which means why have State legislatures anymore? Why have \nGovernors? Why not solve all the problems?\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1042\n\n  Now to the amendment at hand. You cannot help but be discouraged \nabout the Congress. We have all these grand ideas and new programs to \nexpand the size and scope of the Federal Government, but we never want \nto pull it back in when it is not effective and when it is not working. \nSo what do we do? We create a new program or we renew a new \nauthorization, not looking at the facts, not looking at the downside \nconsequences of it. What we do is just reauthorize it with a good goal \nin mind.\n  Helping homeless people is great for us to do. The McKinney-Vento Act \nin the past has made a great contribution to 250 homeless shelters in \nthis country. But nobody pays attention to the fact that we spent $300 \nmillion and went through 30,000 properties to fund 250 homeless \nshelters.\n  The other thing that is not recognized is that we have all these \npieces of property we cannot get rid of. It is actually 69,850 \nproperties that the Federal Government owns that it is not using. Some \nof them need to be razed, but they are costing us billions every year \nto maintain because we have a bureaucracy that we cannot get through to \nsell the property.\n  We have $89 billion of cash sitting there right now--right now, $89 \nbillion. That is conservative appraisal values today on properties. We \ncould put that money into the Federal Treasury. That is $89 billion we \nwould not borrow against our grandchildren if, in fact, we had a \ncommonsense, cogent way to dispose of excess Federal properties.\n  All this amendment does is say let's create a pilot program for 5 \nyears. Let's offset anything 100,000 square feet or less. Anything \nbigger let's go around it. We are not going to have 100,000-square-foot \nhomeless shelters. And let's incentivize the agencies to get rid of \ntheir property by leaving 20 percent of the money they would get from \nselling those properties in the agency.\n  The GAO says one of our biggest at-risk programs is our real property \nmanagement. Peter Orszag testified in his hearings on confirmation that \nit is a giant problem. So now we come up with an amendment that is \ncommon sense. It is a pilot project. All it does is say let's test it \non a limited number of properties for 5 years and see if we can't move \nsome of this property, can't lower the cost of Government for the \nAmerican people, and let's do it in a way that is smart.\n  We have over 10,000 properties that need to be razed, need to be torn \ndown, that we are expending tons of money to guard or protect or to \nmaintain in a small fashion that is absolutely wasteful. Yet this body \ndoes not want to do that. It does not want to approach a commonsense \nprogram.\n  This does not do anything to homeless people. This does not take any \nopportunities away from them. There is a very set guideline in here on \nhow they get to perform against the properties under the pilot project. \nBut we are going to claim--because the homeless groups that support \nMcKinney-Vento are not happy with it, we are going to claim we cannot \ndo anything. So we are not going to accept this amendment. They are \ngoing to raise a point of order because it costs $20 million. But when \nCBO scored it, they did not count any of the funds coming from the \nproperties.\n  It is a net gain of billions, and we are going to get a point of \norder. Why? Because we would rather satisfy completely an interest \ngroup than do what is best for the country as a whole. We would rather \nspend more money than save money. We would rather look good in one area \nthan protect the future in the long term.\n  One cannot read this amendment and not say it doesn't make common \nsense for us to be doing it. It is absolute common sense. What the \nAmerican people know, better than we do, is there is not much of that \nup here; otherwise, we would have solved this problem 4 years ago when \nI started offering amendments on it. But we don't want to do it. We \ndon't want to take on the established, connected lobbyists and interest \ngroups that say: No, we don't want that to happen.\n  We had an offer from the House to do five properties over 5 years. \nThat was the offer from the House--5 out of 69,000 properties--69,000 \npieces of property the Federal Government has that it wants to get rid \nof and we cannot do it because we are afraid we might miss one \nopportunity to put a piece of property in the hands of good people who \nwant to do the right thing for those less fortunate.\n  Yet we sit here and we deny common sense. If we sold $89 billion \nworth of properties, compound that interest over what we are borrowing \nright now over the next 5 years. Think about how that could offset some \nof our difficulties today. If we just did half of it, what would \nhappen? The first thing the American people would say is, Hey, they are \nstarting to get it. They are starting to understand what we are going \nthrough, making priorities.\n  The risk of missing an opportunity for a homeless shelter versus \ngetting rid of a high-risk problem that this Federal Government has--\nnot denying but maybe missing one opportunity as small compared to how \nit is going to impact the future homeless people in this country, who \nare going to be our grandkids who will never be able to afford to buy a \nhome because we are strangling them with debt.\n  It will be fine to challenge this on a point of order. I will make a \nmotion to waive the point of order. We can have a vote in the Senate \nabout whether we are going to take commonsense actions that actually \nhelp our kids and our grandkids at the same time we are helping the \nhomeless or we are going to say: No, we are not going to do anything \nnew. We are not going to do common sense. We are not going to apply \nwhat the ordinary man would do with their own money. We are just going \nto reject it.\n  The fact that this is not even considered to be accepted in this bill \nis a\n\n[[Page S5113]]\n\nstatement about this body that is unbelievable. There is no legitimate \ncomplaint with this pilot program. The only complaint is, those who \nlobby on the other side do not want it or the only complaint is they \nare afraid we will not get everything we want if you do that.\n  This Nation needs to learn right now; if we are going to get out of \nthese problems, we are all going to have to sacrifice something. \nEverybody is going to have to sacrifice. That means we can't have \neverything we want. So the very idea that we won't address this issue \nat this time on housing, when we have a big, large, overburdening \nproblem with real property in the Federal Government, says: What are we \nthinking about? Why does this not fit within the bounds of what we are \nsupposed to be doing right now? Who are we going to hurt if we create a \npilot program to get rid of properties over 100,000 square feet? How \nmuch money are we going to save just on maintenance every year? It has \nto be seen in the light of the whole picture, not just in the light of \nthe homeless. If we fail to do that, we fail to think about the long-\nterm benefits that will come from having common sense in real property \nreform. We ought to be doing this. We ought to be helping the next two \ngenerations.\n\n  I am reminded that I did 27 townhall meetings while we were on break. \nAnd I will never forget, this guy came up to me and said: I don't care \nwhat you do to me, quit hurting my children. Quit hurting my children.\n  Not accepting this amendment hurts everybody's kids. It is money we \ncould save if we wanted to, but we won't because we don't have the \nbackbone or the courage to do what is the best right thing for the \ncountry right now. I have no doubt we will do the politically expedient \nthing. We won't work on real property. We won't solve this big issue \nthat costs us billions every year just in maintenance costs. We will do \nthe easy thing.\n  I will have more to say about this as it is challenged on the point \nof order, and also before the vote, but I hope my colleagues start \nbecoming partisan for our kids, partisan for our children. We can help \nthe homeless and help our kids too. We can help the homeless and create \na better future for our kids, but we can't if we won't take a risk. So \nmy challenge to my colleagues is to at least look at the amendment and \nsay: If it was my money, what would I be doing? And the fact is, if it \nwas your money, you wouldn't be sitting on $89 billion worth of \nproperty that is costing us billions every year to maintain, that we \nare not using, and that we can't get through the process to get rid of.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, Senator Coburn has been working very \ndiligently over the last several years to deal with the issue of \nproperty disposition. We have established over many decades now certain \npriorities to access Federal properties, and included in those are very \nlow-priority agencies that provide shelter for homeless people. Prior \nto these, in my recollection of the distribution of the properties, is \nthe right of State and local governments to buy property at a \ndiscounted price.\n  Madam President, as Governor, you have probably considered this \noption many times. It is my understanding that this underlying bill \nwould exempt a number of the properties from the Federal Property Act \nprovisions that would allow, in fact, State and local governments to \naccess these properties at prices that are reasonable, particularly \nnow, given the budget pressures of local governments. But, in addition, \nthis 5-year pilot program would encompass the largest and potentially \nmost valuable properties that are held in surplus by the United States.\n  It is far from a pilot program. What our colleagues in the House are \ntalking about is a true pilot program--a limited number of properties \nto validate and really legitimize the approach Senator Coburn and \nothers are suggesting. I know the Senator has been working very \ndiligently and sincerely with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, \nbut this represents a version, an early version, I believe, that, at \nleast in terms of discussion with others, has been changed somewhat.\n  One point I wish to make with respect to the underlying amendment \nthat is important is that we are not attempting to deal with the issue \nof property distribution, which cuts across the entire spectrum of \nFederal properties--practically every agency in the Federal Government. \nThat encompasses not only the rights--very limited rights--of homeless \ngroups to acquire property but fundamentally the rights of State and \nlocal communities to acquire this property. In fact, for many State and \nlocal communities, this program is a major source of economic \ndevelopment.\n  Again looking at the Chair, who was the Governor of the State of New \nHampshire, Pease Air Force Base was surplus property which is now a \ndynamic economic development tool. My guess, again, was that it was \nobtained by the State, probably using at least in part some of these \npowers. All of that would be altered in this pilot program that would \ngive, in fact, public lands managers wide discretion to dispose of \nproperties. Again, it is a pilot program, but it is so long term. Five \nyears is not exactly a short-term, let's do an experiment, evaluate it, \nand see what can be done.\n  Our legislation, the underlying amendment, is the result of many \nyears of bipartisan effort to deal with the issue of homelessness, not \nthe distribution or disposition of public property. I think it would \nrepresent an extraordinary improvement in the current system. It is \nmore efficient, it consolidates applications, it gives flexibility to \nlocal communities, and it deals with the problem that I think is \nequally compelling for the children of today. There are thousands of \nchildren who don't have a home. We have to be cognizant of the future. \nWe have to take prudent steps--and I wish, looking back over the last 8 \nyears, some of my colleagues on this side would have been much more \nprudent in their fiscal policies that took a surplus in 2001 and turned \nit into a huge deficit in 2008, 2009. So the ability to look ahead is \nnot exclusive to one side of the aisle. But the legislation I have \nproposed, along with Senator Bond, represents a reauthorization of \nMcKinney-Vento, which will give the States and localities better tools \nto deal with the current crisis of countless families who are without \nhomes.\n  My concern is not only with the breadth of this amendment, with its \nfocus on one part of a much more complicated puzzle, but also the fact \nthat I think it could seriously jeopardize the passage of what is \nimportant legislation--the McKinney-Vento reauthorization.\n  I do believe, because of the Senator's efforts, because of his \nsincere and energetic and consistent advocacy of this, that this issue \nis resonating on both sides--both with our colleagues in the House and \nhere in the Senate. I would be extraordinarily disappointed if we were \nto miss a great opportunity to fundamentally reform the program.\n  We worked with the Senator last Congress. We had bipartisan support, \nled by Senator Allard. We had, in fact, the clear endorsement of \nPresident Bush and the Housing and Urban Development Department under \nthe Bush administration for our homelessness proposal, but it failed \nbecause this legislation, the Reed amendment, was embroiled in this \ncontroversy of property disposition which spans every agency of the \nFederal Government. It is not just HUD, it is the Department of \nDefense, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior.\n  I think if we are going to do something this comprehensive, let's not \nsingle out the homelessness initiative as sort of the wedge or the \nfulcrum or the lever. Let's step back, work collectively, \ncollaboratively, and pass legislation that will apply across the board \nand will do so in a principled and practical way. There is no \nopposition to that.\n  I would also note, as the Senator alluded to, that at an appropriate \nmoment there will be a point of order raised on the legislation. But I \nwould hope that, again, we could move through this proposed second \ndegree, pass the underlying amendment, and not forget but in fact \nredouble our efforts to approach this in a comprehensive way. I know \nmany colleagues--not only Senator Coburn but Senator Carper--are \nsincerely and enthusiastically interested in having reform of the way \nwe dispose of property.\n  I am certainly also in a position to say personally that I think if \nwe do\n\n[[Page S5114]]\n\nthis, we have to take into consideration the equities of all the \nparties. This is not just about homeless groups that get grants, this \nis about State and local governments, this is about the way we have \nestablished over many years the disposition of Federal property. Can it \nbe improved? Yes, it can. Should we improve it? Yes, we should. But I \nthink to essentially target the homeless population as sort of the \nlever for this change is the wrong approach. So I would, at the \nappropriate moment, either myself or the manager, raise a point of \norder.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Madam President, I do have another amendment which I would like to \ncall up, but I see the Senator from Oklahoma is here, and he should \nhave an opportunity to speak.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. I appreciate Senator Reed's understanding of our effort, \nbut the question arises: We have 69,850 properties. This isn't a big \npilot. It only allows 750 properties to be disposed of. Think about \nthat--750. It is barely over 1 percent. It is going to be $800 million \nto $1 billion, and we are going to block everything--a pilot--because \nit is too big, too expansive--750 properties out of 69,850. We don't \nthink we ought to attach that now?\n  We put in extra provisions to make sure the homeless can have these, \nbut most of them aren't good for anything. In fact, most of them will \nprobably be razed. But the fact is, to say we can't do it--we have been \nsaying we can't do it for 4\\1/2\\ years. Can't do it. Can't do it. When \ncan we do it? And 750 properties to look at over a 5-year period is \njust 150 properties a year. How small does it need to be for us to have \na pilot--out of 750, 150 properties a year? A total of 69,850. One \nhundred fifty, and we can't do that? And because we can't do that, that \nbecomes a symbol for the rest of our failures. We can't sell 750 \nproperties and protect the homeless while we do it and lower some of \nthe burden of the excess real property this Government has. If we can't \ndo that on this bill, a small number of properties, I am wondering what \nwe can do.\n  It confounds me. It doesn't fit with any sort of common sense. It \ndoesn't fit with any reason. It doesn't fit with any long-term view of \nhow do we get out of the mess we are in. What it fits with is that we \ndon't want to do it because it is hard. We don't want to do it because \nsomebody might yell, somebody might scream. But how do we do the best \nright thing--not the best thing, the best right thing--for the country? \nI can tell you that letting another year go by when we have 73,000 \nproperties and $98 billion worth of money and $8 billion a year to \nmaintain it isn't the best right thing.\n  I am used to standing up and losing, but I am not going to stop \nputting forward ideas that we shouldn't be rejecting, that make a \ndifference in the outcome for the future of this country. This doesn't \nhave a liberal or conservative slant to it. It is just plain old, good \nold Oklahoma common sense, good old Connecticut common sense, good old \nRhode Island common sense. The fact we would reject it says that our \nmotives have to be somewhat suspect on the reasons we would reject it \nat this time, especially when we are in the trouble we are in.\n  It is so discouraging to go home and hear people say, why are you \ndoing what you are doing? Why aren't we fixing this? Why aren't we \nmaking the small steps that create a big step that create a yard that \ncreate a mile that secures the future?\n  It is amazing to me that you can have a real objection to this \namendment--not 150 properties a year. That isn't going to impact \nanybody except our kids in the long term, and it is going to impact \nthem positively. But we are going to have a parochial reason why we \nmight not do it? I think that is what I might have heard implied. A \nparochial protection? We are going to die of parochialism. It is going \nto kill us. Eighty-plus billion dollars sitting there and we could take \nand lower the impact of this tremendous downturn and make a difference. \nYet we are going to say no.\n  As they say in Oklahoma--go figure.\n  Mr. DODD. Will my colleague yield?\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to yield.\n  Mr. DODD. I understand what my colleague from Rhode Island is talking \nabout, but I must say our colleague from Oklahoma is making a lot of \nsense. He often does so. Who has jurisdiction over this? Does it depend \nupon the Federal property, where it is located? Which of the \ncommittees?\n  Mr. COBURN. Homeland Security.\n  Mr. DODD. People say debates here don't have an effect on anybody. I \nwill make a commitment to you as chairman of the Banking Committee, I \nwill work with you on this.\n  Mr. COBURN. I appreciate the Senator's offer.\n  Mr. DODD. I am intrigued by what the Senator is saying. I suspect a \nlot of other people don't disagree with what he is driving at here. We \nneed to pull some people together to see if we might get something \ndone.\n  At this late hour of the night I might not be listening to this \ndebate were I not chairing the committee and managing the bill on the \nfloor, but my colleague from Oklahoma I think has raised a very \nvaluable point and it is worthy of our consideration and I would like \nto sit with him and see if I can't help.\n  Mr. COBURN. I am happy to take the Senator up on that offer as soon \nas I lose my amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. I want to give my colleague from Rhode Island a chance to \nbe heard but--let him offer his amendment.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, there will be an amendment that I propose \nthat will help qualify the status of warrants that are currently held \nby the Department of Treasury with respect to TARP. It will give the \nSecretary of the Treasury discretion to dispose of those warrants when \nhe feels it is appropriate. Right now, under language that was adopted \nin the context of our debates over the recent amendments to TARP, there \nis a mandatory requirement for the Secretary to surrender or dispose of \nthe warrants if the TARP funds are returned by a financial institution.\n  I believe the Secretary should have the discretion to hold these \nwarrants if he thinks it is in the best interests of the taxpayers. The \nwhole point of the warrants, and a point I insisted upon in the \noriginal legislation for the TARP bill last September, indeed a point \nthat I found to resonate with many of our colleagues on the Republican \nside--Spencer Bachus, the ranking Republican on the House Financial \nAffairs Committee cited this specifically as one of the reasons why the \nTARP program could be supported--and that is, in addition to our \ninvestment in preferred stock which pays dividends, the Government \nwould also have the right to obtain warrants; that would be the right \nto acquire stock in the future.\n  Interestingly enough, at the time we were debating the TARP bill, \nWarren Buffett, who was a very sophisticated and is a very \nsophisticated investor, made a preferred stock investment in a large \nfinancial institution and also received warrants. So this is typically \nhow many of these deals are done.\n  At this juncture the institutions receiving TARP funds have the right \nat any time to pay it back. That is an issue that has been settled. It \nis the policy of the United States. But I believe the Secretary of the \nTreasury should have the discretion, because these are separate \ninstruments, to hold those warrants, to maximize, if he can, the market \nprice that he will receive on behalf of the taxpayers.\n  This, again, is an issue that was very critical to many of us in the \ninitial adoption of the TARP legislation. We are not mandating that the \nSecretary of the Treasury surrender the warrants, nor are we mandating \nthat he keep them. It will be discretionary. He and his colleagues \nhave, and I believe must exercise, the judgment when it is an \nappropriate time to surrender these warrants or to take other actions \nunder the contracts under which they were issued, to ensure value for \ntaxpayers.\n  We have made very significant investments in the financial system \nthrough the TARP program. The premise, again, was that not only would \nthe direct investment be repaid, but taxpayers would benefit from the \nrecovery of these institutions. We are seeing that recovery now. We \nhave a ways to go but we are seeing some encouraging signs. I believe, \nagain, that having assumed risks, taxpayers should benefit from the \nrewards of a revived\n\n[[Page S5115]]\n\nfinancial institution and in that case we are simply making this \ndiscretionary with the Secretary of the Treasury so that he can judge \nwhether and when the appropriate time is to surrender the warrants, to \nreceive fair market price for the warrants, and to ultimately help \nbenefit the taxpayers who have put up the money to deal with a huge \nfinancial crisis.\n  At the appropriate time I believe there will be a consent to move \nforward on this amendment. I hope it would be supported and adopted, \nbut I wanted to make that point at this juncture.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut is recognized.\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I rise and offer my support for the \namendment of the Senator from Rhode Island that repeals the requirement \nfor the Secretary of the Treasury to liquidate warrants under repayment \nof obligations under the Troubled Asset Relief Program. The Senator \nfrom Rhode Island I think has laid out the rationale for this, but the \npoint is under existing law it was rather restrictive and required a \nspecific action without consideration of what the values may be. What \nthe Senator is suggesting is moving from a ``shall'' requirement to a \n``may'' gives flexibility, which is exactly what we have been arguing \nfor today in a number of these amendments, giving flexibility dealing \nwith preferred and common shares--flexibility. Some of the other \namendments earlier reflect on this flexibility, which is critical.\n  These warrants change over time. It doesn't suggest by holding back \nyou will necessarily get a better value. It doesn't mean by releasing \nthem earlier you will do better. It is obviously a judgment call and \nyou want to give people the opportunity to make the judgment calls. The \nbeneficiary of all of this ultimately will be the American taxpayer and \nthat is ultimately what we are trying to achieve.\n  I think my colleague has once again offered a very wise and \nworthwhile amendment to this bill. It strengthens it, in my view. I \nthank him for it. I don't know if there is any objection to this at \nall.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Rhode Island is recognized.\n  Mr. REED. Madam President, I believe they are working on an \nappropriate consent to adopt it.\n  Mr. DODD. As soon as that happens, we will move this along and see if \nwe can't get this agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1036\n\n  I want to mention a few words about the amendment offered by Senator \nKerry from Massachusetts and Senator Gillibrand from New York and \nSenator Reid from Nevada, if I may.\n  This is a very good amendment. My hope is my colleagues will support \nit. We offered an amendment on earlier legislation dealing with rental \nproperties that were affected under the Government-sponsored \nenterprise. Under that legislation, we prohibited those properties from \nevicting tenants who were current in their rental obligations when a \nproperty was foreclosed or purchased by a new buyer, the thought being, \nif a tenant is current in their obligations, they should not be evicted \nunless they are on a month to month, in which case at the end of the \nmonth the landlord would have that right. But if there are leases of \nlonger duration, these tenants ought to be respected under the \ncontracts they have.\n  I can say in my own State of Connecticut, we do not have a great \nsupply of affordable rental stock. This is not unique in my State. I \nthink this is true in most States. As you are watching more and more \nforeclosures occurring and as people lose their homes, the demand for \nrental stock is increasing. The cost of it is prohibitive. In the State \nof Connecticut--I believe these numbers are correct--I think you need \nan hourly income of close to $21 an hour to afford the average two-\nbedroom apartment. Obviously that could fluctuate to some degree, but \nthat gives you some idea of the cost, and that is close to three \nminimum wage jobs, in effect, in a day to pick up that kind of income.\n  It is important that we do what we can to protect people in this \nsituation. That is exactly what Senator Kerry does, in that the measure \nrequires at least 90-days' notice for all renters in federally related \nhousing, but would honor the full term of any existing lease unless a \nnew owner will occupy the home. The amendment also amends the housing \nvoucher statute to preserve section 8 contracts at foreclosure. These \nprovisions would be in effect during the foreclosure crisis, sunsetting \nat the end of December 2012.\n  This is a very worthwhile proposal. We are protecting an awful lot of \ngood people out there. Frankly, I am somewhat perplexed that there are \nthose who object to this. It seems to me it would be in the interests \nof a new owner to want to keep people in paying rents, current in those \nobligations, rather than evicting them and beginning another process \nunless they are looking for some extremely--higher rents coming in. But \nit seems to me, given the amount of people out of work, given the \ndeclining value of properties, you are probably acquiring these \nproperties at a lot less cost than the previous owner may have had \nwhich means the rents you would have to secure wouldn't have to be as \nexpensive to maintain it.\n  At the very hour people are worrying about where they are going to \nlive--we just heard a discussion by Senator Reed about homeless \nfamilies. The largest increase in homeless families is children in our \ncountry.\n  Again, imagine that family tonight--10,000 tonight, as there were \nlast night, as there will be tomorrow night and every night--who has \ndiscovered they are in such default their home is on the auction block \nor has been lost. That is a pretty compelling moment to know you have \nlost your home. It further compounds that problem by not knowing where \nyou are going to live, where you are going to take your family--showing \nup tonight and looking at your children and suggesting you are going to \nmove, going to have to find a different place to live.\n  What Senator Kerry is saying here, at least for tenants who are in \ngood standing on their properties, they should not be affected because \nthe property ended up in foreclosure through whatever rationale that \nmay have happened to the landlord. It seems to me, putting people out \non the street is not what we ought to be doing at a time such as this. \nWhatever your views are about whether these programs are working as \neffectively as they should, I think all of us agree the innocent who \nare being confronted with these decisions should not be left in a more \nprecarious position than they are already in, and that is exactly what \nwould happen in the absence of the Kerry amendment, the Kerry-\nGillibrand-Reid amendment.\n  Once again the majority leader, Senator Reid, has taken a strong \nposition on these matters and is making a difference, as he has, by \nallowing these matters to come up and being as supportive as he has of \nthe various efforts we are making here to complete this work.\n  I thank Senator Kerry of Massachusetts, his colleagues Senator Reid \nof Nevada and Senator Gillibrand of New York, for offering this idea. \nIt is one deserving of our support and will make a real difference.\n  People have asked whether this bill is going to make a real \ndifference for real people. This amendment makes a real difference for \nreal people, and is exactly what we ought to be doing. These were not \nthe people who caused the problems they are in. These are the victims \nof what is occurring. If we care about what is happening to them, this \nis a wonderful way to say we understand it, we are stepping up and \nmaking a difference in their lives.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Madam President, I rise in strong support of the Boxer-\nSnowe amendment, which would be modified by an Ensign-Pryor-Boxer-Snowe \nsecond-degree perfecting amendment, to provide for additional oversight \nof the Public-Private Investment Program--PPIP--which the Treasury \nDepartment has established to help remove toxic securities from bank \nbalance sheets and restore the flow of credit.\n  With up to $100 billion of Troubled Asset Relief Program--TARP--\ndollars at stake for PPIP alone, it is critical that we take every step \nat our disposal to safeguard taxpayer dollars. To that end, I am \npleased to have collaborated with Senators Ensign and Pryor to modify \nthe amendment Senator Boxer and I initially offered. I hope that the \nSenate will now approve our consensus language overwhelmingly.\n  One common feature of PPIP, which will work in conjunction with the\n\n[[Page S5116]]\n\nTerm Asset-Backed Loan Securities Loan Facility--TALF--that Treasury \nhas established to get small business and consumer credit flowing once \nagain, is that both programs match dollars put forth by private \ninvestors with money from TARP, the Federal Reserve, and Federal \nDeposit Insurance Corporation. One concern that has been raised by \nprivate observers and the Special Inspector General for TARP Neil \nBarofsky in his April 21 report to Congress is the potential for fraud. \nIndeed, Mr. Barofsky's assessment could not be clearer, as he wrote, \n``Many aspects of PPIP could make it inherently vulnerable to fraud, \nwaste, and abuse.''\n  Unfortunately, the potential for fraud appears widespread. For \nexample, as private funds with access to taxpayer dollars will be \ncreated to purchase and manage toxic assets under PPIP, conflicts of \ninterest between what is best for the fund manager and the taxpayer \ncould easily arise. In cases in which a fund already owns or manages \nthe same types of assets it is proposing to purchase on behalf of \ntaxpayers, that could give it the incentive to overpay. The reason is \nthat it could make more money if the price of the assets it already \nowned were bid up. At the same time, the taxpayer will have overpaid \nfor assets and forfeited an investment fee to the fund managers.\n  To ensure that taxpayers are not bilked, the original Boxer-Snowe \namendment had two objectives. First and foremost, it would require \nTreasury to work with Special Inspector General for TARP Barofsky to \nwrite stringent conflict of interest rules. Second, it would provide \nMr. Barofsky's office an additional $15 million to audit transactions \nunder PPIP to ensure taxpayers do not get fleeced. As I mentioned, that \nSenator Boxer and I were able to work with Senators Ensign and Pryor to \nstrengthen the taxpayer protections contained in our initial amendment. \nThe result is a consensus amendment that will ensure PPIP is subject to \nstrict safeguards that will still allow it to get underway and begin to \nclear toxic assets from bank balance sheets, thereby, spurring the flow \nof credit.\n  Turning to specifics, our consensus amendment will require the \nTreasury Department to impose strict conflict of interest rules on \nmanagers of public-private investment funds to ensure that securities \nbought by the funds are purchased in arms-length transactions, that \nfiduciary duties to public and private investors in the fund are not \nviolated, and that there is full disclosure of relevant facts and \nfinancial interests.\n  Second, each public-private investment fund would be required to \ndisclose quarterly to the Secretary of the Treasury the value of the 10 \nlargest positions of each fund manager.\n  Third, each manager of a public/private investment fund would be \nobliged to acknowledge a fiduciary duty to both the public and private \ninvestors in such a fund, as well as develop a robust ethics policy and \nmethods to ensure compliance.\n  Fourth, our amendment would mandate that Special Inspector General \nBarofsky would have access to all books and records of a public-private \ninvestment fund, as well as each fund manager to retain all relevant \nbooks, documents, and records to facilitate investigations.\n  Last but not least, our amendment would add critical legislation \nproposed by Senators Ensign and Pryor that would require the Secretary \nof the Treasury to work with Special Inspector General Barofsky to \nissue regulations governing the interaction of PPIP with the Term-Asset \nBacked Securities Loan Facility to address concerns regarding the \npotential for excessive leverage that could result from interactions \nbetween the programs. The issue here, is that although both programs \nwould match private funds with public dollars, the government's stake \nis generally several times higher. For example, in the case of PPIP \nalone, private funds may only have to put up $7 for each $100 invested. \nGiven that it is always easier to play with other people's money than \nyour own, I am pleased that this language has been added to the \nunderlying Boxer-Snowe amendment.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment that would \nsafeguard taxpayer funds on both the front end by mandating critically \nnecessary conflict of interest rules on PPIP and on the back end as \nwell by providing Inspector General Barofsky with additional resources \nto investigate those who would seek to enrich themselves at taxpayer \nexpense.\n\n\n                    Amendment No. 1039, as Modified\n\n  Mr. DODD. Madam President, I am going to make a series of unanimous \nconsent requests dealing with modifications.\n  On behalf of Senator Reed of Rhode Island, I call up his amendment \nNo. 1039 and ask that the amendment be modified with the changes at the \ndesk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Connecticut [Mr. Dodd], for Mr. Reed, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 1039, as modified.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 1021\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Madam President, I rise to speak on an amendment I have \noffered, 1021. It will have Democratic and Republican cosponsors. This \nsubstitute amendment gives the Government Accountability Office \nauthority to audit the Federal Reserve.\n  However, this version limits the Government Accountability Office's \nnew authority to matters involving the Federal Reserve's participation \nin the TARP or its emergency action under section 13(3) authority.\n  This is a much narrower version of the original amendment. It is \nintended to address the Federal Reserve's concern that its core \nmonetary policy functions remain independent of the Government \nAccountability Office scrutiny.\n  For over 90 years, the Fed has conducted monetary policy through a \ncombination of open-market operations and changes in banking reserve \nrequirements. On rare occasions, the Fed has invoked its authority \nunder section 13(3) to take extraordinary action to address what they \nwould decide was a very short-term crisis. While these actions are \nintended to be temporary, they can have a lasting impact on specific \ninstitutions and on the long-term credibility of the Fed.\n  The Fed has created a number of facilities that are making \nnonrecourse loans or buying and selling assets through a subsidiary of \nthe Fed. These transactions involve undisclosed counterparties. Without \nadequate oversight, no one will ever know the terms or conditions of \nthese transactions: Who received what from the Fed and what did the Fed \nreceive in return? How much did each of those entities profit and how \nmuch did the taxpayers lose?\n  This amendment is simply about accountability, not monetary policy, \nbecause I do not want to interfere in Fed monetary policy. But I do \nthink that when we are helping out businesses, the way we are, \nsometimes through appropriations from Congress, sometimes through \nfacilities and powers of the Fed, we are talking about taxpayers' \nmoney.\n  If you think the Fed does not have anything to do with taxpayers' \nmoney, remember that last year they returned, I think it was, $38 \nbillion to the Federal Treasury--I know it was in the mid-30s that it \nreturned to the Federal Treasury in year-end operations.\n  They are not going to be able to do that this year, but that $38 \nbillion goes into the general fund to be used, like money being \nfungible. It is not seen by the taxpayers any differently from the \nincome tax or the payroll taxes that are paid. There is an interest in \nprotecting the taxpayers' money. It is not an interest in doing \nanything with the independence of the Fed, it is just a matter of \nknowing who is getting helped, what is being helped, are they \nprofiting, how much are they profiting, and the extent to which the \ntaxpayers are being protected, the instruments the Fed takes in as \ncollateral. These are things that it is good to know. We need to know. \nWe need to know them. Why? Because there are a lot of facilities, \ninstitutions, companies being helped that would be belly up--well, I \nguess you would say they are belly up or they would not need the help--\nbut belly up and they exist because of either Congress appropriating \nmoney or because of the Fed intervening.\n  All good reasons maybe but they operate. So, in my judgment, the \npublic's business ought to be public. Oh, there are some exceptions, \nsuch as intelligence information, national security, some privacy. But \neverything else ought to be public. That is what this amendment is all \nabout. It is all about making sure money is handled responsibly.\n  The Fed is only supposed to lend money against good collateral. Their \nauthority to conduct monetary policy must not be allowed to degenerate \ninto a taxpayer-funded bailout for those who engage in reckless \nlending.\n  I hope people who are going to be voting on this amendment tomorrow \nwill consider what we are trying to do. We are trying to do everything \nthis President said in his campaign--the President has not spoken on \nthis issue, but I am speaking in a general way about what the President \nsaid in his campaign--that he wanted more transparency in Government, \nhe wanted more accountability in Government.\n  For the most part, the President, through various things, maybe not \ncompleted yet, has tried to deliver on that promise--putting TARP \nexpenditures on the Internet, for instance, so anybody in the United \nStates can know, maybe not today but eventually, where every penny \nwent--because it is the taxpayers' money. This Government belongs to \nthe American people.\n\n[[Page S5119]]\n\nWhat this Government does that affects the pocketbooks of Americans \nought to be made public.\n  This amendment is not something to try to destroy anything. It is not \nsomething trying to get involved in that which affects the monetary \npolicy of the Fed. We are just trying to get information out and make \nsure people are accountable. We have to have this information to know \nthat. It doesn't hurt one iota to make sure the public has access to \nthis information. I hope Members will support amendment No. 1021 \ntomorrow.\n  There is another amendment which, it is my understanding, the \nmanagers will accept. But 1021 we will have to have a vote on. I have \ngiven my reasons. I may take a minute in the morning to expand on that \nand remind Senators, but I hope we can move forward and get this agreed \nto.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Udall of Colorado). The Senator from \nConnecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I commend my friend from Iowa. He has been a \nconsistent advocate over the years for transparency and accountability. \nI am pleased to work with him on these amendments. I am fairly \nconfident the committee will accept these amendments as part of the \nunderlying bill. It strengthens what we are trying to achieve. I regret \nwe couldn't arrange to do that this evening while the Senator was here, \nbut there are other powers that my colleague and I are well aware of \nthat need to make sure they pour over everything before we go forward. \nI thank him for his counsel and his advice and this recommendation.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. DODD. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n\n\n                          Credit Card Industry\n\n  Mr. SANDERS. Mr. President, I wanted to take a couple minutes to talk \nabout an issue that will be on the Senate floor next week, and that is \nthe outrageous way that the credit card industry is treating millions \nand millions of Americans. Last week, 2 weeks ago, I sent an e-mail out \nto my mailing list, which is about 135,000 people, and I said: Tell me \nhow credit card companies are treating you. Within a few days, we had \n1,000 responses, many from Vermont but, in fact, from all over the \ncountry.\n  Essentially, what people were saying, as they described the treatment \nthey are receiving at the hands of these credit card companies: We are \ndisgusted that at the same time we as taxpayers are bailing out Wall \nStreet and these large financial institutions, at the same exact time \nas the big banks are receiving zero interest loans from the Fed, the \nresponse of the credit card companies and the banks is to double or \ntriple the interest rates we are paying on our credit cards.\n  The stories that came in were heartbreaking, appalling, and they \nspoke to the greed and the callousness of many of these financial \ninstitutions. We put a couple dozen of these responses into a little \nbooklet called ``Enough is Enough, How Credit Card Companies Are \nAbusing Americans, Letters from Vermont and the Nation.'' They are \navailable on my Web site at sanders.senate.gov.\n  What I want to do for the moment is read some of the comments we \nreceived from Vermont and around the country and also invite any viewer \nwho has a problem to correspond with us and we will read them right \nhere in the Senate. I think it is time that some of my colleagues in \nthe Senate understood what is going on in the real world.\n  Yes, I do understand that the financial interests have put $5 billion \ninto lobbying and campaign contributions over the last 10 years. And, \nyes, I do understand that despite the fact that they have pushed this \ncountry, through their greed and recklessness, into a recession, they \nstill have enormous power on Capitol Hill. But maybe it is time that we \nstarted listening to the American people rather than the lobbyists from \nthe large banks.\n  I will read a few of the comments, excerpts from some of the \nresponses we received from all over the country. This is from Donna \nfrom New Jersey:\n\n       I want to know why consumers are not protected in any way \n     from these predatory lenders who were bailed out with my \n     taxpayer dollars and then turn around and raise my interest \n     rate from 7 percent to 27 percent because of ``difficult \n     economic times'' for the credit industry. This is outrageous! \n     I have not missed a payment and my credit rating is in the \n     high 800's. How can they keep getting away with this?\n\n  Well, that is a good question. How can they keep getting away with \nthis? And they continue to get away with it.\n  This is from James in Highgate Center, VT:\n\n       I once had Bank of America charge me 27.99 percent interest \n     when I had only a $53 balance on one of their cards. I of \n     course paid it in full, then closed out the card to avoid \n     doing business with those crooks!\n\n  The next one is from Los Angeles, CA, from Jennifer:\n\n       I have personally had three separate credit cards raise the \n     APR to 29.99 percent--when I have paid my bills on time \n     (Citicard, Chase and [Bank of America]). Then just last \n     billing cycle, another card I am in perfect standing with \n     doubled my APR--no apparent reason (Chase).\n\n  Well, I think Jennifer raises a good question. What are we doing \nabout it? How can companies get away with doubling or tripling the \ninterest rates on people who have always paid their bills on time?\n  This is from Sheila in Wilder, VT:\n\n       I am tired of being the one who has to pay! The executives \n     of these credit card companies mess up and the little people \n     pay. The government messes up and the little people pay. Now \n     my oldest child is going off to college and I can't even get \n     financial help except for loans. Yes, more interest! So now I \n     have to pay more interest on my credit cards. When will I get \n     help?\n\n  Well, Sheila, I guess you will have to contribute a whole lot of \nmoney into the political system because apparently Congress is not \nlistening to you.\n  Susan and John in Sea Cliff, NY:\n\n       Capital, Chase, and Bank of America all doubled and tripled \n     their rates despite a lifelong perfect payment record, with \n     no excuse (we phoned them) except that they could. This is \n     nothing but breach of promise and a flat-out theft. A good \n     reason for severe, retroactive rollbacks or simple seizure of \n     banks. . . .\n\n  Theft? Not bad.\n  Anne from Brattleboro, VT:\n\n       I live in a small town in Vermont. I feel that the credit \n     card companies need to have a ceiling on interest rates and \n     fees they are stealing from us. We pay for the bail out and \n     we pay the interest increases. They must think we are stupid.\n\n  And on and on it goes. This is just a couple of dozen. We received \n1,000. There are millions of people out there who are sick and tired of \nbeing ripped off.\n  What is the solution? I think the House has made some progress. I \nguess the Senate committee is making some progress. Ultimately, what we \nhave to do is call a spade a spade and say that when you are charging \npeople 25, 30 percent in interest rates, that is usury. That is \noutrageous. It should be illegal in America.\n  As many people know, for a number of years individual States had \nusury rates. They said loans could not be made out above whatever the \nrate may be, depending on the State. Then what happened in 1978, the \nSupreme Court made a decision in the Marquette case which basically \nsaid if a credit card company did business in a State without any usury \nrates, other States could not stop them from charging any interest \nrates whatsoever. That is, in fact, what has happened.\n  I have introduced legislation and will bring up an amendment when we \ndebate the credit card issue. I hope we can get some support in the \nSenate to pass a national usury law. The rate we have decided upon is \n15 percent, with some exceptions. The reason we chose that as the \nceiling is that is exactly what credit unions have been existing under \nfor 30 years. A lot of people don't know that. But a credit union \ncannot charge 25, 30 percent interest rates. It is illegal for them to \ndo that by law. So I think if we have a regulatory ethic with credit \nunions that has been working quite well for the last 30 years--credit \nunions are not marching into Washington for bailouts--I think we can \napply it to the private sector as well.\n  What we are proposing is a cap on interest rates of 15 percent; under \nexceptional circumstances, which is currently the case for credit \nunions, another 3 percent. That would be it.\n  I think that is sensible legislation. Whether we can get much support \nhere and take on the banking interests, I don't know. But I think it is \nwhat the American people want. I certainly hope we can pass legislation \nlike that.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n\n[[Page S5120]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, as the administration considers ways to \nreform our foreign aid programs, I want to call attention to a recent \nOp Ed piece by a Vermont friend who has over 30 years of experience \ndealing with these issues.\n  Dr. George Burrill founded Associates in Rural Development--ARD--in \nBurlington in 1977 and since then he has brought Vermont common sense \nand values to international aid and development work. Since its \nfounding, it has implemented some 600 projects around the world \nincluding extensive work with the U.S. Agency for International \nDevelopment. Today ARD, a for-profit international development firm, \nhas $100 million in annual revenue operating out of 43 field offices \naround the world.\n  Throughout his career, Dr. Burrill has thought long and hard about \nways to make foreign aid more effective. In his recent piece in the \nBurlington Free Press, a copy of which I will ask to be printed in the \nRecord, Dr. Burrill calls for a ``modernization'' of our thinking about \nforeign aid; the creation of a global development strategy to give U.S. \nforeign aid agencies a way to effectively evaluate past actions and \ndetermine what reform is needed; and tools for evaluating progress. \nBeyond that, he proposes developing a ``coherent strategy that will \nfoster economic opportunity'' in the developing world, enacting \nlegislation that ``elevates development as a foreign policy pillar \nequal with diplomacy and military defense,'' and creating an \nindependent executive agency bringing together the relevant Federal \nagencies and departments into a single group ``giving the executive \nbranch the authority it needs to develop solutions to 21st century \nproblems while providing accountability to Congress.''\n  Foreign aid reform means many things to different people, but there \nis one thing we all agree on--it is overdue. Dr. Burrill's voice is one \nthat should be listened to, and I commend him for speaking out.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the article be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n            [From the Burlington Free Press, Apr. 30, 2009]\n\n      My Turn: Investing in Smart Power Is Foreign Aid Well Spent\n\n                          (By George Burrill)\n\n       During his campaign, Barack Obama called for salvaging \n     America's international reputation. Rebuilding international \n     respect and trust, he correctly maintained, is vital to our \n     future security and economic well-being. The president's new \n     budget proposal indicates that he intends to follow through \n     with this promise. Americans should be encouraged and \n     relieved that the budget supports an increased emphasis on \n     nonmilitary responses to our security and foreign policy \n     interests.\n       A major component of nonmilitary response is our foreign \n     assistance and development programs. They are critical in the \n     struggle against global poverty, open markets for our \n     products, spread our basic values, and help address global \n     environmental and economic problems. In the 21st century, \n     America needs smart power, as robust a diplomatic and \n     international development capability as it has military \n     strength. Now is the time to modernize our thinking about how \n     to relate to the developing world.\n       There are several steps the Obama administration must take \n     in order to achieve the promise of a bold makeover. These \n     steps are consistent with the effort to make government more \n     efficient and to ensure that the American public is getting \n     more services and impact for the dollar. And they won't cost \n     anything.\n       First, along with the redesign of our national security and \n     foreign policy, which the president has already vigorously \n     embarked upon, government needs to simultaneously create a \n     global development strategy. We need a coherent strategy that \n     will foster increases in economic opportunity for the bottom \n     billion of Earth's residents and help eliminate the \n     conditions that foster conflict in the developing world. When \n     the United States leads on international development and \n     relief issues, it enhances our international standing and \n     strengthens our relationships with allies. It creates \n     improved possibilities for America's global agenda.\n       Second, the White House needs to work with Congress and \n     representatives of the broader development community in \n     crafting new legislation that elevates development as a \n     foreign policy pillar, equal with diplomacy and military \n     defense. We currently have an outdated, inadequate set of \n     legislation; international foreign assistance efforts that \n     are spread across at least 20 different agencies (which has \n     created competing fiefdoms and inefficiency). No single \n     person or authority is clearly in charge that the president \n     and Congress can hold accountable. New legislation would \n     provide the congressional mandate for streamlined \n     organizational structures and coherent policies, and give the \n     executive branch the clear authority it needs to develop \n     solutions to 21st-century challenges while providing \n     accountability to Congress.\n       Third, a modernized set of foreign assistance policies and \n     operations must be placed in a single, streamlined, \n     consolidated and empowered U.S. development agency. The ideal \n     option for streamlining and eliminating the current, \n     inefficient, multi-agency situation would be to create a new \n     Cabinet-level department for global development, as is the \n     case in England. Or the White House could work with the \n     Congress and create a new subcabinet, independent executive \n     agency. Either option should merge all international \n     development and humanitarian programs into a single entity. \n     Agencies such as the U.S. Agency for International \n     Development, the Millennium Challenge Corp., the President's \n     Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief and all the international \n     development programs of various agencies including those in \n     the Department of Defense should be merged.\n       As a candidate, Obama indicated his support for these \n     actions, but there have been no recent public comments by the \n     administration about any planned reorganization. Efficiency \n     calls for it.\n       America cannot afford an uncoordinated, confused or second-\n     best approach to our relations with the developing world. Our \n     foreign assistance programs have immense importance in \n     addressing global poverty, eliminating the environments that \n     help create terrorists and fostering the advancement of a \n     sound global economy. The Obama administration and Congress \n     must not miss this opportunity to modernize our foreign \n     assistance infrastructure. Getting the most out of the new \n     budget demands it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/05/senate-section/article/S5120-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5120-S5122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard.\n\n[[Page S5121]]\n\nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       First I want to thank you for your e-mail up-dates. I am \n     very concerned about this so called ``energy crisis''. I find \n     it very interesting that as soon as the subprime crisis hit, \n     the banks, fund managers, and speculators found another way \n     to [profit from] the American people. Anyone who reads widely \n     can see what is happening here. [Those who] stole our money, \n     ran up the cost of housing and property, and overcharged \n     homebuyers are not going to be held responsible. Yes, the \n     good old taxpayers paid the price of the high cost of housing \n     and now we are taking it again as we see the overinflated \n     housing market take a dive. The banks and mortgage companies \n     lent money to the vulnerable that never should have been able \n     to buy such high-priced property. Then they covered [the \n     risky practice] by bundling their risk and selling it to all \n     of us as ``good investments.'' But no matter, now the good \n     old simple-minded taxpayers can pick up the tab--cannot let \n     those poor old bankers, land speculators, loan companies, \n     realtors, and land developers take a financial hit. \n     Personally, I think they should all be rounded up, their \n     money and land taken from them, and sent directly to jail for \n     the rest of their lives!\n       Now, how is all of this changing my life? My home value has \n     gone down, my investments are in the tank, the cost of food \n     is off the chart, the cost of gas is so high that I only go \n     to town once a week, and the vacation plan is gone. I once \n     drove to Nampa, Caldwell, or Boise to go shopping \n     occasionally, and now that is out of the question. We live \n     near Ontario, Oregon, and it only has a Wal-Mart and Kmart \n     store. If I want a nice pair of shoes, a dress, or a nice set \n     of towels, I have to go to Boise, but cannot afford that now. \n     I would buy online, but you never see a sale and the cost of \n     shipping has gone out of sight. Besides, when the item does \n     not fit or is not what you want, the cost of return shipping \n     is too high. Then you keep what you do not want and try not \n     to have a fit.\n       My only extravagance now is my Wall Street Journal, so that \n     I can keep up on what [what is happening] in business and \n     government. I see that the energy package faltered when the \n     House failed to pass the law that would allow the FTC to \n     investigate and punish motor fuels price gougers. Lawmakers \n     also postponed a measure that would crack down on excessive \n     speculation in energy futures trading markets. Our Congress \n     working for the best interest of the American people again! \n     The House passed the Medicare bill that would prevent cuts in \n     Medicare payment to physicians. However, members of the \n     Senate failed to invoke cloture and did not vote on the \n     issue. The senior citizens can just find doctors that will \n     take Medicare or do without. I was not surprised when the \n     House failed to act on two major domestic spending bills. [It \n     is unfortunate that partisan politics drive the agenda in \n     Congress, rather than the needs of the American people.]\n       I could go on, but I really have spent too much time on \n     venting my opinion which I know, of course, will have no \n     meaning. I encourage you to keep trying to do what is right \n     for the American people as a whole. I know that the answers \n     are not easy, but you must keep trying or we will ultimately \n     lose our democracy. Thank you for all of your efforts.\n                                                 Lynda, Fruitland.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n       We had to cancel our trip to Ohio to see my parents whom I \n     have not seen in six years. We also are now driving sixty \n     miles an hour to save on gas. We need to lift all \n     restrictions on drilling and refineries and start drilling \n     ASAP and building more refineries. Also start building \n     nuclear power plants. [Stop delaying over partisan arguments \n     and] start doing something good for Americans.\n     Randy.\n                                  ____\n\n       My family just celebrated my son's graduation from high \n     school. Because of the high gas prices, his aunt in Seattle, \n     Washington, and uncle in Denver, Colorado, could not attend \n     with their families. My oldest daughter has a family in \n     Wyoming that I cannot see but only once this year because of \n     the gas prices. Last year I was able to see my grandchildren \n     only twice. There are a couple of things we are still \n     planning to do but because of the gas we will not be \n     contributing as much to our local services like Salvation \n     Army or even our Church. Instead we have to take care of our \n     family first. It affects us financially as we will not be \n     able to save as much for our retirement which is hopefully in \n     another 12-15 years. At this rate, we will have nothing to \n     live on because of the cost of living has taken a hold of our \n     paychecks and the jobs are not increasing in revenue at the \n     same rate. We are not poor nor are we extremely wealthy. We \n     are your working class people.\n       By allowing another country to put a stranglehold on us in \n     such a manner, you will see a rise in unemployment, more \n     foreclosures, small business closures, children in foster \n     care, divorce, crime and suicide If our government cared \n     about our way of life, it would take care of us first and not \n     allow another country dictate what we have on our dinner \n     table at night or when we can see our family members again. \n     Congress not allowing for the drilling and refineries to be \n     built is affecting us as a nation. I am ashamed of the \n     direction our Congress is taking us. I believe our \n     forefathers would be too, if they could see what is taking \n     place. Have we not learned anything?\n       There is only two solutions for this. Sometimes you have to \n     grab the bull by the horns and hold on but the rewards are \n     there. Do not allow another country to have control of our \n     lives. As Americans, we are tired of it.\n     Carol Sue.\n                                  ____\n\n       You are right when you say on your website that we have no \n     other choice but to keep driving and pay the high prices of \n     oil. We live in the country, and we realize that is our \n     choice. Carpooling and public transportation are very \n     limited. We figure it is costing us $35-$60 per day just to \n     get to work. And our vehicles get 27-35 mpg! We drive an \n     economy car and a motorcycle, but we also have a family and \n     sometimes have to drive a larger vehicle. We have looked into \n     carpooling, which we are doing and saving about $20 per day, \n     and we are also looking into growing our canola to burn as \n     fuel. We have also stayed home as much as we can, which on a \n     larger scale is hurting the economy (everyone stays home, no \n     one goes out and spends money).\n       It is hard when you have to work two hours per day just to \n     pay for the gas to get there. We firmly believe that we \n     should drill our own oil in America and not give our money to \n     other countries. I would rather pay high prices to American \n     workers than to terrorists who want to harm us physically and \n     fiscally.\n       Still grateful to live in the greatest place on Earth,\n     Jeremy and Kristina.\n                                  ____\n\n       You asked for our story how gas prices affect us. All I can \n     say is the only people I know who pay $200 a month are the \n     ones that live in town. As you said, this is a rural state \n     and we do not have any options. I live 18 miles north of \n     Sandpoint; for my car alone we pay over $200 a month. My \n     husband is a heavy equipment operator. He works all over \n     north Idaho and into Washington around the Spokane area. We \n     pay $900 a month for his vehicle in gas. We have talked about \n     how he might have to take a lower-paying job in Sandpoint if \n     the gas prices continue to go up. It is becoming very \n     difficult to make ends meet when you are spending $1,100 a \n     month on just gas. The most frustrating part is when you read \n     in the news that it is speculators driving the price up. \n     There is no shortage--just greedy men, bankrupting this \n     nation.\n       So my question is why do you want our stories? What do you \n     see needs to be done? From where I sit, I do not see any \n     politicians doing much about it. We just wonder when or if it \n     is going to stop.\n     Danielle, Sandpoint.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for your invite to share my story on how energy \n     prices are affecting me, my family and life. However, I am \n     not going trouble you with my woes. With all due respect, \n     stories mean little; action means everything and it is high \n     time that Congress addressed the problem seriously and in \n     place of rhetoric.\n       You are correct--we do need to consider alternate energy. \n     The trouble is we need to start doing something about it \n     instead of talking about doing so. In Idaho, we do two things \n     well--we produce abundant sunshine and wind! Take a listen to \n     a maverick oil man and his five-minute plan; he makes a ton \n     of sense and it is worth your time. One cannot say that T. \n     Boone Pickens is a fool. Being a pilot, I have flown the man; \n     I know for a fact. Video: T. Boone Pickens 5 Minute Plan, \n     http://link.brightcove.com/services/link/bcpid1641244028/\n bclid1641831933/bctid1653634930.\n       However, as well you know, alternate energy is not going to \n     happen overnight, and it will take years to transition from \n     where we are today to where we need to go tomorrow especially \n     if we continue jawboning about it. Until then, until we \n     actually start a real transitional journey, we are going to \n     continue to be dependent upon oil, which is in and of itself \n     not a problem since there is an abundance of oil within the \n     confines of our very own borders that dwarfs that which is in \n     the Middle East. It is high time we stopped worrying about \n     the caribou and goodness knows what else. These are times for \n     action and not words. And again, we need Congress to face \n     facts and stop blocking vital resources of oil.\n       The Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and the oil shale of \n     Colorado, Utah and Wyoming are reported to dwarf the oil \n     reserves of the Middle East and, if you throw in the \n     Athabasca oil sands north of Ft. McMurray in Alberta that the \n     Canadians are exploiting (they say one third of the world's \n     known oil reserves reside there) then in essence if it were \n     not for the [arrangements] that we have with Saudi Arabia we \n     could in essence tell the Arabs to go pound sand and be free \n     of anyone's oil but our own. Or, at the very least the \n     supposed energy crisis would be just what it is in reality, a \n     NON-crisis with artificially high prices that are crippling \n     our economy.\n       Please, if you truly care about Idaho, Idahoans and indeed, \n     the rest of the country,\n\n[[Page S5122]]\n\n     and, I believe you are one of the few in [Congress] that do, \n     then take a listen to T. Boone Pickens, do some research into \n     the oil shale in our neighboring states, research the \n     minuscule coastal area that would be affected by drilling in \n     the ANWR and convince the rest of Congress to [move ahead \n     with realistic and lasting solutions.]\n       Thanks for giving me the opportunity to give my 2 cents \n     worth or, in my case, more like a quarters worth.\n     Marcus, Bellevue.\n                                  ____\n\n       We installed propane heating in our home when it was the \n     energy-saving thing to do! The cost of propane then was under \n     30 cents a gallon. We knew it would not stay that low, but in \n     the last five years we have seen the cost go up to over $2 a \n     gallon. This past year, our heating cost went over $2,000 for \n     a heating season. With the high energy prices, we get to \n     choose, wrap up in blankets to keep warm so we can buy gas to \n     go to the store and buy a loaf of bread and gallon of milk or \n     buy heating fuel to stay warm and not eat. Some choice!\n     Unsigned.\n                                  ____\n\n       My story may be coming from a different angle; you see, I \n     am nearly 62, working for Boeing trying to get enough money \n     to retire and move back to Idaho. My investments have lost \n     $130,000 in the last six months. My portfolio is fairly \n     conservative or I would have lost much more. I am not wealthy \n     by any means, so that much of a loss will set me back several \n     years in my retirement plans.\n       All the while I am looking at Congress to come up with an \n     energy policy that makes sense so our economy can flourish. \n     At this point I am so tired of hearing that we cannot drill \n     in ANWR or offshore that I have considered retiring early \n     just to spend my senior years trying to [make a difference on \n     how the Congress represents the people]. With [the] current \n     approval rating of 9%, [Congress should recognize that the \n     public does not approve of its work.] If my approval rating \n     was less that 75% I would be fired on the spot. Think about \n     it--would you fly on a Boeing airplane that worked 75% of the \n     time?\n     Rulon.\n                                  ____\n\n       The astonishing increases in fuel prices this year are \n     hitting everyone on a national basis very hard indeed. We are \n     a nation that runs on fuel. Everything we buy, be it a \n     necessity such as food or the very fuel we use in our \n     vehicles is shipped in, and the vehicles that ship those \n     goods to us run on diesel, and guess what fuel is priced the \n     highest.\n       Why this is I have no idea, but I do know that, at the rate \n     that the cost of diesel is increasing, it will not be long \n     until buying food will be something akin to if not worse than \n     the Great Depression of the 1930s. Already I have been \n     hearing of farms all over the USA that cannot afford the fuel \n     it takes to harvest their crops. As a result, the crops are \n     left to rot in the fields.\n       My own family is rapidly approaching the point of deciding \n     between food, the mortgage, and fuel to get to work. \n     Personally, I drive a diesel pick-up and, in July of last \n     year, 28 gallons (1 tankful) of diesel would cost me $65-$70. \n     Now it costs me close to $140 for the same amount of diesel, \n     despite my diesel pick-up getting amazing economy. I am still \n     getting hit hard by these prices, which have more than \n     doubled in one year.\n       One thing in particular that I cannot figure out is why the \n     Western states are paying much higher fuel prices than other \n     states. Where I am coming from on this is a interesting \n     innovation on fuel price tracking called the ``Gas \n     Temperature Map'' http://gasbuddy.com/\ngb_gastemperaturemap.aspx. See for yourself, Western States \n     are paying significantly higher prices than many southern & \n     eastern states are. Why, I have no idea nor do I have the \n     time and resources to research it effectively, but I am sure \n     a lot of other Idahoans would also be interested in why this \n     is the case.\n       There is much more I could say on this, but I realize you \n     are a busy man, so I will save it for another time. It is my \n     sincere hope that yourself and other Representatives like you \n     can find a way to somehow turn this nightmare around.\n     Dan.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to tell you how the high cost \n     of fuel is affecting me. I live on the west side of Idaho \n     Falls. I work on the east side of the city. I realize that \n     people in bigger cities have much bigger commutes, but we \n     have no real public transit so I have to drive. I own a Honda \n     Civic, but am considering a scooter. Because of the winters \n     in Idaho, that is not a practical option. With the price of \n     fuel, food and health insurance going up every day, all I can \n     afford to do is drive to work and back. I have had to cut out \n     movies, trips, and dining out. I received a letter from Delta \n     airlines that was titled ``An Open Letter To All Airline \n     Customers.'' I hope you have seen it and are in a position to \n     do something to stop unnecessary price gouging. Nuclear fuel \n     is very clean and safer than most other forms of fuel, why \n     are we not looking into that more closely? Thank you again \n     for this opportunity.\n     Karen.\n                                  ____\n\n       The energy issue in the state of Idaho is out of hand, and \n     one that families cannot afford. The state government should \n     be offering land for development of wind energy, and \n     renewable recourses, Just make them paint the towers with \n     camo about halfway up. There should be far more incentives \n     for home owners to add solar power to their homes, and \n     incentives for companies that do that kind of work to come \n     into Idaho. Allowing logging companies to go into our forests \n     and do selective harvest makes a win-win situation for \n     everyone man and animal. A lot of the social services done in \n     this area do not require a car and should be revoked from \n     those who abuse the use of city, county, and state cars. That \n     ticks me off more than the price of fuel.\n     Lyle and Family, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       Tax credits for clean energy are absolutely essential to \n     our energy future and to our economy. Society suffers from \n     the lack of alternatives while oil companies reap large \n     profits. In spite of all the tax benefits that oil companies \n     receive, they show a reluctance to make investments in a \n     timely fashion and realize large profits, which they return \n     to investors and management.\n     Mary.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a 68-year-old taxpaying American citizen, and military \n     veteran. I live in Coeur d'Alene and work in Spokane, \n     Washington. It is getting increasingly more difficult to \n     afford the gas to drive to and from work. Carpooling or the \n     use of public transportation is out of the question as I work \n     in the construction industry on various jobs throughout the \n     Spokane area.\n       The time has come to start drilling for oil in Alaska, \n     Colorado, Wyoming, and offshore. From what has been in the \n     news and from what we read in various publications, all from \n     very intelligent engineers and scientists, we know the oil is \n     there. We have shale deposits in several states that we could \n     be using. We need to work harder on wind and nuclear power. \n     The states want to drill, and we need to lift the federal \n     bans.\n       We should either sell or give the abandoned military bases \n     to companies willing to build refineries on them. The time \n     has come to quit asking--it is time to demand that this be \n     done. We have the resources, let us use them. The United \n     States of America should not have to go begging to other \n     countries for oil when we have it within our own shores.\n       We, the people, should not be suffering these exorbitant \n     prices due to the incompetence in all areas of our \n     government, and speculators in the stock market.\n     Wayne, Coeur d'Alene.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/05/senate-section/article/S5122-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5122-S5126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                      SPECIAL OTIS BOWEN LECTURES\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nremarks by Ralph Neas be printed in the Record.\n  The being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in the \nRecord, as follows:\n\nRemarks of Ralph G. Neas, CEO of the National Coalition on Health Care, \n  the Special Otis Bowen Lecture, University of Notre Dame, March 26, \n                                  2009\n\n       Thank you. It is truly an honor and a privilege to be here \n     with you today as a participant in the Otis Bowen lecture \n     series.\n       I want to express my appreciation to Dr. Mark Walsh for \n     inviting me, and commend all the conveners and hosts of this \n     gathering. I congratulate Indiana University and the \n     University of Notre Dame for the collaboration that brought \n     IU's medical school to the Notre Dame campus.\n       I want to especially thank Otis ``Doc'' Bowen, the 44th \n     Governor of Indiana, and the Secretary of Health and Human \n     Services during the Reagan Administration. His leadership, \n     commitment to the public interest, and his contributions to \n     Indiana and the Nation are exemplary and should serve as a \n     model for us all to emulate.\n       Dr. Bowen, both Dr. Henry Simmons, the visionary founder \n     and president of the National Coalition on Health Care \n     (NCHC), and former Governor Robert Ray of Iowa, the Co-Chair \n     of NCHC, send their warm regards. Dr. Simmons was one of \n     President Richard Nixon's top health care advisors in the \n     early 1970s and worked on the Grace Commission which in the \n     1980s found that one-third of all income taxes were consumed \n     by waste and inefficiency. He has devoted his professional \n     life to improving health care for all Americans. And Governor \n     Ray worked with Dr. Simmons and you many times over the past \n     several decades. I am so proud to be working with them.\n       Our timing is propitious. Indeed, the conveners of this \n     event were prescient. We gather tonight at an extraordinary \n     moment in history: The Nation is facing the worst economic \n     crisis in more than seven decades and Americans urgently need \n     a better health care system; our health care system is \n     dysfunctional and represents an unsustainable drain on our \n     economy as a whole. It is inefficient and inequitable; urgent \n     action is required to systematically address what is an \n     incredibly challenging and morally troubling policy problem \n     affecting every American.\n       In short, the health care system in the United States is in \n     desperate need of significant reform. However, we should \n     emphasize at the beginning that we need an American solution. \n     We can and should borrow from the best of what works \n     elsewhere. But we should recognize our unique history and the \n     special characteristics of the American people.\n       The good news is that the President and Congress are \n     seriously considering health\n\n[[Page S5123]]\n\n     care reform. In fact, in just the past month we have seen a \n     presidential address to a joint session of Congress, a \n     presidential budget, and a presidential summit, all \n     prominently featuring systemic, systematic health care \n     reform. In addition, the Senate and House of Representatives \n     have already commenced comprehensive hearings.\n       We must succeed. Too much is at stake: the health and well-\n     being of millions of American families, and the future of the \n     Nation's economic and fiscal health. Also at stake, I \n     believe, is whether we can help restore the trust and \n     confidence of the American people in their government.\n       So I cannot imagine a better time for us to be having this \n     conversation. And I couldn't be happier that it is happening \n     here. The University of Notre Dame, and people connected to \n     Notre Dame, have been central to my life in more ways than I \n     can count.\n       I was a student here during the 1960s. As a young person I \n     had watched on television as Bull Connor turned dogs and fire \n     hoses on civil rights marchers. I had watched Martin Luther \n     King champion human dignity in the face of bigotry and \n     violence.\n       Early on, I wondered whether I had a vocation to the \n     priesthood, but I found in Dr. King and the Kennedys an \n     inspiration to public service as a different kind of \n     vocation. And that brought me to Notre Dame. Father Ted \n     Hesburgh became the first of many Notre Dame role models, \n     teachers, and mentors who have sustained and guided me ever \n     since.\n       The last time I spoke at Notre Dame was about 25 years ago, \n     in 1983. I was just a short time into my tenure as executive \n     director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights, and I \n     was asked to address a conference for Catholic laity on work \n     and faith in society sponsored by the U.S. Conference of \n     Catholic Bishops. I believe, like the late Senator Phil Hart \n     of Michigan, that politics can be a high vocation--that a \n     politician can be a lay priest of society.\n       In preparing for that speech, I realized that I had learned \n     about human dignity and equality before God from my church \n     and my family long before I learned about the legal principle \n     of equality under the law from my college and law school \n     professors. Those principles have guided my life's work and \n     are central to what I am here to talk about today.\n       Another principle that has guided my political life is \n     bipartisanship. I had the extraordinary good fortune to work \n     for two remarkable Republican senators early in my public \n     service career--Edward W. Brooke of Massachusetts, and David \n     Durenberger of Minnesota. They were politicians and public \n     servants who were less interested in ideology and political \n     positioning, and more interested in moving the Nation \n     forward, in finding workable solutions to the Nation's \n     problems. They weren't just willing to work across the \n     partisan aisle; it was central to who they were.\n       These principles were at the core of my decision last month \n     to accept the position as CEO of the National Coalition on \n     Health Care. After I decided to step down as president of \n     People For the American Way, I had spoken with many other \n     health care coalitions and institutions. But I had a keen \n     personal and professional interest in working to achieve \n     health care reform in the most non-ideological and most non-\n     partisan way possible. And I was impressed by what a great \n     fit there was between the National Coalition and my skills, \n     background, and approach to public policy.\n       The National Coalition on Health Care is the largest, \n     broadest, most diverse coalition working to achieve \n     comprehensive health care reform. It is an alliance of 79 \n     organizations representing business, unions, health care \n     providers, associations of religious congregations, \n     minorities, people with disabilities, pension and health \n     funds, insurers, and groups representing patients and \n     consumers. Our member organizations represent more than 150 \n     million Americans. They speak for a cross-section, and a \n     majority, of our population.\n       Our board includes Frank Carlucci, who served several \n     Republican and Democratic presidents in a range of \n     intelligence, national security, and ambassadorial positions, \n     and Israel Gaither, the National Commander of the Salvation \n     Army. It includes John Sweeney, the president of the AFL-CIO, \n     and William Novelli, the CEO of AARP. It includes John \n     McArthur, dean emeritus of the Harvard Business School, \n     Cheryl Healton, President of the American Legacy Foundation, \n     and John Seffrin, CEO of the National Cancer Society. These \n     are organizations and leaders who individually play a major \n     role in our society and in public policy making. Together \n     they represent an extraordinary breadth of expertise and \n     resources.\n       The Coalition is rigorously nonpartisan. Former Presidents \n     George H. W. Bush and Jimmy Carter are our honorary co-\n     chairs. Former Iowa Governor Robert Ray, a Republican, and \n     former Congressman Bob Edgar, a Democrat from Pennsylvania \n     are its co-chairmen. We believe it is essential to make \n     reform a bipartisan process and a bipartisan achievement.\n       I am especially proud of two of the pillars of the \n     Coalition.\n       One of those pillars is religious organizations. The U.S. \n     Conference of Catholic Bishops is a member of the National \n     Coalition on Health Care because the Catholic tradition \n     affirms that access to health care is a basic human right and \n     a requirement of human dignity. The Catholic bishops are \n     joined in that belief, and in our coalition, by the Salvation \n     Army, the Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, the \n     Presbyterian and Episcopal Churches, the United Methodist \n     General Board of Church and Society, and the National Council \n     of Churches.\n       The backing and active participation of these religious \n     communities gives us access to their networks of local \n     religious leaders and lay people. We are well equipped to \n     engage policymakers and the public on the moral poverty of \n     leaving millions of Americans without access to quality \n     affordable health care, and on the moral urgency of tackling \n     that problem.\n       Another especially significant pillar of our coalition is \n     the medical societies, which together represent hundreds of \n     thousands of doctors. They include the American College of \n     Cardiology, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \n     College of Surgeons, the American Academy of Family \n     Physicians, and the American College of Emergency Physicians. \n     Also included are the American Dental Education Association, \n     the Duke University Medical Center and Johns Hopkins \n     Medicine. And just yesterday the Association of American \n     Medical Colleges, along with the Council of Teaching \n     Hospitals, joined our Coalition. This is a very serious brain \n     trust of physicians, medical educators, and their advocates.\n       During the last major health care reform effort in 1993 and \n     1994, many of the medical societies opposed that effort. But \n     they working with us now, I think, for several reasons. \n     First, the need for reform has become increasingly obvious \n     and urgent to everyone who cares about making sure that \n     people have access to quality health care. Second, I believe \n     that doctors have a better view than anyone of the current \n     system's problems, inefficiencies, and distortions. I \n     remember a time in the 1980s when a rallying cry from \n     conservative pundits was ``let Reagan be Reagan.'' Part of \n     what we're trying to accomplish here is to ``let doctors be \n     doctors!'' More than just about anything else, doctors \n     want to practice medicine.\n       Also, this year, everyone has been invited to the table. My \n     own experience tells me that is how lasting progress is made. \n     In the early 1980s, I was selected to lead the Leadership \n     Conference on Civil Rights, the Nation's oldest and largest \n     civil rights coalition. Working with Republican and \n     Democratic leaders, with business and labor and public \n     interest advocates, we accomplished great things. The passage \n     of the life- and culture-changing Americans with Disabilities \n     Act. The strengthening of every major civil rights law with \n     huge bipartisan congressional majorities, and often with the \n     support of the business community.\n       That could only be accomplished by building active \n     alliances across party lines, engaging business and nonprofit \n     leaders, public officials and community activists. We had to \n     find ways to address each community's needs with a pragmatic \n     and principled eye on the ultimate goal of advancing the \n     common good.\n       The members and board of the National Coalition on Health \n     Care understand that all the elements of our health care \n     system are interdependent. So are the health care sector and \n     the broader economy. That is why any solution must be \n     systemic and system-wide if it is to be meaningful and \n     effective.\n       And that's also why reform must be accomplished now.\n       Let me make a case for urgency by discussing the nature of \n     our health care problem.\n       There is no question that our system produces and includes \n     extraordinarily gifted medical professionals. I am alive \n     today because 30 years ago I had access to some of the best \n     medical care the world has to offer.\n       But millions of Americans do not have affordable access to \n     that care. Indeed, nearly 50 million Americans do not have \n     health insurance--a number that grows with every layoff, or \n     with every employer who cuts health coverage to avoid cutting \n     jobs. Every 2 years, some 90 million Americans go without \n     health coverage. Another 20 million are underinsured.\n       What does that mean to individuals and families? It can be \n     disastrous for their physical and financial health.\n       People without insurance--or without sufficient insurance--\n     are less likely to get preventive care that will keep them \n     healthy. They are less likely to go to a doctor when they \n     become ill. Their serious illnesses are diagnosed when they \n     are more advanced and harder to treat. They put off \n     treatments they need but cannot afford.\n       And when they do face serious injury or illness, the cost \n     of treatment can be devastating to their families.\n       There are a lot of numbers and statistics that we use to \n     analyze and describe the current state of our health care \n     system. One that really leaps out to me--that is especially \n     heartbreaking--is that currently one-half of all personal \n     bankruptcies, and one half of all foreclosures, are caused by \n     an inability to pay medical expenses.\n       Think about what that means.\n       Thousands and thousands of families, already traumatized by \n     serious illness or tragic accident, are punished even \n     further. They go through a medical crisis and are forced into \n     a financial crisis. They say good-bye to a loved one--and are \n     forced out of their home. And there is no telling the toll on \n     communities of citizens who are sidelined--or worse--by a \n     condition that could have been treated less expensively and \n     more effectively if the cost of care had not kept people \n     away.\n\n[[Page S5124]]\n\n       These are not just tragic stories. They are evidence of an \n     unforgivable level of cruelty in our current health care \n     system.\n       And, of course, all these consequences are not limited to \n     the uninsured and underinsured. The consequences are shared; \n     the burden is shared, by everyone. The costs of emergency \n     room care for the uninsured are shifted to other parts of the \n     system, to other payers. According to a study by Emory \n     University health care economist Kenneth Thorpe, the cost of \n     providing uncompensated care to uninsured patients adds more \n     than $1,000 per year to the average cost of employer-\n     sponsored family coverage.\n       And that leads us to the second part of the problem we must \n     address--the staggering cost of health care in this country, \n     which is growing in ways that Americans and America cannot \n     afford.\n       The cost of insurance is an increasingly heavy burden even \n     for those who have it. Over the past decade, employers and \n     workers have seen their health care costs rise 120 percent. \n     On the other hand, wages only increased 34 percent during the \n     same period (while inflation rose 29 percent). The average \n     cost to families rose from just over $6,000 per year to \n     about $12,000 per year. That is a huge amount for many \n     middle class families. It is an insurmountable burden for \n     working families.\n       And unless we act, it will only get worse. Richard Johnson \n     and Rudolph Penner of the Urban Institute projected that in \n     2030, out-of-pocket health care costs will consume more than \n     35 percent of after-tax income for older married couples. \n     That is more than double the 16 percent that health care \n     costs took from those couples in 2000.\n       As a Nation, we spend $2.5 trillion in health care costs \n     every year. That is a sixth of our national economy, or about \n     $6,000 per capita. That is twice as much as the average of \n     all industrialized countries, and 50 percent more than the \n     next Nation on the list. (And remember, those countries cover \n     all their citizens, while 15 percent of Americans have no \n     coverage at all.)\n       Costs have been consistently rising at a much higher rate \n     than the consumer price index. We as a Nation simply cannot \n     afford double-digit growth in health care costs year after \n     year. They make it harder for businesses to provide health \n     care coverage for their employees--and those employees find \n     it harder to pay the growing share they are asked to \n     contribute to that coverage.\n       The increasing cost to small and large businesses is a dire \n     challenge to their profitability, competitiveness and \n     survival. It drains funds from research and development, \n     makes it more expensive to hire new employees, and makes it \n     less affordable to offer workers increased wages. Increasing \n     costs undermine the viability of pension funds. And they \n     increasingly put American businesses at a competitive \n     disadvantage to companies abroad who have much lower health \n     care costs.\n       And the fiscal drain to state and federal governments is \n     ruinous. It has been estimated that by 2050, Medicare and \n     Medicaid combined will consume more than double their current \n     share of our gross national product. Our country's financial \n     health--as well as that of individuals, families, and \n     companies--requires that we get costs under control.\n       Closely connected to the problem of runaway costs is the \n     national epidemic of substandard care. It may be hard to \n     believe, but every year 100,000 Americans die from \n     preventable medical mistakes. Another 100,000 die from \n     infections contracted in U.S. hospitals. Millions of others \n     are injured or affected, with cascading consequences for \n     their families, their employers, their communities. It has \n     been estimated that preventable health care accidents, \n     errors, and poor quality of care are the Nation's third \n     leading cause of death after cancer and heart disease.\n       A few years ago a major study by the RAND Institute \n     examined the medical records of thousands of patients from 12 \n     metropolitan areas and evaluated the care they received using \n     indicators of quality developed by specialty expert panels. \n     They found that patients got about 55 percent of recommended \n     care. We should not be willing to accept or tolerate this \n     mismatch between standards and actual practices.\n       And here is more evidence of the interconnected nature of \n     these problems. Two different research studies have estimated \n     that dealing with defects in the quality of our health care \n     could reduce the total cost of health care by 30 percent. 30 \n     percent. That's $750 billion per year. That is a huge \n     financial incentive to deal with the quality of care and the \n     waste and inefficiencies of our current system.\n       So that is the outline of the health care challenge we \n     face--uncontrolled costs, unacceptable quality of care, and \n     unconscionable lack of access to care for millions of \n     Americans.\n       Acting urgently is both a moral and financial imperative.\n       The current economic crisis is putting more families out of \n     work, putting greater strain on companies that struggle to \n     provide health care, and putting enormous fiscal strains on \n     Federal and State budgets.\n       President Obama has called for lawmakers to take action \n     this year. In response, some pundits and critics have \n     suggested that the Obama administration is putting too much \n     on its plate--that it should hold off on health care reform \n     while it figures out how to deal with the financial crisis.\n       But that is not possible. Health care is such an enormous \n     part of the economy, is so interwoven with individual, \n     corporate, and governmental crises, that it is not possible \n     to address our economic woes without taking up health care \n     reform. We have reached the point where the public's most \n     pressing domestic concerns--economic growth, jobs, and \n     retirement security, and health care--are fundamentally \n     intertwined. The first three concerns cannot be addressed \n     effectively unless health care costs are contained. The cost \n     of doing nothing far exceeds the costs of taking action now. \n     And if we implement real systemic reforms now, we will save \n     trillions of dollars in the long run.\n       As economist Peter Orzag says, the road to fiscal \n     sustainability runs through health care reform. Ben Bernanke, \n     the chairman of the Federal Reserve System, puts it this \n     way:\n       ``The decision we make about health care reform will affect \n     many aspects of our economy, including the pace of economic \n     growth, wages and living standards, and government budgets, \n     to name a few . . . As the public interest in these issues \n     testifies, the stakes associated with health care reform, \n     both economic and social, are very high.''\n       So, act we must. But how?\n       It is easy to be dismayed at the size and complexity of the \n     problem--and by past failures to address it. But we cannot \n     shy from reform. Nor can we let a political stalemate grind \n     the process to a halt.\n       I am a veteran of many difficult battles in Washington. \n     I've been part of them for 35 years. And I've never seen a \n     bigger challenge, substantively or politically.\n       But I am cautiously optimistic about the possibilities for \n     real reform this year. There exists a rare confluence of \n     economic, political, and historic circumstances. There is a \n     much broader consensus on the need for ambitious reform. And \n     we are seeing all the stakeholders coming to the table, not \n     with the goal of turning the table over and maintaining the \n     status quo, but to seek some kind of resolution to the \n     systemic problems that can no longer be denied or \n     rationalized away.\n       That's what the National Health Care Coalition is committed \n     to doing this year.\n       And, I'm proud to say, we're ready because we've already \n     done our homework. I've been talking a lot about the problem. \n     Let's talk about the solution.\n       The Coalition spent 18 months working with our board, \n     member organizations, and health care experts to reach a \n     consensus on principles and specifications for reform. \n     There's no more detailed or comprehensive proposal on the \n     table that I'm aware of.\n       The overarching requirement is that reform be both systemic \n     and system-wide. With that as an understanding, we have laid \n     out five principles for reform and specific and achievable \n     approaches within each category.\n       The first principle is coverage for all Americans. We \n     believe coverage should be defined clearly and \n     comprehensively. It should include emergency care, acute \n     care, prescription drugs, oral health care, early detection \n     and screening, preventative care (including smoking cessation \n     programs), care for chronic conditions, and end-of-life care. \n     There should be no exclusion for pre-existing conditions.\n       We recognize a range of options--and possible combinations \n     of options--can be used to achieve this goal: employer \n     mandates, supplemented with individual mandates as necessary; \n     expansion of existing public programs that cover subsets of \n     the uninsured; creation of new public programs targeted at \n     groups of the uninsured; or establishment of a universal \n     publicly financed system.\n       Participation must be universal, and there must be \n     subsidies provided for those least able to afford coverage. \n     But none of these options requires a government-run system.\n       The second principle is cost management. The numbers that I \n     talked about earlier make it clear that it will not be \n     possible to achieve sustainable reform without tackling the \n     cost issue head-on.\n       Cost management must be a multi-faceted undertaking. It \n     should include: a plan to make health insurance premiums \n     easier to compare by requiring insurers to establish separate \n     premiums for the core benefit package and any supplemental \n     coverage; a rational mechanism for increasing the cost-\n     effectiveness of capital spending; cost-sharing and other \n     tools to provide more and better information and incentives \n     for patients to make good choices about health maintenance \n     and care, and reduce over-use and under-use; an increased \n     emphasis on prevention and early detection of disease; a \n     commitment to improving quality of care; investment in a \n     health care information infrastructure; and steps to \n     modernize and simplify the administration, and dramatically \n     reduce the administrative costs of the health care system.\n       It is true that successful reform of all the areas we have \n     talked about will produce significant long-term savings. But \n     it is also essential to begin immediately to bend the cost \n     curve and slowing those double-digit increases that are \n     outstripping our ability to pay for them. The increases in \n     health care costs and insurance premiums for the core package \n     of benefits should be brought into line with percentage \n     increases in per-capital gross domestic product. And we \n     should aim to achieve that goal within 5 years after the \n     enactment of legislation.\n\n[[Page S5125]]\n\n       There must be short-term cost constraints that would \n     include rates for reimbursing providers for care encompassed \n     by the core benefit package, and limits in increases in \n     insurance premiums for the core benefit package. We are not \n     advocating for cuts in reimbursement rates. But slowing the \n     rate of increase is vital--and will reduce the likelihood of \n     sudden cuts made under the stress of financial crisis.\n       We recommend that these efforts to manage costs be \n     established and administered by an independent board \n     chartered and overseen by Congress.\n       The third basic principle is one I just mentioned in terms \n     of cost containment--that is a national effort to improve the \n     quality and safety of care.\n       This includes accelerated development of a national \n     information technology infrastructure, as well as increased \n     emphasis on prevention and early detection of disease, and \n     research on comparative effectiveness and practice guidelines \n     to reduce waste and improve the safety and effectiveness of \n     health care.\n       The members of the National Coalition on Health Care \n     recommend that national practice guidelines be developed by \n     panels of leading health care professional based on reviews \n     of research on the effectiveness and impact of technologies \n     and treatment. Conforming to these best practice guidelines \n     could not only reduce unnecessary treatment and costs, but \n     could also help protect medical professionals against \n     frivolous or marginal lawsuits.\n       Fourth, we must make the financing of health care more \n     equitable and reduce or eliminate cost-shifting.\n       Again in this area we have identified a range of mechanisms \n     that could be used, individually or in some combination, to \n     fund the costs of necessary reforms and assuring that every \n     American is covered: general revenues, earmarked taxes or \n     fees, required contributions from employers, required \n     contributions from individuals and families, which would \n     include co-payments, deductibles, and contributions toward \n     premiums.\n       Subsidies should be provided, or financial obligations \n     varied, based on relative ability to pay for less affluent \n     individuals, families, and employers.\n       And fifth, we must simplify the administration of health \n     care. The United States spends more than any other Nation--\n     hundreds of billions of dollars every year--to administer our \n     health care system. Administrative expenses incurred by \n     private health insurers rose 52 percent between 1999 and \n     2002.\n       Our system's complexity is not only expensive; it is also \n     confusing and frustrating for patients and doctors. And its \n     lack of transparency undermines both accountability and the \n     ability of individuals and organizations to make market-based \n     decisions.\n       Assuring coverage for all Americans, and establishing a \n     core benefit package, would create a consistent set of ground \n     rules for patients, providers and payers.\n       An integrated technology infrastructure would not only \n     reduce administrative complexity and costs, but help to \n     reduce medical errors, protect patients' safety, and improve \n     outcomes.\n       These principles--coverage for all, cost containment, \n     quality and effectiveness of care, simplified administration, \n     and equitable financing--are interdependent. And we must deal \n     with them that way.\n       Taken together, the National Coalition on Health Care \n     specifications provide an ambitious and achievable guide to \n     our Nation's lawmakers. We know what investments and policy \n     changes we need to make now in order to improve access and \n     quality of health care in a way that the Nation can afford.\n       We have a road map. Now we need to keep policymakers \n     focused on the journey.\n       President Obama, who recently hosted a bipartisan summit on \n     health care reform at the White House--has urged Congress to \n     give him reform legislation this year. He has put a \n     significant down payment for reform in his budget.\n       While I do not think the Administration has yet been \n     ambitious enough--dealing, for example, in a realistic way \n     with the need to contain costs--I believe the White House has \n     learned important lessons from the experience of 1993 and \n     1994. They are including all stakeholders from the beginning. \n     They are putting forward broad principles and counting on \n     Congress to write the legislation. And they are moving in a \n     bipartisan fashion, inviting Republican and Democratic \n     congressional leaders into their conversations.\n       I believe bipartisanship is essential not just because we \n     need 60 votes in the Senate, but because a bipartisan \n     consensus would be good for the country as we move forward in \n     this enormous, and enormously important, undertaking.\n       We must understand fully that time is our most formidable \n     foe. We must achieve health care reform now, not only to \n     protect and advance Americans' health, but to shore up our \n     reeling economy. We must take advantage of the political \n     momentum for change. We must overcome those who might be \n     tempted to see the failure of reform as a political \n     opportunity.\n       Reform must be enacted this year--and as of today the year \n     is already almost one-quarter behind us.\n       In Congress, there are at least seven major committees that \n     have some jurisdiction and will be involved in crafting \n     reform legislation. That means multiple subcommittee hearings \n     and markups, full committee markups, House and Senate floor \n     debates and votes, and the House-Senate conference committee. \n     All of this takes time. As I tell my law school legislative \n     process classes, there are 100 decision-making points in the \n     legislative process, and each of them is a point at which \n     compromise can take place.\n       If we are to have reform enacted this year, we must have a \n     bill through the Senate with a bipartisan consensus by Labor \n     Day. So each day is enormously consequential. We have no time \n     for ideological warfare or partisan posturing. This truly is \n     a time for pragmatism to trump ideology. We need to be \n     focused on what works. And we cannot allow the perfect to be \n     the enemy of the good.\n       We can do this.\n       A few years ago, my father-in-law was in Rome. He was at \n     the Vatican when he collapsed with a heart problem. He was \n     attended to by the Pope's doctor--the finest care he could \n     have asked for. And when he had recovered and asked how much \n     he owed, the answer was ``nothing!'' His health care in Italy \n     was free. I know it's a simple story, and our quest for an \n     American solution is anything but simple, but there's no \n     reason we cannot achieve the same kinds of access to \n     affordable quality care that other nations provide.\n       There is another story that explains why I am so committed \n     to making this work--and why I have faith that it can.\n       In 1979, as a young man of 32, I was diagnosed with \n     Guillain-Barre Syndrome, a disease that paralyzes the nerves \n     and muscles. Over a period of weeks I became completely \n     paralyzed, unable to breathe on my own or move a muscle. I \n     was put on a respirator for 75 days, and was eventually given \n     general absolution when it was not clear that I would \n     survive.\n       Three of my doctors in St. Mary's hospital in Minneapolis, \n     Minnesota, were Notre Dame graduates, including chief of \n     staff Pat Barrett, who was the football team's doctor on the \n     road. They helped me survive and recuperate. But no one was \n     more important than my mother, who traveled to Minneapolis \n     from a suburb of Chicago and sat at my bedside, holding my \n     hand, for 50 of my first 100 days in the intensive care unit. \n     And then there was Sister Margaret Francis Schilling, a nun \n     who had survived Guillain-Barre 25 years earlier, and who was \n     celebrating her 50th anniversary as a nun in 1979, who talked \n     to me every day, who prayed with me every night, and who \n     helped save my life and renew my faith.\n       You can probably understand why, when given the opportunity \n     to be transferred to the Mayo Clinic, I told my parents that \n     I wanted to stay at St. Mary's. Sometimes the appearance of \n     near-mystical serendipity trumps all other considerations.\n       The experience taught me many things, most notably how \n     vulnerable each of us is, and how dependent we are on each \n     other. I had been a young hot-shot on a fast track \n     congressional career. I thought I could do anything. As long \n     as I worked hard and never gave up, I would not need anybody. \n     I learned the hard way how wrong I was. I learned first-hand \n     how quickly our lives and health can take a turn. I came out \n     of that experience with a renewed commitment to public \n     service, and with a sense of how interdependent different \n     vocations--like Sister Margaret's, my doctors', and mine--\n     could be.\n       After I finished my physical rehabilitation, and recovered \n     my physical and mental stamina, I began interviewing for \n     jobs. My parents, Senator Brooke, and Senator Durenberger \n     were all advocating that I join a law firm and begin a more \n     traditional way of life.\n       In the middle of my deliberations, John Sears, a Notre Dame \n     grad, a lawyer, and the former campaign manager for Ronald \n     Reagan, gave me contrary advice. He told me that I could join \n     a law firm at any time. But the Nation in 1981 was about to \n     begin a historic debate about civil rights, social justice, \n     and the role of the Federal Government. He told me that if I \n     had an opportunity to have a leadership position, I should \n     seize the moment. He told me how important it was to be on \n     ``the front lines of history.'' Only then could you make a \n     dramatic difference for your family, your community, and your \n     country.\n       And that is the opportunity and the challenge that we all \n     face at this moment.\n       The great Irish poet Seamus Heaney has written:\n\n     History says, Don't hope\n     On this side of the grave.\n     But then, once in a lifetime\n     The longed-for tidal wave\n     Of justice can rise up,\n     And hope and history rhyme.\n\n       We all have a chance, working together, to make hope and \n     history rhyme.\n       Regardless of where you stand on the health care issues \n     before us, I urge you to get involved. This is a time for all \n     of us--of whatever vocation--to come together. We must all be \n     willing to sacrifice for an accomplishment that would address \n     a great moral failing, that would strengthen our Nation's \n     economy as well as its social fabric, that could point the \n     way toward dealing constructively with other systemic \n     challenges ahead.\n       I hope you will support the principles of the National \n     Coalition on Health Care. But the most important thing, in \n     the words of Oliver Wendell Holmes, is to ``share the passion \n     and action'' of one's time.\n       Please do not sit on the sidelines. Immerse yourself, \n     passionately, in this historic moment.\n\n[[Page S5126]]\n\n       Please know how much it has meant to me to be here.

Mr. President, I ask that my letter to Senator \nMcConnell, dated May 4, 2009, with its attachment, be printed in the \nRecord.\n  The material follows.\n         U.S. Senate, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources,\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2009.\n     Senator Mitch McConnell,\n     Republican Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell, Under the provisions of the Honest \n     Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007 (section 512 of \n     P.L. 110-81), attached please find a notice of my intent to \n     object to proceedings on the nomination of David Hayes, \n     Calendar number 31, reported by the Committee on Energy and \n     Natural Resources on March 18, 2009. The reasons for my \n     objection are included in the notice.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Lisa A. Murkowski,\n                                        Ranking Republican Member.\n\n                       Notice of Intent To Object\n\n       Under the provisions of the Honest Leadership and Open \n     Government Act of 2007 (section 512 of P.L. 110-81), I, \n     Senator Lisa A. Murkowski, intend to object to proceedings on \n     the nomination of David Hayes, Calendar number 31, reported \n     by the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources on March 18, \n     2009, for the following reasons:\n       During conversations with the nominees at meetings and \n     hearings, they have generally expressed very reasonable \n     views, including an affirmation of the need for continued \n     energy production in the United States.\n       However, actions speak louder than words, and I am \n     disappointed and troubled by the lack of connection between \n     the rhetoric from the Administration and its nominees, and \n     the reality of the Administration's actions. Rarely a week \n     goes by that the Department of the Interior doesn't issue a \n     pronouncement, that, taken together, add up to a wholesale \n     assault on domestic natural resource development. A few \n     examples are: Cancellation of the Utah leases; 180-day delay \n     of the 5-year plan; delay of the new round of oil shale \n     research, demonstration, and development leases; listing of \n     the yellow billed loon; Monday's determination that the \n     mountaintop coal mining rule is ``legally defective,'' and, \n     most recently, the potential application of Endangered \n     Species Act consultation requirements to all activities that \n     may increase carbon output.\n       Further, I have not been satisfied with the responses to \n     questions we have submitted on these matters to nominees that \n     have previously come before this Committee.\n       Therefore, I will add my name to the list of those who \n     intend to object to the confirmation of Deputy Secretary-\n     nominee David Hayes, until we can get some assurance that we \n     will see the actions of the Department of the Interior \n     comport with the transparency and process and policy that \n     they have promised.\n       I will soon be sending a letter to the Department of the \n     Interior with detailed questions regarding my concerns.\n       These are questions of huge significance to not only \n     American energy security, but to our ability to maintain our \n     Nation's entire infrastructure, and grow our economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/05/senate-section/article/S5126-2", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5126]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ADDITIONAL STATEMENTS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n                 TRIBUTE TO COMMANDANT CHARLES BALDWIN\n\n Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, this spring, the fourth class will \ngraduate from the Delaware Military Academy, and I would like to take \nthis opportunity to recognize Commandant Charles W. Baldwin for his \nyears of dedicated service to the school.\n  The Delaware Military Academy, DMA, is a unique public charter school \naffiliated with the Red Clay School District. Cofounded in 2003 by \nCommandant Baldwin and opened that year with only grades 9 and 10, the \nDMA has quickly found success.\n  Today, in addition to being a Middle States fully accredited school, \nthe academy has grown to enroll 525 students in grades 9 though 12 and \nhas a waiting list of more than 200 applicants. Since 2006, DMA has \nearned a superior rating every year from the Delaware Department of \nEducation. In 2008, the school was named a Superstars in Education \nAward Winner by the Delaware Chamber of Commerce.\n  Designated by the United States Navy as a Distinguished Unit with \nAcademic Honors, the academy has the unique privilege and \nresponsibility of naming nine nominations among the Naval Academy, Air \nForce Academy and West Point Military Academy.\n  The unique school offers students a tuition-free, 4-year high school \nprogram. The entire school is incorporated within the Navy Junior \nReserve Officer Training Corps, and as the first school of this nature, \nhas become the model high school for this Navy Training Corps.\n  The Delaware Military Academy's college preparatory academic \ncurriculum is supplemented with courses that include naval operations, \nnavigation, leadership, seamanship and oceanography. With its cadet \nhierarchy, students are placed in leadership positions and given \nresponsibilities rarely found in a civilian high school. As a result, \nthey emerge from the academy better prepared to meet the demanding \nchallenges of the adult world.\n  In just 6 short years, the academy, under the leadership of \nCommandant Baldwin, has done what takes some schools more than 20 years \nto accomplish. It has built and maintained a successful system that \ninstills values and responsibility into our children while providing \nthem an excellent education. Moreover, the commitment of DMA and its \nstudent body to community service is widely known and appreciated in \nthe State of Delaware.\n  While success in such a short period is certainly a credit to the \nfaculty and students of the academy, Commandant Baldwin has indeed \nplayed a critical leading role.\n  A 24-year Navy veteran himself, Commandant Baldwin has dedicated his \nlife to training, teaching and recruiting, including a tour of duty as \nprincipal of the George V. Kirk Middle School in Delaware's Christiana \nSchool District. Before cofounding the Delaware Military Academy, \nCommandant Baldwin established NJROTC programs in Delaware's Seaford \nand Christiana School Districts. During this time, he has received both \nmilitary and civilian awards for excellence, including the Meritorious \nService Medal, the Military Order of the Purple Heart, Christiana \nTeacher of the Year and the Christiana School District Citizenship \nAward. In addition, he twice received Presidential awards for \nmanagement excellence.\n  On a personal note, I have known and admired Commandant Baldwin for \nmore than a decade. My sincere hope is that as he steps down from his \nleadership role at the Delaware Military Academy, he will consider \nleading an effort to establish other public charter schools in the \nstate that are based on the DMA's unique model.\n  I want to personally thank Commandant Baldwin for his commitment to \nDelaware, to the education of its young people, and to preparing them \nfor lives of service. I warmly wish him the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/05/senate-section/article/S5126-3", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S5126-S5127]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   DRAFT LIST OF SITES, LOCATIONS, FACILITIES, AND ACTIVITIES IN THE \nUNITED STATES FOR DECLARATION TO THE INTERNATIONAL ATOMIC ENERGY AGENCY \n(IAEA), UNDER (THE ``U.S.-IAEA ADDITIONAL PROTOCOL''), AND CONSTITUTES \nA REPORT THEREON, AS REQUIRED BY SECTION 271 OF PUBLIC LAW 109-401--PM \n                                   15\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport; which was referred to the Committee on Foreign Relations:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I transmit herewith a list of the sites, locations, facilities, and \nactivities in the United States that I intend to declare to the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), under the Protocol \nAdditional to the Agreement between the United States of America and \nthe International Atomic Energy Agency for the Application of \nSafeguards in the United States of America, with Annexes, signed at \nVienna on June 12, 1998 (the ``U.S.-IAEA Additional Protocol''), and \nconstitutes a report thereon, as required by section 271 of Public Law \n109-401.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to ensure \nfairness in the coverage of women in the individual health insurance \nmarket; to the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KERRY. Mr. President, there continues to be discrimination \nagainst women in the individual insurance market. As you know, the \nindividual insurance market is often the last resort for health \ncoverage for individuals who do not have access to an employer-\nsponsored plan or who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid.\n  To assist these women, I am today introducing the Women's Health \nInsurance Fairness Act of 2009, a bill that would end the \ndiscrimination against women who seek to purchase an insurance policy \non the individual market.\n  According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, of the 94.7 million women \nbetween the ages of 18 and 64 in 2007, 64 percent had insurance through \nan employer, 18 percent were uninsured, 13 percent were enrolled in \nMedicaid or another type of public insurance, and 6 percent were in the \nindividual market. In other words, about 5.7 million American women in \n2007 received health insurance on the individual market. With rising \nunemployment, it is likely that more women will rely on individual \ninsurance market for coverage in the future.\n  This market is too often a problem for women for a number of reasons. \nFirst, women are often charged more than men for insurance in the \nindividual market. Gender rating is a common insurance practice under \nwhich most women are charged higher premiums than men for identical \ncoverage. Federal civil rights law prevents employers with more than 15 \nemployees from charging different premiums based on gender and other \nfactors. This protection is not extended to policies sold in the \nindividual insurance market.\n  According to a recent report entitled ``Nowhere to Turn: How the \nIndividual Health Insurance Market Fails Women'' by the National \nWomen's Law Center, a 25 year old woman can pay up to 45 percent more \nthan a 25 year old man for the same coverage. A 40 year old woman can \npay up to 48 percent more than a 40 year old man for the same coverage. \nA 55 year old woman can pay up to 37 percent more than a 55 year old \nman for the same coverage.\n  Today, only 10 states prohibit and 2 States limit gender rating in \nthe individual market. I am pleased that Massachusetts is one of the 10 \nStates that prohibit insurers from charging different premiums based on \ngender. But, we should-make sure that this prohibition is extended to \nevery state in the nation.\n  A second problem facing women on the individual market is that \ninsurers may delay, deny, or limit coverage to women due to pregnancy \nor delivery method. Over 30 years ago with the passage of the Pregnancy \nDiscrimination Act of 1978, Federal civil rights law established as sex \ndiscrimination denial of coverage for pregnancy, childbirth and related \nconditions in employer-based insurance policies. Unfortunately, this \nprotection is not extended to policies sold in the individual insurance \nmarket.\n  Individual market insurers can deny coverage to women based on a \n``pre-existing condition''. If the insurer discovers that a woman \napplying for coverage had a Cesarean section in the past, they can: \ncharge a higher premium; impose a waiting period during which it \nrefuses to cover another C-section or pregnancy; or deny coverage \nunless the woman has been sterilized or is no longer of childbearing \nage.\n  Currently, there are only 5 States which prohibit insurance carriers \nfrom refusing to sell individual health insurance coverage to \napplicants who have health conditions or problems. Massachusetts is one \nof the five states which require insurers to accept applicants \nregardless of health status. Again, this prohibition should be extended \nto every state in the nation.\n  A third problem facing women is that the vast majority of policies do \nnot provide coverage for maternity care. The 1978 Pregnancy \nDiscrimination Act specified that employers with more than 15 employees \nmust cover pregnancy on the same basis as other medical conditions. \nOnce again, similar protections do not exist in the individual \ninsurance market.\n  The National Women's Law Center recently analyzed over 3,500 \nindividual insurance market policies and found that just 12 percent \nincluded comprehensive maternity coverage and another 9 percent \nprovided coverage for maternity care that is not comprehensive. They \nalso found that a limited number of insurers sell separate maternity \ncoverage for an additional fee known as a ``rider'', but this \nsupplemental coverage is often expensive and limited in scope.\n  Currently, 5 States, including Massachusetts, have enacted laws \nrequiring insurers to include coverage for maternity services in all \nindividual health insurance policies sold in their state. Every woman \nshould have access to these services.\n  That is why I am introducing the Women's Health Insurance Fairness \nAct of 2009, to end the discrimination against women who seek to \npurchase an insurance policy on the individual market. It has three \nbasic parts.\n  First, the bill prevents insurers in the individual market from \ncharging women higher premiums than men. Gender rating is insurance \ndiscrimination based on sex and should not be tolerated. Over 40 years \nago, the insurance industry voluntarily abandoned its practice of using \nrace as a rating factor and now it is time to end rating discrimination \nagainst women. Gender rating hurts women's health by inflating premiums \nand creating substantial financial barriers for women seeking to obtain \nhealth care coverage.\n  Second, the bill prevents insurers in the individual market from \ndenying or limiting coverage based on a current or past pregnancy or a \npast or future method of delivery. No longer will insurance companies \nbe able to deny coverage to women simply by treating a pregnancy like a \npre-existing condition. Similarly, they will not be able to impose \nwaiting periods relating to a pregnancy. They will no longer be able to \nimpose higher premiums or deductibles on women with prior Cesareans.\n  Finally, the bill will require all insurance policies offered on the \nindividual market to provide comprehensive maternity coverage for the \nfull scope of maternity services from preconception through postpartum. \nThere is a huge cost to our society by denying maternity coverage. In \n2005, the costs associated with preterm birth, one of the most \nexpensive pregnancy complications linked to lack of prenatal care, \ntotaled over $26.2 billion. Yet, for every $1 spent on preconception \ncare saved anywhere from $1.60 to $5.19 in maternal care costs.\n  If women do not have the necessary maternity coverage, they will be \nexposed to substantial out of pocket\n\n[[Page S5131]]\n\ncosts. Too many women are unable to pay these costs. The average U.S. \nhospital cost for an uncomplicated vaginal delivery ranges from $7,500 \nto $15,000 and from $11,000 to $19,000 for a caesarean delivery. I \nbelieve comprehensive maternity coverage will save money and improve \nmaternal and child health outcomes. Those currently without coverage \noften turn to our public safety net for assistance. Today, forty \npercent of all pregnancies are covered by Medicaid. We need to do \neverything possible to increase health outcomes for our children.\n  The bill would provide the Secretary of Health and Human Services \nwith the authority to monitor compliance with the requirements of this \nact. It gives the Secretary the ability to assess fines of at least \n$10,000 against any health insurance company that fails to submit the \nrequired data. Additionally, the bill directs the Government \nAccountability Office to issue a report by December 31, 2010 about \nproblems any remaining for women on the individual insurance market in \nall 50 States.\n  I would like to thank a number of organizations who have already \nendorsed the legislation including the American College of \nObstetricians and Gynecologists, Children's Defense Fund, Consumers \nUnion, Families USA, the National Partnership for Women & Families, and \nOWL--The Voice of Midlife and Older Women.\n  During the Senate's consideration of comprehensive health care \nreform, I will work with Senate Finance Committee Chairman Baucus, \nRanking Member Grassley to make sure that discriminatory insurance \npractices against women are ended. I will also work with my \nMassachusetts colleague, Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor \nand Pensions Chairman Ted Kennedy to make sure this legislation is \nenacted into law. As in other areas of health reform, Massachusetts is \nalready leading the way in preventing insurers from engaging in \npractices that harm women. I believe the rest of the country should \nbenefit from our experience.\n  I find it especially appropriate to introduce this legislation as we \napproach Mother's Day on Sunday, May 10th and National Women's Health \nWeek on May 10th-16th. I can think of no better gift to our mothers, \ndaughters, and sisters than the gift of affordable and accessible \ninsurance that meets their health needs.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. GRASSLEY (for himself and Mrs. Hagan):\n  S. 972. A bill to amend the Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of \n2008 to provide funding for successful claimants following a \ndetermination on the merits of Pigford claims related to racial \ndiscrimination by the Department of Agriculture, to the Committee on \nAgriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I want to first start off by thanking \nthe Senate and in particular the Senate Agriculture Committee for \naddressing a new cause of action in Federal court for those African-\nAmerican farmers who may have been discriminated against and who were \ndenied entry in the Pigford v. Glickman Consent Decree. The Food, \nConservation, and Energy Act of 2008 including a provision entitled \nDetermination on Merits of Pigford Claims.\n  For those who do not know, the Consent Decree was a settlement that \nresulted from a class action lawsuit initiated by a class of African-\nAmerican farmers who had for decades been discriminated against by the \nU.S. Department of Agriculture in the administration of its FSA loan \nprogram. The discriminatory treatment was well-documented by both the \nUSDA's own Inspector General and an internal task force appointed by \nthen USDA Secretary Glickman.\n  We had some unanticipated consequences in the Consent Decree's \nimplementation. There was denial of approximately 77,000 African-\nAmerican farmers into the Decree even though these farmers filed \npetitions by the late-claim deadline. More than half of these late-\nclaim petitioners didn't even know about the Consent Decree. The Court \nsaid the lack of notice was not a sufficient reason to allow them into \nthe Consent Decree. Thus, these individuals were denied entry and their \ndiscrimination complaints went unresolved. This was not a fair outcome \nfor farmers or those attempting to farm at that time.\n  The farm bill did the right thing by allowing late filers to have \ntheir claims heard and judged on the merits. These farmers deserve \njustice and at least the opportunity to have their claims heard.\n  Unfortunately, it has been very difficult to determine how many of \nthe 77,000 actually have valid claims. Lots of different folks have \nlots of different calculations. Either way, it's likely to be \nexpensive. Because of the budget constraints, the Farm Bill only could \nput $100 million towards the endeavor.\n  I think we can and must do better than that. That is why today I am \nintroducing bipartisan legislation with Senator Hagan of North \nCarolina. This bill will make 3 changes to the farm bill. First it will \nallow the claimants to access the $100 million already appropriated in \nthe farm bill, but once that is expended gain access to the Department \nof Treasury permanent appropriated judgment fund. Second, it will allow \nreasonable attorney fees, administrative costs, and expenses to be paid \nfrom the judgment fund in accordance with the 1999 consent decree. \nFinally, it includes a section making fraud related to claims a \ncriminal offense with punishment of a fine or up to 5 years in prison \nor both.\n  The claimants, who were able to timely file, were allowed access to \nthe judgment fund and so it makes sense that we treat these new \nclaimants the exact same way. The Department of Justice was treating \nthe $100 million included in the farm bill as a cap, but Congress \nsimply viewed it as a down payment to rectify the damage done.\n  The farm bill we passed last year does one thing right. It focuses a \nconsiderable amount of resources on new and beginning farmers and \nranchers. Well, many of the Pigford claimants were in that same boat 20 \nyears ago. It is time to rectify that.\n  The farm bill has simply opened up the door so that claims can be \nheard. If a person brings a claim and can not meet the burden of proof, \nthen no award will be given. However, we know USDA has admitted that \nthe discrimination occurred, and now we are obligated to do our best in \ngetting those that deserve it, some relief. That is why I am \nintroducing this legislation with Senator Hagan and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the bill. It is time to make these claimants \nright and move forward into a new era of civil rights at the Department \nof Agriculture.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 972\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to provide that certain provisions of subchapter I of \nchapter 35 of title 44, United States Code, relating to Federal \ninformation policy shall not apply to the collection of information \nduring any investigation, audit, inspection, evaluation, or other \nreview conducted by any Federal office of Inspector General, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, the Federal Inspectors General are the \nfrontline of protection for taxpayer dollars, ensuring that Federal \nagencies spend taxpayer dollars in an effective, efficient, economical \nmanner that is in accordance with all applicable law. The Inspectors \nGeneral root out fraud, waste, and abuse in Government programs by \nauditing, evaluating, and investigating how Federal agencies spend \ntaxpayer dollars and how Government programs utilize funds. The \nInspectors General occupy a unique position within our government. \nCreated by the Inspector General Act of 1978 and by various subsequent \nstatutes, the Inspectors General at Executive Branch agencies also \nreport directly to the Legislative Branch. They were created to keep \ntabs on the government bureaucracy to make sure that agencies follow \nthe spirit and intent of the laws while protecting taxpayer dollars.\n  I have been an outspoken advocate for Inspectors General during my \ntime in the Senate and I was proud to be a cosponsor of the Inspector \nGeneral Reform Act of 2008, which was signed into law by President Bush \nlast year. That legislation ensures that Inspectors General are truly \nindependent of the Federal agencies they oversee. The independence of \nInspectors General is a critical requirement to their ability to get \nthe job done. If Inspectors General lack independence from the agency \nthey oversee, the quality of their work is impacted negatively and \ntheir reputation as independent watchdogs is tarnished.\n  Over the years, I have seen a number of Inspectors General come and \ngo. It is a tough job to be an Inspector General. You can not go along \nto get along. You must buck the system, dig deep into the books of the \nagency, find where the secrets are hidden, and then report the truth to \nCongress, the President, and the American people. Unfortunately, \nInspectors General must do all this with the agencies that often fight \ntheir every move. These entrenched bureaucracies have an interest in \nnot seeing Inspectors General succeed--they do not want egg on their \nface. That is why we in Congress must make sure they have all the tools \nthey need to get the job done and ensure that there is accountability \nfor the billions in taxpayer dollars that are spent annually on the \noperation of the Executive Branch.\n  One growing area of concern I have seen over the years is procedural \nroadblocks being placed before Inspectors General to limit or prohibit \ntheir ability to do their job of protecting taxpayer dollars. One \nrecent example relates to the Special Inspector General for the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program SIGTARP, Neil Barofsky. Inspector General \nBarofsky notified me on January 22, 2009, that he intended to begin an \noversight initiative that would have improved the transparency of the \nTroubled Asset Relief Program, TARP. Inspector General Barofsky's plan \nwas to collect data from TARP recipients asking them for a response \noutlining the use of TARP funds, copies of support documents, a \ndescription of plans to comply with executive compensation \nrestrictions, and certification by a senior executive officer of the \naccuracy of the statements they make. This sounded like a legitimate \nplan from the Inspector General tasked by Congress with ensuring that \nthe $700 billion handed out by the TARP program wasn't lost to fraud or \nabuse. However, it was shortly after this letter that Mr. Barofsky ran \ninto procedural hurdles erected by the Office of Management and Budget, \nOMB.\n  On January 30, 2009, I asked the Inspector General for an update on \nhis initiative when he informed me that OMB had advised the SIGTARP \nthat he could not initiate his effort due to the restrictions in the \nPaperwork Reduction Act of 1980, PRA. As a result, SIGTARP requested \n``emergency processing'' by OMB to consider the impact of its letter to \nTARP recipients. It is my understanding that OMB initially responded \nfavorably finding that SIGTARP would not be limited by the PRA. \nHowever, OMB reversed course and withdrew the emergency approval right \nafter it was granted.\n  OMB then informed SIGTARP that the PRA required he post his proposed \nletter online for TARP recipients to review for 15 days, wait for \ncomments from the recipients, and then require that the SIGTARP justify \nto OMB that it has taken into account all the public comments. This was \na significant, unnecessary roadblock that was erected at a time when \nAmerican Taxpayers were asking everyone ``where did the money go.'' \nThis type of procedural hurdle to an audit and investigation by the \nSIGTARP is unacceptable. Can you imagine what the very corporations \nthat took taxpayer money would write during the comment period? It is \nmy view that corporations that took Government money should be \nsubjected to oversight by Inspectors General and they should not have a \nsay in drafting or amending a letter from the Inspector General that \nthey must respond to. This is exactly what OMB was asking of the \nSIGTARP.\n  I am glad to report that later that same week SIGTARP Barofsky was \ngiven approval from OMB to send the letter requests to the TARP \nrecipients without delay. However, around the same time that the \nletters were approved and sent, the Department of Treasury posted a \ncomment request in the Federal Register about the SIGTARP request. \nThose responses were due to Treasury by April 13, 2009. While SIGTARP \nBarofsky was ultimately able to send his request, this uncertainty \nabout the application of the PRA to audits, evaluations, inspections, \nor investigations by Inspectors General remains a significant question. \nThis whole saga was a wakeup call for many Inspectors General. As a \nresult, many Inspectors General have reached out to my office about \nthis issue and the dangers the PRA could pose to their audits and \ninvestigations.\n  That is why I am here today to introduce legislation that will \nclarify the impact the PRA has on official audits, evaluations, \ninspections, and investigations conducted by Inspectors General. This \nlegislation is narrowly tailored to ensure that Inspectors General are \nnot subject to bureaucratic hurdles erected by OMB, which could be used \nto limit the independence and authority of Inspectors General, and most \nimportantly information that we can garner through their work.\n  Specifically, the PRA currently states that agencies must receive \napproval for each collection request before it is implemented. Failure \nto get this approval provides the recipient of the request the \nprotection to not comply with the request without penalty. The current \nPRA does not apply to criminal investigations, administrative actions, \nor investigations involving an agency against a specific individual or \nentities. However, it does apply to ``general'' investigations. The PRA \nis also silent as to whether it was intended to apply to Inspectors \nGeneral and defines agency as any ``executive department, military \ndepartment, Government corporation, Government controlled corporation, \nor other establishment in the executive branch of the Government \nincluding the Executive Office of the President, or any independent \nregulatory agency. The PRA does expressly exclude the Government \nAccountability Office and the Federal\n\n[[Page S5133]]\n\nElection Commission, but not the Inspectors General.\n\n  The PRA was passed with the noble goal of reducing the impact Federal \nGovernment regulatory agencies have on small businesses and other \nprivate individuals. However, over the years the investigative and \naudit roles of the Inspectors General have expanded to ensure that \ntaxpayer dollars are not lost to fraud, waste, or abuse. As a result, \nthe important work of the Inspectors General may run directly into the \nPRA resulting in a slower process for audits, evaluations, and \ninvestigations, as well as potentially tipping off those being \ninvestigated by the Inspectors General and providing them time to, for \nexample cover-up potential wrong doing.\n  The legislation I'm introducing today is designed to protect the PRA \nas well as the Inspectors General by trying to head off a potential \nconflict among the two statutes before it has to be decided by the \ncourts. It simply states that the PRA shall not apply to the collection \nof information ``during the conduct of any investigation, audit, \ninspection, evaluation, or other review conducted by'' any Federal \noffice of Inspector General. It further defines the definition of \nInspector General to include: statutory Inspectors General, Federal \nentity Inspectors General, and any Special Inspector General. This \ndefinition also includes the Council of the Inspectors General on \nIntegrity and Efficiency, CIGIE, created by the Inspector General \nReform Act, and the Recovery, Accountability, and Transparency Board \ncreated by the stimulus bill signed into law earlier this year. These \ntwo entities have some audit and evaluation roles provided to them and \nshould also not face procedural hurdles under the PRA when they are \noverseeing the various Inspectors General or Recovery programs.\n  All in all, this is a simple piece of legislation that I encourage \nall my colleagues to support. It picks up on the great work of the \nInspector General Reform Act to ensure that Inspectors General are \nindependent and free from any undue influence--procedural or \nsubstantive--when conducting audits, evaluations, inspections, or \naudits on behalf of the American people. I hope this legislation will \nreceive expedited consideration and swift passage.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 976\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Public Health Service Act to establish a \nnationwide health insurance purchasing pool for small businesses and \nthe self-employed that would offer a choice of private health plans and \nmake health coverage more affordable, predictable, and accessible; to \nthe Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce legislation with \nSenators Snowe and Lincoln to make healthcare more affordable and \naccessible for our nation's small businesses and self-employed \nindividuals. This bipartisan legislation is known as the Small Business \nHealth Options Program Act, or the SHOP Act, and I am working with the \nFinance and HELP Committees to incorporate it into the broader \nhealthcare reform bill the Senate is developing.\n  Health reform is a priority of the American people and a central \nelement of this Congress's agenda. While more must be done, we have \ntaken some small but important steps already.\n  We expanded the CHIP program to provide healthcare to an additional 4 \nmillion children who are uninsured today.\n  We provided assistance to laid-off workers to help them pay for \nhealth insurance under the COBRA continuation program, so that families \nreceiving an average monthly unemployment check of $1,300 aren't \nexpected to pay $1,100 in insurance premiums.\n  We included in the Recovery Act $87 billion for the Medicaid program \nover the next 2 years.\n  We provided $2 billion for community health centers, which serve more \nthan 18 million patients.\n  But we have more to do. Overall, 46 million Americans are uninsured. \nAt the beginning of this decade, fewer than 40 million people were \nuninsured. Over the same period, health insurance premiums have risen 4 \ntimes faster than wages.\n  This is the year to enact reforms to reduce healthcare costs, expand \ncoverage, and improve the quality of the healthcare we receive.\n  It is not easy for small businesses and the self-employed to afford \nhealth insurance. Without the benefits of large group purchasing, \ndouble-digit rate increases are not uncommon.\n  The recession has made it worse. The Main Street Alliance recently \npolled nearly 500 small businesses in a dozen states and found that 35 \npercent have reduced coverage and 12 percent have dropped it altogether \nin the past 2 years.\n  More than 50 percent of the uninsured in America are in households \nled by someone who is either self-employed or works for a business with \nfewer than 100 employees.\n  Workers in the smallest businesses are almost three times likely to \nbe uninsured as those who work for the largest businesses. That is not \nbecause small businesses don't want to offer health insurance; it is \nbecause insurance is more expensive for them than for large companies.\n  Administrative costs for health insurance are higher for small \nbusinesses than larger businesses. About 20-25 percent of a small \nbusiness's premium goes to administrative expenses, compared to about \n10 percent for large employers.\n  Small businesses are less able than large employers to spread the \nrisk that someone will get sick. Even a single employee with a serious \nmedical condition can cause a dramatic increase in a small business's \nhealth insurance premium.\n  Small businesses are also more likely to have lower wages and \nnarrower profit margins than large businesses, making it more difficult \nfor these employers and employees to cover the cost of health coverage.\n  Small business owners like Doug Mayol of Springfield, IL, and David \nBorris, of Northbrook, IL, know all too well the difficulty of \nmaintaining health insurance in this struggling economy.\n  Since 1988, Doug Mayol has owned and operated a small business in \ndowntown Springfield that sells cards, gifts, and other knick-knacks. \nHe has found that his profits are at the mercy of the rising costs of \nhealthcare. He is fortunate that his only employee is over 65 and \nqualifies for Medicare and also receives spousal benefits from her late \nhusband. If this were not the case, Doug does not think he would be \nable to provide her with coverage.\n  In terms of his own insurance, Doug has a preexisting condition and \nfears the real possibility of becoming uninsured. Almost 30 years ago, \nDoug was diagnosed with a congenital heart valve defect. He has no \nsymptoms, but without regular healthcare he is at risk of developing \nserious problems.\n  Like most Americans, his healthcare premiums have risen over the \nyears, but recently the increases have been\n\n[[Page S5134]]\n\ndramatic. In 2001, he paid $200 a month. By 2005, he was paying $400 a \nmonth. The next year, after he turned 50, his rate shot up to $750 a \nmonth.\n  Trying to work within the system, he chose a smaller network of \nproviders and a higher deductible to bring his premium back down to \n$650. Unfortunately, last year it jumped to $1037 a month. Only by \ntaking the highest deductible allowed, $2500, was he able to bring it \ndown to $888. And these rates will continue to rise.\n  Ironically, Doug is not even a costly patient. With his high \ndeductible, his insurance rarely kicks in, as he has never made a claim \nfor illness or injury and has received only routine primary care. Yet \nmore affordable insurance carriers reject him due to his preexisting \ncondition.\n  Meanwhile, Doug avoids seeing a cardiologist, even though periodic \nvisits would be a good idea, because he fears it would add another red \nflag to his already imperfect health record.\n  What kind of healthcare system is it that causes even those with \ncoverage to avoid care? Americans need the peace-of-mind that comes \nwith knowing that health insurance companies will not be able to reject \nyou, or keep raising your rates, because you have a preexisting \ncondition.\n  David Borris faces another dilemma. David is the owner of Hel's \nKitchen Catering, an off-premise catering company located along \nsuburban Chicago's north shore in Northbrook, IL. Over 2 decades ago, \nDavid and his wife opened their business in a 900 square foot \nstorefront with a handful of recipes from his mother and his wife. Both \nDavid and his wife left good-paying jobs in the hospitality industry to \ntake their shot at the American dream of owning their own business.\n  David now employs 25 full-time employees and has offered health \ninsurance to them since 1992. At first, David offered to contribute 50 \npercent of the premium in an employee's first year and 100 percent \nthereafter. The company had 8 full-time employees and David felt a \nmoral obligation to offer insurance to the people who were helping to \ngrow his business.\n  Around 2002, the company started to see staggering premium increases. \nIn 2004, the premium jumped 21 percent. In 2005, it increased by 10 \npercent. In 2006, the increase was 16 percent. In 2007, he was quoted a \n26 percent rate hike, and only a change of carriers allowed him to hold \nthe increase to 17 percent. In total, his premiums have doubled since \n2002, forcing him to ask longtime employees to contribute toward the \ncost of the premiums.\n  Today, David insures only 13 of his 25 full-time employees--the other \n12 cannot afford their 50 percent share of the premium in the first \nyear, and the company cannot afford to pay more.\n  David spent almost 13 percent of his covered employees' payroll on \nhealth insurance premiums last year, and he expects he will have to ask \nemployees to contribute more again next year.\n  He knows that one employee's wife has a kidney problem and another \nemployee's son receives an expensive treatment for a health condition. \nTrying to maintain health coverage for his loyal workers has become a \nmajor complication as he tries to grow his business.\n  Both Doug and David are living the American dream as small business \nowners. Providing health insurance for their employees should not \ndestroy that dream.\n  As Congress works to reform the healthcare system, we need to keep in \nmind the struggle of small business owners like Doug and David. Small \nbusinesses are the backbone of the American economy. They need to be \nable to count on health insurance premiums that are reasonable and \npredictable. They need something better than our current system offers.\n  That is why I am reintroducing the SHOP Act with Senators Snowe and \nLincoln. Our legislation offers new hope for entrepreneurs who struggle \nto afford health insurance. It will make health insurance more \naccessible and more affordable for small businesses and the self-\nemployed.\n  Our bill has three core elements: purchasing pools for small \nbusinesses and the self-employed; health insurance rating reforms; and \ntax credits.\n  Our bill would create incentives for States to establish purchasing \npools and would create a national pool that we call SHOP, the Small \nBusiness Health Options Program, for small businesses with up to 100 \nemployees and for the self-employed.\n\n  Purchasing pools will lower administrative costs, give employers and \nemployees more private health insurance plans to choose from, and \nenhance competition by making it easier to compare plans.\n  Our bill would prohibit insurers from setting premiums based on \nhealth status in both the national SHOP pool and in States' small group \nmarkets, and would gradually reduce other sources of premium variation. \nThese rating changes will make premiums more stable from year to year \nand make coverage more affordable for those who need it most.\n  To lower the cost of providing health coverage, our bill would \nprovide a tax credit to small businesses with up to 50 workers who pay \nat least 60 percent of their employees' premiums.\n  The size of the tax credit would be targeted to the size of the \nbusiness. A full tax credit of $1,000 for self-only coverage and $2,000 \nfor family coverage would be available to the smallest businesses, with \nthe value of the tax credit phased down as the size of the employer \nincreases.\n  Employers who cover more than 60 percent of the premium would be \nrewarded with a bonus credit.\n  In addition, we would move to a system where individual employees can \nchoose their own health plan instead of having their employer choose it \nfor them. Where rating rules permit it, each worker would be able to \nenroll in the health plan in SHOP that best meets his or her needs.\n  The bill we have introduced reflects our commitment to find \nreasonable compromises and address the challenges faced by small \nemployers and the self-employed. This bipartisan legislation has the \nsupport of a range of business, labor, and consumer groups.\n  We have worked closely with the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, the National Association of Realtors, and SEIU in the \ndevelopment of the bill, and we also have the support of Families USA, \nthe National Restaurant Association, and the Partnership for Women and \nFamilies.\n  We have received valuable input from the National Association of \nInsurance Commissioners and have taken the hard steps they have \nrecommended to address rating issues and ensure that the approach is \nviable over the long haul.\n  Although each group that supports SHOP has its own priorities for \nbroader health reform, this diverse coalition of stakeholders from \nacross the political spectrum came together to address the needs of \nsmall businesses as one important component of reform.\n  Everyone understands that this bill is not comprehensive health \nreform, and none of us would stop with SHOP. However, the renewed focus \non broader reform has given us an opportunity to offer SHOP as a \ncarefully-crafted component of broader reform that addresses the \nspecific needs of the small business community. We believe our approach \nis consistent with the broader conversation and can help the greater \nreform effort move forward on a bipartisan basis, and we look forward \nto including the features of SHOP in the broader bill.\n  In a town hall meeting in March this year, the President spoke to a \ncrowd about the new mindset of this Administration. He talked about \n``understanding that we're all in this together and that if the middle \nclass is working well, if working people are doing well, then everybody \ndoes well.''\n  This bill is consistent with that thinking. Its seemingly disparate \nsupporters may disagree on many things, but they have worked together \nto develop this legislation because they agree on a greater principle: \nthat our current system is hurting everyone--families, businesses, and \nour economy.\n  We must keep working together on a bipartisan basis to try to enact \nlegislation that will give all Americans access to affordable health \ninsurance, and solving the healthcare challenges faced by small \nbusinesses is an important part of that process.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to enact such \nlegislation and ensure that the healthcare needs of small businesses \nand all Americans are met.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n\n[[Page S5135]]\n\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 979\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Inflammatory Bowel Disease \n     Research and Awareness Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis are serious \n     inflammatory diseases of the gastrointestinal tract.\n       (2) Crohn's disease may occur in any section of the \n     gastrointestinal tract but is predominately found in the \n     lower part of the small intestine and the large intestine. \n     Ulcerative colitis is characterized by inflammation and \n     ulceration of the innermost lining of the colon. Complete \n     removal of the colon in patients with ulcerative colitis can \n     potentially alleviate and cure symptoms.\n       (3) Because Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis behave \n     similarly, they are collectively known as inflammatory bowel \n     disease. Both diseases present a variety of symptoms, \n     including severe diarrhea, abdominal pain with cramps, fever, \n     arthritic joint pain, inflammation of the eye, and rectal \n     bleeding. There is no known cause of inflammatory bowel \n     disease, or medical cure.\n       (4) It is estimated that up to 1,400,000 people in the \n     United States suffer from inflammatory bowel disease, 30 \n     percent of whom are diagnosed during their childhood years.\n       (5) Children with inflammatory bowel disease miss school \n     activities because of bloody diarrhea and abdominal pain, and \n     many adults who had onset of inflammatory bowel disease as \n     children had delayed puberty and impaired growth and have \n     never reached their full genetic growth potential.\n       (6) Inflammatory bowel disease patients are at high risk \n     for developing colorectal cancer.\n       (7) The total annual medical costs for inflammatory bowel \n     disease patients are estimated at more than $2,000,000,000.\n       (8) The average time from presentation of symptoms to \n     diagnosis in children is 3 years.\n       (9) Delayed diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease \n     frequently results in more-active disease associated with \n     increased morbidity and complications.\n       (10) Congress has appropriated $3,480,000 from fiscal year \n     2005 to fiscal year 2009 for epidemiology research on \n     inflammatory bowel disease through the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention.\n       (11) The National Institutes of Health National Commission \n     on Digestive Diseases issued comprehensive research goals \n     related to inflammatory bowel disease in its April 2009 \n     report to Congress and the American public entitled; \n     ``Opportunities and Challenges in Digestive Diseases \n     Research: Recommendations of the National Commission on \n     Digestive Diseases''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Labeling, recordkeeping, records inspection.\nSec. 302. Study and report.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The use of tobacco products by the Nation's children is \n     a pediatric disease of considerable proportions that results \n     in new generations of tobacco-dependent children and adults.\n       (2) A consensus exists within the scientific and medical \n     communities that tobacco products are inherently dangerous \n     and cause cancer, heart disease, and other serious adverse \n     health effects.\n       (3) Nicotine is an addictive drug.\n       (4) Virtually all new users of tobacco products are under \n     the minimum legal age to purchase such products.\n       (5) Tobacco advertising and marketing contribute \n     significantly to the use of nicotine-containing tobacco \n     products by adolescents.\n       (6) Because past efforts to restrict advertising and \n     marketing of tobacco products have failed adequately to curb \n     tobacco use by adolescents, comprehensive restrictions on the \n     sale, promotion, and distribution of such products are \n     needed.\n       (7) Federal and State governments have lacked the legal and \n     regulatory authority and resources they need to address \n     comprehensively the public health and societal problems \n     caused by the use of tobacco products.\n       (8) Federal and State public health officials, the public \n     health community, and the public at large recognize that the \n     tobacco industry should be subject to ongoing oversight.\n       (9) Under article I, section 8 of the Constitution, the \n     Congress is vested with the responsibility for regulating \n     interstate commerce and commerce with Indian tribes.\n       (10) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of tobacco products are activities in and substantially \n     affecting interstate commerce because they are sold, \n     marketed, advertised, and distributed in interstate commerce \n     on a nationwide basis, and have a substantial effect on the \n     Nation's economy.\n       (11) The sale, distribution, marketing, advertising, and \n     use of such products substantially affect interstate commerce \n     through the health care and other costs attributable to the \n     use of tobacco products.\n       (12) It is in the public interest for Congress to enact \n     legislation that provides the Food and Drug Administration \n     with the authority to regulate tobacco products and the \n     advertising and promotion of such products. The benefits to \n     the American people from enacting such legislation would be \n     significant in human and economic terms.\n       (13) Tobacco use is the foremost preventable cause of \n     premature death in America. It causes over 400,000 deaths in \n     the United States each year, and approximately 8,600,000 \n     Americans have chronic illnesses related to smoking.\n       (14) Reducing the use of tobacco by minors by 50 percent \n     would prevent well over 10,000,000 of today's children from \n     becoming regular, daily smokers, saving over 3,000,000 of \n     them from premature death due to tobacco-induced disease. \n     Such a reduction in youth smoking would also result in \n     approximately $75,000,000,000 in savings attributable to \n     reduced health care costs.\n       (15) Advertising, marketing, and promotion of tobacco \n     products have been especially directed to attract young \n     persons to use tobacco products, and these efforts have \n     resulted in increased use of such products by\n\n[[Page S5144]]\n\n     youth. Past efforts to oversee these activities have not been \n     successful in adequately preventing such increased use.\n       (16) In 2005, the cigarette manufacturers spent more than \n     $13,000,000,000 to attract new users, retain current users, \n     increase current consumption, and generate favorable long-\n     term attitudes toward smoking and tobacco use.\n       (17) Tobacco product advertising often misleadingly \n     portrays the use of tobacco as socially acceptable and \n     healthful to minors.\n       (18) Tobacco product advertising is regularly seen by \n     persons under the age of 18, and persons under the age of 18 \n     are regularly exposed to tobacco product promotional efforts.\n       (19) Through advertisements during and sponsorship of \n     sporting events, tobacco has become strongly associated with \n     sports and has become portrayed as an integral part of sports \n     and the healthy lifestyle associated with rigorous sporting \n     activity.\n       (20) Children are exposed to substantial and unavoidable \n     tobacco advertising that leads to favorable beliefs about \n     tobacco use, plays a role in leading young people to \n     overestimate the prevalence of tobacco use, and increases the \n     number of young people who begin to use tobacco.\n       (21) The use of tobacco products in motion pictures and \n     other mass media glamorizes its use for young people and \n     encourages them to use tobacco products.\n       (22) Tobacco advertising expands the size of the tobacco \n     market by increasing consumption of tobacco products \n     including tobacco use by young people.\n       (23) Children are more influenced by tobacco marketing than \n     adults: more than 80 percent of youth smoke three heavily \n     marketed brands, while only 54 percent of adults, 26 and \n     older, smoke these same brands.\n       (24) Tobacco company documents indicate that young people \n     are an important and often crucial segment of the tobacco \n     market. Children, who tend to be more price sensitive than \n     adults, are influenced by advertising and promotion practices \n     that result in drastically reduced cigarette prices.\n       (25) Comprehensive advertising restrictions will have a \n     positive effect on the smoking rates of young people.\n       (26) Restrictions on advertising are necessary to prevent \n     unrestricted tobacco advertising from undermining legislation \n     prohibiting access to young people and providing for \n     education about tobacco use.\n       (27) International experience shows that advertising \n     regulations that are stringent and comprehensive have a \n     greater impact on overall tobacco use and young people's use \n     than weaker or less comprehensive ones.\n       (28) Text only requirements, although not as stringent as a \n     ban, will help reduce underage use of tobacco products while \n     preserving the informational function of advertising.\n       (29) It is in the public interest for Congress to adopt \n     legislation to address the public health crisis created by \n     actions of the tobacco industry.\n       (30) The final regulations promulgated by the Secretary of \n     Health and Human Services in the August 28, 1996, issue of \n     the Federal Register (61 Fed. Reg. 44615-44618) for inclusion \n     as part 897 of title 21, Code of Federal Regulations, are \n     consistent with the first amendment to the United States \n     Constitution and with the standards set forth in the \n     amendments made by this subtitle for the regulation of \n     tobacco products by the Food and Drug Administration, and the \n     restriction on the sale and distribution of, including access \n     to and the advertising and promotion of, tobacco products \n     contained in such regulations are substantially related to \n     accomplishing the public health goals of this Act.\n       (31) The regulations described in paragraph (30) will \n     directly and materially advance the Federal Government's \n     substantial interest in reducing the number of children and \n     adolescents who use cigarettes and smokeless tobacco and in \n     preventing the life-threatening health consequences \n     associated with tobacco use. An overwhelming majority of \n     Americans who use tobacco products begin using such products \n     while they are minors and become addicted to the nicotine in \n     those products before reaching the age of 18. Tobacco \n     advertising and promotion play a crucial role in the decision \n     of these minors to begin using tobacco products. Less \n     restrictive and less comprehensive approaches have not and \n     will not be effective in reducing the problems addressed by \n     such regulations. The reasonable restrictions on the \n     advertising and promotion of tobacco products contained in \n     such regulations will lead to a significant decrease in the \n     number of minors using and becoming addicted to those \n     products.\n       (32) The regulations described in paragraph (30) impose no \n     more extensive restrictions on communication by tobacco \n     manufacturers and sellers than are necessary to reduce the \n     number of children and adolescents who use cigarettes and \n     smokeless tobacco and to prevent the life-threatening health \n     consequences associated with tobacco use. Such regulations \n     are narrowly tailored to restrict those advertising and \n     promotional practices which are most likely to be seen or \n     heard by youth and most likely to entice them into tobacco \n     use, while affording tobacco manufacturers and sellers ample \n     opportunity to convey information about their products to \n     adult consumers.\n       (33) Tobacco dependence is a chronic disease, one that \n     typically requires repeated interventions to achieve long-\n     term or permanent abstinence.\n       (34) Because the only known safe alternative to smoking is \n     cessation, interventions should target all smokers to help \n     them quit completely.\n       (35) Tobacco products have been used to facilitate and \n     finance criminal activities both domestically and \n     internationally. Illicit trade of tobacco products has been \n     linked to organized crime and terrorist groups.\n       (36) It is essential that the Food and Drug Administration \n     review products sold or distributed for use to reduce risks \n     or exposures associated with tobacco products and that it be \n     empowered to review any advertising and labeling for such \n     products. It is also essential that manufacturers, prior to \n     marketing such products, be required to demonstrate that such \n     products will meet a series of rigorous criteria, and will \n     benefit the health of the population as a whole, taking into \n     account both users of tobacco products and persons who do not \n     currently use tobacco products.\n       (37) Unless tobacco products that purport to reduce the \n     risks to the public of tobacco use actually reduce such \n     risks, those products can cause substantial harm to the \n     public health to the extent that the individuals, who would \n     otherwise not consume tobacco products or would consume such \n     products less, use tobacco products purporting to reduce \n     risk. Those who use products sold or distributed as modified \n     risk products that do not in fact reduce risk, rather than \n     quitting or reducing their use of tobacco products, have a \n     substantially increased likelihood of suffering disability \n     and premature death. The costs to society of the widespread \n     use of products sold or distributed as modified risk products \n     that do not in fact reduce risk or that increase risk include \n     thousands of unnecessary deaths and injuries and huge costs \n     to our health care system.\n       (38) As the National Cancer Institute has found, many \n     smokers mistakenly believe that ``low tar'' and ``light'' \n     cigarettes cause fewer health problems than other cigarettes. \n     As the National Cancer Institute has also found, mistaken \n     beliefs about the health consequences of smoking ``low tar'' \n     and ``light'' cigarettes can reduce the motivation to quit \n     smoking entirely and thereby lead to disease and death.\n       (39) Recent studies have demonstrated that there has been \n     no reduction in risk on a population-wide basis from ``low \n     tar'' and ``light'' cigarettes, and such products may \n     actually increase the risk of tobacco use.\n       (40) The dangers of products sold or distributed as \n     modified risk tobacco products that do not in fact reduce \n     risk are so high that there is a compelling governmental \n     interest in ensuring that statements about modified risk \n     tobacco products are complete, accurate, and relate to the \n     overall disease risk of the product.\n       (41) As the Federal Trade Commission has found, consumers \n     have misinterpreted advertisements in which one product is \n     claimed to be less harmful than a comparable product, even in \n     the presence of disclosures and advisories intended to \n     provide clarification.\n       (42) Permitting manufacturers to make unsubstantiated \n     statements concerning modified risk tobacco products, whether \n     express or implied, even if accompanied by disclaimers would \n     be detrimental to the public health.\n       (43) The only way to effectively protect the public health \n     from the dangers of unsubstantiated modified risk tobacco \n     products is to empower the Food and Drug Administration to \n     require that products that tobacco manufacturers sold or \n     distributed for risk reduction be reviewed in advance of \n     marketing, and to require that the evidence relied on to \n     support claims be fully verified.\n       (44) The Food and Drug Administration is a regulatory \n     agency with the scientific expertise to identify harmful \n     substances in products to which consumers are exposed, to \n     design standards to limit exposure to those substances, to \n     evaluate scientific studies supporting claims about the \n     safety of products, and to evaluate the impact of labels, \n     labeling, and advertising on consumer behavior in order to \n     reduce the risk of harm and promote understanding of the \n     impact of the product on health. In connection with its \n     mandate to promote health and reduce the risk of harm, the \n     Food and Drug Administration routinely makes decisions about \n     whether and how products may be marketed in the United \n     States.\n       (45) The Federal Trade Commission was created to protect \n     consumers from unfair or deceptive acts or practices, and to \n     regulate unfair methods of competition. Its focus is on those \n     marketplace practices that deceive or mislead consumers, and \n     those that give some competitors an unfair advantage. Its \n     mission is to regulate activities in the marketplace. Neither \n     the Federal Trade Commission nor any other Federal agency \n     except the Food and Drug Administration possesses the \n     scientific expertise needed to implement effectively all \n     provisions of the Family Smoking Prevention and Tobacco \n     Control Act.\n       (46) If manufacturers state or imply in communications \n     directed to consumers through the media or through a label, \n     labeling, or advertising, that a tobacco product is approved \n     or inspected by the Food and Drug Administration or complies \n     with Food and Drug Administration standards, consumers are \n     likely to be confused and misled. Depending upon the \n     particular language used and its context, such a statement \n     could result in consumers being misled into believing that \n     the product is endorsed by the Food and Drug Administration \n     for use or in consumers being misled about the harmfulness of \n     the\n\n[[Page S5145]]\n\n     product because of such regulation, inspection, approval, or \n     compliance.\n       (47) In August 2006 a United States district court judge \n     found that the major United States cigarette companies \n     continue to target and market to youth. USA v. Philip Morris, \n     USA, Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 99-2496 (GK), August 17, \n     2006).\n       (48) In August 2006 a United States district court judge \n     found that the major United States cigarette companies \n     dramatically increased their advertising and promotional \n     spending in ways that encourage youth to start smoking \n     subsequent to the signing of the Master Settlement Agreement \n     in 1998. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, Inc., et al. (Civil \n     Action No. 99-2496 (GK), August 17, 2006).\n       (49) In August 2006 a United States district court judge \n     found that the major United States cigarette companies have \n     designed their cigarettes to precisely control nicotine \n     delivery levels and provide doses of nicotine sufficient to \n     create and sustain addiction while also concealing much of \n     their nicotine-related research. USA v. Philip Morris, USA, \n     Inc., et al. (Civil Action No. 99-2496 (GK), August 17, \n     2006).\n\n     SEC. 3. PURPOSE.\n\n       The purposes of this Act are--\n       (1) to provide authority to the Food and Drug \n     Administration to regulate tobacco products under the Federal \n     Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.), by \n     recognizing it as the primary Federal regulatory authority \n     with respect to the manufacture, marketing, and distribution \n     of tobacco products as provided for in this Act;\n       (2) to ensure that the Food and Drug Administration has the \n     authority to address issues of particular concern to public \n     health officials, especially the use of tobacco by young \n     people and dependence on tobacco;\n       (3) to authorize the Food and Drug Administration to set \n     national standards controlling the manufacture of tobacco \n     products and the identity, public disclosure, and amount of \n     ingredients used in such products;\n       (4) to provide new and flexible enforcement authority to \n     ensure that there is effective oversight of the tobacco \n     industry's efforts to develop, introduce, and promote less \n     harmful tobacco products;\n       (5) to vest the Food and Drug Administration with the \n     authority to regulate the levels of tar, nicotine, and other \n     harmful components of tobacco products;\n       (6) in order to ensure that consumers are better informed, \n     to require tobacco product manufacturers to disclose research \n     which has not previously been made available, as well as \n     research generated in the future, relating to the health and \n     dependency effects or safety of tobacco products;\n       (7) to continue to permit the sale of tobacco products to \n     adults in conjunction with measures to ensure that they are \n     not sold or accessible to underage purchasers;\n       (8) to impose appropriate regulatory controls on the \n     tobacco industry;\n       (9) to promote cessation to reduce disease risk and the \n     social costs associated with tobacco-related diseases; and\n       (10) to strengthen legislation against illicit trade in \n     tobacco products.\n\n     SEC. 4.

SEVERABILITY.\n\n       If any provision of this Act, of the amendments made by \n     this Act, or of the regulations promulgated under this Act \n     (or under such amendments), or the application of any such \n     provision to any person or circumstance is held to be \n     invalid, the remainder of this Act, such amendments and such \n     regulations, and the application of such provisions to any \n     other person or circumstance shall not be affected and shall \n     continue to be enforced to the fullest extent possible.\n\n         TITLE I--AUTHORITY OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION\n\n     SEC. 101. AMENDMENT OF FEDERAL FOOD, DRUG, AND COSMETIC ACT.\n\n       (a) Definition of Tobacco Products.--Section 201 of the \n     Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 321) is \n     amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(rr)(1) The term `tobacco product' means any product made \n     or derived from tobacco that is intended for human \n     consumption, including any component, part, or accessory of a \n     tobacco product (except for raw materials other than tobacco \n     used in manufacturing a component, part, or accessory of a \n     tobacco product).\n       ``(2) The term `tobacco product' does not mean an article \n     that is a drug under subsection (g)(1), a device under \n     subsection (h), or a combination product described in section \n     503(g).\n       ``(3) The products described in paragraph (2) shall be \n     subject to chapter V of this Act.\n       ``(4) A tobacco product shall not be marketed in \n     combination with any other article or product regulated under \n     this Act (including a drug, biologic, food, cosmetic, medical \n     device, or a dietary supplement).''.\n       (b) FDA Authority Over Tobacco Products.--The Federal Food, \n     Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. 301 et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating chapter IX as chapter X;\n       (2) by redesignating sections 901 through 910 as sections \n     1001 through 1010; and\n       (3) by inserting after chapter VIII the following:\n\n                     ``CHAPTER IX--TOBACCO PRODUCTS\n\n     ``SEC. 900.

Res. 128\n\n       Whereas May 5, or ``Cinco de Mayo'' in Spanish, is \n     celebrated each year as a date of great importance by the \n     Mexican and Mexican-American communities;\n       Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday commemorates May 5, 1862, \n     the date on which the Battle of Puebla was fought by Mexicans \n     who were struggling for their independence and freedom;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo has become one of Mexico's most \n     famous national holidays and is celebrated annually by nearly \n     all Mexicans and Mexican-Americans, north and south of the \n     United States-Mexico border;\n       Whereas the Battle of Puebla was but one of the many \n     battles that the courageous Mexican people won in their long \n     and brave struggle for independence and freedom;\n       Whereas the French, confident that their battle-seasoned \n     troops were far superior to\n\n[[Page S5164]]\n\n     the almost amateurish Mexican forces, expected little or no \n     opposition from the Mexican army;\n       Whereas the French army, which had not experienced defeat \n     against any of Europe's finest troops in over half a century, \n     sustained a disastrous loss at the hands of an outnumbered, \n     ill-equipped, and ragged, but highly spirited and courageous, \n     Mexican force;\n       Whereas after three bloody assaults upon Puebla in which \n     over a thousand gallant Frenchmen lost their lives, the \n     French troops were finally defeated and driven back by the \n     outnumbered Mexican troops;\n       Whereas the courageous and heroic spirit that Mexican \n     General Zaragoza and his men displayed during this historic \n     battle can never be forgotten;\n       Whereas many brave Mexicans willingly gave their lives for \n     the causes of justice and freedom in the Battle of Puebla on \n     Cinco de Mayo;\n       Whereas the sacrifice of the Mexican fighters was \n     instrumental in keeping Mexico from falling under European \n     domination;\n       Whereas the Cinco de Mayo holiday is not only the \n     commemoration of the rout of the French troops at the town of \n     Puebla in Mexico, but is also a celebration of the virtues of \n     individual courage and patriotism of all Mexicans and \n     Mexican-Americans who have fought for freedom and \n     independence against foreign aggressors;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo serves as a reminder that the \n     foundation of the United States is built by people from many \n     nations and diverse cultures who are willing to fight and die \n     for freedom;\n       Whereas Cinco de Mayo also serves as a reminder of the \n     close spiritual and economic ties between the people of \n     Mexico and the people of the United States, and is especially \n     important for the people of the southwestern States where \n     millions of Mexicans and Mexican-Americans make their homes;\n       Whereas in a larger sense, Cinco de Mayo symbolizes the \n     right of a free people to self-determination, just as Benito \n     Juarez once said, ``El respeto al derecho ajeno es la paz'' \n     (``The respect of other people's rights is peace''); and\n       Whereas many people celebrate during the entire week in \n     which Cinco de Mayo falls: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate--\n       (1) recognizes the historical struggle for independence and \n     freedom of the people of Mexico; and\n       (2) calls upon the people of the United States to observe \n     Cinco de Mayo with appropriate ceremonies and activities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "05"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/05/05/senate-section/article/S5164-1", "month": "05", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S5164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSENATE RESOLUTION 129--COMMENDING LOUISIANA JOCKEY CALVIN BOREL FOR HIS \n                  VICTORY IN THE 135TH KENTUCKY DERBY\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. McConnell) submitted \nthe following resolution; which was considered and agreed to:\n\n                              S.
