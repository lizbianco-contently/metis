Mr. President, yesterday we had votes on a handful of \namendments which were aimed at reducing the overall size of the Omnibus \nappropriations bill. Many of us who are concerned about the spending \nbinge we have been on thought it would be responsible to bring it back \nin line with the appropriations bills we passed last year. That was \nobviously before the economic crisis.\n  As the junior Senator from Indiana put it this morning in an \ninsightful op-ed piece in the Wall Street Journal, this bill was \ndrafted last year.\n\n       Since then, economic and fiscal circumstances have changed \n     dramatically, which is why--\n\n  As he put it--\n\n     the Senate should go back to the drawing board. The economic \n     downturn requires new policies, not more of the same.\n\n  That is Senator Evan Bayh of Indiana.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have the article, in which Senator Bayh \ncalls on his colleagues to vote against the omnibus or for the \nPresident to veto it, printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n              [From the Wall Street Journal, Mar. 3, 2009]\n\n                    Deficits and Fiscal Credibility\n\n\n      A Democratic senator says no to a huge federal spending bill\n\n                             (By Evan Bayh)\n\n       This week, the United States Senate will vote on a spending \n     package to fund the federal government for the remainder of \n     this\n\n[[Page S2724]]\n\n     fiscal year. The Omnibus Appropriations Act of 2009 is a \n     sprawling, $410 billion compilation of nine spending measures \n     that lacks the slightest hint of austerity from the federal \n     government or the recipients of its largess.\n       The Senate should reject this bill. If we do not, President \n     Barack Obama should veto it.\n       The omnibus increases discretionary spending by 8% over \n     last fiscal year's levels, dwarfing the rate of inflation \n     across a broad swath of issues including agriculture, \n     financial services, foreign relations, energy and water \n     programs, and legislative branch operations. Such increases \n     might be appropriate for a nation flush with cash or \n     unconcerned with fiscal prudence, but America is neither.\n       Drafted last year, the bill did not pass due to Congress's \n     long-standing budgetary dysfunction and the frustrating \n     delays it yields in our appropriations work. Since then, \n     economic and fiscal circumstances have changed dramatically, \n     which is why the Senate should go back to the drawing board. \n     The economic downturn requires new policies, not more of the \n     same.\n       Our nation's current fiscal imbalance is unprecedented, \n     unsustainable and, if unaddressed, a major threat to our \n     currency and our economic vitality. The national debt now \n     exceeds $10 trillion. This is almost double what it was just \n     eight years ago, and the debt is growing at a rate of about \n     $1 million a minute.\n       Washington borrows from foreign creditors to fund its \n     profligacy. The amount of U.S. debt held by countries such as \n     China and Japan is at a historic high, with foreign investors \n     holding half of America's publicly held debt. This dependence \n     raises the specter that other nations will be able to \n     influence our policies in ways antithetical to American \n     interests. The more of our debt that foreign governments \n     control, the more leverage they have on issues like trade, \n     currency and national security. Massive debts owed to foreign \n     creditors weaken our global influence, and threaten high \n     inflation and steep tax increases for our children and \n     grandchildren.\n       The solution going forward is to stop wasteful spending \n     before it starts. Families and businesses are tightening \n     their belts to make ends meet--and Washington should too.\n       The omnibus debate is not merely a battle over last year's \n     unfinished business, but the first indication of how we will \n     shape our fiscal future. Spending should be held in check \n     before taxes are raised, even on the wealthy. Most people are \n     willing to do their duty by paying taxes, but they want to \n     know that their money is going toward important priorities \n     and won't be wasted.\n       Last week I was pleased to attend the president's White \n     House Fiscal Responsibility Summit. It's about time we had a \n     leader committed to addressing the deficit, and Mr. Obama \n     deserves great credit for doing so. But what ultimately \n     matters are not meetings or words, but actions. Those who \n     vote for the omnibus this week--after standing with the \n     president and pledging to slice our deficit in half last \n     week--jeopardize their credibility.\n       As Indiana's governor, I balanced eight budgets, never \n     raised taxes, and left the largest surplus in state history. \n     It wasn't always easy. Cuts had to be made and some \n     initiatives deferred. Occasionally I had to say ``no.''\n       But the bloated omnibus requires sacrifice from no one, \n     least of all the government. It only exacerbates the problem \n     and hastens the day of reckoning. Voters rightly demanded \n     change in November's election, but this approach to spending \n     represents business as usual in Washington, not the voters' \n     mandate.\n       Now is the time to win back the confidence and trust of the \n     American people. Congress should vote ``no'' on this omnibus \n     and show working families across the country that we are as \n     committed to living within our means as they are.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Today, Republicans are going to continue bringing up \nour amendments, amendments that we think are better and more \nresponsible ways to use the taxpayers' money today.\n  Unfortunately, it has become increasingly clear that most of our \nDemocrat colleagues here in Congress--Senator Bayh notwithstanding--are \nperfectly comfortable with the breathtaking rate of spending we have \nbeen on since the beginning of the year. They want it to continue, \nwithout restraint and without any end in sight.\n  Amazingly, in the midst of an economic crisis, congressional \nDemocrats want to increase the annual spending included in this omnibus \nby 8 percent, which, compared to last year, is twice the rate of \ninflation.\n  At a time when Americans are learning to cut back, Democrats in \nCongress are suggesting we double up. As Senator Bayh put it in the \nsame op-ed:\n\n       The bloated omnibus requires sacrifice from no one, least \n     of all the government. It only exacerbates the problem and \n     hastens the day of reckoning. Voters rightly demanded change \n     in November's election, but this approach to spending \n     represents business as usual in Washington, not the voters' \n     mandate.\n\n  Nobody wants an open-ended recession. But so far the only solution to \nthe economic crisis that Democrats in Congress are offering is open-\nended spending without any end in sight. And let's be clear about \nsomething: we cannot end a recession by digging the country into deeper \nand deeper debt any more than one can pay off a credit card by using it \nmore often. And we can't tax our way out of a recession.\n  February was an expensive month for American taxpayers. In the month \nof February, Congress spent more money than we did in 7 years on the \nwar in Iraq, the war in Afghanistan and Hurricane Katrina relief \ncombined.\n  All of this spending is reason to carefully consider and pare back \nthis massive spending bill, particularly in these areas which contain \nfunding for 122 programs already funded in the stimulus bill.\n  Remarkably, even Senator Hutchison's amendment, which sought to find \n$12 billion, or just 1 percent, in duplicative spending from two bills \ntotaling $1.2 trillion, was struck down.\n  I hope our friends across the aisle will join Republican efforts to \nensure every taxpayer dollar is spent with care, and support amendments \nto protect taxpayer dollars.\n  This current spending bill is only one step in the spending process. \nIt doesn't include the President's budget, the housing proposal, or \nuntold trillions to stabilize financial markets and other programs\n  Our children and grandchildren can't afford this level of spending. \nThey will be the ones left to pay off the Federal Government credit \ncard that Democrats in Congress are busy maxing out.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/04/senate-section/article/S2724-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2724-S2725]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                       sergeant daniel w. wallace\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise because our country has lost a \ntrue patriot. SGT Daniel W. Wallace of Dry Ridge, KY, was tragically \nkilled by enemy fire while serving his country in Afghanistan on \nOctober 31, 2008. He was 27 years old.\n  A member of the Kentucky Army National Guard since 2006, Sergeant \nWallace was on his first deployment. For his valor in uniform, he \nreceived several medals, awards and decorations, including the Bronze \nStar Medal and the Purple Heart.\n  ``Sergeant Daniel Wallace was a true patriot,'' says Kentucky \nNational Guard Adjutant GEN Edward W. Tonini. He ``stood up and \nanswered the call to serve his Nation in a time of need.''\n  Sergeant's Wallace's mother, Karen Wallace, says the same thing, but \nin a way only a mother could.\n  ``Danny's my fallen hero,'' she says.\n  Daniel's family lived in the town of Latonia in the northern Kentucky \nsuburbs of Cincinnati, when he was young. When he was about 9 years \nold, they moved to Dry Ridge in Grant County. They moved because Karen \nand Daniel's father, Kenneth, wanted to trade in life in the city for \nthe country. But Daniel didn't take it so well.\n  ``He didn't like the move . . . because of his friends being in \nLatonia,'' Karen remembers. ``He was always bored in the country, \ncomplaining about how there was nothing to do.''\n  It would come as no surprise, however, if I told you that Daniel, \nlike any young boy, found plenty of things to do. He liked to fish, \ncamp and watch and play sports like baseball, basketball and football. \nAnd with three brothers and a sister, there were plenty of people to do \nthings with.\n  ``He loved camping,'' says Karen. ``We'd get so tickled because he \nand [his brother] Alex would bet on who could make the first fire, [or] \nthe biggest fire.''\n  Karen did set some limits for her son, however.\n  ``He always wanted to go hunting but we never did that,'' she says. \nAnd ``he got mad at me for not letting him play football because he was \nso skinny.''\n  Daniel started attending Crittenden-Mt. Zion Elementary School, and \nwhen he was in third grade, Karen started working there. ``I was able \nto watch him as he was adjusting to a new school,'' she recalls. ``The \nteachers liked him. . . . He was very computer knowledgeable [and] . . \n. the teachers would have him fix computers.''\n  Daniel's father, Kenneth, recalls how his son was quick to look out \nfor others.\n  ``He always felt he had to protect the other kids,'' Kenneth says. \n``He wanted\n\n[[Page S2725]]\n\nto know who did it if something happened.'' Karen recalls a few times \nwhen Daniel came to the defense of his brother Alex when he was teased \nby other boys.\n  Like the rest of his family, Daniel was also very committed to his \nchurch. One way they all contributed together was as a gospel band, the \nWallace Family Band. Mom and dad sang. Their sons Charles and Brian \nplayed the guitar, Alex played the drums, and Daniel played bass \nguitar. The whole family got into the act.\n  After high school, Daniel went on to National College in Florence, \nwhere he took business classes. He was studying to be an accountant. \n``Danny liked numbers and he enjoyed math,'' says Karen.\n  In high school and college he had a couple of jobs, working at a car \ndealership and as an apprentice with a steel manufacturer. But just as \nhis family raised him to serve others through his work at church, \nDaniel felt moved to serve his country through military service.\n  ``He liked the Army one hundred percent,'' his mother Karen says. \n``You couldn't have budged him out of that. . . . I've never seen him \nhappier in all my life than after he joined the National Guard.''\n  In the Guard, Daniel trained to be a combat engineer. His dad recalls \nthat after his training, he was named the 218th Regiment Honor \nGraduate. Part of his training included learning how to deactivate \nexplosive devices--his mother Karen recalls that ``on his evaluation, \nit said Danny likes to blow up things.''\n  Daniel also inspired his brother Alex to join the National Guard, and \nAlex became a medic.\n  ``I'm proud of my brother,'' Alex says. ``I'm going to keep carrying \non. I know he wants me to serve my full time, which is what I'm going \nto do.''\n  Daniel joined the 201st Engineer Battalion of the Kentucky Army \nNational Guard, based out of Cynthiana, and was deployed to \nAfghanistan. He wrote his mother letters telling of his experiences, \nespecially of his work to renovate the chapel for the soldiers on base.\n  ``Danny made a library [in the chapel],'' Karen recalls. ``We'd send \nhim books for the library and Danny read all of them. They were redoing \nthe chapel outside and inside . . . he was always working in the \nchapel.''\n  Daniel's family shipped him his bass guitar, and he formed a band \nwith his fellow soldiers in Afghanistan. Karen recalls how, before his \nposting in Afghanistan, Daniel had played with the Wallace Family Band \none last time.\n  ``Danny came in for 15 days of R, [and] we got one booking in the \nchurch,'' she says. ``Everybody was there . . . daughter-in-law, the \nboys, everybody. God has blessed us with our family. I've always told \npeople that.''\n  The members of Daniel's loving family are in our prayers today as I \nshare with my colleagues just some of Daniel's story. We are thinking \nof his son, Cody George Mardis; his daughter, Abigail Rose Wallace; his \nparents, Kenneth and Karen; his brother Charles, Charles's wife Robin \nand their children; his brother Brian, Brian's wife Jennifer and their \nchildren; his brother Alex; his sister Kim; his grandfather, Arvis \nSinclair; and many other beloved friends and family members.\n  Daniel once asked his mother to write more letters--not to him, but \nto other soldiers who didn't have moms like her writing to their sons \nand daughters in a war zone. After Daniel's death, Karen heard from her \nson's fellow soldiers about how Daniel carried himself, even in the \nface of great danger.\n  ``The letters I've received from the guys shows me Danny was true to \nGod. He had a true mission over there,'' Karen says. He'd always say, \n`Mom, don't worry--God's watching over me.' ''\n  Nothing could ever take away the pain of this family's loss. But I \nhope Daniel's loved ones know there is one other thing they should \nnever worry about: that our Nation could ever forget Daniel's great \nsacrifice.\n  And this U.S. Senate will forever honor Sergeant Daniel W. Wallace \nfor his service to country.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Under the previous order, the \nSenator from Iowa is recognized.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/04/senate-section/article/S2725-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2725-S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PRIVATE DEBT COLLECTION AMENDMENT\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I rise for the purpose of discussing an \namendment that was filed yesterday that I hope I get an opportunity to \noffer. I am going to touch on these points, but I thought I would \nhighlight a couple points about this amendment.\n  First of all, there is bipartisan agreement in this body there is a \n$290 billion tax gap--``tax gap'' meaning taxes that are owed but not \ncollected. There is also an understanding that is not written that the \nIRS is not going to go after taxes unpaid, through their own employees, \nof under $25,000 a year. There is a feeling by some people in the IRS \nthere ought to be more employees hired to go after the tax gap, but \neven if those additional employees are hired, they still will not go \nafter those under $25,000.\n  Now, we have a program in place I wish to defend in my remarks. That \nprogram in place is the IRS contracting with private collection \nagencies to go after the money that is owed for those under $25,000; \nand to make the point, that program is working. But the bill before us, \nthe Omnibus appropriations bill, contains a provision that would \nessentially kill the IRS private debt collection program, which the \nSenate, working through the Senate Finance Committee I serve on, only \nauthorized a short period of 4 years ago. The IRS implemented that \nprogram only 2 years ago.\n  This program, which has never been fully operational in its brief 2-\nyear period, allows the Internal Revenue Service to use private \ncollection agencies to collect money owed to the Government. The \nprogram has many critics, and once again they are seeking to destroy \nthe program before we have a chance to gauge how effective the program \nis.\n  Before I discuss the merits of the program, I wish to note that an \nappropriations bill is not the proper vehicle to nullify tax policy. \nThe private debt collection program was created in a tax bill within \nthe jurisdiction of our Finance Committee, and further legislation \naffecting the program should be done through the committee where the \nexpertise is, the Finance Committee. Whether you would agree with the \nprogram, I think everyone could agree on the importance of the \ncommittee structure that we use in the Senate. In other words, a \ncommittee of jurisdiction where the expertise is ought to work to \nchange a program if it needs to be changed or if it needs to be done \naway with, as basically the appropriations bill would do. I would \nassume members of the Appropriations Committee would not want--would \nnot want--those of us on the Finance Committee making decisions against \nthe expertise of the Appropriations Committee.\n  The IRS private debt collection program facilitates the collection of \ntax debts the IRS would not otherwise pursue. These liabilities amount \nto billions of dollars a year.\n  A Government Accountability Office report issued in June of 2008 \nreported the unpaid tax debt as of fiscal year 2007 to be about $290 \nbillion, of which almost $185 billion was classified as nonpotentially \ncollectible inventory and $25.5 billion was deemed potentially \ncollectible but not in active collection status. The private debt \ncollection agencies are only permitted to pursue debts taxpayers have \nconceded they owe.\n  Opposition to this program is surprising, since the Internal Revenue \nService program is intended to run like similar programs at other \nagencies. In other words, the Department of Education uses private \ncollection agencies to pursue delinquent student loans. The Treasury \nDepartment, which houses the Internal Revenue Service, also houses the \nFinancial Management Service, and, ironically, the Treasury Department \nuses private debt collection agencies to collect small business loans.\n  So if it is OK for one branch of the Treasury Department to do that, \nwhy isn't it OK for the Internal Revenue Service to go after taxes owed \nbut not paid? The only reason I can think of that private debt \ncollection is so controversial at the Internal Revenue Service is \nsimply the opposition to the program from the National Treasury\n\n[[Page S2726]]\n\nEmployees Union. The National Treasury Employees Union is comprised \nprimarily of Internal Revenue Service employees, and according to that \nunion's Web site, is the largest Federal sector union in the entire \ncountry.\n  The other Government agencies that use private debt collectors do not \nhave as powerful a union fighting for more Government jobs. Yet this \nprogram does not threaten the jobs of revenue agents already working at \nthe IRS. The tax debts the private collection agencies are targeting \nare debts the Internal Revenue Service is not even pursuing, and likely \nwould not pursue even if additional revenue agents were hired.\n  In May 2007, Acting Commissioner Kevin Brown--now this is a \nCommissioner of the Internal Revenue Service--when testifying before a \nsubcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee, confirmed that the \nInternal Revenue Service would not otherwise pursue these debts, even \nif the IRS were given additional resources. So the bottom line is this: \nThere are no IRS jobs on the line. Rather, the National Treasury \nEmployees Union believes the IRS should be hiring more union employees \nto do collections work.\n  In contrast, I believe if the IRS is going to hire more workers, it \nshould be agents to do more exams--work that private contractors cannot \ndo. Former IRS Commissioner Mark Everson stated in a letter to me on \nApril 11, 2007, that a full-time revenue agent auditing individual tax \nreturns historically brings in nearly $700,000 annually.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that Commissioner Everson's \nletter be printed in the Record, as well as a followup letter I wrote \nto Treasury Secretary Paulson on this issue.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                       Department of the Treasury,\n\n\n                                     Internal Revenue Service,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 11, 2007.\n     Hon. Charles E. Grassley,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Finance,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Grassley: This letter follows-up on a matter \n     that has been an ongoing concern to both the Internal Revenue \n     Service (IRS) and you for several years now, and that you \n     raised in a meeting with IRS senior executives on January 30, \n     2007. Specifically, you asked for information on the use of \n     official time by representatives of the National Treasury \n     Employees Union (NTEU).\n       Reducing the use of official time by NTEU representatives \n     has been a significant point of negotiations between the IRS \n     and NTEU for several years. Over time, the IRS has \n     established greater controls over time granted to union \n     officials to perform representational duties.\n       As illustrated by the enclosed chart, from 2002 through \n     2006, total annual NTEU time spent on union related \n     activities has decreased approximately 14 percent, from \n     729,988 hours to 630,539 hours. Per your request at the \n     January 30, 2007, meeting to quantify the data in terms of \n     full time equivalents (FTEs), this represents a reduction \n     from approximately 350 to 302 FTEs. To further quantify this \n     in terms of resource and revenue trade-offs, as you \n     requested, historically a full-time SB/SE revenue agent \n     auditing individual tax returns brings in nearly $700,000 \n     annually.\n       While progress has been made, the IRS recognizes that more \n     needs to be done. The recent IRS-NTEU mid-term negotiations \n     in 2006 produced a broad range of means for achieving \n     operational efficiencies. These include simple time-\n     efficiencies such as increasing the number of meetings \n     conducted by phone and requiring stewards within the \n     commuting area to attend in-person meetings. Other measures \n     include establishing an annual cap of 850 hours of \n     representational time for the vast majority of stewards, \n     reducing the grievance procedure for performance appraisals \n     and mass grievances from a multi-step to a one-step process, \n     and streamlining NTEU's participation on various committees.\n       Reducing the amount of official time continues to be a \n     priority and we will seek significant additional improvements \n     in our upcoming contract negotiations. Please contact me \n     should you require additional information or a member of your \n     staff may call Robert Buggs, Chief Human Capital Officer. at \n     202-622-7676,\n           Sincerely,\n     Mark W. Everson.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                      U.S. Senate,\n\n\n                                         Committee on Finance,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 2007.\n     Hon. Henry Paulson,\n     Secretary,\n     Department of Treasury,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Secretary: I am writing to you regarding an \n     ongoing concern that I have with respect to the amount of \n     official Internal Revenue Service (IRS) time used by \n     representatives of the National Treasury Employees Union \n     (NTEU). As you are aware, I have been a strong advocate of \n     using IRS resources in the most productive manner possible.\n       Based on information former Commissioner Everson provided \n     to me in a letter dated April 11, 2007, total NTEU time spent \n     on union related activities for 2006 equated to 302 full time \n     equivalents (FTEs). In terms of resource and revenue trade-\n     offs, the letter referenced a historical figure of a full-\n     time SR/SE revenue agent auditing individual tax returns \n     bringing in nearly $700,000 annually. Thus, according to IRS \n     figures, total NTEU time for 2006 represents approximately \n     $211,400,000 additional direct revenue that could have \n     potentially been brought into the United States Treasury. \n     This figure does not account for any increase in revenue that \n     would be gained indirectly through the increased audit \n     activity. At a time when this Committee is increasingly \n     looking at new methods of closing the tax gap, it is \n     imperative that we first ensure that the IRS is effectively \n     using its existing resources.\n       At the Senate Finance Committee's tax gap hearing on April \n     18, 2007, former Commissioner Everson stated that the IRS was \n     in the process of trying to renegotiate the NTEU agreement, \n     which would include a renegotiation of union activity time, \n     Former Commissioner Everson also stated that the amount of \n     time devoted to union activities is proportionately higher at \n     the IRS than it is in comparison to other departments and \n     agencies within the government. Without getting into whether \n     taxpayers should even be funding union activity, please \n     provide me with an analysis of IRS union activity time versus \n     union time for other governmental departments and agencies. \n     Please also quantify this analysis in terms of FTEs and the \n     number of agency or department employees who are represented \n     by the union. What is being done in the renegotiation process \n     to bring the IRS-NTEU agreement at least more in line with \n     practices elsewhere in the government?\n       Thank you for your time and attention to this matter. I \n     would appreciate your response by May 25, 2007.\n           Cordially yours,\n                                              Charles E. Grassley,\n                                                   Ranking Member.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. For me, this proves the IRS would be better off hiring \nmore examination agencies than debt collectors. In addition to the \nNational Treasury Employees Union's failure to discuss the success of \nprivate debt collection programs at other Federal agencies--I mentioned \nthem, Education and one other branch of the Treasury Department--the \nNational Treasury Employees Union also conveniently fails to mention \nthat the private collection agencies hired by the IRS have consistently \nscored customer satisfaction ratings above 95 percent, while the IRS \ncollection employees appear to be scoring at less than 65 percent.\n  The National Treasury Employees Union also fails to mention the \namount of employee time devoted to union activities is proportionately \nhigher at the Internal Revenue Service than it is in comparison to \nother Federal Departments and agencies. Commissioner Everson testified \nto this at the Senate Finance Committee tax gap hearing held on April \n18, 2007. Just think, then, of the additional revenue IRS could be \ncollecting if union employees were actually doing the job they were \npaid to do instead of spending taxpayers' dollars to lobby Congress to \ndo away with a program that is collecting money owed under $25,000 a \nyear that would not otherwise be collected. Of course, they do not like \nthat program.\n  Since the omnibus provision prohibiting the IRS from using 2009 \nappropriations to fund the program office may actually kill the \nprogram, I have this amendment before the Senate. I mean, at least it \nis filed. It is not before us yet. I would not support a government \nprogram that is unsuccessful, and this private debt collection program \nis no different. However, we do not have enough information to know \nwhether this program is effective, and, given the success of such \nprograms at other agencies, I believe it can be successful at the \nInternal Revenue Service. It surely is successful at the Education \nDepartment.\n  Last week, I, along with Senator Harkin, my colleague from Iowa, and \nMr. Schumer, the senior Senator from New York--the three of us--sent a \nletter to Treasury Secretary Geithner and IRS Commissioner Shulman \nasking for more information so we can actually make an informed \ndecision on the effectiveness of the private debt collection program.\n  The letter asks for, among other things, additional information to \nmeasure the cost-effectiveness of the program, information to gauge the \nresults of the collection agencies, and more information on the use of \ncollection\n\n[[Page S2727]]\n\nagencies by other Government agencies. So all my colleagues are able to \nread the letter, I ask unanimous consent that letter be printed in the \nRecord.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 2009.\n     Hon. Timothy F. Geithner,\n     Secretary of the Treasury,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Douglas H. Shulman,\n     Commissioner of Internal Revenue,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Geithner and Commissioner Shulman: We are \n     writing regarding the private debt collection program (PDC) \n     that is being implemented by the Internal Revenue Service \n     (IRS) and has been in place since 2006. We are aware that \n     many critics believe that the program does not operate \n     effectively, and they lead an annual effort to strip the IRS \n     of all authority to implement it. But we do not believe that \n     the necessary data has been collected and disseminated that \n     would allow an informed decision to be made about the \n     program's long-term effectiveness.\n       Make no mistake: If the program is genuinely unsuccessful, \n     we would be among the first to concur that it should be \n     terminated. However, we remain very concerned that IRS will \n     terminate the PDC program before a complete and thorough \n     accounting of the program is conducted. For example, while \n     some are critical of the effectiveness and efficiency of the \n     PDC program, we have yet to see solid, reliable numbers. \n     Criticism of the program's return on investment do not \n     account for its start-up or investment costs, and ignore the \n     fact that the program has not been fully operational for any \n     of its two years.\n       We appreciate that the IRS has decided to use an \n     independent third party to study the effectiveness of the \n     program, and its report may be issued as early as next week. \n     But it is not clear that the new study will discuss ways to \n     increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the PDC program \n     or explain why similar programs at other federal agencies \n     appear to be successful. For example, the Department of \n     Education uses PCAs to collect student loan debt, and the \n     Department of Treasury Financial Management Service uses them \n     to collect small business loans, farm loans, and other \n     similar debt owed to the federal government, and these \n     programs appear to work well with little controversy.\n       Given the amount of uncollected tax debt, a program that \n     was allowed to operate at full capacity would have the \n     potential to be successful, yet the current program has only \n     operated in fits and starts. In fact, during the past fifteen \n     years, the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the \n     Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration (TIGTA) \n     have issued numerous reports discussing the IRS's problems in \n     collecting delinquent debt. A list of these reports is \n     attached. Some of the key findings include:\n       In its May 1993 report, New Delinquent Tax Collection \n     Methods for IRS, the GAO highlighted the complexity of the \n     IRS's collection process. GAO presented a number of options \n     to improve the IRS's delinquent debt process, including \n     establishing early telephone contact with debtors and \n     utilizing private collection agencies. So there is a long \n     track record indicating that a well-run PDC program could \n     be successful.\n       In its June 2007 report, Tax Debt Collection: IRS Has a \n     Complex Process to Attempt to Collect Billions of Dollars in \n     Unpaid Taxes, the GAO description of the IRS's collection \n     process indicates that IRS has not experienced significant \n     improvement in its collection function since 1993. The report \n     also states that the total unpaid tax debt as of fiscal year \n     2007 was $290.1 billion, of which $184.8 billion was \n     classified as non-potentially collectible inventory and $25.5 \n     billion was deemed potentially collectible, but not in active \n     collection status. This would seem to be further \n     justification for a viable PDC program.\n       In its December 2008 report, Tax Administration: IRS's 2008 \n     Filing Season Generally Successful Despite Challenges, \n     Although IRS Could Expand Enforcement During Returns \n     Processing, the GAO notes that, because collections staff was \n     reassigned to answer telephone calls regarding stimulus \n     payments, the IRS reported $655 million in forgone revenue \n     through August 2008 alone, which means that the number for \n     the whole calendar year will likely be greater. If the IRS \n     viewed the PDC program as part of its larger collection \n     program, rather than a stand-alone program, PCAs may have \n     been able to complete the work of the collections staff that \n     had been temporarily reassigned.\n       It is important for critics of the program to recognize \n     that the IRS's PDC program is designed to go after tax debts \n     that have been conceded by taxpayers, but not paid. What's \n     more, even if the IRS enforcement budget were significantly \n     increased, the accounts turned over to PDC are those that \n     would still likely be ignored by IRS collection agents. In \n     his May 2007 testimony before the Committee on Ways and \n     Means, Subcommittee on Oversight, Acting Commissioner Kevin \n     Brown, confirmed that IRS would not otherwise pursue these \n     debts even if IRS were given additional resources.\n       We remain cautiously optimistic that a PDC program could be \n     successful in helping to close the tax gap, but only if it is \n     allowed to operate at full capacity. Only after that point \n     could a determination be made about whether the program is \n     meeting its objectives. We are hopeful that the report being \n     prepared will provide answers to the following questions. If \n     not, we hope that you will take the time to let us know the \n     following key information before the IRS makes any final \n     decision about the PDC program:\n       The primary argument for terminating the IRS PDC program is \n     that it is not cost effective. In order to better understand \n     the program's revenues and costs, we would like a monthly \n     accounting of all funds expended on the program since its \n     inception, including a breakdown of all costs for IRS \n     personnel involved in administering the program (salary \n     levels, positions descriptions, etc.), as well as costs \n     associated with technology and travel.\n       We would also like to know the number of cases placed with \n     the private agencies since the program began, including the \n     number of cases for which the amount was collected in full, \n     the number of resulting installment agreements, and the \n     number of cases recalled and reasons for recall. We would \n     also like an accounting of the commissions earned by the PCAs \n     since the program started.\n       Some taxpayers choose to ignore the IRS's many letters and \n     respond to the IRS only after it notifies them that their \n     cases will be referred to a PCA. In these cases, where the \n     IRS benefits from the use of the PCA's names, we would like \n     to know why the PCAs are not compensated when those taxpayers \n     settle those debts.\n       We would also like for you to describe how IRS's collection \n     process and procedure differs from the process and procedure \n     used by PCAs in collecting IRS debts, including the IRS's \n     ability to make outbound phone calls, negotiate or settle tax \n     debts, and impose liens and levies.\n       Another criticism of the program is that the IRS has run \n     out of cases that can be assigned to the current PCAs, which \n     is why other PCAs have not been added. However, the exclusion \n     list, which was not determined by statute but by the IRS, \n     appears fairly extensive. In addition, as noted above, the \n     GAO's June 2008 report indicates that, as of fiscal year \n     2007, there was at least $25.5 of potentially collectible \n     inventory that IRS was not actively pursuing. We would like \n     to know how each of the exclusion criteria was determined.\n       Tables 5, 6 and 7 of the GAO's June 2008 provide a \n     breakdown of the total delinquent debt for fiscal years 2002 \n     through 2007. Please update these tables to add numbers for \n     fiscal year 2008 and provide a breakdown of this amount by \n     the exclusion criteria. We would also like to know why all \n     potentially collectible inventory is not in active collection \n     status and cannot be assigned to PCAs.\n       We would also like to know whether Treasury or any other \n     agency has studied the cost effectiveness of the use of PCAs \n     by Treasury or other federal agencies. If such studies are \n     available, we would like to see them.\n       Finally, you may be aware that there are almost 200 jobs in \n     both Iowa and New York that will be lost if the IRS PDC \n     program is terminated prematurely. Given the current economic \n     crisis, such job losses should not be forced to occur before \n     a full accounting of the program's success is made available \n     and/or the program is allowed to operate as originally \n     intended. The recently enacted Economic Recovery Act, which \n     will further strain IRS resources, is an additional reason \n     why the PCAs should be allowed to operate until the success \n     or failure of the program can be definitively determined.\n       If you have any questions regarding the above, please do \n     not hesitate to contact our staff. We also ask that you brief \n     our staff on the forthcoming study before the study is \n     finalized and made public.\n           Sincerely,\n     Chuck Grassley,\n       U.S. Senator.\n     Charles E.

It boils down to the fact that we should have a chance \nto obtain and review this information before killing a program that is \ngoing after money owed--$25,000 or less--from people who have said they \nacknowledge they owe it, that IRS employees would not go after. This \naffects jobs in a couple States, and I wish to say that when we are \nhaving a program--as the stimulus bill did--to keep people from being \nlaid off and to have people being hired, you would at least think we \nwould not think about eliminating jobs in a couple States. I was a \nsupporter of this program before any contracts were awarded. As I said, \nI will not support the program if it does not prove effective.\n  Given the propensity to spend the Government seems to be afflicted \nwith, there is going to be a hunger for new sources of revenue which is \ngoing to be controversial. What should not be controversial is that we \nneed to collect taxes currently owed in the most effective and most \nefficient way possible and particularly not ignore a policy of not \ngoing after money under $25,000. Since the private debt collection \nprogram will accomplish that, I urge support for this amendment when it \ncomes up.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/04/senate-section/article/S2728-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2728]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Under the previous order, the \nSenate will resume consideration of H.R. 1105, which the clerk will \nreport by title.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       A bill (H.R. 1105) making omnibus appropriations for the \n     fiscal year ending September 30, 2009, and for other \n     purposes.\n\n  Pending:\n\n       Coburn amendment No. 596, to require the use of competitive \n     procedures to award contracts, grants, and cooperative \n     agreements funded under this act.\n       Coburn amendment No. 608, to provide for the Emmett Till \n     Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act from funds already provided \n     for the Weed and Seed Program.\n       Coburn modified amendment No. 623, to prohibit taxpayer \n     dollars from being earmarked to 14 clients of a lobbying firm \n     under Federal investigation for making campaign donations in \n     exchange for political favors for the group's clients.\n       Coburn amendment No. 610, to prohibit funding for \n     congressional earmarks for wasteful and parochial pork \n     projects.\n       Wicker amendment No. 607, to require that amounts \n     appropriated for the United Nations Population Fund are not \n     used by organizations which support coercive abortion or \n     involuntary sterilization.\n       Thune amendment No. 635, to provide funding for the \n     Emergency Fund for Indian Safety and Health, with an offset.\n       Murkowski amendment No. 599, to modify a provision relating \n     to the repromulgation of final rules by the Secretary of the \n     Interior and the Secretary of Commerce.\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, Senator Grassley and I do not see eye to \neye on this issue, and I wish to state for the record why this section \nwas included in the appropriations bill.\n  First, it is hard for me to follow his argument that because the \nFinance Committee created a permissive arrangement where the Internal \nRevenue Service could enter into contracts with private companies to \ncollect IRS debts, it somehow takes away the authority of the \nAppropriations Committee to even address this issue. It is a permissive \nstatute. It does not require the IRS to sign up a private company. When \nthe IRS does exercise the right under that statute, it involves Federal \nexpenditures, appropriations.\n  My provision in this bill is not tax language. My provision in this \nbill says: None of the funds in this bill may be used to enter into, \nrenew, extend, administer, implement, enforce or provide oversight of \nsuch a contract. We go directly to the spending aspects. There is no \ncommittee violation here. This is our jurisdiction.\n  Senator Grassley's committee, the Finance Committee, does not pay for \nthese agencies. The appropriations process does. So we are exercising \nour authority--no violation of committee jurisdiction, which, of \ncourse, means little to those following this debate but means a lot to \nthose of us who serve in this Chamber.\n  Let me tell you what this is about. This is about collecting debts \nowed to the Federal Government, specifically the Internal Revenue \nService, and the Finance Committee said: Let's see, if we let private \ncollection agencies do it, whether they can save us money and do it \nmore effectively. That is a legitimate inquiry. It is one I would be \nopen to. I think it is reasonable to see if that might happen.\n  Well, let me tell you what has happened. After the Federal Government \nspent $71 million in start-up costs to allow two companies, one in Iowa \nand one in New York, to move forward on this first phase of outsourcing \nprograms, they started operations in September 2006. Presently, the IRS \nhas contracts with two companies--one in Senator Grassley's State of \nIowa and one in the State of New York--for the collection of unpaid \nFederal income tax liabilities. The IRS is currently in the process of \ndetermining whether to exercise the option to extend these contracts \nfor a 1-year period. That is why our language came in and said: Stop, \ndon't do it. And I will explain why. There are a host of reasons.\n\n  The collection of Federal taxes, of course, is a core Government \nfunction, but I am not going to argue with the premise that we should \nsee if we can do it with more cost efficiency by using private \ncollectors. It is true that the information we are talking about here \nis sensitive information. So the IRS, of course, has access to more \ninformation about the debtors than the private collection agencies, and \nwe want to always make certain we protect the confidentiality of \ncertain information all American citizens share with their Government \nand don't believe it is going to be broadcast to any private company. \nSo there is a natural tension here between the efforts of a private \nbusiness making money collecting back taxes and the Internal Revenue \nService, which has more information at their disposal in making \nevaluations but also a higher responsibility and duty in protecting the \nprivacy of taxpayers with the information they provide our Government.\n  Let's get down to the bottom line. Using private companies to collect \ntaxes is far more costly than having qualified, trained IRS employees \ndo the work. I couldn't say that without evidence to back it up. Since \nthe inception of this private collection program, the Internal Revenue \nService has spent approximately $80 million to set it up and administer \nit and we have received back as taxpayers $60 million in net revenue, \nafter paying these private companies in Iowa and New York $13 million \nin commissions--$13 million to receive back $60 million. According to \nthe IRS, private collection agencies were originally projected to bring \nin $65 million in fiscal year 2007 and up to $127 million in fiscal \nyear 2008. So what happened? Instead, they raised $32 million in 2007--\nless than half of what we expected--and only $37 million in gross \nrevenue in fiscal year 2008, about a fourth of what we expected. So \ntheir performance was dramatically less than promised, dramatically \nless than the IRS anticipated when they entered into these contracts.\n  The IRS has not identified any best practices from these private tax \ncollectors, which was one of the stated intentions of the program. \nThese private companies were supposed to show us\n\n[[Page S2729]]\n\nthe way to collect money more effectively. So far, they haven't, and \nthey have fallen down in their own goals in terms of collection of back \ntaxes. The private companies have collected approximately one-half or \nless of what they were supposed to bring in, but they continue to be \npaid 21 to 24 percent in commissions on the easiest cases of all, \ntotaling $13 million we have paid to these private companies.\n  Now, Senator Grassley made a reference to student loan collection. Of \ncourse, he should acknowledge, if he makes that reference, that we cap \nthe commission for student loan collection at 16 percent. Instead, \nthese companies in Iowa and in New York are being paid 21 to 24 percent \nof back taxes collected, so they are getting a premium and they are \ncollecting far less than they said they would.\n  The story gets more interesting.\n  The IRS already has a significant collection infrastructure: \nthousands of trained employees. I heard Senator Grassley make negative \nreferences to unions. That is his point of view. I don't share it, but \nI do believe union employees should be given an opportunity to be \ncompared in their collection practices with those in private business. \nLet's be fair about this. This was an experiment, and the premise was \nthat if you just turn it over to a profit-making, private company, it \nis going to do a better job and it will be cheaper for the Government--\ncheaper than relying on IRS employees who may or may not be members of \nthe union to which Senator Grassley referred. The automated collection \nsystem in the Internal Revenue Service is a critical collection \noperation. It collects nearly $1.5 million per employee, per year. It \nworks. So the employees at the IRS are collecting the back taxes as \nthey promised they would.\n  Now, listen to this: The Internal Revenue Service National Taxpayer \nAdvocate, Nina Olsen, has estimated that IRS employees collect $32 for \nevery $1 spent, compared to collections by the private agencies of $4 \nfor every dollar given to them in commissions--8 to 1. If this is about \ncomparing the dollar cost of collecting back taxes, the IRS employees \nwin this 8 to 1. How in the world can anyone justify continuing \nsubsidizing private collection agencies that can't do the job as well \nas the employees of the Internal Revenue Service?\n  According to the ``Taxpayer Advocate Annual Report to Congress'' in \nDecember 2008, the IRS automated system of collection--using IRS \nemployees--collected more than three times as much as the private \ncollectors did. They went on to say that this automated collection \nsystem in the IRS collected 13 percent of the balance due, while \nprivate collectors collected 4 percent of the balance due. By every \ntangible measure, the employees of the IRS are doing a dramatically \nbetter job than those in the private collection agencies.\n  These agencies have failed to meet the goals they set in terms of the \namount of money they collect and how much they would charge the \nGovernment for all the years they have been doing this--in the 2 \nstraight years. Is it any wonder we have questioned whether we should \ncontinue this? This is a subsidy--a subsidy to private companies that \nhave not met the burden they said they would meet to prove to the \ntaxpayers theirs was a more cost-efficient way to collect back taxes.\n  The last argument made by Senator Grassley is an interesting one. He \nargued--even though he opposed President Obama's stimulus package--that \nwe needed to keep subsidizing these private collection agencies because \nwe need to create more jobs in America. In other words, this would be \nSenator Grassley's private stimulus package for this company in Iowa. \nWell, I would say to the Senator that, sadly, with the state of this \neconomy, collection agencies shouldn't have any problems finding work \nto do. I just don't think the American taxpayers ought to be \nsubsidizing them. I think basic Midwestern values suggest to us that we \nhave experimented and the experiment results are in. This has turned \nout not to be a good investment of taxpayers' money. As the chairman of \nthe subcommittee that has to pay for this, I can't justify it. I can't \njustify it for New York or for Iowa or for any State. We tried this \nexperiment in good faith, and the private collection agencies failed to \ncome through as promised.\n  Let's put the money, as I suggest in this appropriations bill, into \nthe trained employees, with the automated collection system, who are \nbringing back, by a margin of 8 to 1, more back taxes than these \nprivate companies in Iowa and New York. I believe that is reasonable, \nand I find it hard to understand how many of my Republican colleagues \nwho criticize this Omnibus appropriations bill for wasting money would \nvote for the Grassley amendment which would continue the subsidy--\nwasting taxpayers' dollars--with private collection agencies that have \nnot been as effective as the Internal Revenue Service.\n  Until these private companies can prove they can do the job better, \ndo it more efficiently, do it at a lower cost, there is no reason we \nshould continue this subsidy. A personal stimulus bill for a company in \nIowa and a company in New York is something we can ill afford to do at \nthis moment when we are trying to deal with the costs of this \nGovernment and bringing them under control.\n  The Omnibus appropriations bill increases funding for the IRS with a \nboost of over $337 million in enforcement activity. With these enhanced \nfunds, the IRS will be hiring new employees who can do this work \nefficiently, as they have proven time and time again. They have the \ntools, they have the options the taxpayers have a right to expect, and \nthey will protect the privacy of the taxpayers in the process. Section \n106, which Senator Grassley addresses, will ensure that appropriated \nfunds for tax collection work will be put to optimum use within the \nagency rather than being diverted to outsourced Government work, which \nhas shown that it cannot meet its promises of reducing the cost of \nGovernment and increasing collections. We know it works. Let's stick \nwith it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I am not going to take long to respond because I think \nthe main point I make is this. My remarks were not addressed by the \nSenator from Illinois. The issue we are talking about is an IRS policy \nthat they will not go after any amount of money under $25,000, even \nthough those are amounts that individuals agreed they owe.\n  So any comparisons of what the IRS can do versus what private debt \ncollection agencies can do is not legitimate because you can hire more \nIRS employees. But I told you the policy of the IRS if they hire more \nemployees, they will not go after amounts of $25,000 or less and I \nthink it is fair to taxpayers that are honest, that every dollar owed \nis collected. Not one dollar more. And that we shouldn't have a \ngovernment policy that is not going to go after it, and this program \ndoes go after it.\n  He mentioned start-up costs and this is very important because you \ncannot judge the cost effectiveness of a program based on how much was \nspent on start-up costs. There are start-up costs in any Federal \nagency, for any new agency or program that starts out. You can't weigh \nthe costs incurred for what was supposed to be a permanent program \nagainst the benefits of a program that hasn't been fully operational \nfor most of the 2 years of its existence.\n  And the reason it hasn't been fully operational, is that the union, \nthe taxpayer advocate, and even the chief counsel, continued to throw \nup roadblocks by weighing in on what type of cases the contractors \ncould work. This means that even though the program was supposed to \nstart in September 2006, it was months later before the contractors \nreceived the full allocation of cases they were supposed to get.\n  The Senator from Illinois asked what happened in regards to why the \nactual amounts collected to date by contractors was lower than \nexpected. Well, that is what happened. And to his point about paying \n$13 million for $60 million of revenues. Let's be honest--the \ncontractors are paid on a commission basis so the IRS isn't paying \nanything out of its pockets. The contractors are getting a percentage \nof the taxes they collect and they don't get paid for all the work they \ndo that generates no collection. Because of the IRS policy to not \ncollect taxes due under $25,000, the $60 million IRS did get is revenue \nthat IRS would never have received.\n\n[[Page S2730]]\n\n  He also mentioned this, there is a difference between what is paid to \neducation debt collection contractors and what is paid to tax debt \ncollection contractors. He is right. But there is a factor with \ncollecting taxes that is not true in the case of the Education \nDepartment and that is the privacy issues that have been brought up. \nThe contractors with the IRS incur higher expenses than education \ncontractors because they don't have access to all the information IRS \nhas because the law does protect the privacy of taxpayers. And because \nthey have to provide all of the safeguards and protections that IRS \nprovides, the contractors have to incur more security expenses than \neducation contractors.\n  The Senator from Illinois mentioned the success of IRS's use of \nautomated collection systems. You have to remember that there is \nnothing automated about the IRS's so-called automatic collection \nsystem. The contractors use automated systems to determine which \ntaxpayer to call next. The IRS doesn't even make outbound phone calls--\nthe only phone calls are returning phone calls when taxpayers call the \nIRS with questions about a letter they received.\n  Finally, the Senator from Illinois described my efforts to continue \nto fund the IRS program as my own personal stimulus plan because it \nwill save jobs in Iowa. I want to make clear that it was expected that \nthe IRS would contract with 10 or 15 contractors--not just 2. But \nbecause of all the roadblocks put up by the union and others, the IRS \napparently claims that there aren't enough cases to provide to even \nthese two contractors. This doesn't make sense to me since there is \napparently $25 billion of potentially collectible debt that the IRS is \nnot pursuing. The program, if run properly, would have and should have \nbeen expanded to include other contractors. And I would also like to \npoint out that these two contractors are national organizations and \nbetween them are likely to have offices and employees in almost all of \nthe 50 States.\n  So the bottom line of our approach in this program is to make sure \nthat the honest taxpayer is protected. And that we do not support an \nIRS policy that we aren't going to collect the money from everyone--a \npolicy which is not clear to me that IRS is going to change. And we're \nshowing that we do not accept this policy through this program. We are \ngoing after that money that no IRS employee is going to go after. And \nif you're going to be fair to the taxpayer that pays every dollar that \nthey owe, it seems to me we should make every effort we can to go after \nall taxpayers who do not pay their taxes. I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, my understanding is the Senator from \nMaryland is going to seek recognition next. I ask unanimous consent to \nbe recognized following the presentation by the Senator from Maryland.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I know the Senate is on a tight \ntimeframe because there will be a joint session of Congress to welcome \nthe Prime Minister of England, our greatest ally.\n  I rise today as the chairperson of the Appropriations Commerce, \nJustice, Science Subcommittee and to lay out for our colleagues what is \nin this appropriation and why it is needed and what compelling human \nneeds it meets.\n  No. 1, why do we have to do this since we passed the stimulus? \nActually, we should have done this before the stimulus. We should have \ndone it in October. Why didn't we? We didn't do it in October because \nwe were facing a hostile White House and an OMB Director who was \nhostile to the very agencies this funds. We didn't want to send this \nappropriations to the Bush White House because all we would have faced \nwas one more back-and-forth parliamentary quagmire.\n  This appropriation keeps the U.S. Government going. What my \nsubcommittee does is fund those agencies that are critical and crucial \nto the economic growth of the United States of America, that will \nprotect the communities of the United States, and will also work to \nprotect our planet. In terms of economic growth, this is the \nsubcommittee that funds all science agencies with the extension of the \nNational Institutes of Health and the Department of Energy. It comes up \nwith the new ideas. It follows the recommendations of the National \nAcademy of Sciences about how we can rise above the gathering storm to \nbe competitive today and be able to be competitive tomorrow. In \nEnglish, and in the diners around Maryland, that would mean jobs today \nand tomorrow. It is in basic research that we come up with the new \nideas that lead to the new products, that lead to the new jobs.\n  That is what this CJS funds. At the same time, it funds the Patent \nOffice. Our colleagues on the Judiciary committee will be giving us a \nnew framework for the protection of patents. That is a geek word that \nmeans if you invent it, we are going to protect you, and you will be \nable to harvest the benefits of your new idea. We are going to protect \nintellectual property because it is right now, in the knowledge-driven \neconomy, the property of choice to be protected.\n  This subcommittee funds research, innovation, the development of \ntechnology. It also funds the Department of Justice--gosh, a Department \nof Justice that even remembers what the name means. I am so excited \nabout working with our new Attorney General.\n  In addition to the work of the Justice Department, it funds local law \nenforcement through cops on the beat and Byrne grants, and our national \nFederal law enforcement agencies--the FBI, Bureau of Alcohol and \nFirearms, and the Marshal Service.\n  So if you want to know, why should we support the CJS? If you want \njobs today and tomorrow, you want to vote for this appropriation. If \nyou want to keep neighborhoods safe, you want to vote for this \nappropriation. If you want the marshals going after sexual predators so \nthere are no more Adam Walshes, vote for this bill. If you want to \nprotect violence against women, victims of domestic violence, and have \nthe shelters and community interventions, you want to vote for this \nbill. If you are so proud of the great genius of the United States of \nAmerica and its entrepreneurship that comes up with these new ideas, \nthese new products, you want to vote for this bill because you want a \nPatent Office where you don't want to stand in line for years to be \nable to protect your ideas so they are not stolen or hijacked or \npirated around the world. You want to vote for this bill. If you want \nto protect our planet--global warming is a real threat, from the \nstandpoint of our Director of National Intelligence, who says global \nwarming could destabilize populations, and it is a national security \nissue. It is not only about protecting the polar bears; it is also \nabout protecting the Port of Baltimore, Chesapeake Bay, our coastline, \nand those around the world. If you want to protect the planet and our \nhomeland, you want to vote for this bill.\n  In summary, these are the top 10 reasons to support CJS in the 2009 \nomnibus bill:\n  I ask unanimous consent to have them printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       1. Funds the FBI, our chief domestic national security \n     agency, to take down terror cells and dirty bombs on U.S. \n     soil ($7 billion).\n       2. Adds 85 FBI agents and forensic accounting professionals \n     to combat mortgage and financial fraud ($10 million).\n       3. Funds DEA to fight international drug cartels that \n     finance terrorism and infiltrate our neighborhoods with \n     heroin and meth ($2 billion).\n       4. Funds ATF to partner with the military to dismantle IEDs \n     that maim and kill our troops on the battlefield ($1 \n     billion).\n       5. Supports cops on the beat--provides $3.2 billion for \n     state and local law enforcement, $2.1 billion above the \n     previous Administration's request--to help state and local \n     police fight gangs, drugs, crime and child predators.\n       6. Highest funding level ever for the Violence Against \n     Women Act programs to combat sexual assault and domestic \n     violence and help victims get their lives back together ($415 \n     million).\n       7. Protects our kids from predators by preventing, \n     investigating and prosecuting crimes against children ($234 \n     million).\n       8. Advances climate research and restores satellite climate \n     sensors cut by the previous Administration ($270 million).\n       9. Enhances U.S. competitiveness and innovation by \n     increasing science and technology research at NSF and NIST, a \n     7 percent increase over last year ($913 million).\n\n[[Page S2731]]\n\n       10. Restores fiscal responsibility and accountability to \n     ensure stewardship of taxpayer dollars--prohibits funds for \n     lavish banquets, controls cost overruns, and requires IGs to \n     do random audits of grantees.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I am tired of the naysayers who come up with these \nquirky little congressionally designated projects and make them a \nsubject of ridicule. Our country, our ship of state, right now is \nleaking. We can right that ship and President Obama is righting that \nship. This CJS bill is the right tool to be able to do that.\n  What are the consequences of not passing this bill? I will tell you \nright now. Let's go to law enforcement. If we do not pass this bill and \nwe put it on something called a continuing resolution, that is \nessentially keeping it barely afloat. The FBI will get a half billion \ndollars less to run their agency for this year. If Director Mueller \nwere here, he would say this means 650 fewer FBI special agents. It \nmeans less analysts and other people fighting crime on U.S. soil. It \nmeans we cannot hire 100 new FBI specialists in forensic accounting to \ngo after the mortgage fraud people. Remember them--the scammers, the \nbums? We would not be able to do that.\n  Let's talk about drug enforcement. There will be $52 million less for \nDEA. What are some of the biggest threats facing us right now? Let's \ntalk about Mexico. Mexico is on the verge of a state of siege because \nof the drug cartels that are running rampant. If you watch the news and \nlisten to the Ambassador of Mexico and to their compelling issues down \nthere--look at what was on ``60 Minutes,'' where the drug cartels are \nroaming streets with assault rifles, shooting police chiefs, shooting \nelected officials, kidnapping--that is on our border. We need the DEA. \nThen there are the narcotraffickers in Colombia--in that long, \nsteadfast fight where we are making progress. Then there is \nAfghanistan, which provides 85 percent of the world's poppy. We are \ngoing to send thousands of more troops into Afghanistan.\n  I am not too excited about that part, but that is a debate for \nanother time. But what is going on in Afghanistan? They are growing \npoppy like Iowa grows corn. It is an enormous drug crop. What does the \nmoney from that do? First, it corrupts Government and elected \nofficials. It corrupts the judiciary. It has a corrupting influence. So \nwe are going to send American troops to fight and die for something \nthat could be bordering on a narcostate?\n  I say, before we send in more marines, let's send in more DEA agents \nto work with the Karzai government to do something about the growth of \npoppy and the funding of the Taliban. Let's send in DEA agents. Under \nthis, we are going to have a hiring freeze. Agents would have to take \nfurloughs. But that is OK, that is just in law enforcement.\n  Let's talk about the national space agency, NASA, and the National \nOceanic and Atmospheric Agency. If we don't do this appropriation, NASA \nwill be funded close to a half billion dollars below what is in the \nomnibus. This would be a major setback to developing a reliable \ntransportation system to continue our human space flights. We are \nalready going to go dark in space, where we are going to rely on the \nRussians to get us up to our very own space station. But what this \ncould mean is the loss of several thousand jobs in Florida, Texas, \nMississippi, Alabama, Utah, and Louisiana. If we don't pass this by the \nend of March, layoff notices will begin. Aren't we for jobs today and \njobs tomorrow? Aren't we for building rocket ships and spaceships? We \nhave to pass this bill.\n  Then when we look at NOAA. We all love the weather reports. We rely \nupon them for early warnings of tornadoes and hurricanes and, at the \nsame time, to be able to give us traffic. Weather reports don't come \nfrom the Weather Channel. The Weather Channel gets its information from \nthe weather services provided by our Government at NOAA. We ought to \nrename it the ``National Oceans Atmospheric and Weather \nAdministration.'' Right now, they are weathering their own storm. If \nthis continuing resolution hits them, it means more layoffs. We won't \nbe able to develop the right technology to predict and give the early \nwarnings that are so important to our people.\n  Then I wish to talk about education. Through the National Science \nFoundation, and other science agencies in here, we work to promote \neducation, to get our young people excited and participating in science \nand technology, so that they want to come into these exciting new \npossible careers, where they are going to come up with new ideas and \ninventions. This makes a major downpayment so we can coordinate with \nour new Secretary of Education and our President, who is such a strong \nadvocate of this.\n  If you wish to have a country that is meeting the day-to-day needs of \nour own people, yet looking ahead to the long-range needs of our \ncountry, you want to vote for this appropriation. You want to vote for \nthe subcommittee portion of this appropriation. The other reason, for \nthose who are concerned about the issue of bipartisanship, is we \ndeveloped this jointly and collegially and civilly with my colleague \nfrom Alabama, Senator Richard Shelby. This bill has his endorsement and \nit will have his vote. Senator Shelby and I have worked together for \nmany years, and we believe that good people can find common ground, \nfind an accessible center in the rough and tumble of politics that \nenables us to come before the Senate with a bipartisan approach to the \nCommerce, Justice, Science bill.\n  I want to thank Senator Shelby and his staff for their cooperation \nand collegiality in crafting the CJS portion of the bill we are \nconsidering.\n  The CJS Subcommittee's top priority is keeping Americans safe from \nterrorism and violent crime. To that end, our bill provides $26.1 \nbillion for the Justice Department, which is $3 billion above the \nprevious President's budget request. We fund the FBI our domestic \ncounterterrorism agency with mission of dismantling terror cells and \nweapons of mass destruction on U.S. soil at $7.3 billion, which is $155 \nmillion above the previous President's budget request.\n  The CJS bill is the major Federal funding source for our State and \nlocal police departments. The previous President's budget request \nproposed dramatic cuts totaling $2 billion to State and local grant \nfunding. We reject those cuts and instead provide a total of $3.2 \nbillion to support our thin blue line.\n  Among those funds, the CJS bill provides $550 million for COPS \ngrants, which pay for gear and technology--such as bulletproof vests \nand crime scene analysis--to keep our cops safe, and to help them catch \ncriminals. We also have $546 million for Byrne-justice assistance \ngrants, a formula-based program that is the main Federal funding tool \nfor State and local police operations, which was zeroed out by the \nprevious administration. For juvenile justice and delinquency \nprevention mentoring and antigang programs we provide $374 million, \nwhich is $189 million more than that the previous President request. \nLastly, we provide $415 million to prevent violence against women, \nwhich is the highest level ever allocated for Violence Against Women \nAct programs.\n  In addition to helping our State and locals keep our communities \nsafe, the CJS bill funds our major Federal law enforcement agencies. We \nprovide $1.9 billion for the DEA to fight international narcoterrorists \nand drug kingpins. There is also $1.1 billion for the Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, ATF, to combat violent gun \ncrime and gangs and investigate arson.\n  The CJS bill contains $954 million for the Marshals Service to \napprehend fugitive sex offenders and other violent criminals. We \nincluded $1.8 billion for our U.S. Attorneys to prosecute gang leaders, \ngun traffickers and drug dealers. Lastly, we provide $6.2 billion for \nmanagement and construction of Federal prisons to ensure our Federal \nprisons are safe and secure.\n  These agencies are the backbone of our criminal justice system. They \nenforce our laws, catch criminals and keep our communities safe.\n  Most importantly, this bill protects the most vulnerable among us: \nour children. We provide over $234 million to keep our kids safe from \npredators and violence.\n  The CJS includes $5 million to hire 20 new U.S. marshals to track \ndown and arrest fugitive sex offenders, $47 million for the FBI \nInnocent Images program to catch deviants who use the Internet to prey \non children, $5 million to hire 25 new assistant U.S. Attorneys to \nprosecute sex offenders, $70 million\n\n[[Page S2732]]\n\nfor state and local law enforcement efforts to find and apprehend child \npredators, and $16 million for grants to school districts to keep kids \nsafe at school.\n  I am proud to report that the CJS bill follows the framework of the \nAmerica COMPETES Act and makes investments to improve America's \ncompetitiveness.\n  The bill provides $819 million for the National Institute of \nStandards and Technology, which includes $65 million for the new \nTechnology Innovation Program and $110 million for the manufacturing \nextension partnership, MEP. This is important funding to develop new \ntechnologies and new products and make American manufacturers more \ncompetitive.\n  We also provide $6.5 billion for the NSF, including $845 million \ndedicated for education. These funds focus on science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics, and will develop our next generation of \nscientists and engineers.\n  For the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA, we \nprovide $4.4 billion, including: $945 million for our weather service \nto predict and warn us about severe weather, and $758 million for our \nfisheries service to protect our marine resources.\n  The bill also provides $17.8 billion for NASA, which is $200 million \nmore than the previous President's budget request. We meet our \nobligations to fully fund the space shuttle at $3 billion, the space \nstation at $2 billion, and the next generation space vehicle at $3.1 \nbillion this year.\n  Finally, the CJS bill supports an innovation friendly government by \nproviding full funding at $2 billion for the Patent and Trademark \nOffice, PTO, to reduce backlogs of patent applications and protect our \nintellectual property; and $430 million for the International Trade \nAdministration to enforce our trade laws.\n  The CJS bill also makes important investments in America's future. We \nprovide $240 million for economic development grants--$140 million more \nthan requested by the previous administration--to help communities \ncreate jobs and opportunity. We also provide $20 million for public \ntelevision infrastructure grants.\n  The CJS bill funds the science we use to monitor and predict changes \nin our weather and climate, and make policy decisions on actions we \nshould take to save our planet. In fact, the CJS bill funds 85 percent \nof all Federal climate change science.\n  Specifically, we provide $1.4 billion for NASA Earth science for \nsatellite missions that tell us how much pollution is in our \natmosphere, our rainforests and ice sheets are shifting, and the height \nand chemistry of our oceans are changing. Funding for Earth science \nincludes $150 million for new NASA earth science missions, which is $50 \nmillion above the previous President's request. This funding is \nrecommended by the National Academy of Science to measure our ice \nsheets, climate, and atmosphere so we can better predict changes to our \nplanet.\n  We provide $606 million for NASA science into how the sun affects the \nEarth. This helps predict and warn about events like solar flares that \ncan knock out our communications and power grids.\n  The CJS has $966 million for NOAA weather satellites, which are \nimportant early warning tools. If we can better predict and warn when \ntornadoes and hurricanes are coming, we can save lives and save money. \nWe provide $74 million to restore critical climate sensors that had \nbeen deleted from our next generation polar satellites because of cost \noverruns. We also include $420 million for NOAA research to help us \nbetter understand our oceans and atmosphere and how they interact and \nchange.\n  Finally, the CJS bill continues to emphasize congressional oversight, \naccountability and fiscal stewardship.\n  We meet our constitutional obligations for a timely and accurate \nCensus by providing $3.1 million for the 2010 Census. This will keep \nthe Census on track, despite the previous administration's \nmismanagement of an information technology contract.\n  The CJS Subcommittee continues its oversight role by cracking down on \ncost overruns or mismanagement of taxpayer dollars. The bill insists on \ndiscipline and vigorous oversight by requiring each agency to notify \nthe committee when costs of projects grow by more than 10 percent, \nthereby creating an early warning system.\n  We also require that inspectors general conduct random audits of \ngrant funding to ensure compliance.\n  Finally, the bill complies fully with legislative transparency and \naccountability rules.\n  Again, I want to thank Senator Shelby and his staff--Art Cameron, \nGoodloe Sutton, Allen Cutler and Augusta Wilson--for their cooperation \nand collegiality.\n  The CJS bill meets the day to day needs of our constituents by \nkeeping them safe from terrorism and violent crime. It looks out for \nthe long-term needs of our Nation by making investments in America's \nphysical and intellectual infrastructure to create and sustain jobs for \ntoday and jobs for tomorrow.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to support it.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 608\n\n  Mr. President, I rise to oppose the amendment No. 608 offered by the \nSenator from Oklahoma. Simply put, this amendment is a solution in \nsearch of a problem. The CJS portion of the omnibus does provide funds \nfor the Department of Justice to solve civil right cold cases. This \namendment is a distraction.\n  Before I speak about why I oppose this amendment, however, we must \nfirst talk about Emmett Till.\n  Emmett Till was a 14-year-old African-American boy from Chicago who \nwas murdered in Money, MS, on August 28, 1955. He was dragged from his \nuncle's home and shot in the head. His body was dumped in the \nTallahatchie River, tied to a 70-pound cotton gin with barb wire, and \nfound 3 days later by fishermen. Emmett's mother demanded an open \ncasket to show the world the brutality of his murder.\n  The murder of Emmett Till was a key event igniting the civil rights \nmovement. Emmett's two killers never served a day in jail for their \nheinous crime. An all-White jury acquitted them in 67 minutes. The \nkillers later admitted to murdering Emmett Till, but could not be \nprosecuted for the crime because they had already been found innocent \nby a jury.\n  In May 2004, 49 years after the murder, the Department of Justice \nreopened the case to finally determine if anyone else was involved in \nthe killing. The FBI exhumed Emmett Till's body and performed an \nautopsy. Two years later, the FBI determined no one else was involved \nand officially closed the case.\n  On October 7, 2008, President Bush signed a law named after Emmett \nTill. The purpose of the legislation is to make sure Justice Department \nhas the necessary resources to investigate civil rights cold cases.\n  Cold cases are extremely difficult to solve. Investigators run into \nmany dead ends, as witnesses are hard to find and evidence can be \neasily misplaced, mishandled or destroyed. Additionally, investigations \nuse up a lot of time and money resources.\n  However, solving these cases is important. This is about more than \njust bringing killers to justice. Solving these cases is about letting \nvictims' families get on with their lives, about moving beyond racial \nhatred, and reconciliation.\n  I want to be clear I support funding for investigating cold cases. \nThat is why I fought hard to make sure there is money in the Federal \ncheckbook for fiscal year 2009 to support the Emmett Till law. The CJS \nportion of the omnibus provides the Department of Justice with the \nresources it needs to investigate civil rights cold cases.\n  To boost resources for civil rights cold case investigations, the CJS \nbill provide $123 million for the Department of Justice's Civil Rights \nDivision, which is $7 million more than 2008, and charged with heading \nup the investigation and enforcement responsibilities set forth in the \nEmmett Till bill. We include $151 million for funding to reduce \nenormous backlog of untested DNA evidence. There is a backlog of \n500,000 unsolved cases with untested DNA evidence sitting in evidence \nlockers today.\n  So that State and local law enforcement have the means to carry out \ntheir roles in investigating civil rights cold cases, we provide $30 \nmillion for competitive funds for State and local government to \ninvestigate and prosecute civil rights violations. There is also $25\n\n[[Page S2733]]\n\nmillion for competitive grants to State and locals to reduce forensic \nevidence backlogs.\n  The CJS bill provides $9.8 million for the Justice Department's \nCommunity Relations Service to train local law enforcement how to \nmediate racial tensions in communities. We also have $75.6 million for \nthe inspector general at Department of Justice, which is $5 million \nmore than 2008. Under the Emmett Till law, the Inspector General has \nthe authority to investigate missing children cold cases.\n  In addition to cold case investigations, the CJS bill provides robust \nfunding to enforce our Nation's civil rights laws. It includes $1.84 \nbillion, which is $88 million more than 2008, for the U.S. attorneys \noffice at Department of Justice. These are the attorneys who \ninvestigate and prosecute civil rights violations. The bill also has $9 \nmillion for the Commission on Civil Rights, which is responsible for \nmaking agencies are complying with Federal civil rights laws and \nraising public awareness on civil rights. Lastly, we include $343 \nmillion for the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, whose mission \nis to end workplace discrimination. This is $14.8 million above 2008 \nand will help reduce the current backlog of EEOC cases.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose amendment No. 608 and support the \nomnibus. The omnibus gives Department of Justice the resources it needs \nto investigate civil rights cold cases and enforce our country's civil \nrights laws.\n  I have a letter from Attorney General Eric Holder stating his support \nfor the goals of the Emmett Till Act. Attorney General Holder is \ncommitted to the goals of the Emmett Till Act, and this letter gives \nhis personal commitment to continuing to use funding to pursue these \nserious crimes.\n  If the Senate does not pass the omnibus, the Department of Justice \nwill be forced to operate at 2008 levels. This means we will have to \nlay off investigators and prosecutors, and civil rights enforcement and \ninvestigations will be compromised.\n  For all these reasons, I urge a ``NO'' vote on this amendment.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the letter to which I referred be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         The Attorney General,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2009.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and \n         Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairwoman: The Department of Justice \n     wholeheartedly supports the goals of the Emmett Till Unsolved \n     Civil Rights Crime Act. The racially-motivated murders from \n     the civil rights era constitute some of the greatest \n     blemishes upon our history.\n       The Department is working in partnership with the National \n     Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the \n     Southern Poverty Law Center. and the National Urban League to \n     investigate the unsolved racially-motivated violent crimes \n     committed more than 40 years ago. The FBI has prioritized the \n     top dozen of these cases, though there are more than 100 \n     unsolved murder cases from the civil rights era under review \n     by the FBI.\n       You have my personal commitment that the Department will \n     continue to pursue these serious crimes in those matters in \n     which the law and the facts would permit effective law \n     enforcement action. We will continue to use our resources and \n     expertise to identify and locate those responsible for these \n     crimes and prosecute them whenever possible, consistent with \n     the Principles of Federal Prosecution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Eric H. Holder, Jr.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. It is time to move the appropriations. We have to make \nsure our Government can function so our economy can function.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, prior to the statement by the Senator from \nMaryland, I was listening to the discussion between Senator Grassley \nand Senator Durbin on an issue that I know Senator Grassley feels \nstrongly about. I don't believe there is an amendment yet offered. I \nhope it is not offered, frankly. I have great respect for the Senator \nfrom Iowa, Mr. Grassley. He and I have worked together on a range of \nissues, and he is a good legislator. He and the Senator from Illinois, \nMr. Durbin, were having a disagreement about this.\n  I come down on the side of the Senator from Illinois. This discussion \nis about the issue of using private collection agencies to collect \ncertain Internal Revenue Service delinquent taxes. First, let me say \nthat I think people who are delinquent on their taxes ought to be \nsqueezed a bit to pay them. Unless there is some extraneous \ncircumstance, I think most Americans voluntarily pay their taxes. They \ndo not necessarily like to but they do because that is part of the cost \nof citizenship in this country. We have to do things together. We build \nroads together, and we have a law enforcement function in our \ncommunities together. We build schools, we have defense--we do all \nthese things together. It costs money, so we pay taxes. That's part of \nthe cost of citizenship.\n  There is great disagreement at what level those taxes should be and \nwho actually pays it. I understand all that. But because we have a \nresponsibility to pay some taxes and because there are some who do not, \nwe have taxes that are delinquent in the Internal Revenue Service that \nneed to be collected.\n  The Internal Revenue Service has on two occasions begun experiments \nwith hiring private collection agencies to collect those taxes. The \nexperience with those experiments has not been good. Because there has \nbeen a great move toward privatizing everything, we have hired private \ncollection agencies to collect lower level delinquent taxes and, in \nfact, we have actually lost money in doing so.\n  It is almost unthinkable that someone who is going to collect taxes \nis going to lose money doing it. That is like being in business to sell \ntomatoes and someone is going to give me the tomatoes and you lose \nmoney.\n  Here is what the taxpayer advocate says. The tax advocate is someone \nwho works independently inside the Internal Revenue Service on behalf \nof taxpayers. Taxpayer Advocate Olson says that since its inception--\nthis latest iteration of using private collection agencies--the IRS has \nspent roughly $80 million to set up and administer this program to \ncollect delinquent taxes. They have spent $80 million but collected net \nrevenues of only $60 million.\n  Think of that. You hire some private companies to collect delinquent \ntaxes. It costs $80 million to get it going and administer it, and you \ncollect $60 million. I took rudimentary math in a high school senior \nclass of nine students in a town of 300 people. I can understand that \nequation. You spend $80 million and collect $60 million. It means you \nlost $20 million. It makes no sense to me.\n  By the way, the firms that did this also made $13 million in \ncommissions. That is part of the shortfall here.\n  It is also estimated by the taxpayer advocate in the Internal Revenue \nService that had they not hired a private collection agency and instead \nhired collectors at the IRS, they would have collected 13 times more \nmoney. This is about, in my judgment, common sense and waste. Common \nsense suggests you select the best alternative for collecting these \ntaxes. The alternative that would give the taxpayers the most for their \ninvestment and waste is about deciding you are going to hire private \ncollection agencies and spend $80 million and collect $60 million.\n  Let me make a couple of observations about what the tax advocate has \nsaid about these issues. The tax advocate has said--and again, this is \nan employee inside the Internal Revenue Service:\n\n       Private debt collection initiatives are failing in most \n     respects. . . . Not meeting revenue projections, its return \n     on investment is dismal. Private collectors are no better at \n     locating or collecting tax liabilities than the IRS itself.\n\n  If the taxpayer advocate that we fund inside the Internal Revenue \nService to look after the taxpayers says this is a failure, let's \ndecide it is a failure.\n  The underlying legislation brought to the floor in this omnibus \npackage effectively says let's get rid of this program. Let's have the \ncollections done as they should have been done and were done for a long \ntime at the Internal Revenue Service. They will not lose money. We will \ncollect 13 times more revenue, in my judgment, based on the estimates.\n\n[[Page S2734]]\n\n  Former IRS Commissioner Mark Everson in congressional testimony said:\n\n       I have freely acknowledged it is more costly to use private \n     collection agencies than it would be were the IRS to do it.\n\n  That is from an IRS Commissioner.\n  Former Acting Commissioner Kevin Brown told the House Ways and Means \nCommittee:\n\n       We can do it more efficiently. We have the tools under the \n     law that obviously are going to lead us to being more \n     efficient.\n\n  My only point is, I hope there is not an amendment on this issue. I \nhave great respect for my colleague from Iowa. But I think this is a \nprogram that should not have been started. Now that it is started and \nlosing money, it ought to be abandoned. If we are looking after waste, \nfraud, and abuse issues and trying to protect the American taxpayer and \nshut down the waste of taxpayers' money, there is no better candidate, \nin my judgment, than the candidate that is in this omnibus package and \nthis particular subcommittee by which we shut down the use of private \ncollection agencies that have actually lost money for the American \ntaxpayers. My hope is we do not have an amendment on this point. In any \nevent, it is long past the time for us to have shut down a program that \nis costing the American taxpayers money--$20 million to hire private \ntax collectors who are collecting less money than it is costing us to \nhire those collectors.\n  One might, by the way, look at this and say: Man, how can that be \ncontroversial? It seems to me that is a slam dunk, that is common \nsense. If that is the case, if that is what you think, you do not \nunderstand how the system works because even things that are \ndemonstrable failures are often hard to shut down. This is an example \nof that. We are close to getting that done.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet).

The Senator from California.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. INHOFE. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 596\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, amendment No. 596, offered by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma, prohibiting funding from being used for no-bid contracts \nwould appear on its face to be a good amendment, an amendment that some \nare asking: Why would I vote against this?\n  When this amendment first appeared as an amendment to the recovery \nact, the Senate passed it by a unanimous vote because it appeared to be \na good-government amendment. However, what we quickly learned as we \nbegan conference negotiations with the House is that the consequences \nof this amendment are more far reaching than simply prohibiting no-bid \ncontracts.\n  Because of the way this amendment is drafted, it is destructive to \nsmall business and minority-owned businesses in this country, as well \nas to Native American funding. This amendment states the only \nprocedures that can be used to award funds in this act are the \nprocedures in accordance with only section 303 of the Federal Property \nand Administrative Services Act. As a result, this amendment prohibits \nagencies from making any awards to small businesses through statutes \nthat have been enacted over the years that provide assistance to small \nbusinesses, including small veteran-owned businesses, service-disabled, \nveteran-owned businesses, minority-owned businesses, tribal \nenterprises, women-owned businesses, HUBZone-qualified businesses, and \nother entities covered through the SBA programs, as well as the Javits-\nWagner-O'Day Act, just to name a few.\n  Mr. President, in terms of Native American funding, this provision \nwould essentially overturn the so-called ``638'' contracts whereby a \ntribe contracts with the Bureau of Indian Affairs or Indian Health \nService or other agency to perform the function of that agency. These \ncontracts are not competitive pursuant to the Indian Self-Determination \nAct and other statutes enacted to help Native Americans.\n  In fact, efforts were made to correct this language during the \nconference negotiation of the recovery act so that small businesses--\nthe backbone of this country--and Native American funding would not be \nunnecessarily penalized by language that combined the broad dismissal \nof authorization statutes and the narrow citing of one procurement law. \nEven with the significant improvements made to the original text, the \nSenator from Alaska, who is the ranking member on the Energy and \nNatural Resources Committee, asked that I enter into a colloquy with \nher during consideration of the conference report to clarify that the \nlanguage did not impact existing Federal procurement law applicable to \nprograms that allow for set-asides and direct-award procurements.\n  Mr. President, I cannot speak to the intentions of the Senator from \nOklahoma as to what he wants to accomplish with this amendment. To be \nclear, however, I can speak to the consequences of the pending \namendment. It will have a destructive impact on the small business \nprograms and Native American programs mentioned above.\n  Do we really want to prohibit small veteran-owned businesses, \nservice-disabled, veteran-owned businesses from Federal funding \nopportunities unless they compete in the same manner as large \ncorporations? Do we really want to prohibit small women-owned \nbusinesses from Federal funding opportunities unless they compete in \nthe same manner with large corporations? Do we really want to say our \nFederal agencies must ignore existing Federal procurement laws that \ngovern these small business programs and Native American programs and \nallow only these small businesses to compete subject to section 303 of \nthe law?\n  This amendment systematically ignores years of Small Business \nCommittee and Indian Affairs Committee authorizations enacted into law \nby insisting that all contracts be awarded through one specific section \nof one specific law. This is the exact language the Senator from \nOklahoma offered during Senate consideration of the recovery act and \nnot the provision that was amended after Members were made aware of the \nnegative impacts on our small business community.\n  Consequently, while it appears to be a good-government amendment, it \nis in fact the opposite. If this amendment is adopted, it will cause \nsignificant disruptions to small businesses across this country, and I \ndon't wish to be part of that effort. Small businesses make up 99.7 \npercent of our Nation's employers and 50.3 percent of our Nation's \nprivate sector employment. Denying the ability of these small \nbusinesses to compete on a level playing field would severely impact \nsmall businesses that are\n\n[[Page S2735]]\n\nalready struggling to stay afloat during the current economic downturn.\n  Given the information we have learned since this amendment was first \nproposed several weeks ago, and given the fact the language before us \ndoes not take into account and address the many problems raised after \nit was first proposed, I encourage my colleagues to oppose this \namendment. It is the least we can do for our small businesses, \nparticularly given the economic crisis we are currently in.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 608\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I would like to speak a few minutes on the \nEmmett Till amendment that I have up. We heard this morning from the \nHonorable Senator from Maryland, utilizing the letter from the Attorney \nGeneral saying they would work hard in approving and working on the \nEmmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. However, the defense for \nnot approving my amendment was the fact that the Justice Department is \ngoing to work hard on it anyway.\n  I would note for my colleagues that is exactly the opposite amendment \nthat we had last year when we were trying to pass this bill, when it \nwas my contention that we didn't need additional money and that the \nJustice Department could do it. What we heard almost unanimously \noutside this Chamber is they couldn't do it without funding.\n  So now we have an amendment that actually puts in funding to go after \nthese perpetrators of these heinous crimes. Yet we don't want to do it \nbecause now the very excuse we said wasn't good enough last year is \ngood enough this year.\n  That is disloyal to the cause, No. 1; and, No. 2, it does not make \nany sense in light of the very statements made by some of the very same \nSenators last year.\n  The fact is, not funding this will make a real difference in the \nnumber of cases that get brought to prosecution. We have a letter from \nthe Attorney General that says he will try, but what we are talking \nabout is giving him more money so he does not have any excuse for not \ntrying--which lines up exactly with the reasoning behind the \nappropriations bills on almost every other topic.\n  I say to my colleagues, having a letter which was generated last year \nin my support for trying not to increase the funding--which was said \nthat wasn't adequate, that we needed funding--now the fact that you \nrefused to fund something you promised to fund and say it will get done \nanyway does not speak very well of our effort in that behalf.\n  It is my hope the Senate will look hard and long at this. You cannot \nhave it both ways. You cannot say you need to authorize funding, we \nneed to have funding, and send out a press release saying you \nauthorized $15 million a year for the next few years to do something \nand then have a chance to fund it and not fund it and say we didn't \nneed to authorize the funding in the first place. It is hypocritical, \nin my opinion, and my hope is we will give great and concerted \nconsideration to my amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. ENSIGN. Mr. President, very soon I am going to talk about an \namendment I want to offer on the DC Voucher Program for low-income \nkids. But first I want to talk about the bill in general for a few \nminutes.\n  Yesterday, I talked about the spending bill we have before us as \nbeing 8 percent over spending from last year on various programs that \nare contained within the bill.\n  We just had Secretary of Treasury Geithner before the Senate Finance \nCommittee. I asked him a question. I said: I applaud the President for \nhosting a fiscal responsibility summit just last week at the White \nHouse. I think that was a great thing. It set some very important goals \nfor us to be fiscally responsible to the next generation. I told him \nthis administration had an opportunity to say these are last years \nbills, drafted under a different administration. But rather, they said, \nwe are going to look the other way; we are not going to hold to our \n``no earmarks'' pledge or fiscal responsibility pledge on this bill, we \nare going to do that on future things.\n  But the problem is, it is not just this bill that increases spending \nby 8 percent. This bill gets added into the baseline. This extra $23 \nbillion gets added into this year's baseline, which means that next \nyear's the baseline goes up and the budget for the next year after that \ngoes up, and up and up, so this $23 billion increase in federal \nspending ends up being several hundred billion over 10 years. That is \nnot what we should be doing now.\n  We have entitlements that are going to be exploding. Every family in \nAmerica today is looking for ways to cut their budget. We are hearing \nthat the movie industry is actually doing pretty well right now because \npeople are saying: That is actually a little luxury I can afford, \nbecause they can't afford some of the bigger luxuries they wanted. \nInstead of buying cars or big-purchase items, they are buying smaller \nthings. That is why Wal-Mart seems to be doing well at this point. \nPeople are looking for values.\n  Businesses across the country are looking to cut expenses. They are \nlooking to cut wasteful spending. Every bureaucracy, whether it is \nprivate or public, grows over time, so businesses are looking for ways \nto be able to handle these tough economic times.\n  Local governments and State governments are forced to live within a \nbudget. So what are they doing? They are making tough choices right \nnow. Even with the money the Federal Government sent them, they are \nstill having to make difficult choices, so they are looking for what \nwasteful spending is out there and what ways they can cut back on \nwaste.\n  The one place that seems immune to cutting wasteful spending is the \nFederal Government, and the people responsible for that are right here \nin this Chamber and in the Chamber across the Capitol. We control the \npurse strings. This is not a time for us to increase spending. This is \na time for us to ask every Federal agency, department, program out \nthere: How can you save money right now? How can you cut administrative \ncosts? Which programs are duplicative? Which programs are working and \nwhich ones are not? Let's take the money away from the programs that \nare less efficient right now, let's cut back on bureaucracy instead of \nexpanding the bureaucracy at this point. I would say this is really an \nirresponsible moment for this Congress.\n  I applaud two Members from the other side of the aisle, Senator Evan \nBayh and Senator Russ Feingold. They have come out in opposition to \nthis bill because they said pretty much the same things I was saying \nthis morning. Senator Evan Bayh from Indiana wrote a great opinion \neditorial today in the Wall Street Journal laying out why this is an \nirresponsible bill and why he is going to be opposing it.\n  If we are going to care about our children and our grandchildren, we \ncannot wait a year or 2 years. We need to be fiscally responsible \ntoday. We should have been doing it in the past years as well. I agree \nthere has been irresponsible spending in this body by both sides of the \naisle and by the previous administration, but that is no excuse for us \nto say we can just continue it.\n  Federal spending has been rising and rising, much of it off budget. I \nagree with the Democrats when they criticize Republicans in the \nprevious administration for off-budget spending. I have been one of the \npeople up here saying the tricks we were playing with the budget on \ndefense were dishonest. They were trying to say they were not \nincreasing spending because it would take money away from defense, \nknowing it would be added on later so they could increase other \nspending bills. That was dishonest. That was dishonest budgeting, and \nit is time to get to honest budgeting.\n  But it is also not just honest budgeting we need to get to. We need \nto get to fiscal responsibility. So really take a look at what we are \ndoing here. Think about the next generation and\n\n[[Page S2736]]\n\nfuture generations. Do we really want to add this kind of debt burden, \nwhere they have to pay hundreds of billions of dollars and even \ntrillions of dollars in interest just because we were unwilling to take \ntough votes here in the Senate?\n  The second issue I wish to talk about is the issue of DC choice. The \nschools in Washington, DC, are some of the worst schools in America. We \nbrought this issue up last week, and we were able to get an agreement \nthat, instead of having a vote on the DC voting rights bill, the \nmajority leader would give us time on the Senate floor to reauthorize \nthe program. It is a program that says for very low income kids in the \nDistrict of Columbia, we are going to experiment and see if maybe we \ncan give them a decent education.\n  The District of Columbia spends around $15,000 a year per student on \npublic school education. We said we will give them a $7,500 voucher \ntowards the ability to go to a private school, a school of their \nchoice. The number of people who want to get into this program is \nincredible. Why? Because DC schools are failing too many children. DC \nschools are mostly made up of minorities, and we are trapping those \nvery minorities into a school system that by and large does not work. \nSo the DC voucher system was put in to at least take a few of those \nstudents out and see if they can do better in a different setting. Does \nit work? Some people say we are not measuring it right. All you have to \ndo to know whether it works or not is to talk to the parents and to the \nstudents who have been involved in the program. Guess what. They want \nit to continue. As a matter of fact, they would like to see it expand. \nBut what are we doing? This bill all but guarantees its elimination. \nHow does it do that? If this language is not removed from the omnibus \nthe program would be effectively cut. The omnibus contains language to \neliminate the program after the 2009-10 school year unless congress \nreauthorizes it and DC City Council approves it. We know where the \nvotes are on the DC City Council. The votes on the DC City Council \nwould kill the program. The teachers unions in the District of \nColumbia, as they are in most cases, are totally opposed to any kind of \nvoucher system. They believe it is a threat to their power base.\n  I am concerned about the kids and their education. That is all I am \nconcerned about. If this program is going to work--and it seems to be \nworking based on the interest of the number of families who want in it \nand based on the desire of the families who are in it to continue in \nit--then that is what we should be concerned about.\n  I am going to be offering an amendment that would strike the language \nin the omnibus bill and would allow us to authorize it this year in the \nSenate. That is the right thing to do, to make sure these kids still \nhave a chance to get a good education in the United States.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa is recognized.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak in opposition \nto an amendment offered by the Senator from Oklahoma, who singles out \ntwo instances of congressionally directed funding that were included in \nthe fiscal year 2009 Omnibus appropriations bill under my name. The \nSenator has claimed that these earmarks are inappropriate or wasteful \nand should be removed from the bill. One provides $5.7 million for \ncompetitive school modernization grants in my State of Iowa. The other \nprovides $1.8 million for national research into swine odor and manure \nmanagement at the Soil Tilth Laboratory in Ames, Iowa.\n  At the outset, as a constitutional matter, I first take issue with \nthe premise underlying the amendment of the Senator, the idea that \nCongress has no business directing the expenditure of Federal moneys \nthrough congressionally directed funding; that somehow there is \nsomething inherently wrong or evil in this practice and that only the \nexecutive branch should determine the details of where moneys are to be \nspent. This stands the Constitution on its head. Article I, section 9, \nexpressly gives Congress the power of the purse, both to collect \nmoneys--levy taxes--and to direct where that money is to go. I would \nsay that the Executive, the President of the United States, does not \nhave the constitutional authority to spend one single dime of our \ntaxpayers' money. That authority has been given to the President, the \nexecutive branch, over the last 200 years by the Congress, but there is \nno constitutional basis for the President spending any money. So, \ntherefore, that is inherently a constitutional function of the \nCongress. At any moment, at any time, if we want to, we can pass \nlegislation taking all that money back here and saying the President \ncannot spend a dime unless we say so. We do not want to do that, \nobviously. But we could. We would be in our constitutional right to do \nso. So there is not something inherently wrong with Congress directing \nfunding. In fact, I would say it is more appropriate for Congress to do \nthat than for the President.\n  It is an odd practice--if the President requests it in the budget, it \nis not an earmark, but if we put it in, it is an earmark.\n  Someone please tell me the logic of that. So, again, I basically \ndisagree with sort of the underlying premise that somehow executive \nbranch employees, all those bureaucrats, have a much better \nunderstanding of where and how Federal funds should be spent most \neffectively in our States and in our districts.\n  Now, again, over the years we have permitted that to happen, but we, \nthrough our oversight functions, can look at how that money is being \nspent, and through our congressionally directed funding can decide how \nsome of that is spent. So it is not a constitutional issue. It is not a \nconstitutional issue, at least as far as Congress goes, as far as \ndirecting where spending should be made.\n  But I want to talk about these two earmarks mentioned, both of which \naddress significant needs both nationally and in my State of Iowa. I \nwill talk about the second earmark, funding research into swine odor \nand manure management later in my remarks.\n  I want to say at the outset, I am proud of both of those earmarks or \ncongressionally directed spending, and I stand behind them. I believe \nthe Senator from Oklahoma's attempt to strike them from the bill is \nextremely shortsighted and misguided, quite frankly.\n  So let me spend a few minutes discussing why I included these items \nin the bill. Let me start first with the $5.7 million for competitive \nschool modernization grants. For years I have argued that the genius of \nour education system in America is its diversity; local school \ndistricts deciding what is taught, what books to buy, what teachers to \nhire, how to run their schools. We do not have, as some other countries \nhave, a top-down structure where the central government decides exactly \nwhat is to be taught, how it is to be taught, and everybody gets the \nsame thing. I have been to those countries. A lot of them tout their \neducational system. But, quite frankly, it does not have the kind of \ncreativity and diversity and spontaneity that our diversified education \nhas in this country. So that is the genius of the American system of \neducation.\n  The failure of the American education system is how we pay for it. I \nwish someone would show me somewhere in the Constitution where it says \nthat elementary and secondary education in America is to be paid for by \nproperty taxes. You will look and you will not find it anywhere in the \nConstitution. So why do we do it that way?\n  Well, I delved into the history of this, and it kind of goes like \nthis: In the early days of the founding of our country, before we were \na nation, in the Colonies, people wanted to have a free public \neducation. Well, it was free for white males at that time, but, \nnonetheless, free. But since we had no taxing system other than tariffs \nand property taxes, that was the only way they could pay for it. So \ntariffs and property taxes became the support mechanism for local \nschools in the Colonies, and that kind of continued on. It continued \non. The tariffs went by the wayside, so then it became a property tax-\nbased function for paying for elementary and secondary schools in \nAmerica. The first time the Federal Government ever got involved in \neducation in any way whatsoever was in 1864 with Morrill, the bill that \nLincoln signed for setting up land grant colleges and universities. \nThat was the first time, and that was only higher education. That was \nhigher education.\n\n[[Page S2737]]\n\n  The next time the Federal Government got involved in education was \nalmost 100 years later. It was after World War II when we set up the GI \nbill to pay for our young veterans to go to college, and then that was \nhigher education.\n  Then we had the Eisenhower program, the National Defense Student Loan \nProgram in the 1950s. Again, higher education. The first time the \nFederal Government ever got involved in elementary and secondary \neducation was title I, providing some Federal help to low-income \nschools to try to help right this imbalance out there.\n  Then we had the Education of the Handicapped Children's Act, which \nlater became IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. So \nthe Federal Government has not been involved--well, unless you want to \ntake the School Lunch Program. The School Lunch Program and breakfast \ncame along later, but the School Lunch Program, which came in after \nWorld War II as a feeding program, not as an educational program. I \nforgot to mention that.\n  So the Federal Government's involvement in elementary and secondary \neducation has been as of late and very small, only title I, and \nbasically IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act.\n  Jonathan Kozol wrote a book in the eighties called ``Savage \nInequality,'' and this was the savage inequality: What he talked about \nis how he traveled around America and how he found there were some \ngreat schools and great facilities in one place, and very bad schools \nwith bad facilities in another place. He asked the question why. Why is \nthis? Well, it was because if you happened to be born and raised in \nFairfax County, for example, where there is a high income level and \nvery high property taxes, you get great schools. If you are born and \nraised in Bedford-Stuyvesant, or in inner city south Los Angeles, or in \nsome rural areas of Iowa or Missouri or Oklahoma, Kansas, chances are \nyou got very low property taxes and you got poor schools.\n  So he asked the question, and then I asked the question: Why should \nwhere you are born, the circumstances of your birth and where you are \nraised, why should that be determinative of the quality of the physical \nschool you have? Why should that determine it? That is the savage \ninequality of our educational system.\n  Well, I began thinking about this some years ago on how we would kind \nof right this system, how we would tend to solve this imbalance, on the \none hand by not interfering with the genius of the American school \nsystem, which is, who is hired and who is fired, who teaches, what they \nteach, the textbooks, all that, how do we not interfere with that, but \nat the same time try to balance these savage inequalities.\n  Then one day it occurred to me. I was walking out of my office one \nday. This is many years ago, back in the late eighties. And I have on \nmy wall, right by the door that goes out of my office, a framed piece \nof paper. It is a little orange card. It has always been there. I have \nalways kept it there to remind me of something. It is my father's WPA \ncard, when he worked on the WPA in the 1930s.\n  It occurred to me that when I was a teenager, my father took me to \nvisit Lake Ahquabi, which is a lake south of Des Moines, which is now \nstill being used as a recreational lake. They built that; still being \nused today.\n  He took me to visit a high school, Cornerstone, WPA, 1940, that he \nhad worked on; still being used today. I dare say there are schools all \nover America that are still being used, built by the WPA. Finally it \noccurred to me that perhaps one role the Federal Government could take \nin helping to balance these savage inequalities of rich areas versus \npoor areas in terms of the quality of the school facilities is to be \ninvolved in modernizing and building new schools and getting the \ntechnology into these schools. That way you do not interfere with who \nis hired, who is fired, what is taught, what textbooks to buy. You are \nonly helping to build new schools. We did that in the 1930s and we have \nbeen using a lot of these schools ever since.\n  So I might add, as an aside, that when I sought the nomination of my \nparty for President in 1991 and 1992, this was one of my platforms. I \ntalked about the need to invest in the infrastructure. I called it the \nblueprint for America. On my document I had a picture of a blueprint. \nPart of it was building and remodernizing schools through the Federal \ntaxing system, rather than relying on property taxes.\n  Well, I didn't win the Presidency, obviously, but I continued in that \nendeavor. I could not quite get it through, although we did have 1 year \nfinally we got it through. In 2000, the last year of the Clinton \nadministration, we got $1 billion for a national program of modernizing \nand helping to modernize schools. That was reduced down to about $800 \nmillion. It went out 1 year. The next year President Bush came in and \nthe program got ended. So we did have 1 year of it and, quite frankly, \nthat 1 year, that money went out quite well and did a lot of \ninnovative, good things with schools all over America.\n  Since I could not get the Federal Government to do this in the \nbroader basis, I decided to see what would happen in my State of Iowa \nif we started doing this, what would happen, how would this work. So \nsince 1998, I have been fortunate to secure funding for my State's \nschools in this regard.\n  The actual allocations are funds are not made by me, they are made by \nthe Iowa Department of Education, which undertakes a grant competition \nto select the most worthy and needy school districts that receive these \ngrants for a range of renovation and repair efforts. There are kinds of \npots. One pot is for fire and safety, which requires no match. The \nother is for building and renovation which does require a local match.\n\n  Now, I might say that since 1998 this Federal funding has leveraged \npublic and private funding so the dollars that have gone out there have \nmultiplied tremendously. I think my colleague called the funding unfair \nand wrong. He believes it is unfair that Iowa's schools receive funding \nwhile children elsewhere in the United States are forced to learn in \nantiquated, crumbling school buildings.\n  Well, I agree with my friend from Oklahoma. He is correct in one \nrespect. There is indeed a persistent and unfair disparity in the \nquality of schools across the country, the savage inequalities, I just \nmentioned. Jonathan Kozol wrote the book about it in the 1980s.\n  In fact, for the last several years, local spending on school \nfacilities in affluent communities is almost twice as high as in our \npoorest communities.\n  So I ask the question again, why should the circumstances of your \nbirth, where you are born and where you are raised, determine the \nquality of the school you go to? Why should it? So we tried to \nalleviate this imbalance. Sure, you want every State in the Nation to \nhave this. As I said to my friend from Oklahoma, he may not have heard \nthis, in this year 2000, we did get it through for every State. But \nthat was only 1 year, and then in 2001 the Bush administration came in \nand stopped it. But in that 1 year, it did go out.\n  Now, again, and most recently in the stimulus bill, in the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act, we did in the Senate put in $16 billion \nfor school construction and renovation to go out all over America. I \nwas happy about that. I thought this was something that would put \npeople to work, stimulate the economy and build schools for our kids, \nget new technology into our schools.\n  Well, because of opposition on that side, that was stricken from the \nbill. In the conference it was stricken. So, again, I do not mean to \nhave this only for Iowa, I would love to do this for the entire United \nStates.\n  So again, if I could not do it there, at least I wanted to see what \nwould happen in the State of Iowa. And I can tell you that over the \nyears, each Federal dollar that has gone into my State for this has \nleveraged an additional $5-plus additional from public and private \nsources.\n  How does that happen? Well, a lot of times school districts would try \nto pass a bond issue. They could not pass it to renovate or something, \nbecause they are poor people, you know, and this means raising property \ntaxes. We have a lot of elderly in Iowa. Raising property taxes is hard \nwhen they are on a fixed income.\n  So they don't vote for the bond issues. All of a sudden they applied \nfor one of these competitive grants to the\n\n[[Page S2738]]\n\nDepartment of Education in the State of Iowa. The State of Iowa gave \nthem a grant, but they had to match. Guess what happened. They passed \nthe bond issue and built new schools. It has leveraged private \ninvolvement, people with businesses, endowments, and even individuals \nwho have come forward to put money into local schools because they had \nthis grant.\n  I ask unanimous consent to print in the Record some letters I \nreceived. One is from Paula Vincent, superintendent of the Clear Creek \nAmana School District. She points out that receipt of a school \nconstruction grant was instrumental in her district passing a $2.5 \nmillion bond referendum to build two new schools. Prior to receiving \nthe grant, her district did not have a history of passing bond \nreferendums for school improvement. Not only did this bond referendum \npass on the first vote, but it broke records for voter turnout and has \nled to additional support for school infrastructure from surrounding \ncommunities. She estimates that an initial $100,000 grant led to an \nadditional $28 million in local funding to improve school buildings. \nThat is way over 5 to 1. That may be an anomaly, but that is what she \nsays happened in their area.\n  I have other letters from individuals on these grants and what it has \ndone.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                 Clear Creek Amana\n\n\n                                    Community School District,\n\n                                        Oxford, IA, March 3, 2009.\n     Hon. Tom Harkin,\n     First Ave. NE,\n     Cedar Rapids, IA.\n       Dear Senator Harkin, Thank you for your continual advocacy \n     for facility construction and renovation. As you know, Clear \n     Creek Amana was fortunate to receive one of the Iowa \n     Demonstration Construction Grants to aid in the construction \n     of a new elementary school.\n       This half million dollar Harkin grant was helpful to our \n     district in successfully passing a twenty-five and a half \n     million dollar general obligation bond referendum to build \n     two new schools. In Iowa, school districts must receive a \n     super majority, sixty percent approval, to pass any bond \n     issues. Our community did not have a history of passing bond \n     referendums for school improvement prior to this latest \n     attempt and had never passed a bond referendum on the first \n     vote. Not only did the community approve the bond referendum \n     on the first vote, but also broke previous voter turnout \n     records. The federal support was one of the factors members \n     of our community listed as a reason they voted in favor of \n     the proposed bond referendum.\n       The positive success of the bond referendum led to \n     additional community support from cities within the school \n     district boundaries. For example, the City of North Liberty \n     provided land for the new elementary school, street and \n     utility access to the construction site and an additional \n     half million dollars toward the construction of the new \n     elementary school. Likewise, the city of Tiffin and the Iowa \n     Department of Transportation are partnering with the district \n     to widen the highway leading to the new high school. Using \n     conservative estimates, the half million dollars of federal \n     support leveraged an additional twenty-eight million dollars \n     to improve the school facilities within the Clear Creek Amana \n     District.\n       Having resources to construct new buildings allowed us to \n     take advantage of the latest information regarding excellent \n     school design. With the assistance of our architects and \n     engineers and the cooperation of students, staff and \n     community members we are confident that our new schools will \n     provide improved learning environments for CCA students and \n     staff. A few of our design features include: increased \n     student and staff access to technology; updated science labs \n     and equipment; flexible teaching and learning spaces with \n     planned areas for small and large group instruction; common \n     areas for teacher teams to plan, and study together; shared \n     school and community spaces such as preschool, library/media \n     center, physical fitness areas, before and after school space \n     and shared gym space; and added safety features such as \n     controlled building access with limited exterior door entry \n     points, electronic door controls and sprinkler systems.\n       Again, federal support through the school construction \n     grants played a key role in making these improvements to the \n     overall safety and quality of the learning environment in our \n     schools possible.\n       Federal school construction dollars also have a positive \n     impact on environmental concerns. We were able to incorporate \n     multiple energy saving features into the design of the new \n     buildings by participation in the Commercial New Construction \n     Program provided by the Weidt Group, Minnetonka, Minnesota, \n     and funded by the local utility companies.\n       The benefits of building an energy efficient building \n     include a cash rebate from the utility companies of about \n     $250,000 as well as lower operational costs for the lifetime \n     of the new buildings. Many of the selected energy strategies \n     also contribute to the quality of the learning environment \n     (natural lighting, temperature controls in each classroom). \n     We believe these energy-efficient strategies add significant \n     investment value to the buildings and minimize many negative \n     environmental impacts typically caused by new construction.\n       We have experienced a significant benefit from a modest \n     federal investment in school infrastructure. We have every \n     reason to believe our students will benefit from the improved \n     learning environment in our new schools and we expect we will \n     see some of this benefit in higher student achievement. \n     Higher achievement by our nation's children ultimately \n     translates to a brighter future for all of us when these \n     children take their place as contributing members of the \n     workforce and of the educated citizenry essential for a \n     democratic society.\n       Thank you for your work in including school infrastructure \n     support in Federal legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Paula Vincent,\n     Superintendent.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                    Corning Community Schools,\n\n                                       Corning, IA, March 3, 2009.\n     Senator Tom Harkin,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Harkin, With all due respect, I would like to \n     express my concern about an amendment that has been offered \n     to eliminate the Harkin Fire Safety Grants. I am the \n     superintendent of Corning Community Schools in southwest \n     Iowa. Our school is located in Adams County which is one of \n     the poorest areas, of not only our state, but of the country. \n     Our local patrons are willing, but unable, to raise enough \n     funds to maintain our school facilities which were built in \n     the 1930s. It is only through the Harkin Fire Safety Grants \n     that we are able to keep our facilities open and provide a \n     safe environment for our children to work and play in. The \n     Harkin grants have allowed us to make our buildings \n     handicapped accessible, so all children are given equal \n     opportunity to attend classes on the second and third floor \n     of our facility. The Harkin grants have created an equal \n     playing field so the children of our district have the same \n     safe environments as wealthier districts. The Harkin Fire \n     Safety Grants have provided handicapped doors, fire alarm \n     systems, warning devices, and fire safe doors. Without these \n     funds our school would have been closed down and children \n     would have been forced to travel long distances to other \n     schools.\n       I truly applaud your efforts in providing these funds for \n     schools. Considering all of the foolish ways the government \n     spends money, I can't believe that anyone would want to end \n     this program. The Harkin Fire Safety Grants provide funds \n     that are making a difference in the lives of children. What \n     could be better? I encourage you to continue the good fight \n     for the poor people of Iowa. I encourage you to continue to \n     fight the shifting of funds to ``bail-out'' private \n     businesses at the expense of our children and the future of \n     this great nation. If there is anything I can do to help \n     preserve these funds, please let me know. On behalf of the \n     Corning Community School District, the patrons of Adams \n     County, and most of all the children of our district, we \n     thank you for these funds.\n           Respectfully,\n                                                       Mike Wells,\n     Superintendent.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                              Des Moines Public School System,\n\n                                    Des Moines, IA, March 3, 2009.\n       Dear Senator Harkin, As a member of the Des Moines School \n     Board I would like to thank you for all the work you have \n     done to enable our school system to receive Harkin Grants. \n     Without them our urban school district would be lagging \n     behind in both infrastructure and fire safety needs.\n       The Des Moines Public School System is an urban school \n     district with a free and reduced lunch rate above 50 percent. \n     We have received a total of 8 Harkin Grants in the amount of \n     $4.275 million dollars. We have used the Harkin Grants in a \n     number of our buildings. For example, we have been able to \n     use the infrastructure portion of the Harkin Grants to add to \n     our renovations at Moulton School, Capitol View Elementary \n     and Carver Elementary. All three of these schools have a free \n     and reduced lunch rate over 79 percent. The Harkin Grants \n     have helped to bring 21st century buildings to students of \n     all economic backgrounds. Harkin Grants have also been used \n     to help Des Moines East High School with its renovation \n     expansion to meet the needs of its urban population. We have \n     also received Harkin Grants for renovations at one of our \n     downtown schools. Without this funding our urban school \n     district would be lagging behind our suburban counterparts.\n       Our nearly 30,000 students have also become safer at school \n     through the fire safety component of the Harkin Grants. That \n     portion has been instrumental in allowing us to keep our \n     children safer in a school district that does not have the \n     resources of many suburban schools. They have helped to bring \n     our buildings to a superior level of safety.\n       In conclusion, as a board member of the Des Moines Public \n     School System, I would like you to know how important your \n     Harkin Grants have been in renovating some of our high \n     poverty schools and in keeping all our students safe. \n     Programs like the Harkin Grants have helped us immensely. You \n     will never know how much these grants mean to\n\n[[Page S2739]]\n\n     an urban system like the Des Moines Public Schools.\n           Gratefully yours,\n                                                    Patty J. Link,\n                                     Director, Board of Education.\n\n  Mr. HARKIN. Rather than trying to deprive the schoolchildren in Iowa \nof this funding, I encourage the Senator from Oklahoma to extend this \nprogram to his own State and to all other States and the District of \nColumbia. In the coming weeks, I will reintroduce the Public School \nRepair and Renovation Act, which I have been introducing for some time, \nwhich would create a competitive grant program for schools across \nAmerica to receive funds to repair and renovate school facilities based \nupon the successful program we have had in Iowa. Were some mistakes \nmade in the beginning? Yes. But the Department of Education, over the \nlast 10 years, has figured out how to do this, how to separate the two \npots--one for fire and safety with no match requirements, one for \nbuildings and innovation requiring a match--and then taking in the \nproposals on a competitive basis and deciding where the money should \ngo. I encourage the Senator from Oklahoma to support this bill. I ask \nhim to be an original cosponsor to get this out to schools all over the \ncountry.\n  Now let me also talk about the $1.8 million I secured in this bill \nfor research into swine odor and manure management. That always brings \na smile to everyone's face. David Letterman will be talking about it \nand Jay Leno will be talking about it, $1.8 million to study why pigs \nsmell. I suppose that is the way they will couch it. We all know how \nthe game is played. Critics will take something such as this with a \nfunny sounding name or purpose, hold it up for ridicule. For some \nreason, especially outside rural America, the very word ``manure'' \nseems to be cause for laughter and levity and jokes. In farm country, \nmanure and odor management are profoundly serious challenges that can \nbe mitigated through scientific research. I urge the Senator to visit \nfarms in his own State. Ask his own farmers and neighbors about whether \nit is worthwhile to conduct research into animal odor and manure \nmanagement.\n  If I am not mistaken--and I may be--I believe the attorney general of \nOklahoma, a few years ago, brought an action against the neighboring \nState of Arkansas in terms of some of the effluent coming into Oklahoma \nand this raised questions of manure management and how it is put on the \nland and such. That is what this research is about. Some people living \nin rural America are concerned about livestock agriculture and its \nenvironmental impacts. So it makes good sense to fund research that \naddresses how rural communities and livestock agriculture can coexist.\n  I wish to point out this item did not originate as a congressionally \ndirected earmark. This research unit of the Agriculture Research \nService originated administratively within the U.S. Department of \nAgriculture to conduct scientific research to address significant \nchallenges facing livestock agriculture. This item is only included as \nan earmark now because the last Bush budget proposed to terminate a \nnumber of ongoing agricultural research projects in order to come in at \na lower funding level, knowing full well this needed research would \nlikely be restored by Congress, which is what we are doing. But it \ndidn't originate here in Congress. It originated administratively.\n  Let me also point out to the Senator from Oklahoma, this is not a \nproject for the State of Iowa. It provides funding for the Agricultural \nResearch Service which is the main in-house research arm of the U.S. \nDepartment of Agriculture. The mission of ARS is ``to find solutions to \nagricultural problems that affect Americans every day from field to \ntable.''\n  One might say the money is going out to ARS in Iowa. That is because \nthat is where they do the research. If ARS was doing research on \npeanuts, they would probably be doing it at an ARS research facility in \nGeorgia. If they were doing it on cotton, they would be doing it in \nMississippi or someplace not in Iowa. So why are they doing it in Iowa? \nBecause one-fourth of all the hogs in America are produced in my State. \nWe are the No. 1 producer of pork, and we are very proud of it. The \npork industry is critical to our State's economy. But as the demand has \ngrown for pork and as we produce more pork, one can understand that the \nmanagement problems of what to do with the waste has become very \nserious, not only for the odor problems but for the waste itself.\n  At any given day, we have 20 million hogs living in Iowa. Think about \nit, 20 million. A lot of farmers use the the manure from hogs as \nfertilizer. The Department of Agriculture, soil scientists, and others \nhave encouraged that. But there can be odor problems and other \nenvironmental impacts. So that is what this research seeks to resolve. \nIt looks at improving nutrient or feed efficiency in swine. This \nresearch would help the livestock industry make better use of co-\nproducts from the production of biofuels, which is a growing industry \nin our State and the Nation. Quite frankly, we can't feed the \nbyproducts to swine like we can cows. They are not a ruminant animal. \nBut this research is looking at how to improve those byproducts for \nswine--everything from the feed to the byproducts and odor--to improve \nthe quality of life for those who live in rural areas. We have had \nswine odor and manure management challenges in my State. And not only \nin Iowa; as chairman of the Agriculture Committee, I have visited North \nCarolina and have witnessed the same issues there too. So how do we \nalleviate this? How do we make it possible for a very good industry, \nthe swine industry, to meet the demand and at the same time be good \nneighbors and do it in an environmentally sound way? That is what this \nmoney is for. The research doesn't only help Iowa it helps all across \nthe country because it is research conducted by the Agricultural \nResearch Service. They are doing it in Iowa because that is where most \nof the hogs are. Congress didn't originate it here. It originated with \nthe administration.\n  A lot of States share the same problem we do with odor and waste \nproblems. I suppose we will hear a lot of jokes on David Letterman and \nJay Leno. A lot of other people will be making jokes about this money \nfor manure. Keep in mind, this is not wasteful or unnecessary or \nfrivolous. This is very important to the daily lives of the people of \nmy State and every other place where we raise swine.\n  I appreciate this opportunity to share with my colleagues my reasons \nfor including these two items in the Omnibus appropriations bill. I \nstand here and say, unequivocally, I am proud of both of them. I \nbelieve the effort to remove them from the bill is misguided. I urge \ncolleagues to vote against the Coburn amendment.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Madam President, it is interesting, the first of the \nSenator's remarks had to do with the Constitution. He conveniently \nskipped over article I, section 8, and went straight to article I, \nsection 9. If you read what Madison and the Founders wrote about \narticle I, section 9, they had a very limited scope for what we ought \nto be doing. As a matter of fact, the trouble we find ourselves in \ntoday is because we have abandoned the enumerated powers of the \nConstitution. We have excused them and we have said: We should fund it \nall.\n  As far as education, Federal funds fund 20 percent of education but \n80 percent of the problems. If you think our schools are successful, \nlook at our scores compared to everywhere else in the world. Our scores \nstarted going down when the Federal Government started getting involved \nin education, not prior.\n  The other assumption is, you have to have a great building to have a \ngreat education. That is absolutely wrong. Education is based on the \nincentive of the children, the quality of the teacher, and the control \nof discipline. You can teach as well in a Quonset hut as you can the \nmost modern school, if you have motivated kids, great teachers, and \ngreat control of the classroom.\n  The purpose for trying to eliminate these earmarks isn't necessarily \nthat they are wrong. They are truly unauthorized, but that would be a \ntotally different story if a group of peers had said these are \npriorities, but they haven't. The problem is, is it a priority now, \nwhen every penny you will use, whether it is the new school program you \nwant me to cosign or the earmarks\n\n[[Page S2740]]\n\nyou have in the bill today, is going to be borrowed from your \ngrandchildren.\n  The very schools you are going to build in Iowa, that we are not \ngoing to build in the rest of the country, by leveraging Federal \ndollars are going to be charged to the kids of the kids who are there. \nThey are going to pay for it. It is not about whether it is right or \nwrong; it is about whether it is a priority, whether we ought to be \ndoing it now.\n  The Agricultural Research Service is a fine organization. Every time \nwe need money for agriculture, we steal money from the Agricultural \nResearch Service. There is nothing wrong with studying manure and its \napplication as both a fertilizer, soil enhancer, and other things. \nThere is nothing wrong with studying the other aspect of the odor. We \nslaughter 10,000 hogs a day in one plant in Oklahoma. I know exactly \nwhat it smells like. I have traveled every farm area in my State. As a \nmatter of fact, to me a lot of it smells pretty good compared to what \nyou smell in the cities. But the fact is, is it a priority that we \nspend that money now?\n  The real problem we have isn't earmarks. It is two: One is, we give \nthis document short shrift; No. 2, we have become parochialized. We \nforget what our oath was that we signed when we came in here, to uphold \nthe Constitution, to do the right things for this country as a whole in \nthe long term and do the best things we can for the future of the \nchildren who follow. But what we have turned into is what can we take \nhome; how do we look good at home; how do we send Federal dollars home.\n  The reason the stimulus bill was bad is because we took the lack of \nfiscal discipline in this body and we transferred it to every State \nhouse in the country. Ask any Governor what is happening now that we \nhave passed the stimulus. The hard choices will not be made in the \nStates. So the future prospect for fiscal discipline in the States is \nnow gone. The next time they have problems, they will be counting on \nus. We have now transferred our bad habit of being fiscally \nirresponsible to the States.\n  I think it is ridiculous that at this time in our Nation, when we are \ngoing to have a $1.7 trillion deficit, we would spend the first penny \non anything other than a necessity because when we have a $1.6 trillion \ndeficit, it is not just $1.6 trillion, it is $1.6 trillion we are going \nto borrow over the next 30 years, and we are going to be paying awfully \nhigh interest rates. It is not very long--2015--when we are going to be \nat 40 percent of the budget going to interest. There will not be a \nHarkin school program for Iowa in 2015 because there will not be any \nmoney. We will not be able to borrow any more money because the \ninterest rates and the cost to borrow it will be too high because the \nrest of the world will doubt whether we can pay back the money.\n  So the prudence I am asking for in trying to eliminate some of the \nearmarks is to think about the long term rather than the short term, to \nthink about what is best for our country in the long term, not what is \nbest for us and how we look at home, and to do what is within the \nframework of the Constitution.\n  The final point I will make: Presidential earmarks ought to have \nexactly the same dealing as we do with congressional earmarks--get them \nauthorized, put them in a list of priorities, and then fund them. But \ndo not send an earmark to the floor that is not authorized by the \nCongress and the relevant committee it comes through.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Iowa.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Madam President, I appreciate the engagement by my friend \nfrom Oklahoma on this issue. But I will point out, first of all, one \nlittle mistake I think the Senator might have made. The research for \nthe ARS for the swine research is well within the authorization the \nAgriculture Committee provided in the farm bill. It is well within \ntheir purview. So it is not outside their purview whatsoever. Again, I \nsay the reason we put it in there: It has been administratively asked \nfor before, but the Bush administration in the last year did not \ninclude it because they wanted to cut down their request, knowing full \nwell we would probably fund it, which we have done here. But I just \nwanted to point that out.\n  Interestingly, the Senator mentioned article I, section 8, of the \nConstitution. Article I, section 8, of the Constitution, I would point \nout, is very clear:\n\n       The Congress shall have Power To lay and collect Taxes, \n     Duties, Imposts and Excises, to pay the Debts and provide for \n     the Defense and general Welfare of the United \n     States. . .;\n       To borrow money on the credit of the United States;. . . .\n\n  Et cetera, et cetera.\n  Well, Congress--Congress, it says--has the power and authority to \nprovide for the general welfare and to borrow money. I do not like to \nborrow money more than anyone else. But the Senator from Oklahoma said \nsomething about: Well, the money we are using to build these schools is \nborrowing from our grandchildren. I cannot think of a better thing to \nborrow from our grandchildren than to build better schools. As I \npointed out, my father worked on WPA. I have his WPA card hanging on \nthe wall of my office. They built schools all over America, schools \nwhich we are still using today. In fact, one of the Iowa Department of \nEducation grants went to a middle school--it used to be a high school--\nit is a middle school that was built by WPA and had been in such \ndisrepair, but the building itself was sound. They just had an old \nheating plant. Kids were getting sick. It was cold and drafty in the \nwintertime. They got a grant. They came in. They put in a new \ngeothermal heating system. They put in double-paned windows. Here is a \nschool built by WPA in 1939 and, with just a little bit more money, \ntoday is going to be used for another 50 more years for kids. So I say, \nif we are going to borrow from our grandchildren, let's build them \nbetter schools so the kids today will be better educated and will make \nmore money and so our grandchildren will be better off.\n  Lastly, my friend from Oklahoma says that better buildings do not \nlead to better schools. He said: You could learn in Quonset huts, you \ncould have a better education in a Quonset hut, I guess, than in some \nof our better schools. Well, I do not know how to respond to that. If \nyou have a Quonset hut, are you going to have the up-to-date, latest \ntechnology in terms of the Internet? Probably not. Are you going to \nhave up-to-date technology in terms of a science lab? Probably not. \nPhysics lab? Probably not. Biology lab? Probably not. So what kind of \neducation are you going to get in that Quonset hut? If we are sending \nour kids to school in Quonset huts, what are we telling them about how \nwe value education? I daresay the nicest things that our kids should \nsee in their daily lives ought to be where they go to school. They \nought to be the brightest, the best lit, the best built, with the \nlatest technology, with the best teachers and the best material. Then \nwe are saying to our kids: Here is what we value.\n  So I could not disagree more with my friend from Oklahoma that kids \nwill learn as well in a Quonset hut as they can in a nice building. All \nyou have to do is look at the test scores of kids from schools that are \nin areas where they have high property taxes, a lot of wealth. Just \nlook at those test scores and look at the scores of the kids who come \nfrom your poverty areas and rural areas. I do not mean just inner city \nbut rural poverty areas. Look at their test scores. That will tell you \nsomething right there. Why? They cannot afford to hire the best \nteachers. They cannot afford to pay more for their teachers. They \ncannot afford to have the best laboratory and equipment and Internet \ntechnology for our kids.\n  So I could not disagree more with my friend from Oklahoma. I believe \none of the most important things we can do in the Federal Government is \nto provide funds for the building and rebuilding and modernization of \nour schools all over America. As I said, I am sorry we are not doing it \nnationwide. We tried, and we will try again. But it is the one way we \ncan help our local property taxpayers, help our kids--not interfere \nwith what they are taught or how they are taught or what teachers they \nhire or what books they use. Let's take a page from what we did in the \n1930s. Let's do it again. Let's build more schools all over America and \nmake them modern and up to date for our kids so our grandkids will have \na better life.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Michigan.\n\n[[Page S2741]]\n\n                           Amendment No. 610\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Madam President, amendment No. 610 would strike from the \nbill funding for a number of projects. One of the projects which would \nbe stricken is funding which I requested for the redevelopment of part \nof old Tiger Stadium and its ballfield. It is in an economically \ndistressed area of Detroit called Corktown. I support funding of this \nproject from the Economic Development Initiatives account. The purpose \nof that account is for projects such as this.\n  Historically, old ballparks have been demolished after Major League \nteams move out. Members of the community in Detroit, where I live, \nrecognized the economic development value in old Tiger Stadium and its \nballfield, so they formed a nonprofit organization called the Old Tiger \nStadium Conservancy to help preserve a piece of this part of Detroit \nand its baseball history and to help revitalize the economy of downtown \nDetroit, because this is very close to the downtown in an area called \nCorktown.\n  The conservancy has been working with the city, which owns the \nstadium. This is a stadium owned by the city of Detroit. They worked on \na plan to preserve part of this stadium--the original part of the \nstadium, which had been called Navin Field 140 years ago--and to do \nthis for a number of purposes; mainly, so that youth leagues would be \nplaying on that field.\n  That field and that piece of the stadium are a huge magnet for \neconomic development. So to preserve that field--that field of dreams--\nand to redevelop that part of the stadium's structure and the adjacent \nland and to use the adjacent land for retail shops, restaurants, and \nother commercial and entertainment attractions will bring economic \nactivity into a distressed neighborhood and into the city of Detroit.\n  Now, it was said yesterday, I believe, that it did not make sense for \nthis fund to preserve an old stadium we are not going to do anything \nwith. That is just simply not accurate. There is huge interest by \ndevelopers in this old piece of Tiger Stadium and the field it is part \nof. Part of this old stadium has been demolished, demolished by the \ncity, so what is left is a piece of this stadium, essentially between \nfirst and third base. This field and this piece of the stadium is \nnothing short of an anchor for the economic development project that \nwill bring much needed jobs to a part of the city that desperately \nneeds them. The conservancy has already received a number of letters of \ninterest from local organizations and financial institutions expressing \nthe desire to participate in the redevelopment, to bring commercial \noperations into the remaining stadium structure and the neighborhood \narea.\n  For too many years, economic development in this area has been \nstymied because of the unpredictable status of what was to happen to \nthis property at the corner of Michigan and Trumbull, right near \ndowntown Detroit. So there is now a new excitement, not only for the \nexpectation of sports activities on the field, where youth teams will \ncome and play, but also for the adjacent commercial retail, sports \ntraining programs, and other activities that will be attracted to the \nsite.\n  According to the Housing and Community Development Act of 1974, the \nEconomic Development Initiatives account, which this is part of, will \nbenefit persons of low- and moderate-income and may be used for a \nnumber of purposes, including the restoration and preservation of \nhistoric properties and for economic development to improve the use of \nland for residential, commercial, industrial, recreational, and other \nneeded activity centers. This project is what the 1974 act had in mind \nbecause it reuses part of a historic structure which has been sitting \nvacant for a decade and maintains its historic field as a recreational \nand commercial center of economic growth in a low- to moderate-income \nneighborhood in the city of Detroit.\n  So I hope this amendment will be defeated. This is an expenditure \nthat comes from an important fund called the Economic Development \nInitiatives account. That fund is going to be spent in any event, and I \ncan think of a few other things which also should come out of that \naccount, but this is surely one of them. I hope this amendment is \ndefeated and these funds are retained.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maine.\n  Ms. COLLINS. Madam President, I rise to speak in support of funding \nin this bill for the American Lighthouse Foundation. This allocation \nwas recommended to the Appropriations Committee by Senator Snowe and by \nme. Now, I can understand why those who are unfamiliar with this \nprogram might view this as an easy target. That is why I have come to \nthe floor to explain to my colleagues, who may not be familiar with \nthis program, why it is important and why it warrants Federal support.\n  The nonprofit American Lighthouse Foundation in Rockland, ME, \npartners with the U.S. Coast Guard to protect, restore, and preserve \nfederally owned historic lighthouse properties. Let me repeat that. \nThese are federally owned, and I wonder if the sponsor of this \namendment understands that is the case.\n  The Coast Guard leases lighthouses to the American Lighthouse \nFoundation in an effort to help support restoration because the \nfoundation raises private funds that help to relieve some of the burden \nthat otherwise would fall on the American taxpayer.\n  The three Maine lighthouses that will directly benefit from that \nfunding--Owls Head, Pemaquid Point, and Wood Island--are maintained by \nthe U.S. Coast Guard as active aids to navigation. Let me repeat that \npoint. These are active aids to navigation. The Presiding Officer knows \nhow important that is. These lighthouses perform a vital function for \nMaine's lobster and fishing industries, as well as for commercial \nshipping and recreational boaters. They are critical active navigation \naids.\n  I would also note the American Lighthouse appropriation is a direct \ninvestment in Federal property, a responsibility that dates to 1789 \nwhen the first Congress extended Federal funding to lighthouses. This \nisn't new. This isn't something the Senators from Maine dreamed up when \nwe were trying to come up with worthy projects. This goes back to the \nbeginning days of our Republic.\n  By working in partnership with the Coast Guard, the foundation has \nbeen able to raise funds from the private sector. Over the past decade, \nthe foundation has invested more than $2 million in restoring \nlighthouses throughout New England, and in the process, saved the \nFederal Government much money by improving these sites with private \nsector dollars. So this is a wonderful public-private partnership. It \nis the kind of partnership we in Congress like to see and that we \npromote.\n  So, again, let me make three points I have to believe that the \nsponsor of this amendment was not fully aware of: First, that these \nlighthouses are federally owned; they are Federal property. Second, \nthey house within them active aids to navigation maintained by the \nCoast Guard--the lights, the horn. These active aids to navigation are \nused by our fishing industry, our lobstermen, by commercial shippers, \nby recreational boaters. These are active lighthouses. Third, this is a \npublic-private partnership. The foundation raises millions of dollars \nfrom private sources to help restore these lighthouses that contain \naids to navigation used by the Coast Guard. Thus, the burden is shifted \nfrom the Federal Government to the private sector, and that is \nextremely helpful.\n  So I think this is a great example of why it is important that those \nof us who are sponsoring this funding come to the floor and explain it. \nI think when that is done, it casts a whole new light on the purpose of \nthis funding and why it deserves Federal support.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 623\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, I wish to speak on amendment No. 623, an \namendment submitted by the Senator from Oklahoma, because it is most \ntroubling for several reasons.\n  First, this amendment presumes guilt without the benefit of the full \nlegal process. Second, it presumes that the 14 clients actively or \nknowingly participated in the alleged activities of the firm without \nany evidence to support that assumption. Third, the amendment will \npunish the clients for having funds allocated to their projects\n\n[[Page S2742]]\n\nwithout any knowledge of wrongdoing. Fourth, it makes the assumption \nthat Members requested these projects because of ties to the lobbying \nfirm rather than because these projects addressed the needs of their \nconstituents.\n  The last thing we in this body should do on matters such as this is \nrush to judgment. Yes, we know the firm was raided by the FBI, and we \nalso know the firm is in the process of being disbanded, but we also \nknow no one from the firm has been convicted of any crime. In fact, as \nfar as we know, no one has even been indicted for a crime. Further, \nthere is nothing to suggest that the clients themselves are being \ninvestigated, much less guilty of some Federal offense. There has been \nabsolutely no indication by anyone involved in the actual investigation \nthat any of the clients of the PMA firm were involved in any illicit \nactivity.\n  Under our legal system, everyone is presumed innocent until proven \nguilty, but under this amendment we will presume such guilt. We will \npresume guilt even of those who are not under investigation. It is not \nthe responsibility of the Senate to presume guilt. That determination \nshould be left to the courts based on evidence presented by Federal \ninvestigators.\n  Our ``evidence,'' however, is based on press reports. But even in \nthis most questionable evidence, there has been no assertion that the \nclients were involved in any type of criminal activity and certainly \nnone has been accused of any wrongdoing. Nonetheless, the amendment \nwould deny funding for projects included in this bill by Members of the \nHouse and the Senate. The projects were approved by the relevant \nsubcommittees and displayed publicly on the Internet.\n  Rather than assuming guilt, what we should assume is that Members who \nasked for these projects did so because they believe they will serve \nthe needs of their constituents. We have no information that indicates \nthat funds were recommended for these programs because of the efforts \nof any lobbying firm. We can't even say with certainty the funds were \nincluded at the behest of this particular lobbying firm. I would point \nout that the Senator from Oklahoma must also not be so sure since he \nhas modified his amendment to remove one of the projects which he \noriginally had on his list.\n  Are we seriously considering voting to cut funds for projects because \nwe think they might--they might--have been related to a firm which is \nunder investigation, even though the projects' advocates are not under \ninvestigation?\n  As do many of my colleagues, I meet with lobbyists every year--dozens \nof them. They seek hundreds of millions of dollars in earmarks in \nappropriations bills. I am not the only Member in this situation. \nIncidentally, the firm is not a Hawaiian firm, although the projects \ninvolved are Hawaiian. For the most part, the lobbyists with whom I \nmeet request funds for projects pertaining to my State of Hawaii. But \nas do most Members of Congress, I seek funding only for ones which I \nbelieve will have the greatest benefit for my State and for its \ncitizens and which hold the greatest promise for achieving a larger \nnational objective. This is what we were elected to do--to serve our \nconstituents.\n  Why do we presume guilt in this instance instead of innocence? Why do \nwe assume wrongdoing by clients because they hired this lobbying firm? \nWhy should we assume Members requested funds because of the efforts of \nthe lobbying firm instead of the merits of the programs?\n  I can't speak personally of any of these projects because most of \nthem were included by the House and agreed to by our subcommittees, but \nI do believe most Members act responsibly. I, for one, am willing to \ngive the Members who sponsored these projects the benefit of the doubt \nthat they did so because they believe the projects were meritorious and \nworthy of their support. I am not willing to presume our Members are \nguilty of wrongdoing because their constituents hired some lobbyist who \nmight--and I emphasize the word ``might''--have been engaged in some \nillegal activity.\n  Do any of us seriously believe the Members who sponsored these \nprograms in their States and districts did so for any reason other than \nit benefited their constituents or they believed in the work the \nclients are engaged in? For every Duke Cunningham willing to trade \nearmarks for cash, there are 534 other Congressmen and Senators who \nwould never think of doing such a thing. I do not believe we should \nimpugn the motives of the Members who sponsored these earmarks, and I \ncan think of no reason to do so.\n  I recognize this is what we call a tough vote. Many Members might \nwish to vote in favor of this amendment because they fear the news spot \nthat says they supported crooked earmarks. But my colleagues should \nunderstand if we don't stand up for this institution--the Senate--and \nits Members, no one else will. We should all recognize the next time \nthis could be your earmark or mine. You could be the one standing on \nthe Senate floor forced to defend yourself because someone is accused \nof wrongdoing, even though that matter is completely unrelated to your \nbehavior.\n\n  This is actually a simple matter. There is no evidence to support \nwrongdoing by the Members involved. There is no evidence to suggest \nthese projects are not meritorious. There is no evidence to suggest the \nclients who engaged in these projects did anything wrong.\n  Finally, we cannot be certain anyone engaged in any wrongdoing. This \namendment sets a course down a slippery slope that is unnecessary. \nFederal laws already provide remedies to recoup funds depending on the \ncircumstances if our legal system determines laws were broken. Funds \ncan be rescinded and improper payments can be recovered by the agencies \ninvolved.\n  Finally, the agencies have their own rules and regulations to follow \nif they believe there is any impropriety involved. We should allow the \nlegal process to work and then assess an appropriate response based on \nthe results. We should not convict the clients and Members and enact \npunishment before we even know whether a crime has been committed. \nTherefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this unfair amendment.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Will the Senator withhold his request?\n  Mr. INOUYE. I am sorry. Yes, I withhold.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kansas is recognized.\n  Mr. BROWNBACK. Madam President, I thank my colleague from Hawaii, \nwith whom I have had the great pleasure of serving in this body, for \nwithholding that request.\n  I come to the Senate floor today to address the Omnibus \nappropriations bill, as well as to address one of the major needs of a \nmajor industry in our State.\n  I would ask my colleagues to think about this for a second: If there \nwas a business in the United States they knew about that contributed \nannually around $150 billion to the U.S. economy; employed 1.2 million \npeople, mostly in the manufacturing sector of the economy; is a major \nexport driver with 40 percent of their production--40 percent of this \n$150 billion going to overseas sales, contributing to the economy, \ncontributing as a multiplier, and a significant multiplier--to the \neconomy, I think most people would say: What is the business and how do \nwe support it? How do we move it on forward in these tough economic \ntimes, if the business is having a great deal of difficulty? The one \nmajor thing they are asking from the Government now is not to badmouth \nthem, not to talk them down. It is to be positive about this business \ninstead of being down. So of all the businesses we have coming to us \nasking for money, for support and grants and these sorts of things, we \nhave one that is a major industry, an exporter, and a major \nmanufacturer. They want us not to badmouth them anymore. We should be \nable to comply with that request, and we ought to.\n\n  I am talking about the general aviation industry, which is this $150 \nbillion industry, flying 1.2 million people, primarily in the \nmanufacturing sector. It is a major exporter that is growing but is \nhaving enormous difficulty in this economic and global climate because \nso much export was going overseas. Federal officials are making fun and \nsaying people should not fly on these business aircraft; they should \nnot use these things. They are making it a matter of derision.\n\n[[Page S2743]]\n\n  The industry is simply asking us not to do that; help us out, don't \ntalk us down, don't hurt us. The industry is appreciative of the bonus \ndepreciation that was put in the stimulus package, and I am also \nappreciative of that. I hope it can help. It doesn't help when the \nPresident and others say people are disappearing on private jets and \nflying around the country.\n  I think it is helpful to present a few facts on the actual situation \nand say who actually uses business aircraft and where they go. Eighty-\nsix percent of the passengers on business aircraft are not company \nsenior officials but instead are mostly midlevel employees, including \nsalespeople, engineers, and other technical specialists. These \ncompanies have operations in a number of different places. They can't \nget into convenient commercial airports, and they use business aircraft \nto get these people back and forth between various sites very \nefficiently.\n  A lot of my colleagues don't realize there are some 5,000 airports \nnationwide, but only 500 are served by commercial airlines. So 10 \npercent are served by commercial airlines and the other 90 percent are \nnot. How do you get in and out of all the other 90 percent, other than \nby using business aircraft--whether it is propeller or jet? They are \nwhat ends up connecting a lot of people on a rapid basis throughout the \ncountry. That is important for people to realize. Without the use of a \nlot of business aircraft, you are going to have much more inefficiency \nin companies, a lot more difficulty getting people from point A to B.\n  In a lot of cases, you have emergency situations where you have \nbusiness aircraft moving people who are very sick from one place to get \nthem to a critical hospital; it gives them access. Behind all this and \nthe numbers I am talking about, you have a bunch of people working for \nthese companies.\n  I will show you some pictures of people in my State. I am proud of \nthe work they do in business aircraft. This is King Air by Beechcraft. \nThe assembly line is back here. I have been in these factories a number \nof times. It is an interesting and cool business. It is one a lot of \nplaces around the world are trying to steal from the United States. The \nJapanese, the Brazilians, and certainly the Chinese are trying to take \nthis manufacturing business from the United States. We are the center \nof business aviation and of the construction of these planes for the \nworld. As you might guess, it is a high-wage, high-skill manufacturing \nfield. It is a great business. Consequently, you have a number of other \ncompetitors trying to break into this field at the same time our \nGovernment is talking down this business in the United States. The \nworkers in my State who are making these great quality aircraft are \nsaying: Just don't talk bad about us.\n  I have some other pictures I wish to show you of other people in this \nbusiness. I want individuals to be able to see this. Behind every \ndiscussion, you have the people who make the aircraft. Most people who \nsee this aircraft probably say there is probably somebody well-to-do \ninside. But more likely it is an engineer, a salesperson or a \ntechnician. These are the people building it. This is a Hawker 4000. It \nis a great aircraft that came out. I will show another aircraft. These \nare made in Wichita, with a lot of suppliers from the entire region and \nthe country that are going into making these aircraft. These are some \nof the volunteers, the employees working here, volunteering in the \ncommunity and this is from the Christmas season and this is soccer. \nHere are some of their products. I will show another one as well, so \npeople can get an idea of who all is involved in this picture. This is \nthe rollout of an aircraft, a Cessna. This is the celebration of the \nrollout of the first Sovereign jet. You can see in the picture the \npeople involved in this.\n  I hope my colleagues will take note that when they use a cheap shot \nto say we should not have these guys using business aircraft, 90 \npercent of your airports would not be accessible if people were not \nusing these. These are experts getting to various operations. The \ncorporations would be far less efficient, and they would lose the \nconnection for people to be able to make it to medical services that \nare critical in some places in the country. There is a lot of good this \nbusiness does, and it is a business dominated by the United States. We \nneed to support it, not hurt it.\n  Finally, on an amendment I hope comes up on a separate issue in the \nomnibus bill, there is a sunsetting of the DC scholarship program. I \nraise the point to my colleagues that this has been a very successful \nprogram, with a strong support base from the people who are using it \nand a desire to continue to use it. I think we ought to continue it \nrather than sunset this particular program.\n  In the omnibus bill, the opportunity scholarship program is sunsetted \nunless there is reauthorization that takes place. Hopefully, that will \noccur this year, and reauthorization will occur.\n  Listen to who is participating in this program, and if it is \nsunsetted, who cannot continue to participate. The average annual \nincome of the people participating was around $22,800, far below the \neligibility level for this program, which is 185 percent of the Federal \npoverty level or $39,000. The actual number is $22,736, and that is the \naverage annual income of the people participating. Just over 1,700 \nstudents are participating in the program. They are trying to get into \nschools that are better for their kids because the DC Public Schools \nhave not served them well.\n  The DC Public Schools' per pupil expenditure is the highest in the \ncountry at $15,000. The DC class size is one of the lowest in the \ncountry; it is a 14-to-1 student to teacher ratio. Yet reading scores \ncontinue to languish near or at the bottom of national assessment in \nthe Nation. Recent data shows that 69 percent of fourth graders in the \nDC public schools are reading below basic levels. DC students ranked \nlast in the Nation in both SAT and ACT scores. Forty-two percent of DC \nstudents drop out of school compared to 31 percent nationwide.\n  People fudge with figures and say it doesn't mean this or that, but \nwhat you have are 1,700-plus students who have opted to use a \nscholarship to get into a private school that they are very happy with, \nthat they are performing well in, and that the parents are happy with, \nrather than the DC Public School System that, by and large, is not \nserving students well, and the longer you stay in that system, the \npoorer you are doing.\n  Most representatives, Congressmen and Senators, who have children and \ngrandchildren in DC don't send their children to public schools. As a \nmatter of fact, I don't know if anybody in this body does. Yet we \nconsign people who don't have the income ability to get out of the DC \npublic system into a school system that has failed students. A number \nof efforts are being made to change this system. I applaud the efforts \nby the mayor's office and the superintendent of schools, Michelle Rhee. \nBut if you are in the system, these changes are taking time to make and \nyou don't have time when you are going through the first, second, \nthird, and fourth grades. Each year you are losing ground.\n  Here is a group of students who have found a way to get into a better \nsituation. We should not take that away. It is wrong for us to take \nthat away. I know they believe it is wrong to take that away. I urge my \ncolleagues to not let this program be sunsetted but to reestablish it. \nI would like to see it expanded so more students could take advantage \nof it as well.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 608\n\n  Mr. INOUYE. Madam President, may I associate myself with the comments \nof the chair of the Commerce, State, Justice Subcommittee regarding the \namendment proposing an earmark for the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil \nRights Crime Act.\n  Make no mistake, no one in this Chamber is interested in denying \nfunding to resolve unsolved civil rights cases--no one. But what we are \ninterested in doing is passing this bill as quickly as possible, so \nthat the Department of Justice has the necessary and adequate funding \nto pursue these cases.\n  This amendment slows down that process. This amendment earmarks $10 \nmillion with existing funding for the Weed and Seed Program, which is \nan authorized competitive grant program under title I of the Omnibus \nCrime and Control and Safe Streets Act, which funds communitywide \nstrategies to reduce violent crime, drug abuse, and gang activities.\n\n[[Page S2744]]\n\n  This authorized program has nothing to do with resolving unsolved \ncivil rights cases. Yet this amendment takes almost half the funding in \none authorized program designed to combat violent crime and gang \nactivities and earmarks it for a different program that already has \nmillions in funding available for this effort.\n  I am confident this administration's Department of Justice will be \nusing its resources to solve as many of these cases as possible.\n  The Department of Justice has at its disposal $123 million provided \nfor the Civil Rights Division, $151 million in funding to reduce the \nbacklog of untested DNA evidence, and $30 million for State and local \ngovernments to investigate and prosecute civil rights violations.\n  These are just a few of the many authorized civil rights-related \nprograms for which the subcommittee chair has provided increased \nfunding for the fiscal year 2009.\n  The best way to fund initiatives of the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil \nRights Crime Act is to pass this measure--the underlying measure--now \nand send it to the President for his signature. The amendment of the \nSenator from Oklahoma detracts from that effort, while providing no \noverall benefit.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence after quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Cardin). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, I think it is a good time to take stock of \nwhere we are on this bill and to give my thoughts and feelings to my \ncolleagues on why it is so important to get it done and move it \nswiftly.\n  The bill that is before us is unfinished business. It is an Omnibus \nappropriations bill that finishes up the funding for this year. The \nreason we are in this situation is for a variety of reasons, including \nan election, and the appropriations bills did not get done. Some of \nthem did, but most of them did not get done. This bill wraps them up in \na package, and here is where we are. We have two choices: Either we \npass this bill the way it is or we go back to the continuing resolution \nwhich takes us back a year and a half ago.\n  It is very important for us to consider that point because a year and \na half ago, life in America was very different. A year and a half ago, \nwe were not in the jam we are in now economically. We did not see homes \nbeing lost at such a rapid rate. We did not see unemployment figures \ngoing into the double digits in some of our States, including \nCalifornia, which I am so proud to represent, my State. But it has over \n10 percent unemployment at this time. If we go backward, as Senator \nMcCain is suggesting, and other colleagues, if we go backward to the \ncontinuing resolution approach where we ignore everything that has \nhappened, then we have a budget for this year that is irrelevant in \nmany aspects.\n  Why do I say that? In this particular omnibus bill--which I am sure \nhas flaws, because nothing in life is perfect--we do address the \nhousing crisis. In this omnibus bill, we do give the SEC, the \nSecurities and Exchange Commission, the funding it needs to move \nagainst these Ponzi schemes and these frauds that are being perpetrated \non the people. In this bill, we do more for education. We do more for \nhealth care. In this bill, we step up to the best of our ability to \naddress some of these problems.\n  We know that if any of these amendments are adopted, it is going to \nweigh this bill down because the House has acted and said basically: \nThis is last year's business; we don't want to get bogged down with it. \nEither take it or leave it. That is where we are.\n  As I have said often on this floor, we usually do not have a chance \nto get the perfect bill around here. It is very difficult to get the \nperfect bill, unless each of us wrote it his or her own way. Then it \nwould be perfect for us.\n  Clearly, there are issues with this bill. But I want to say again, if \nyou were sitting with your family and you went back to last year's \nbudget and all of a sudden you realized that in the last 12 months, \nthings had radically changed in your family--let's say you had a child \nwho got sick with a terrible disease, let's say that your grandma had \nto go into a nursing home and she needed certain things--you would \nrealize that last year's budget does not fit what your requirements \nare. You would have to address your child's health, your grandma's \nsituation to be relevant for the year.\n  It doesn't always mean spending more money. I am not suggesting that \nat all. But this omnibus bill does respond to the needs of our people. \nPut that together with the stimulus bill, which is finally beginning to \nbear fruit out there--and I am excited about it because we are starting \nto see the funding flow to our States, we are starting to see people \nget back to work. Once we do this, it is another boost to the people of \nour great country.\n  These amendments that are coming at us at the end of the day, I \nbelieve many of them are meant to weigh this bill down, to take this \nbill off course. I am going to talk about a couple of those amendments.\n  Senator Coburn has an amendment for he says, the worst projects in \nthe world--whatever he calls it. He is going after them. And one of \nthose projects that he picks is one I was proud to get in here. So I \nwant to talk about it because I am proud of it. The way Senator Coburn \ndescribes it, you wouldn't know what I did.\n  He says there is money in the bill for the Great Park in Orange \nCounty. But what he doesn't say is there is funding in here, and it is \nnot that much funding compared to a lot of these items--$475,000 to \nrestore the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station hangar No. 244. This \nhangar was opened in 1943 to house aircraft during World War II. The \nhangar is being renovated. It is being turned into a military history \nmuseum and a welcoming center for the park.\n  This particular $475,000 is not going for anything other than the \nrenovation of this hangar to bring it back to life, to serve as a \ntribute to our veterans and to their military service. It will be on \nthe site of what used to be a leading military installation on the west \ncoast. Millions of U.S. military personnel during World War II, Korea, \nVietnam, and the Cold War passed through El Toro. This base reuse \nproject honors our military history and the service and the sacrifice \nof our military men and women.\n  This is not the first time my Republican friends have gone after \nveterans. I had another funding request. We were able to win that one, \nand we will win this one, too. I believe it. They were going after a \nprogram to help disabled veterans get back to a normal life. They \nactually did that. But we beat them then, and we will beat them now.\n  The hangar needs a number of repairs and upgrades to make it suitable \nfor public use. This deals with the upgrade of electricity, fire safety \nsystems. And 100 jobs will be created. Not bad. Mr. President, 100 jobs \nwill be created through the rehab of this building, and another 10 to \n20 full-time jobs will be created to staff the facility when it is \nbuilt.\n  Here is the thing. Orange County, in which this particular project \nresides, is a Republican county. Registered Republicans outnumber \nregistered Democrats by 235,000 voters, and they voted for this project \n58 to 42 percent in an election where 500,000 votes were cast. Yet I \nhave a Senator who comes on the floor and tries to say this is some \nfrivolous, horrible project. I resent it, and so do the veterans resent \nit.\n  I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record a series of \nletters from veterans very concerned about Senator Coburn's amendment.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record as follows:\n\n                                                    March 3, 2009.\n     Senator Barbara Boxer and Members of Congress.\n       Dear Senator, I am taking this opportunity to formally \n     thank you for all the success Orange County has experienced \n     with the redevelopment of the former Marine Corps Air Station \n     El Toro. If you had not taken a leadership role in helping \n     the Orange County voters decide the future of the surplus \n     military property at El Toro, I am certain our aspirations \n     for a Great Park at the site would not have materialized.\n       Now, as the Orange County Great Park Corporation's lead \n     sponsor for the development of a heritage museum honoring the \n     contributions of our community to the defense of this great \n     country, I must seek your\n\n[[Page S2745]]\n\n     support once again. In the creative scheme to preserve an in-\n     tact 1943 vintage U.S. Marine Corps squadron area, including \n     two logistics buildings and a squadron administration-\n     headquarters facility, and a historic hangar (hangar #244) \n     our corporation seeks federal funds to help defray renovation \n     costs.\n       The veterans and civilian employees who worked, transited, \n     or were stationed at MCAS El Toro would be the primary \n     beneficiaries of your successful efforts. We will incorporate \n     the restoration of the subject buildings into an education \n     program for local students--least we allow history to be \n     forgotten.\n       My heartfelt request comes to you not only from a retired \n     U.S. Marine Corps aviator, citizen activist with a twenty \n     year experience defending the voters rights to decide the \n     former MCAS El Toro's final design and use, but, also from my \n     experiences as a Director at the Orange County Great Park \n     Corporation and as a Commissioner of the California State \n     Parks and Recreation Commission.\n       Our heritage museum needs your resolute support at this \n     critical point in time. Please present this message to your \n     fellow member of Congress.\n           Respectfully,\n     William Gustav Kogerman,\n       LtCol USMC (Ret); Director, Orange County Great Park \n     Corporation; Commissioner, State Parks and Recreation \n     Commission.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 3, 2009.\n\n     Re: Renovation of Hangar #244 at MCAS El Toro.\n\n       Members of Congress: I have recently been informed that \n     funding for the renovation of hangar 244 at the Great Park \n     has been withdrawn. This is a travesty. MCAS El Toro once \n     stood as an American symbol of freedom, providing a sense of \n     security and an abundance of opportunity for surrounding \n     communities. It would be a shame to allow the last remaining \n     hangar standing at the Great Park to fall rather than serve \n     as a reminder of the service this once great post served to \n     the residents of Orange County and Southern California.\n       I strongly support the renovation of hangar #244.\n                                                      John Rotolo,\n     GySgt USMC (Ret).\n                                  ____\n\n       Both while in the military and since, I have traveled \n     abroad. As a nation, we have done very little relative to our \n     European counterparts to preserve historic treasures. This \n     persistent desire to upgrade and update leaves our society at \n     a historical disadvantage. Our society quickly forgets our \n     roots and those who have fought to preserve them. As a \n     result, the patriotic nature of our society has been damaged \n     because we've underfunded the preservation of sites such as \n     Hanger #244.\n       This past January, I was in the UK and visited Winston \n     Churchills' Museum and Cabinet War Rooms (http://\ncwr.iwm.org.uk/). This is a fine example of how preserving \n     historic military locations can communicate to the masses, \n     the greatness of the military and its ability to produce such \n     leadership. The people that I was with that day expressed \n     great pride in their country, what they stood for and the \n     military's accomplishments.\n       As a former Sergeant in the USMC stationed at MCAS Tustin, \n     I had spent considerable time at MCAS El Toro. \n     Geographically, I would suggest that MCAS El Toro's location \n     and ease of access is an ideal location for a historic \n     landmark. I stand behind your initiative to renovate hanger \n     #244 at MCAS El Toro and wish that your funding returns with \n     due speed.\n           Regards,\n     Dave Ristow,\n       Chief Financial Officer, KSS Retail\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             LtCol Clifton Wallace USMC (Ret),\n\n                                                       Irvine, CA.\n\n     Re: MCAS El Toro Hangar #244.\n\n       Members of Congress: I would like to publically add my \n     emphatic support for the project to renovate Hangar 244 at \n     the former Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California now \n     the Orange County Great Park. I served as a pilot at MCAS El \n     Toro from 1977 until I retired from the Marine Corps in 1999 \n     and feel it is extremely important that Hangar 244 be \n     renovated and restored to its historical condition.\n       Hangar 244 is an original hangar from the 1940s and the \n     last remaining historic hangar at the Great Park. It must be \n     renovated and preserved to not only preserve the building but \n     also the heritage of five decades of service to our nation's \n     defense. The Great Park intends to build an aviation/heritage \n     museum at the site and Hangar 244 will be a historic center \n     piece for this new museum.\n       On October 2, 2008, the Orange County Great Park \n     Corporation conducted an ``El Toro Homecoming'' event which \n     honored veterans from World War II that were stationed at \n     MCAS El Toro. Several hundred WWII veterans attended this \n     historically important and emotional tribute conducted in \n     Hangar 244 resulting in rich memories and moving stories by \n     the men and women who served our nation during this time of \n     great need.

I \n     served at MCAS El Toro in the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s \n     and feel it extremely important that hangar #244, an original \n     hangar from the 1940s, and the last remaining historic hangar \n     at the Great Park be renovated and preserved to not only \n     preserved the building but also the heritage that over five \n     decades of service to our nation is represented by that last \n     hangar. The Great Park intends to build an aviation/heritage \n     museum at the site and hangar #244 will be a historic center \n     piece for the new museum. I strongly encourage support for \n     the renovation project and hope funds for this project are \n     restored.\n           Semper Fi,\n                                                       Tom O'Hara.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, here is one letter. It is to Members of \nCongress signed ``Semper Fi, Clifton Wallace.'' He is a retired marine. \nHe says:\n\n       I'd like to publicly add my emphatic support for the \n     project to renovate Hangar 244 at the former Marine Corps \n     Station El Toro, California now the Orange County Great Park. \n     I served as a pilot . . . from 1977 until I retired in 1999 \n     and feel it is extremely important that Hangar 244 be \n     renovated and restored to its historical condition.\n       Hangar 244 is an original hangar from the 1940s and the \n     last remaining historic hangar at the Great Park. It must be \n     renovated and preserved to not only preserve the building but \n     also the heritage of five decades of service to our nation's \n     defense. . . .\n\n  He says:\n\n       On October 2, 2008, the Orange County Great Park \n     Corporation conducted an ``El Toro Homecoming'' event which \n     honored veterans from World War II that were stationed at \n     [this base]. Several hundred WWII veterans attended this \n     historically important and emotional tribute conducted in \n     Hangar 244 resulting in rich memories and moving stories by \n     the men and women who served our nation during this time of \n     great need. I strongly encourage support for the Hangar 244 \n     renovation project and strongly request that the funds [be \n     there].\n\n  That is one. And this goes on veteran after veteran. Senator Coburn \ncomes to the floor and talks about the Great Park and the free balloon \nrides that the kids have there. What does that have to do with this \nline item that turns this hangar into a museum for those who put their \nlife on the line? I will say, Senator Coburn has gotten them so riled \nup and so worked up and so upset. For what reason? None that I can see.\n  So here is a circumstance where we have a line item our veterans \nwant. One of them talks about visiting Europe and saying how much more \nthe Europeans have preserved these memories of their fighting men and \nwomen compared to our country and he begs Senators not to strip this \nout.\n  Here we have a circumstance where Senator Coburn is saying I have a \nline item that is about ``the Great Park,'' but he does not say what \nthe purpose of the line item is: to restore the hangar and turn it into \na military museum and a visitor center to celebrate those who have \ngiven so much to our Nation.\n  Then we have another amendment by Senator Murkowski. What she wants \nto do is go back to the bad old days of the Friday night midnight rules \nthat the Bush administration took at the very end of their days here. \nThe midnight rules were put in place and ran roughshod over the rights \nof the public to participate in the rulemaking process.\n  The language in the bill goes back to the status quo ante. In other \nwords, it goes back to before the Bush administration issued its \nmidnight rules.\n  On December 11, 2008, almost 35 years to the day after the Endangered \nSpecies Act became law, and after the Republicans lost the election, \nthe Bush administration issued a midnight rule which allows Federal \nagencies to decide unilaterally that consultations with the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service or the National Marine Fisheries Service are not \nnecessary when there is any type of development proposal. That midnight \nrule made a mockery of the process we are supposed to follow.\n  According to press reports, a Department of Interior e-mail indicated \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service received 300,000 comments on the proposed \nrule. The agency reviewed 200,000 of these\n\n[[Page S2746]]\n\ncomments in 32 hours. This is an average of 6,000 comments every hour. \nLet's face it, Mr. President, I don't care how many people you had \nlooking at these comments, it is not possible that they could have \nreviewed the outcry from all over the country.\n  Now, who agrees with me? Dozens of groups. I am going to read some of \nthe groups that said: No, don't do this. Yet they did it anyway:\n\n       The Audubon, American Rivers, Arizona Wilderness Coalition, \n     Californians for Western Wilderness, Center for Biological \n     Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, Endangered Species \n     Coalition, Friends of Red Rock Canyon, Friends of the \n     Missouri Breaks Monument, Grand Canyon Wildlands Council, the \n     Trust for Public Land, the Wilderness Society, Union of \n     Concerned Scientists, World Wildlife Fund, Partnership for \n     the National Trails System, Natural Resources Defense \n     Council, Oregon Natural Desert Association, National Trust \n     for Historic Preservation . . .\n\n  I am not reading them all, Mr. President, so I ask unanimous consent \nto have printed in the Record the entire list.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Audubon, American Rivers, Arizona Wilderness Coalition, \n     Californians for Western Wilderness, Center for Biological \n     Diversity, Cienega Watershed Partnership, Defenders of \n     Wildlife, Earthjustice, Endangered Species Coalition, Friends \n     of the Agua Fria National Monument, Friends of Red Rock \n     Canyon, Friends of the Desert Mountains.\n       Friends of the Missouri Breaks Monument, Friends of the \n     Sonoran Desert National Monument, Grand Canyon Wildlands \n     Council, Grand Staircase Escalante Partners, Idaho \n     Conservation League, International Dark-Sky Association, \n     League of Conservation Voters, National Parks Conservation \n     Association, National Trust for Historic Preservation, \n     National Wildlife Federation, National Wildlife Refuge \n     Association, Natural Resources Defense Council, Oregon \n     Natural Desert Association.\n       Partnership for the National Trails System, Rincon \n     Institute, San Juan Citizens Alliance, Scenic America, Sierra \n     Club, Sky Island Alliance, Snake River Raptor Volunteers, \n     Soda Mountain Wilderness Council, Southern Utah Wilderness \n     Alliance, The Trust for Public Land, The Wilderness Society, \n     Tuleyome, Union of Concerned Scientists, World Wildlife Fund.\n\n  Mrs. BOXER. Mr. President, you have the Bush administration, after \nthey lost the election, take this step, not even looking at the peer-\nreviewed scientific evidence. The CRS--the Congressional Research \nService--said there appears to be little additional protections by this \nact.\n  So they had two of these midnight rules. One dealt with the \nconsultations they are supposed to have with environmental agencies \nbefore permits are given; the second one had to do with the polar bear. \nThe Bush administration determined that the polar bear is a threatened \nspecies, and we all know, just from a little bit of reading or watching \nTV, that the polar bear is endangered or, I would say, certainly \nthreatened because the ice habitat is melting literally under their \nfeet. The Endangered Species Act applies to the polar bear. Oh, no, the \nBush administration said, we are going to deny key protections for the \npolar bear under the Endangered Species Act. So they unilaterally \ndecided by a rule that the only thing that will apply to the polar bear \nis marine mammal protection, not the Endangered Species Act, and the \nBush administration put in this special rule without any notice or \ncomment. They simply decided they wanted to eliminate the ESA's \nprotections for the polar bear, and once again they ran roughshod over \nthe process.\n  So in this omnibus bill, this is all we do. We say let's go back to \nregular order. Let's go back to the status quo ante. Let's go back to \nthe way it was before these midnight rules were passed. I am very \ndisappointed we have to vote on this because I think it is a matter of \ncommon sense and pride in the place we work. We need to follow a \nprocess.\n  It has nothing to do with how one feels about the polar bear. \nFrankly, I am heartbroken when I see what is happening to the polar \nbear. Other people may not be moved by it, may not be touched by it. \nBut it doesn't matter how one feels about the polar bear. What matters \nis that we stand for the laws we passed in this great country under \nRepublican and Democratic administrations, and the Endangered Species \nAct was one of those. If we see it isn't working, we can take steps, \nbut let's not shortcut the process. So I hope we will oppose the \nMurkowski amendment.\n  Again, not everybody will agree with me the polar bear deserves \nprotection under ESA. Not everybody will agree with me that before a \npermit is granted there ought to be consultation with Fish and \nWildlife. Frankly, I think that is a very modest and moderate position \nto take and a commonsense position. But don't support an amendment \nwhich just says: To heck with what the public says. We don't care. It \ndoesn't matter. Cut it short. Remove the Endangered Species Act. Remove \nthe consultation process. That is not a way to go, and especially for \nthe Bush administration to do it after the election, on one of those \nlate-night announcements. Let's give this administration a chance to \ntake a look at both of these rules, take a look at making sure the \nscientists are listened to, the public is listened to.\n  So, again, in closing, I want to say this in summing up. Senator \nCoburn has attacked the veterans in my State by calling a line item in \nthis bill one of the worst projects in this bill. He actually did. The \nveterans in my State are up in arms, and I put the letters in the \nRecord and I hope we will vote against the Coburn amendment. The way he \nhas presented it is so unfair to my veterans. He talks about free \nballoon rides and the Great Park. The funding here is simply to \nrefurbish a historic hangar, the only hangar at El Toro that can be \npreserved to remember these veterans. So I hope we will vote that down, \nand I hope we will vote down the Murkowski amendment because if you \nvote for her amendment, friends, what you are saying is the process \nshould be truncated; that it doesn't matter who the President is--\nPresident Obama.\n  In other words, if you vote for this as a process, you are saying to \nthis new President: Well, we support your being able to just decide \nwhatever you want; to ignore the public comments, ignore the \nscientists; just get up and do whatever you want at midnight. I think \nthat is wrong, and I don't care if the President is Republican or \nDemocrat, we shouldn't do it that way. It isn't the right way to do it.\n  So I hope we will take a stand against that kind of government, and I \nhope we will take a stand in favor of my veterans. I hope we can, in \nfact, pass this bill and get on with our business because the option is \nto go back to a bill that was written--basically, it goes back to the \nold budget, before we had all the problems we have now. I think it is \nlooking backwards. I think it is putting our government in reverse at a \ntime when we need to move forward with confidence. I believe passing \nthis bill is an important part of what we need to do this week.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 623\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I rise to briefly discuss the amendment \nthat has been proposed by the Senator from Oklahoma, Mr. Coburn, to \nprohibit funding for PMA-related earmarks.\n  A lot of Americans don't know who PMA is, Mr. President. In fact, I \ndidn't until recently, but it is very interesting. The Coburn \namendment, by the way, would strike 13 projects where funding is \ndirected to clients of the PMA Group, a lobbying firm currently under \nFederal investigation for corruption.\n  Today, we have before us a massive omnibus spending bill totaling \nnearly $410 billion that contains over 9,000 earmarks. Perhaps even \nmore troubling than the number of earmarks is to whom and how some of \nthis funding is being directed. Contained within this legislation are \n13 earmarks totaling over $10 million directed to clients of the PMA \nGroup.\n  Mr. President, the PMA Group is a lobbying firm that was recently \nforced to close its doors after the home of its owner and offices were \nraided last November by the FBI for suspicious campaign donation \npractices. That investigation continues to this day.\n  Well known for its deep ties to Capitol Hill, the PMA Group has a \nlong and lucrative history for securing earmarks for its clients, \nincluding approximately $300 million in the fiscal year 2008 Defense \nappropriations bills--none of them authorized, by the way--$300 \nmillion.\n  There have been many accusations against the PMA Group, including \nusing straw donors to further spread\n\n[[Page S2747]]\n\ntheir wealth to curry favor with influential Members of Congress. A \nFebruary 14, 2009, Washington Post article examined campaign \ncontributions reportedly given by members of the PMA Group and found \n``several people who were not registered lobbyists and did not work for \nthe lobbying firm,'' including a 75-year-old California man who, \ndespite being listed in financial disclosure documentation as a donor \nand PMA employee, had never even heard of the firm.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthat complete article.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Feb. 14, 2009]\n\n        Despite Listing, Donors Don't Work for Firm Being Probed\n\n                         (By Carol D. Leonnig)\n\n       Marvin Hoffman is listed in campaign finance records as one \n     of the many lobbyists with the powerful PMA Group donating \n     money to lawmakers. But Hoffman is a soon-to-retire \n     information technology manager in Marina del Rey, Calif., who \n     has never heard of the Arlington lobbying firm or the Indiana \n     congressman to whom he supposedly gave $2,000.\n       ``It's alarming that someone is stealing my identity \n     somewhere,'' Hoffman, 75, said in an interview. ``I've never \n     heard of this company.''\n       Another contributor listed as a PMA lobbyist is, in fact, a \n     sales manager for an inflatable boat manufacturer in New \n     Jersey. John Hendricksen said he did make campaign donations \n     but never worked at PMA and does not know how he ended up \n     listed in records that way.\n       These errors, along with other unusual donations linked to \n     the firm, come as the Justice Department examines allegations \n     that PMA may have violated campaign finance laws. The offices \n     of PMA, which ranked last year as the 10th-largest Washington \n     lobbying firm by earnings, were raided in November by FBI \n     agents and Defense Department investigators.\n       Federal investigators are focused on allegations that PMA \n     founder Paul Magliocchetti, a former appropriations staffer \n     close to Rep. John P. Murtha (D-Pa.), may have reimbursed \n     some of his staff to cover contributions made in their names \n     to Murtha and other lawmakers, according to two sources \n     familiar with the investigation. PMA has long had a \n     reputation for securing earmarks from congressional \n     appropriators, particularly for defense contractors, and it \n     has donated generously to influential members of Congress. \n     Magliocchetti personally gave $98,000 in campaign donations \n     last year, according to campaign records.\n       Federal election laws limit the amount of money individuals \n     may contribute to candidates, but lobbying firms often show \n     their clout by collecting and bundling contributions. It is \n     illegal for employers to reimburse donors for their \n     contributions.\n       The Washington Post examined contributions that were \n     reported as being made by PMA employees and consultants, and \n     found several people who were not registered lobbyists and \n     did not work at the lobbying firm. It is unclear whether the \n     donors misidentified as PMA associates are part of the \n     federal probe.\n       A PMA spokesman said the firm's management does not know \n     Hoffman or Hendricksen and does not know how the errors were \n     made in reports to the Federal Election Commission.\n       ``It's up to the campaigns to report contributions in their \n     FEC filings,'' said PMA spokesman Patrick Dorton.\n       FEC spokeswoman Mary Brandenberger said she has not often \n     seen such misidentified donations, but if a complaint were \n     received, the commission would first question the campaign \n     about its record-keeping.\n       Jan Witold Baran, a campaign finance and ethics expert and \n     Wiley Rein lawyer, said the errors pose serious questions and \n     should be cleared up.\n       ``It's true that candidate campaigns have the \n     responsibility for disclosure, but the information they \n     obtain usually comes from the contributor or the person who \n     solicited from the contributor,'' Baran said. ``The question \n     is: Where did that information come from?''\n       Murtha aide Matthew Mazonkey said the congressman was not \n     the recipient of the erroneous donations.\n       PMA, founded in 1989 by Magliocchetti, a former Murtha aide \n     to the House Appropriations Committee, has enjoyed a high \n     success rate in winning earmarks for its clients, which \n     include such major defense contractors as Lockheed and \n     General Dynamics. PMA also represents a circle of lesser-\n     known but also successful contractors such as Argon ST, MTS \n     Technologies, DRS Technologies and Advanced Acoustic \n     Concepts. Many PMA clients have opened offices in Murtha's \n     western Pennsylvania district, donated generously to him, and \n     received millions in earmarks requested by the congressman.\n       In the last election cycle, PMA and its clients donated \n     $775,000 to Murtha's campaigns. Last year, those clients \n     received earmarks worth $299 million and arranged by Murtha \n     and his colleagues.\n       The majority of PMA's 35 lobbyists had worked on Capitol \n     Hill or at the Pentagon. Several of the top lobbyists were \n     also PMA directors and had ties to lawmakers.\n       Two men listed in campaign finance reports as together \n     giving $30,000 to lawmakers and being part of the PMA Group \n     team are not Washington lobbyists at all. They live and work \n     in the Florida resort community of Amelia Island, where PMA \n     founder Magliocchetti has a beachfront condominium. Both are \n     listed as directors of PMA.\n       John Pugliese had been a sommelier at the posh Ritz-Carlton \n     Hotel on the island, his family said. Jon C. Walker is in \n     charge of golf marketing at the neighboring Amelia Island \n     Golf Club, according to club personnel and its Web site. They \n     each donated identical amounts to the same lawmakers, in 12 \n     installments each, almost always on the same date.\n       Walker and Pugliese did not return repeated phone calls and \n     messages.\n       Pugliese is listed as a PMA Group ``associate,'' and Walker \n     is a PMA Group ``consultant'' in finance records.\n       Rebecca DeRosa, who is listed as a part-time accountant at \n     PMA and director, recently married Magliocchetti and has \n     given generously on PMA's behalf for several years. Last year \n     alone, she personally gave $73,000 to lawmakers and \n     congressional political action committees, records show. For \n     most of those donations, she is listed as a PMA employee. Her \n     donations included $22,000 to the Democratic Congressional \n     Campaign Committee and $4,250 to Rep. James P. Moran Jr. (D-\n     Va.).\n       DeRosa did not answer her phone or returns calls to the \n     Gaithersburg office of the DRS subsidiary, where she is \n     listed as an employee.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. An article from the Congressional Quarterly on February \n19 noted another curious statistic from the PMA Group's financial \ndisclosure forms. Somehow during the course of the last four election \ncycles, PMA's political action committee reported expenses of $18. Now, \nI have heard of businesses trying to cut overhead costs, but spending \n$18 over 8 years doesn't pass the smell test.\n  I don't use the word ``corruption'' lightly, Mr. President. I don't. \nBut we have seen the abuses of the appropriations process before, and \nwe obviously haven't learned. Whether it was Jack Abramoff bilking \nmillions of dollars from numerous Indian tribes or Duke Cunningham \nsteering high-value defense contracts to firms that curried his favor \nthrough bribes and extravagant trips around the world, we have a broken \nsystem that breeds this sort of behavior.\n  Let me remind you there are former Members of Congress and staff \nmembers who now reside in Federal prison. The allegations against the \nPMA Group are serious and troubling, and we in Congress should treat \nthem as such. How in the world do we approve 13 earmarks that were \nobtained by a group that has been raided and shut down by the FBI? How \ndo we tell the American people we did such a thing--$10 million and \nover $300 million in last year's Defense appropriations bill?\n  Mr. President, the American people, sooner or later, are going to \nhold us accountable. Why should we approve earmarks from an \norganization that is clearly in violation of numerous laws, including \nhaving the FBI raid them and shut them down? They have all said they \nare no longer in business anymore, and clearly there are people listed \nin campaign finance reports--and I will quote again from the Washington \nPost article:\n\n       . . . giving $30,000 to lawmakers and being part of the PMA \n     Group team are not Washington lobbyists at all. They live and \n     work in the Florida resort community of Amelia Island, where \n     PMA founder Magliocchetti has a beachfront condominium. Both \n     are listed as directors of PMA.\n\n  And the article goes on and on, Mr. President.\n\n       \"John Pugliese had been a sommelier at the posh Ritz-\n     Carlton Hotel on the island,'' his family said. John C. \n     Walker is in charge of golf marketing at the neighboring \n     Amelia Island Golf Club, according to club personnel and its \n     Web site. They each donated identical amounts to the same \n     lawmakers, in 12 installments each, almost always on the same \n     date.\n  I will talk some more about this before this is over because the \nAmerican people are beginning to figure it out. The American people are \nrising up in strenuous objection to this kind of process, with 9,000 \nporkbarrel earmark projects on them. Some of them are of value. Some \nare not. We do not know because it did not go through the authorization \nprocess these projects need to go through to be properly vetted and \nauthorized by the authorizing committees.\n  We are not through with this bill, I am happy to say. I will be \ntalking a lot\n\n[[Page S2748]]\n\nmore about it, and the American people are talking a lot more about it. \nThere have been some statements made that I am angry. I am angry, but I \nam not nearly as angry as the taxpayers are. I am not nearly as angry \nas the people who see that we are going to give $10 million in earmarks \nthat were obtained by a company, a lobbying outfit, that has been \nraided and shut down by the FBI.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of the Coburn amendment to \nremove at least the $10 million from this porkbarrel bill that was \nobtained through an organization of questionable credentials, \nquestionable donors, and certainly--according to the FBI, having shut \nthem down--being people who do not deserve to be able to have $10 \nmillion of the taxpayers' dollars.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Mr. President, I come to the floor to speak against \nCoburn amendment No. 596, not the amendment Senator McCain was speaking \nto, and also to put some personal remarks in the Record in a few \nminutes. I understand some of my colleagues are here to speak as well, \nbut since I am on the floor, I would like to make a comment about PMA.\n  I do not know PMA. I don't know the organization. But the Senator \nfrom Arizona certainly knows there are processes and ways to get at \nthis other than amending this bill, which has a very tight deadline and \nis very important to all of the agencies of this Government.\n  He raises some legitimate points. He is angry. Many of us are angry \nabout this process that has gone too far. But may I remind my colleague \nfrom Arizona that this Democratic-led Congress has reduced the number \nof earmarks by 50 percent, has made every single one transparent, has \ngone through an open and public process, and none, to my knowledge--on \nthe testimony of the chairman of the committee who is on the floor \nnow--has been put in at any time in a closed-door conference session, \nwhich was done routinely when the other side was in charge. While it is \nnot perfect, while investigations must continue to go on and people \nmust be held accountable, the Senator from Arizona knows he is not the \nonly one angry, he is not the only one helping to lead this reform \neffort. President Obama himself has done a great deal of work on this \nsubject, and we will continue to.\n  The second point I would like to make as an appropriator and one who \ndoes have directed spending in this bill is that since when did every \nauthorizing committee turn out to be perfect in their authorization \nlanguage? Since when did every bill that goes through every committee \ncome out to a perfect end? We have a long list of bills and \nauthorization programs that did not work, that were ineffective. So \nsince when is it appropriate to come and say every authorization is \nperfect, but those things that were debated openly in the \nappropriations committee--testimony given, evidence in support of some \nof these programs--are all put in sort of a subcategory? I resent that.\n  This is a balance between authorizers and appropriators. It always \nhas been and probably always will be. What we need to do is get back to \na balance, which was completely out of whack when the Republicans were \nin charge of the budget process. As Democrats are trying, with some of \nour colleagues' support, to get a handle on this situation, I think the \npublic is at least pleased that we are moving in that direction. We do \nhave a ways to go. I certainly will admit that. With the leadership of \nSenator Inouye, I think we are making some progress.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 596\n\n  On the Coburn amendment No. 596, I rise in opposition to it. It is a \ndifficult amendment to oppose because on its face it seems as if it \nmakes a great deal of sense. In fact, there was a strong vote for it on \nanother bill. But I rise in opposition on this point alone: The \namendment calls for everything in the bill to be competitively bid. On \nits face, it sounds like the right thing to do. Most people do put \ncontracts out for competitive bid in the private sector. But there are \nany number of times the private sector does not do that. In the public \nsector, there are any number of reasons--whether it is special \nintelligence procurement; whether it is in the small business sector; \nwhether it is programs that reach out especially to veterans where \nthere are certain new technologies that have to be sole-sourced and not \ncompetitively bid--there are any number. The Senator from Oklahoma \nknows that very well. He is actually on the Homeland Security Committee \nand, I believe, the subcommittee that has jurisdiction. Mr. President, \nyou and I serve on that committee with him. There is a way to go about \nnarrowing or making sure that most of the Federal procurement is done \nthrough competitive bid. Not on this bill. Not this day. Not at this \ntime.\n  It is not as if there are not some good arguments, but that is the \nproblem with these amendments. They are not here to try to change and \nreform, contrary to what the others talk about. They are here to stop, \nto delay, to derail, to cause something to fail. They are not here in a \nconstructive way.\n  That is why I am urging my colleagues to oppose Coburn amendment No. \n596, to vote down the McCain and others amendments that have been \noffered--not because they do not have some kernels of truth in what \nthey are trying to do, but this is not the time to do it and this is \nnot the bill.\n  Finally, because I know my colleague from Missouri is here to speak, \nand others, I wish to take a moment, if I may, to pay tribute to a \nyoung man who worked for me for many years--actually, for 12 years.\n  (The remarks of Ms. LANDRIEU are printed in today's Record under \n``Morning Business.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Missouri is recognized.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. McCASKILL and Mr. UDALL of Colorado pertaining \nto the submission of S. Res. 63 are located in today's Record under \n``Submission of Concurrent and Senate Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DORGAN. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 596\n\n  Mr. DORGAN. Mr. President, we will vote this afternoon on a number of \namendments to the Omnibus appropriations bill. I want to comment \nbriefly on one of them, and that is the Coburn amendment No. 596. That \namendment presumably requires competitive bidding procedures to award \ncontracts. That is a subject for which I have very strong support. I am \nall in favor of competitive bidding. I am tired of seeing sole-source \ncontracts and contracts that go to special companies. I have held 18 \nhearings on the subject of contracting in Iraq. I have seen the most \nunbelievable waste, fraud and abuse that has ever happened in the \nhistory of this country. So sign me up as somebody who believes in \ncompetitive bidding and contracts. But let me make the point that this \namendment goes way beyond the goal of requiring competitive bidding in \nsupport of saving the taxpayers money. This amendment does something \nmuch more than that.\n  This amendment--because it has not come through a committee and is \nnot the product of a committee hearing--people don't understand. For \nexample, it would set back 30 years of progress with respect to Indian \ncommunities and tribal governments where we have pursued something \ncalled Indian self-determination. The approach for self-determination \non Indian reservations is to allow those tribal governments to access \nsome of the funds in the programs designed explicitly for tribal \ngovernments dealing with housing, health care, education, and law \nenforcement. This amendment would essentially deny them opportunities \nto access those funds and move them off into a completely different \nprocess. It undermines the whole notion of self-determination for \nIndian reservations.\n  I know that is not what was intended by the author. I know that is \nnot what was intended. But we should not, in any event, here in the \ntwelfth hour, consider amendments that have not been the part of any \nhearing I am aware of. We should not pass legislation that would have \nthe consequence\n\n[[Page S2749]]\n\nof undermining 30 years of progress. This progress is moving towards \nself-determination on Indian reservations where tribal governments are \nable to access those funds explicitly to best use them to benefit their \ntribal government.\n  We have the most significant poverty, unemployment, health care \ncrisis, and homelessness anywhere in this country on Indian \nreservations. Many of them are living in Third World conditions. Health \ncare is being rationed. It ought to be front-page news. Forty percent \nof the health care needs for American Indians is unmet. We have kids \nand elders dying because the money isn't there to provide adequate \nhealth care. The same is true with respect to education and housing. We \nhave tried over the period to begin moving in the direction of self-\ndetermination in which, rather than have someone in some agency decide \nhow tribes must address their housing or health care issue, self-\ndetermination for tribes allows them to begin to use that funding to \nbest address their needs. I don't think anybody wants to upend the \nprogram. That wouldn't make any sense. We don't want to have a \ncircumstance where we subvert progress that we have made in recent \nyears on self-determination for Indian tribes.\n  This is only one issue. I am sure there are dozens with respect to \nthis amendment. I couldn't support an amendment that, while it sounds \ngood, has significant, unintended consequences for the first Americans. \nThe first Americans were here to meet us, they are those who now live \nin substantial poverty, and those for whom legislation dealing with \nself-determination has tried to help by moving in a different \ndirection. We should not undermine that. We should not in any way \ninjure that approach to try to improve life on American Indian \nreservations. That is not the intent of the author, but I know that \nwill be the consequence.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in voting against the amendment.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. DeMINT. Mr. President, it was great to hear Mrs. McCaskill, the \nSenator from Missouri, speaking on the floor. She has been a real \nchampion of fighting one of the real causes of excess spending and \nwaste in Washington. She came down to talk about earmarks. In this \ncase, she was talking about Republican earmarks. I congratulate her \nbecause we have to go after them all. If there is one thing in this \nwhole Congress that is bipartisan, it is earmarks. If America wants to \nknow how well bipartisanship works, you can look at earmarks because \nwhen it comes to wasteful spending, there is great bipartisan agreement \nhere in the Congress that as long as we get our pork, as long as we get \nour political projects we can take back home, then we will vote for \nwhatever is in the bill no matter how big it is.\n  Senator McCaskill, though relatively new to the Senate, has been \nwilling to take on not just my party but her own in fighting this root \ncause of much of the wasteful spending in Washington. So I commend her \nvery much for coming to the floor, not just today but many other times.\n  She has worked with me on several earmark-related bills. She \nsupported a 1-year moratorium on earmarks, which then-candidate Senator \nObama flew back to vote to suspend earmarks for a year so we could look \nat ways to reform them so we would not continue this pattern of very \nwasteful spending.\n  I honestly believe the reason we are looking at trillion dollar bills \ntoday is because of this whole earmarking process. This $400 billion \nOmnibus appropriations bill we are considering this week, I am \nconvinced would be voted down if the leadership on both sides had not \nsprinkled earmarks for about every Member of the House and the Senate. \nIt is a way to pass bills that otherwise would not pass.\n  I do need to correct one thing Senator McCaskill mentioned, which is \nthis idea that since the Democrats took over the majority, they have \ncut earmarks in half. I wish that were true, but, unfortunately, it is \nnot. If you look at this chart I have in the Chamber, earmarks have \ngrown under bipartisan agreement for years.\n  As we came into 2006, we began--several of us in the Senate and the \nHouse were putting increasing pressure on both sides to cut the number \nof earmarks, and they dropped a little bit. But this lower figure here, \nas shown on the chart, came as the Republicans had lost the majority in \nthe election but had not yet given up the majority in that January. A \nnumber of us held back an omnibus bill with thousands of earmarks in \nit, and we ended the year 2007 with less earmarks than we had had in \nalmost 10 years.\n  But, as you see, under the Democratic majority, it is already back to \nthe second highest number, counting this omnibus we are talking about \nthis week with over 9,000 new earmarks which are totally unnecessary, \ntotally against the things that have been said in the last election, \nthat in 2009, at least counting as of this week, we are nearly at \n12,000--the second highest in history. So neither party can boast we \nhave done anything significant about earmarks.\n  As America looks in, they are becoming increasingly outraged at this \nflagrant waste we are shamelessly involved with every week. So I \ncommend Senator McCaskill for taking on both parties, senior Members in \nboth parties, on this earmark issue.\n  But the real issue now comes back to leadership in our country, and \nis there anyone in Washington with the power to change this who is \nwilling to take on the issue. My hope has been since the last election \nthat while I know I will disagree with President Obama on a number of \nthings, it was my understanding and my hope he would keep his word on \nfighting earmarks. He certainly talked about it during his election.\n  He said, in April of 2008: We can no longer accept a process that \ndoles out earmarks based on a Member of Congress's seniority rather \nthan the merit of the project.\n  He said, in October of 2008: We need earmark reform, and when I'm \nPresident, I will go line by line to make sure we're not spending money \nunwisely.\n  But, last week, his Budget Director said: This omnibus we are talking \nabout this year is last year's business. We just need to move on.\n  So I guess this week we have suspended the Presidency, we have \nsuspended hope and change, and we have gone back to nearly 12,000 \nearmarks.\n  Senator McCaskill said: Do not take anyone seriously who says one \nthing and does another. That is the worst sin of all.\n  What I am afraid of, at this point in the new Presidency, is that the \nonly change that has occurred in Washington is the change with the \nPresident himself. This is an issue he said he would help us on. This \nis an issue he said he knew was a core problem of waste and corruption \nhere in Washington. This is not a Republican or Democratic issue. \nNeither party can sit down here and say they are righteous in this. But \nboth parties need to come to the understanding, the realization, that \nthis earmarking process is destroying our whole work as a Congress.\n  You see, what this has done is this has trained the American people \nto believe that our purpose here in Washington is to take money home to \nour States and congressional districts. It is teaching the American \npeople that we use earmarks as a reward to help those groups and \norganizations that helped us get elected. Or we use taxpayer money to \nbail out people who have been irresponsible in their decisionmaking.\n  But what we have forgotten is that our constitutional oath is to \ndefend and protect the Constitution of the United States of America, \nnot to get projects for our district. But what earmarking has done has \nperverted the whole purpose of this Congress. Instead of working on \nfixing a Tax Code that is destroying our economic base in this country, \nand overseeing our financial system to keep it from financial collapse, \nand fixing Social Security and Medicare so we can keep our promises to \nseniors, and defending our country by funding the military properly--\ninstead of doing that, we spend most of\n\n[[Page S2750]]\n\nthe year here in Washington figuring out which local roads and bridges \nand water and sewer plants and bike paths we are going to build.\n  In this omnibus bill or ominous bill--whatever you want to call it--\nit is hard to read the list and then think about the rhetoric of how \ntreacherous these times are, how difficult they are, and that every \npenny we spend of taxpayer money has to go to help our economy and help \nthe American people.\n  What does $1.8 million for swine odor and manure management research \nhave to do with these difficult times we are in, or $200,000 for a \ntattoo removal violence prevention outreach program, or $75,000 for a \nTotally Teen Zone where people can play Xbox?\n\n  Folks, if I read this, it is only going to make you madder and madder \nand madder. This is a mix of Republican and Democratic earmarks. You \nwould hear a lot of Senators say: I know this is a bad bill, I know it \nis wasteful, but I have something in it for back home. I can't vote \nagainst it.\n  There is only one person in Washington who can stop all this because \nCongressmen and Senators will say, similar to a bunch of drunks: I am \nnot going to drink as much tomorrow. But they don't have the power to \nstop themselves. I have become convinced, after 10 years of being in \nthe House and the Senate, we don't have the power to stop ourselves.\n  There is one person in Washington who can lead on this issue and he \nsaid he would lead on this issue and he said this is a change we could \nexpect from his administration. The President should veto this omnibus \nbill with over 9,000 earmarks in it--9,000 of what I am reading here. \nIt takes money. They say: It is not that much money; oh, it is just $7 \nbillion or $8 billion or whatever; but the reason we are passing a $400 \nbillion bill that we should not be passing right now is because it has \nthese earmarks in it.\n  The reason you won't see very many people on the floor of this Senate \ncome in and vote no is because they have something in it for back home \nthat they have already done a press release on, taking credit and \nbeating their chests for taking home the bacon, but the taxpayers are \npaying for it. Folks are getting more and more outraged, and I am, too, \nbecause I have children and I have grandchildren now and I know we are \ntaking all these millions of dollars and putting it on their backs for \nthe rest of their lives and taking credit for our little projects in \nour press reports.\n  There is only one person who can stop this; the person America counts \non today for changing the way we do business in Washington. After only \na month in office, if this system has changed him rather than him \nchanging the system, then we are all in trouble. We have not reduced \nearmarks, and we are on track to have the highest number of earmarks in \nhistory within the next year, in a bipartisan fashion. There is nothing \nnoble about combining bad ideas from both parties and calling it \nbipartisanship, and that is what we are doing here today.\n  I would encourage the President to threaten a veto of this bill, to \nfollow through on a veto of this bill, and make this Congress send this \nbill back to committee and do the things America needs instead of the \nthings we want politically to help us get elected in our next election \nthat is coming up.\n  I wish to thank, again, the Senator from Missouri, Mrs. McCaskill, \nfor bringing up this issue and having the courage to fight both parties \non a very important issue to our country.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, on behalf of the leadership, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Senate now proceed to vote in relation to \nthe Coburn amendment No. 596; that no amendment be in order to the \namendment prior to a vote; that upon disposition of amendment No. 596, \nthe Senate resume consideration of the Coburn amendment No. 608; and \nthat there be 20 minutes of debate remaining with respect to the \namendment, with no amendment in order to the amendment prior to a vote \nin relation thereto; with the time equally divided and controlled \nbetween Senators Leahy and Coburn or their designees; that upon the use \nof that time, the Senate proceed to vote in relation to amendment No. \n608.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I wish to clarify the time. There is no \ntime at this moment, but it will be soon.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, prohibiting no-bid contracts is a laudable \ngoal. With billions of dollars wasted on no-bid contracts by the \nprevious administration, it is a goal that Democrats and Republicans \nshould embrace.\n  But Amendment No. 596 which is disguised as a good government \namendment does far more harm than good.\n  This amendment would require that only procedures in accordance with \nsection 303 of the Federal Property Administrative Services Act would \nbe eligible to receive funds.\n  The result would be to strictly limit opportunities for small \nbusinesses, minority-owned businesses and Native Americans to receive \nagency contracts.\n  The Indian Self-Determination Act and the Native American Housing \nAssistance and Self-Determination Act allow tribes to provide \ngovernmental services to their members by entering contracts and \nreceiving grants. Requiring these contracts and grants to go through a \ncompetitive process would undermine the purposes of tribal self-\ndetermination.\n  The tribes in Nevada and throughout America know how to best serve \ntheir members' interests. Tribes enter contracts with the Bureau of \nIndian Affairs and the Indian Health Services to provide these \nservices. This amendment threatens their authority to do so.\n  Enacting this amendment would roll back years of Small Business and \nIndian Affairs Committee authorizations by requiring that all contracts \nbe awarded through just one specific section of one specific law.\n  Small businesses employ more than half of our country's private \nsector workforce. If we pass this resolution and deny these small \nbusinesses the ability to compete on a level playing field, we will be \nseverely impeding our country's desperately needed job creation engine.\n  Congress has authorized a number of procedures over the years to help \nsmall businesses, veteran-owned businesses, minority-owned businesses \nand tribal enterprises gain access to government contracts. We have \ndone so on a strong bipartisan basis because we recognize that small \nbusinesses are able to provide the same level of skill and service as \ntheir larger counterparts. We should continue giving these small \ncompanies a fair chance to earn business, prosper, grow and create the \njobs our country desperately needs.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask for the yeas and nays on the Coburn \namendment No. 596.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There appears to \nbe.\n  The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. \nConrad) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Nebraska (Mr. Johanns) and the Senator from Alabama (Mr. \nSessions).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 608\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There will now be 20 minutes of debate prior \nto a vote on amendment No. 608 of the Senator from Oklahoma. Who yields \ntime?\n  The Senator from Oklahoma is recognized.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 608\n\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this amendment is a very straightforward \namendment. This Senate made a commitment last year through the Emmett \nTill Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act that we would fund in this bill \nmoney to be applied to the Justice Department to start and bring up to \na level that is appropriate the funding of the investigative, \nprosecutorial, and other necessary agencies with which to go after \nthese unsolved crimes.\n  The reason it is important is that in most of these crimes, the \nwitnesses are very elderly. So the timeliness of it is very important.\n  It is interesting today that the other side produced a letter from \nthe Attorney General that states exactly the opposite position they \ntook last year when I opposed trying to get the money to pay for this \nbill. They bring forth a letter that says Attorney General Holder is \ngoing to make sure we try to do this within the funds he has. That is \nthe very argument I made last year, but it was not good enough. So we \nhad hundreds of press releases go out on all these things we are going \nto do on the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime Act. Yet when it \ncomes time to fund it this year, we cannot find $10 million in a $410 \nbillion bill to do it. Either we mean to do it and we mean to uphold \nthe promise we made to this group that has worked hard to have that \nbill passed or we are full of hot air.\n  This amendment takes $10 million from a program that has questionable \nresults in half of its grant money. I will not go into the details of \nit. Yet we will not fund this bill. I said last year on the Senate \nfloor, we will see if you fund it. And sure enough, you didn't fund it. \nSo you didn't keep your commitment, you didn't keep your commitment to \nAlvin Sykes, a guy who has worked 10 years to get that bill passed. And \nnow we come up and say we will take care of it through the \nadministration, which was the very argument I used that said we didn't \nneed increased authorization. Now all of a sudden you say that is good \nenough. Well, it is not good enough. It breaks your commitment to fully \nfund this program to bring to justice those who committed these \nterrible crimes.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time is available in opposition to \nthis amendment?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Ten minutes.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I recall the young man who killed his \nparents and threw himself at the mercy of the court saying: You have to \ngive me mercy, I am now an orphan. I have heard that line used before \non this floor and I use it again in this instance because I hope we can \ntell the truth about what happened on the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil \nRights Crime Act.\n  I worked very hard over the last two years with Senator Dodd and \nCongressman Lewis to pass the Emmett Till Unsolved Civil Rights Crime \nAct to provide resources for the Department of Justice and Federal \nBureau of Investigation to investigate and prosecute decades-old \nunsolved civil rights cold case crimes. It could have been law earlier \nhad not Republican opposition obstructed its enactment. We tried to get \nthis bill through the Senate. It was being held up. Now, after the \nefforts to stop it from becoming law in the first place, we are told: \nOh, my gosh, my Emmett Till bill, which I love so much, you are not \nfunding it right. That is not right. This should have been a \nnoncontroversial bill and it should not have taken several Congresses \nto pass.\n  Indeed, passage ended years of opposition by Senator Coburn and \nothers across the aisle. In June 2007, we unsuccessfully attempted to \nget Senate consideration and passage of the bill by unanimous consent. \nSenator Coburn placed a hold on the Till bill. The Senator from \nOklahoma also announced that he opposed the Till bill because the FBI \nis already investigating and prosecuting old civil rights cases and \nbecause crimes committed before 1970 cannot be prosecuted under most \nFederal civil rights statutes.\n  Majority Leader Reid included the Emmett Till bill in the Advancing \nAmerica's Priorities Act, S. 3297, last summer. It was still opposed by \nthe Senator from Oklahoma who objected to its consideration.\n  I worked for months to have it considered and passed as a separate \nstand alone measure. I have to thank Senator Dodd and Representative \nJohn Lewis for their leadership and hard work in persevering and \ngetting it through the full Senate over the objection and the \nroadblocks of the Senator from Oklahoma. I was happy when he finally \nended his opposition, after much public criticism, and I told him so at \nthe time. After he lifted his hold, the full Senate passed the Till \nbill unanimously by voice vote. Senator Coburn announced that he \n``can't convince'' his colleagues that ``there are plenty of funds'' at \nJustice to probe these old crimes, so he decided to lift his hold.\n  I am glad that Senator Coburn finally ended his opposition to the \nEmmett Till bill. I know that he now likes to emphasize that he \nbelatedly became a supporter of the bill, but that was after years of \nhaving stalled its passage. Regrettably, the current Coburn amendment \nappears to be as mischievous as was his unsuccessful amendment to the \nDistrict of Columbia House voting rights bill last week. It should \nsuffer the same fate. It should not delay or deter passage of the \nOmnibus appropriations bill that needs to be passed by the Senate and \nsigned by the President this week.\n  This special ``earmark'' that the Senator from Oklahoma is proposing \nis just not needed. Its functional impact if accepted would be to \nprevent enactment of the Omnibus appropriations bill this week and \nforce it to be reconsidered by the House of Representatives. At a time \nwhen confidence and funding of our Nation's institutions is critical, \nwe should not be playing games with funding. We need to get it done. We \nneed to work together to solve the Nation's problems.\n  In fact, this Omnibus appropriations bill increases funding for the \nJustice Department, specifically for the Civil Rights Division, and \nalready increases funding available to Emmett Till-type investigations \nand grants. I doubt that anyone in the Senate is a stronger supporter \nof Federal assistance to State and local law enforcement than I. \nProviding that support will take place when the Omnibus appropriations \nbill is enacted and we can provide the increased funding at last year's \nappropriated levels and the funding in the continuing resolution. I \nbelieve the best way to move forward, if we support the Emmett Till \nbill and care to solve unsolved civil rights era crimes, is to pass the \nOmnibus appropriations bill without adding this additional, unnecessary \n``earmark.''\n  The able chair of the Appropriations Subcommittee, a long-time \nsupporter of the Emmett Till bill, has set forth, not only does the \nCivil Rights Division get more funding under the bill, not only does \nthe inspector general receive more funding under the bill, but $30 \nmillion is available under the bill for competitive funds for States \nand local jurisdictions, including for investigating and prosecuting \ncivil rights violations. In addition, the increased funding for U.S. \nattorneys' offices, something for which some of us have been fighting \nfor years, is significant; the funding for grants to State forensic \nlabs is significant; and there is more than $150 million to reduce the \nbacklog of offender profiles and untested DNA, something we have fought \nfor in the Debbie Smith Act for years.\n\n[[Page S2752]]\n\n  Does anybody doubt Attorney General Holder is sensitive to these \nmatters? Of course he is. Our first African-American Attorney General \ndoes not need to be lectured or mandated on investigating heinous \ncrimes committed against African Americans during the civil rights era. \nHe has spoken about his dedication to restoring the Civil Rights \nDivision. He will demonstrate his commitment. Indeed, in his recent \nletter to Chairwoman Mikulski he reiterates the Justice Department's \n``wholehearted'' support for the goals of the Emmett Till Unsolved \nCivil Rights Crime Act, notes some of the actions the Department has \nalready taken, and states his ``personal commitment'' to pursue these \nmatters. Ironically, Senator Coburn voted against the nomination of \nEric Holder, as well.\n  I join Chairman Inouye, the distinguished chair of the Appropriations \nCommittee; Chairwoman Mikulski, the chair of the Appropriations \nSubcommittee; Senator Dodd, the author of the Emmett Till Unsolved \nCivil Rights Crime Act; and the majority leader in opposing this \namendment at this time on this legislation.\n  Our interest is actually in going after these unsolved crimes, not in \ntrying to add a poison pill amendment to the bill on the Senate floor. \nThat is what we did, we fought for years over the objection of the \nSenator from Oklahoma to get the Emmett Till bill passed. Let's not now \nkill it with an amendment on the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Connecticut.\n  Mr. DODD. Mr. President, I will be very brief. Senator Leahy \ndescribed the situation very well. One name that was not mentioned in \nthe discussion here was Jim Talent, a former colleague of ours from \nMissouri, a former Republican Member of this body who was the principal \nauthor of the Emmett Till legislation. I was his cosponsor, and when he \nleft, I became the lead sponsor and others joined on both sides of the \naisle to adopt this legislation to pursue unsolved civil rights cases.\n  I say to my friend from Oklahoma, I am pleased we resolved it. He had \nsome problems not so much with the idea of investigating unsolved \nmatters. His concern was, if I recall, whether the matter ought to be \nauthorized without having an offset at the time. As I recall, that was \nthe debate.\n  We went a year, maybe longer, while this was held up and we were not \nable to adopt it. The argument is that had we done so, when it finally \npassed unanimously in this body, it was after the Commerce-Justice-\nScience appropriations bill was adopted. So it was too late to get the \nfunding in that proposal. As a result, we ended up with an \nauthorization.\n  As Senator Leahy has pointed out, Eric Holder has testified, in fact, \nI think, in response to questions of my friend from Oklahoma, whether \nthere would be funding for this program during either his confirmation \nhearing or an appearance before the committee. He responded there was \nadequate funding. He said--I think his quote was at the time he would \n``figure out ways to try to move money around'' to investigate and \nprosecute these crimes.\n  Of course, under this omnibus bill before us, Department of Justice \nfunds can be used to investigate unsolved civil rights crimes. The \nmoney includes $123 million for the Civil Rights Division at the \nDepartment of Justice responsible for investigating cold cases, which \nis $7 million more than the fiscal year 2008 levels. There is an \nadditional $30 million for competitive funds for State and local \ngovernments. Eligible activities include expenses associated with \ninvestigating and prosecuting civil rights violations that are criminal \nin nature.\n  Obviously, as Senator Leahy and others have pointed out, it is \ncritically important we get this omnibus bill done or funding \naltogether will be eliminated. I say it is time we move forward. This \nhas been an important matter, the fact that we received unanimous \nsupport on this effort back a few months ago.\n  Jim Talent, who came up with the idea, thought we ought to pursue \nthese matters. I thought it was a worthy one. That is why I joined him \nin it. On a bipartisan basis, we stepped forward. It would be \nunfortunate at this hour to take this omnibus bill, which has resources \nto do that, to reject this and obviously send the whole matter into \nconference, which would delay the funding that is appropriated in this \nbill.\n  With that, I respectfully say to my friend from Oklahoma that I \nappreciate his support of the underlying concept and bill, that we \npursue these matters of unsolved civil rights cases. I welcome his \nparticipation in that. I strongly urge my colleagues respectfully to \nreject the amendment so we can move forward and provide the funding \nnecessary for the bill.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, first, I regret the inference that my \nobstruction to this bill was anything other than financial. To me it is \na fairly low blow to imply, by the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nthat I had a motivation other than financial. I am known in this body \nfor trying to make us more efficient and to save money.\n  The second thing is it is laughable to call it an earmark. It is \nauthorized. That is what we passed last year. It is authorized. It is \nauthorized by 100 Senators. The commitment that was made was that we \nwould fund it.\n  One of my negotiations for finally agreeing is that if you are going \nto do this and you are going to authorize it at $15 million a year, you \nought to at least fund it since the very statements were that we didn't \nhave the money within the Justice Department to do this the way the \nJustice Department was funded.\n  There is not one mention of this bill in either the report language \nor the text of the bill related to this particular act. So what we see \nis cover.\n  I truly wish to see us solve all these. But the game that is being \nplayed today is somebody forgot to fund it.\n  The final point I will make before my time runs out is that if this \ngets added, we are not going to not fund this. This bill is still going \nto pass, we are still going to do the hard work, and we are still going \nto fund the agencies. To imply otherwise is disingenuous.\n  This amendment was put up in a sincere effort to keep a commitment to \nAlvin Sykes, not to create mischief, not to be a bill killer, but to \ncreate a commitment. The last thing I told Alvin Sykes: You got it \nauthorized. Your problem is going to be getting it funded. He was \nassured by the office of Senator Dodd and others that it would be \nfunded. And what do you know, the bill comes through and it is not \nfunded. I don't know if it was a mistake. Just say it was a mistake and \nwe will take care of it in the next bill. But to deny the fact we made \na commitment and now are not keeping it and assign all sorts of motives \ndifferent than what they are is pretty distasteful, I would say.\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Vermont.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I was going back over the notes of what I \nsaid. I don't find anything where I ascribe any motives to the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma. I am shocked that he thought I had. If there is any \nimplication in the record that I was ascribing motive to my friend and \nvalued member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, it certainly was not \nintended. I did, however, relate the fact that he held up the bill for \nsome considerable period of time. That is a fact. That is in the \nRecord. That is known. I will let him explain why he held it up. I \nascribe no motives. In fact, in my 36 years in the Senate, I have not \nascribed motives to any colleague of mine, even if he or she placed a \nhold on a bill. I am not about to start now. The fact is, the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma did place a hold on the important Emmett Till bill. The \nfact is, the full Senate did pass it over his objection. The fact is, \nwe do have a letter from Eric Holder, the Attorney General, promising \nthat his Justice Department has already, and will continue, to commit \nits resources towards prosecuting civil rights era cold cases. The fact \nis, the money we want to have is already in the bill we consider today. \nAnd the fact is, we have to pass this bill with the appropriations in \nhere, including for the Department of Justice, so we can move forward \nas a nation. We must ensure that the Emmett Till bill is more than \nsimply a statute. It must also be an answer to the hopes of all \nAmericans that justice might finally occur in\n\n[[Page S2753]]\n\nso many of the unsolved civil rights cases.\n\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe letter from Eric Holder.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                         The Attorney General,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 3, 2009.\n     Hon. Barbara Mikulski,\n     Chairwoman, Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science and \n         Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, U.S. \n         Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Madam Chairwoman: The Department of Justice \n     wholeheartedly supports the goals of the Emmett Till Unsolved \n     Civil Rights Crime Act. The racially-motivated murders from \n     the civil rights era constitute some of the greatest \n     blemishes upon our history.\n       The Department is working in partnership with the National \n     Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the \n     Southern Poverty Law Center, and the National Urban League to \n     investigate the unsolved racially-motivated violent crimes \n     committed more than 40 years ago. The FBI has prioritized the \n     top dozen of these cases, though there are more than 100 \n     unsolved murder cases from the civil rights era under review \n     by the FBI.\n       You have my personal commitment that the Department will \n     continue to pursue these serious crimes in those matters in \n     which the law and the facts would permit effective law \n     enforcement action. We will continue to use our resources and \n     expertise to identify and locate those responsible for these \n     crimes and prosecute them whenever possible, consistent with \n     the Principles of Federal Prosecution.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Eric H. Holder, Jr.\n\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, how much time remains?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 20 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I withhold the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. There is 4\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. COBURN. I thank the Chair.\n  You know, it is interesting, when I hold bills it is hardly ever on \npolicy. Every one of you got a letter from me--everybody in this body--\nwhich said I will oppose all new legislation if you are spending new \nmoney unless you decrease authorization somewhere else. The American \npeople get that.\n  You can't keep growing the government and promising we will do \nthings. So we are seeing it wrung out--the true operations of the \nSenate--because what we are doing is promising something, but when it \ncomes down to dividing the pie, we don't have the money. So instead of \nrecalling our press releases, we don't fund them. We don't keep our \ncommitments.\n  No wonder the American people don't trust Congress. We play games. We \nmanipulate. This is something that should have had, and was committed \nto having, a line item in the appropriations bill to make sure this \nmoney funds what is necessary on a timely basis.\n  The letter the chairman of the Judiciary just submitted for the \nRecord has already been submitted for the Record. It was submitted this \nmorning. But it is ironic that the very argument I used in trying to \nget them to offset this bill last year is the very argument they are \nusing now to say we don't need to have a line item in the \nappropriations bill for it. It wasn't a good enough argument last year, \nbut it is a good enough argument now that you don't want to fund this \ndirectly.\n  This is a matter of timing. We ought to put the money in this on a \ntimely basis to make sure we solve these crimes. The witnesses are \ndying and the information is going away. Justice denied comes about \nbecause we are delaying justice. Regardless of the good intentions of \nthe Attorney General, we can force them to spend this money in that \nway, and the way to do that is to put a line item in the bill.\n  Mr. President, I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time?\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, there is very little time left to the \nSenator from Vermont. I serve on both the Appropriations Committee and \nalso as Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, the committee that \nhas oversight over the Department of Justice. The amendment of the \nSenator from Oklahoma to fund the Emmett Till bill is unnecessary and \nwould kill the overall appropriations. I will oppose it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this amendment would not kill this bill. \nWhat it will do is, it will go back to the House, and they will have to \nagree to it. Everybody knows that. We have known this day was coming \nfor a long time. Whatever the outcome, the fact is, those commitments \nweren't kept. We didn't do what we told the very people who worked very \nhard to accomplish this we would do, and it sheds a light on our body \nthat should not be there.\n  Mr. President, I yield back the remainder of my time, and I ask for \nthe yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the Coburn amendment.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. \nConrad) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senators are necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Nebraska (Mr. Johanns) and the Senator from Alabama (Mr. \nSessions).\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Are there any other Senators in the Chamber \ndesiring to vote?\n  The result was announced--yeas 37, nays 58, as follows:\n\n                      [Rollcall Vote No. 78 Leg.]\n\n                                YEAS--37\n\n     Alexander\n     Barrasso\n     Bennett\n     Bond\n     Brownback\n     Bunning\n     Burr\n     Chambliss\n     Coburn\n     Cochran\n     Collins\n     Corker\n     Cornyn\n     Crapo\n     DeMint\n     Ensign\n     Enzi\n     Graham\n     Grassley\n     Hatch\n     Hutchison\n     Inhofe\n     Isakson\n     Kyl\n     Lugar\n     Martinez\n     McCain\n     McCaskill\n     McConnell\n     Risch\n     Roberts\n     Shelby\n     Specter\n     Thune\n     Vitter\n     Voinovich\n     Wicker\n\n                                NAYS--58\n\n     Akaka\n     Baucus\n     Bayh\n     Begich\n     Bennet\n     Bingaman\n     Boxer\n     Brown\n     Burris\n     Byrd\n     Cantwell\n     Cardin\n     Carper\n     Casey\n     Dodd\n     Dorgan\n     Durbin\n     Feingold\n     Feinstein\n     Gillibrand\n     Gregg\n     Hagan\n     Harkin\n     Inouye\n     Johnson\n     Kaufman\n     Kerry\n     Klobuchar\n     Kohl\n     Landrieu\n     Lautenberg\n     Leahy\n     Levin\n     Lieberman\n     Lincoln\n     Menendez\n     Merkley\n     Mikulski\n     Murkowski\n     Murray\n     Nelson (FL)\n     Nelson (NE)\n     Pryor\n     Reed\n     Reid\n     Rockefeller\n     Sanders\n     Schumer\n     Shaheen\n     Snowe\n     Stabenow\n     Tester\n     Udall (CO)\n     Udall (NM)\n     Warner\n     Webb\n     Whitehouse\n     Wyden\n\n                             NOT VOTING--4\n\n     Conrad\n     Johanns\n     Kennedy\n     Sessions\n  The amendment (No. 608) was rejected.\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Mr. President, I move to reconsider the vote by which \nthe amendment was not agreed to.\n  Mr. REID. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader.\n  Mr. REID. We have a couple more amendments offered by the Senator \nfrom Oklahoma that we are going to try to dispose of this evening. It \nis my wish that we could do that about 5:30 this afternoon. So people \nwho wish to speak on the remaining two Coburn amendments should come \nand do that.\n  We do not have an agreement yet to that effect, but we are sure going \nto try to get to that. As everybody knows, there is an event at the \nWhite House that Senator McConnell and the chairmen and ranking members \nhave been invited to attend. We are going to do that. We are going to \nmove through as many of these amendments as we can tonight. I would \nlike to only get those two amendments voted on.\n  That means we have three that have already been filed, so we are \ngoing to come in early in the morning and start working on those. It is \nmy understanding that there are a number of other amendments people \nwant to offer. But I should alert everyone, we are kind of winding \ndown. We have tomorrow to work on this. But I would hope everyone would \nunderstand we have been through a lot of amendments, with no \nprerequisites as to what they are, and I think that unless something \nuntoward happens, I am going to\n\n[[Page S2754]]\n\nfile cloture on this tonight for a Friday morning cloture vote.\n  We will have to see at that time how many amendments we can dispose \nof tomorrow to see what the temperature of the body is. It would \ncertainly be possible, with a consent agreement, that we can dispose of \nthis tomorrow. But it is up to the Senators as to what they want to do. \nAs I have indicated, the CR expires on Friday. So we have to do \nsomething. I have told people this, but so there is no \nmisunderstanding, I have spoken, in fact with the Speaker last night, \nhad a meeting with her about 4:30 in the afternoon. She said: We have \nput our Members through a lot over here on this appropriations bill. I \nam not going to put them through any more. If there are any amendments, \nwe are going to do a CR for the rest of the year.\n  But the information I have given the Senate is nothing new. I said \nthat earlier this week. So we have had good debate on all these \namendments. I hope it continues.\n\n\n                      Amendments Nos. 607 and 635\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, while the leader is still here, I ask \nunanimous consent that the Thune amendment No. 635, and the Wicker \namendment No. 607 be modified with the changes that are at the desk.\n  Mrs. BOXER. Reserving the right to object, I have not seen those \nmodifications.\n  Now I am being told they are very minor. In that case I will not \nobject.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendments (Nos. 607 and 635), as modified, are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 607\n\n       On page 927, strike line 14 and all that follows through \n     page 929, line 20, and insert the following:\n       (b) Availability of Funds.--Funds appropriated under the \n     heading ``International Organizations and Programs'' in this \n     Act that are available for UNFPA and are not made available \n     for UNFPA because of the operation of any provision of law, \n     shall be transferred to the ``Global Health and Child \n     Survival'' account and shall be made available for family \n     planning, maternal, and reproductive health activities, \n     subject to the regular notification procedures of the \n     Committee on Appropriations of the Senate and the Committee \n     on Appropriations of the House of Representatives.\n       (c) Prohibition on Use of Funds in China.--None of the \n     funds made available under ``International Organizations and \n     Programs'' may be made available for the UNFPA for a country \n     program in the People's Republic of China.\n       (d) Conditions on Availability of Funds.--Amounts made \n     available under ``International Organizations and Programs'' \n     for fiscal year 2009 for the UNFPA may not be made available \n     to UNFPA unless--\n       (1) the UNFPA maintains amounts made available to the UNFPA \n     under this section in an account separate from other accounts \n     of the UNFPA;\n       (2) the UNFPA does not commingle amounts made available to \n     the UNFPA under this section with other sums; and\n       (3) the UNFPA does not fund abortions.\n       (e) Report to Congress and Dollar-for-Dollar Withholding of \n     Funds.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 4 months after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of State shall \n     submit a report to the Committee on Appropriations of the \n     Senate and the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives indicating the amount of funds that the UNFPA \n     is budgeting for the year in which the report is submitted \n     for a country program in the People's Republic of China.\n       (2) Deduction.--If a report submitted under paragraph (1) \n     indicates that the UNFPA plans to spend funds for a country \n     program in the People's Republic of China in the year covered \n     by the report, the amount of such funds that the UNFPA plans \n     to spend in the People's Republic of China shall be deducted \n     from the funds made available to the UNFPA after March 1 for \n     obligation for the remainder of the fiscal year in which the \n     report is submitted.\n       (f) Rule of Construction.--Nothing in this section may be \n     construed to limit the authority of the President to deny \n     funds to any organization by reason of the application of \n     another provision of this Act or any other provision of law.\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 635\n\n       On page 458, after line 25, insert the following:\n\n\n              emergency fund for indian safety and health\n\n        For deposit in the Emergency Fund for Indian Safety and \n     Health established by subsection (a) of section 601 of the \n     Tom Lantos and Henry J.

The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, in deference to the majority leader's \nrequest, I will not ask that amendment No. 635--\n  Mr. REID. Would my friend withhold for a unanimous consent request?\n  Mr. KYL. I will.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the votes in \nrelation to the Coburn amendments Nos. 610 and 623 occur at 5:35 p.m. \ntoday with no amendments in order to either amendment prior to a vote; \nand that the votes occur in the order listed with 2 minutes of debate \nequally divided prior to the second vote; and that the second vote be \n10 minutes in duration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Mr. INHOFE. Reserving the right to object, I will not object, but I \nwould like to make an inquiry, if I could, of the majority. I have been \ntrying to get up a noncontroversial amendment for a long period of \ntime. It is one that has actually been on this legislation since 1996, \nsupported by Democrats and Republicans. I have to have an opportunity \nto get this thing up.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I indicated to the Republican floor staff \nthat that is one amendment we are aware is going to be offered. We hope \nto be able to start offering those as soon as we finish the votes this \nevening--at least yours and maybe a couple others we will consider, the \none amendment Senator Kyl is going to speak on now.\n  I asked Senator Kerry, the chairman of the committee, to take a look \nat it before we make an agreement on it, but yours is one we are aware \nof. We understand it. We are ready. I would only say to my friend from \nOklahoma, I do not know what word you used--noncontroversial or \nwhatever it is--that is in the eye of the beholder.\n  Mr. INHOFE. That is also in the eye of the majority of Democrats and \nRepublicans in the last 17 years.\n  Mr. REID. But the majority has changed.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I was going to offer for consideration my \namendment No. 634, but I will do that after the second vote at the \nrequest of the majority leader. Let me take a couple minutes right now \nto explain what this amendment is.\n  During the Presidential campaign, President Obama said:\n\n       If we can impose the kinds of sanctions that, say, for \n     example, Iran right now imports gasoline, even though it's an \n     oil-producer, because its oil infrastructure has broken down, \n     if we can prevent them from importing the gasoline that they \n     need and the refined petroleum products, that starts changing \n     their cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze \n     on them.\n\n  Indeed, I think the President is exactly right about that. I know of \nno disagreement with that proposition. I also think there would be no \ndisagreement with the proposition that U.S. taxpayers should not be \nsupporting Iran's energy sector. As a result, I have offered or I will \nbe offering this amendment No. 634 that does exactly that. It says very \nsimply: That none of the funds made available in this appropriations \nlegislation, can go to companies helping Iran either import or export \nenergy or energy-related goods.\n  It also does give the President the authority to waive the provision \nif he deems it necessary for a valid national security reason.\n  Two quick points for colleagues who may say: Well, of course, we are \nnot going to allow any of this money to go to companies that provide \nthis kind of relief to Iran's energy sector. I would note two examples. \nSenator Lieberman and I sent a letter to the Export-Import Bank last \nOctober because the bank gave $900 million to loan guarantees to a \ncompany that was exporting gasoline to Iran. When we asked the bank \nwhether it thought the taxpayers should be funding those kinds of \nbenefits to Iran, one of the points raised in the response to me, one \nthat was, by the way, rather indirect in answering the question I asked \nwas:\n\n       The Ex-Im Bank generally is prohibited from taking foreign \n     policy determinations\n\n[[Page S2755]]\n\n     into account when making credit decisions pursuant to its \n     Charter.\n\n  Well, of course, those are the kinds of considerations the American \ntaxpayers would want to be taken into account. I would also note, on \nMonday, the Wall Street Journal noted that several of our colleagues \nfrom the other body wrote to the Secretary of Energy concerning a \npurchase of crude oil from another company doing business in Iran's \nenergy sector. In this case, the company is named Vitol, a Netherlands \ntrading firm that was fined $17.5 million after a jury convicted the \ncompany for criminal misdeeds related to the oil-for-food scandal.\n  Obviously, the U.S. Government should not be doing business with a \ncompany such as that.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that a piece from the American \nForeign Policy Council by Orde Kittrie and carried, I believe, in the \nWall Street Journal, be printed in the Record at the end of my \ncomments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (See exhibit 1.)\n  Mr. KYL. I would hope when my colleagues have an opportunity to vote \non this amendment, they will agree that ensuring the appropriate use of \nAmerican taxpayer money is important, it is one of our obligations. We \nagree with the President that is the kind of thing we can do to put \nsome pressure on Iran, and as a result, we should not be sending our \nmoney to companies that would be supporting the energy sector in Iran.\n  I appreciate my colleagues' consideration of the amendment when we \nhave an opportunity to offer it, debate it, and vote on it.\n\n                               Exhibit 1\n\n             [From the Wall Street Journal, Nov. 13, 2008]\n\n                     How to Put the Squeeze on Iran\n\n\n Cutting off its gasoline imports may be the only peaceful way to get \n             Tehran to abandon its nuclear weapons program\n\n                          (By Orde F. Kittrie)\n\n       If Barack Obama is to persuade Iran to negotiate away its \n     illegal nuclear weapons program, he will first need to \n     generate more leverage than what the Bush administration is \n     leaving him with. The current U.N. sanctions have proven too \n     weak to dissuade Tehran's leaders, and Russia and China seem \n     determined to keep those sanctions weak. Meanwhile, the \n     regime continues to insist there are no incentives in \n     exchange for which it would halt or even limit its nuclear \n     work.\n       However, Tehran has an economic Achilles' heel--its \n     extraordinarily heavy dependence on imported gasoline. This \n     dependence could be used by the United States to peacefully \n     create decisive leverage over the Islamic Republic.\n       Iranian oil wells produce far more petroleum (crude oil) \n     than Iran needs. Yet, remarkably for a country investing so \n     much in nuclear power, Iran has not developed sufficient \n     capacity to refine that crude oil into gasoline and diesel \n     fuel. As a result, it must import some 40% of the gasoline it \n     needs for internal consumption.\n       In recent months, Iran has, according to the respected \n     trade publication International Oil Daily and other sources \n     including the U.S. government, purchased nearly all of this \n     gasoline from just five companies, four of them European: the \n     Swiss firm Vitol; the Swiss/Dutch firm Trafigura; the French \n     firm Total; British Petroleum; and one Indian company, \n     Reliance Industries. If these companies stopped supplying \n     Iran, the Iranians could replace only some of what they \n     needed from other suppliers--and at a significantly higher \n     price. Neither Russia nor China could serve as alternative \n     suppliers. Both are themselves also heavily dependent on \n     imports of the type of gasoline Iran needs.\n       Were these companies to stop supplying gasoline to Iran, \n     the world-wide price of oil would be unaffected--the \n     companies would simply sell to other buyers. But the impact \n     on Iran would be substantial.\n       When Tehran attempted to ration gasoline during the summer \n     of 2007, violent protests forced the regime to back down. \n     Cutting off gasoline sales to Iran, or even a significant \n     reduction, could have an even more dramatic effect.\n       In Congress, there is already bipartisan support for \n     peacefully cutting off gasoline sales to Iran until it stops \n     its illicit nuclear activities. Barack Obama, John McCain and \n     the House of Representatives have all declared their support.\n       On June 4 of this year, for example, Sen. Obama said at a \n     speech in Washington, D.C.: ``We should work with Europe, \n     Japan and the Gulf states to find every avenue outside the \n     U.N. to isolate the Iranian regime--from cutting off loan \n     guarantees and expanding financial sanctions, to banning the \n     export of refined petroleum to Iran.''\n       He repeated this sentiment during the presidential \n     candidates' debate on Oct. 7: ``Iran right now imports \n     gasoline . . . if we can prevent them from importing the \n     gasoline that they need . . . that starts changing their \n     cost-benefit analysis. That starts putting the squeeze on \n     them.''\n       How do we stop the gasoline from flowing? The Bush \n     administration has reportedly never asked the Swiss, Dutch, \n     French, British or Indian governments to stop gasoline sales \n     to Iran by the companies headquartered within their borders. \n     An Obama administration should make this request, and do the \n     same with other governments if other companies try to sell \n     gasoline to Iran.\n       But the U.S. also has significant direct leverage over the \n     companies that currently supply most of Iran's imported \n     gasoline.\n       Consider India's Reliance Industries which, according to \n     International Oil Daily, ``reemerged as a major supplier of \n     gasoline to Iran'' in July after taking a break for several \n     months. It ``delivered three cargoes of gasoline totaling \n     around 100,000 tons to Iran's Mideast Gulf port of Bandar \n     Abbas from its giant Jamnagar refinery in India's western \n     province of Gujarat.'' Reliance reportedly ``entered into a \n     new arrangement with National Iranian Oil Co. (NIOC) under \n     which it will supply around . . . three 35,000-ton cargoes a \n     month, from its giant Jamnagar refinery.'' One hundred \n     thousand tons represents some 10% of Iran's total monthly \n     gasoline needs.\n       The Jamnagar refinery is heavily supported by U.S. taxpayer \n     dollars. In May 2007, the U.S. Export-Import Bank, a \n     government agency that assists in financing the export of \n     U.S. goods and services, announced a $500 million loan \n     guarantee to help finance expansion of the Jamnagar refinery. \n     On Aug. 28, 2008, Ex-Im announced a new $400 million long-\n     term loan guarantee for Reliance, including additional \n     financing of work at the Jamnagar refinery.\n       Or consider the Swiss firm Vitol. According to \n     International Oil Daily, Vitol ``over the past few years has \n     accounted for around 60% of the gasoline shipped to Iran.'' \n     Vitol is currently building a $100 million terminal in Port \n     Canaveral, Florida.\n       Last year, when Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty discovered that \n     an Indian company, Essar, was seeking to both invest some \n     $1.6 billion in Minnesota and invest over $5 billion in \n     building a refinery in Iran, he put Essar to a choice. Mr. \n     Pawlenty threatened to block state infrastructure subsidies \n     and perhaps even construction permits for the Minnesota \n     purchase unless Essar withdrew from the Iranian investment. \n     Essar promptly withdrew from the Iranian investment.\n       Florida officials could consider taking a similar stance \n     with Vitol.\n       The Minnesota example is not the only precedent. U.S. \n     outreach to foreign banks and to oil companies considering \n     investing in Iran's energy sector has reportedly convinced \n     more than 80 banks and several major potential oil-field \n     investors to cease all or some of their business with Iran. \n     Among them: Germany's two largest banks (Deutsche Bank and \n     Commerzbank), London-based HSBC, Credit Suisse, Norwegian \n     energy company StatoilHydro, and Royal Dutch Shell.\n       A sustained initiative may be able to convince most or all \n     current and potential suppliers that the profits to be gained \n     from continuing to sell gasoline to Iran will be dwarfed by \n     the lost loan guarantees and subsidies and foregone profits \n     they will incur in the U.S. from continuing to do business \n     with Iran.\n       Last Sunday, a group of 60 Iranian economists called for \n     the regime to drastically change course, saying that \n     President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's ``tension-creating'' foreign \n     policy has ``scared off foreign investment and inflicted \n     heavy damage on the economy.'' The economists said the \n     current sanctions, as weak as they are, have cost Iran \n     billions of dollars by forcing it to use middlemen for \n     exports and imports. Halting Iran's gasoline supply could \n     contribute to reaching a tipping point--at which economic \n     pressures and protests convince the regime its illicit \n     nuclear program poses too great a risk to its grip over the \n     Iranian people.\n       If the federal and key state governments in the U.S. were \n     to make it their goal to achieve a halt by companies selling \n     gasoline to Iran, it could be a game-changer. It may be our \n     best remaining hope for peacefully convincing Iran to desist \n     from developing nuclear weapons.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington is recognized.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, I rise this evening to address criticism \nthat has been raised by some of our Republican colleagues about the \nOmnibus appropriations bill that is before us today. As I have talked \nabout repeatedly, this bill that is in front of us now is very \ncritical. At the end of this week, a few days from now, the continuing \nresolution we have been operating under is going to expire. At that \ntime, the Government will shut down if we do not take action.\n  This bill we are talking about keeps the Government running at a time \nwhen we desperately need Federal employees on the job working to help \nour economy recover. Our communities are counting on the money and the \nwork in this bill. This bill fulfills the commitment we made to our \ncommunities back in June and July, when we marked up these \nappropriations bills. It ensures that the basic needs of Government, \nfrom housing to law enforcement, to transportation safety are met\n\n[[Page S2756]]\n\nand that our agencies keep up with inflation.\n  I have come to the floor because some of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle have been raising questions about the 1 percent of \nfunding in this bill that they call earmarks. I wish to spend a minute \ntalking about that 1 percent of this funding.\n  The fact is, this is money that is being directed to critical needs \nin our communities, projects that our local leaders say they badly need \nso they can keep people safe or help them fund housing or ensure that \nlocal businesses stay strong.\n  Opposing that money means opposing new jobs, updating infrastructure \nand economic opportunity in local communities, including many in my \nhome State at a time when communities across this country need all the \nhelp they can get to recover from this economic crisis. For example, \nthis bill includes $3 million to help widen a very dangerous stretch of \nroad between Walla Walla and Pasco in my home State of Washington.\n  Now, in the last 18 years, there have been over 1,000 accidents on \nthat stretch of highway. Over 400 people have been hurt and more than \n30 people have died. It is so dangerous a stretch of highway that local \nofficials formed a coalition just to fight for funding to widen that \nhighway. I have been very proud to work with them to help make their \ncommunity safe. The sooner we can get that highway fixed the better.\n  This bill also includes $3 million to reimburse communities in \nWashington State for some of the cost of protecting our northern \nborder. Now, most of the communities on our northern border are very \nsmall. But they bear the large burden of protecting our Nation from \ninternational criminals, including drug dealers and potential \nterrorists, and jailing international fugitives.\n  In fact, in Whatcom County, in the northern part of my State of \nWashington, they spend about $2 million from their general fund, from \nthe county's general fund, every year to process these border-related \ncriminal cases. They shoulder, this poor little county, an unfair \nburden in return for keeping all of us safe.\n  Those police and sheriffs along the border have made it clear to me \nthat they need help. I was glad to work in this bill to help ensure \nthat the Federal Government, us, is stepping up to support that local \ncounty.\n  This bill includes over $700,000 to build 83 studio apartments for \nchronically homeless and mentally ill people in Seattle, with at least \na third of the space designated for homeless veterans. Because of this \nhousing money, they are going to have a stable place to live. It will \nprevent some of the most vulnerable people in our community from \nfalling through the cracks and allow them the chance to focus on \ngetting treatment and rebuilding their lives.\n  Cascade Supportive Housing is a key part of King County's 10-year \nplan to end homelessness. Not only will this money help the people who \nlive there, it will take a burden off the social safety net and \nultimately save all of us money in services we would have had to \nprovide. So like all of the projects listed, this might not have gotten \nFederal support if that community had not come to me as their Senator \nand if I had not been able to work hard, as my job is, to secure money \nin this appropriations bill. I am proud I can include funding for \nprograms that help my constituents.\n  We have heard these projects called insulting and wasteful. Tell that \nto the commuters in Walla Walla. Tell that to the families trying to \nkeep their homes in Seattle. Tell that to law enforcement personnel in \nBellingham in Whatcom County.\n  Washington State is 2,500 miles away from this Nation's Capitol. When \nI come to DC, it is my responsibility to fight for my home State. I \ndon't want to leave the decisions about what is best for Washington up \nto a bureaucrat in an agency who has never been to or even heard of \nWalla Walla or Pasco or Blaine, who has no idea who the people in those \ncommunities are or what their needs are. The Founders of our \nConstitution didn't want that either. In fact, our Nation's Founders \nmade it clear that the administration has no right to spend money \nwithout congressional approval. They believed the people, through their \nrepresentatives--and that is all of us--should make those decisions. \nWithout congressionally directed spending, the President would have \nunprecedented power to determine where all of our taxpayer dollars are \nspent.\n  It is easy for critics to pull out projects that may sound funny to \nthem or make an easy cable news story. They do this and then try to \npaint every bit of congressionally directed spending with one brush. I \nreject those efforts. I reject the notion that each and every bit of \nspending we direct is correct or wasteful. My constituents do too.\n  Additionally, unlike the pictures some of my colleagues are trying to \npaint, none of this spending is secret. Last Congress, Democrats led \nthe most sweeping ethics and earmark reform in history. This year, the \nAppropriations Committees in both the House and Senate went out of \ntheir way to voluntarily bring that transparency to a new level. Last \nyear, we reduced earmark spending by 43 percent. After President Obama \nwon in November, we then went back and cut it by 5 percent more. Each \nand every earmark in this bill now has a name attached to it. Anyone \nwho wants to can go online and find out who is asking for money and for \nwhat. That is the accountability and the transparency our constituents \ndeserve and we have provided.\n  Secondly, Democrats are not the only ones directing money in this \nbill. Nearly half of the earmarks Republicans object to were inserted \nby Republicans themselves. This bill directs $475,000 to build an \nemergency shelter at a Women's Bay in Alaska; $475,000 to Harbor Homes \nin Nashua, NH, to build housing for honorably discharged homeless \nveterans; $475,000 for the construction of a residential substance \nabuse treatment center for women and their children in Sioux Falls, SD; \n$617,000 for a new building for the Houston food bank in Houston, TX; \nand $190,000 to build low-income housing in New Orleans. These and \ndozens of other projects are going to help families who are hungry or \nveterans who are homeless. They will enable parents to get access to \nhigh-quality childcare and families to find safe, affordable housing. \nThey are good projects, and I am sure the Republican Senators who put \nthem in these bills did so because they know this money will make a \nreal difference for people in their communities. They know that if they \ndidn't fight for funding in this bill, it is going to be up to some DC \nbureaucrat who might not know that the Houston food bank needs a new \nroof or that there is a real need for an emergency shelter at Women's \nBay, AK. All of these create jobs. They direct money to vital \ninfrastructure needs. They help strengthen communities for the future.\n  Senators who oppose this bill say it is full of waste. I doubt any of \nthe Senators who asked for this money would say their project was money \ngone to waste. I bet neither would the communities that need the money \nto help shelter families or support businesses or keep people safe.\n  The point is, just as I don't expect a Senator from Oklahoma or \nArizona to know the needs of Walla Walla or Bellingham, I don't want to \ntell another Senator that I know their State better than they. We have \nhuge needs in this country today. We cannot afford to tie this bill up \nany longer on petty, baseless arguments. We cannot afford to risk \nshutting down the Government at the end of the day.\n  I urge colleagues, let's get this bill passed. Let's move forward. \nLet's get to work addressing the real problems Americans face every \nday.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Hawaii.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, I ask permission to speak as chairman of \nthe Senate Committee on Appropriations Defense Subcommittee. I realize \nthe Defense bill is not part of this package, but I have become quite \nconcerned with the debate because I am certain many of my fellow \nAmericans are now reaching the conclusion that earmarks are evil, that \nit is a waste, the money is down the drain.\n  I would like to share with my colleagues and refresh their memory as \nto what some of the funds have been spent for. This may come as a \nsurprise to many Americans, but breast cancer research is in the \nDefense bill. It is an earmark. The National Institutes of Health has \njust declared that the finest\n\n[[Page S2757]]\n\nresearch on breast cancer is that program. That is an earmark because \nno one wanted to put in money for breast cancer. Now it is becoming the \nfad of the Nation. It is popular. But it took an earmark to begin that \nprogram. We have spent millions of dollars.\n  Then we have an aircraft called the C-17. It is now the most \nproductive and the best working aircraft we have to carry cargo and \npersonnel. Then we have the F-22, a fighter plane that requires a \nlanding space just about the size of this room. I am citing these \nbecause these have shortened a war in Iraq. There is also the Predator, \nthe unmanned vehicle. We send a plane out with no pilot, but it sends \nback signals and photographs, makes it possible for the men and women \non the field to know what is on the other side of the mountain. That is \nan earmark. It did not come out of the mind of the President of the \nUnited States or from the Defense Department. It came from the minds of \nthe members of the committee. I dare anyone to suggest that these are \nevil products. It has helped to shorten the war. It has helped to save \nlives. It will bring back the brave and courageous men and women from \nIraq.\n  Yes, there are many more I can cite. But I think these few should \nremind us that earmarks are not evil.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, the Coburn amendment concerning the \nremoval of line item appropriations from the bill that were sponsored \nby a group called PMA is pending before the Senate. I think it would be \nof interest to my colleagues to have some additional information about \nthis organization.\n  I have mentioned before this organization's offices were raided in \nNovember in connection with an FBI investigation into its campaign \ncontribution practices. According to multiple news accounts, the \nAssociated Press reported Tuesday that the home of the founder of the \nPMA group, former House appropriations aide Paul Magliochetti, was also \nraided. Also, by doing some cursory research, we became aware that CQ \nreported last week that 104 Members of the House sponsored or \ncosponsored earmarks for clients of the PMA group in a single bill--the \nfiscal 2008 Defense appropriations bill. That set of lawmakers got $1.8 \nmillion in campaign contributions from the PMA group and its employees \nbetween 2001 and 2008. I also pointed out earlier today there was a \nWashington Post story as well as others reporting that there are \ncampaign contributors who are listed as being contributors who have no \nknowledge, nor have ever been involved, in making campaign \ncontributions.\n  I also noted that the payment for inserting the 14 appropriations--\nthe 14 projects--in this bill to PMA Group comes to a total of $2.185 \nmillion. That is not a bad business for 1 year, to get paid $2.185, \nnearly $2.2 million of the taxpayers money--for getting porkbarrel \nprojects inserted in appropriations bills. It is another reason why we \nshould take these projects out. Many of these projects have been going \non for some time and have been receiving very large amounts of Federal \ndollars for a long period of time. Most of them are doing the business \nthat could be done by the National Science Foundation or done by the \nDepartment of Defense in competitive bidding, and many other ways that \nfunding for these various companies and projects could have been \nimplemented. Instead, they were inserted in an appropriations bill \nwithout authorization, without hearings, and without scrutiny. It is a \nvery large amount of money--over $10 million which is being \nappropriated--and I am sure the payment to that lobbying group comes \nout of the money they are able to secure through this process.\n  So a cursory examination of the 14 projects identified revealed over \n$2 million paid to PMA as a fee for their services of a lobbying group \nthat secured the earmarks. I think it is another reason why the Coburn \namendment should be adopted. If the Coburn amendment is not adopted, \nthen clearly, it is not only business as usual in Washington, but it \nindicates without a doubt that even if the FBI raids your headquarters, \neven if the home of the head of the lobbying group is raided by the \nFBI, your projects will still be inserted into appropriations bills \nwithout authorization, without scrutiny, and without competition.\n  This is a very important vote that is coming up. It is only--when I \nsay ``only''--$10 million, but this organization, PMA, has been able to \nsecure hundreds of millions of dollars over the years for various \nentities. If we go ahead and do not remove these projects, then it is \nnot only business as usual in Washington, it has hit a new low.\n  I wish to thank the Senator from Oklahoma for his courage. I am \naware, as he is, that it is not the most popular thing to do, to come \nto the floor and try to eliminate these projects and help work to \nreform the system that is obviously badly broken.\n  I note the presence of the majority leader on the floor. I did note \nhis quote today where he said that the amendment is ``a nice try, but \nthere's no lobbying organization I know of that is earmarked.''\n  Well, they are identified in the bill as according to the legislation \nor rule we passed last year. It may be a nice try, but I want to assure \nthe majority leader that as long as I am here, I will come to this \nfloor and I will go to the American people and try to stop this \nterrible waste of their tax dollars at a time when Americans are \nexperiencing the most difficult of times.\n  With that, I thank the Senator from Oklahoma again for his courage \nand his hard work.\n  I yield the floor.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, could I inquire of the Chair what the \norder of business is now?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Schumer). Votes are scheduled to begin at \n5:35.\n  Mr. COBURN. Do we have any arrangement for the division of time?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. No, there is no such arrangement.\n  Mr. COBURN. I ask unanimous consent to be recognized and to share \nthat time with anybody in opposition.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I think the only speakers left are Dr. \nCoburn and myself, so he can go ahead and use any time he wants and if \nhe goes over, I can use my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, this amendment is straightforward. There \nis an alleged significant violation of Federal law associated with the \nfirm that was responsible for lobbying for the insertion of these 13 \nearmarks. I have not said anything about the quality of these earmarks. \nI have not said anything about the individuals who actually placed \nthem. What I ask my colleagues is, in light of where we are today, \nshould we not back off and say these should be stricken from the bill \nat this time until that situation is clarified?\n  It is prudent from a couple of standpoints. The investigation is \nrolling forward. We have had private residences now searched by the \nFBI, computers taken, and information pulled under subpoenas and search \nwarrants issued by Federal courts. Do we want to be in the midst of \npassing things that were connected with what appears to be and is \nalleged to be improper behavior both in terms of the source of the \nfunds, the payment of campaign funds, and the lobbying efforts on \nbehalf of these firms?\n  I cast no aspersion on the firms or the entities that are getting \nthis, nor on the individuals who have placed these earmarks. But I can \ntell my colleagues the American people are not going to be happy if we \ndon't recognize that maybe there is a checkpoint here where we ought to \nreconsider what we are doing in light of the developing situation \naround this firm. If we go forward and assume there will be \nprosecutions and convictions, we find ourselves in a very uncomfortable \nposition of having encouraged it. We also send a signal to other \nindividual lobbying firms that there isn't a standard of behavior to \nwhich we will not respond to their lobbying efforts.\n  I ask my colleagues to take a look at this not as Members of the \nSenate but as individual citizens outside of the\n\n[[Page S2758]]\n\nSenate in the country, as others look at us and say, What are you \ndoing?\n  Is there not a point in time--again, I make the point that the \nSenator from Arizona made that it would be totally different if these \nwere authorized earmarks, but they are not. They went through the \nAppropriations Committee, not the authorizing committees. They have \nnever been judged by a group of our peers. They weren't voted on; they \nwere inserted. We raise the specter of whether we can be trustworthy in \nfront of the American people. We need to work to regain their trust.\n  I will not say any more. This will speak a lot about our body and \nwhat the American people say. I understand the votes are lining up. I \nunderstand that. But I will assure you that I will keep coming to the \nfloor on earmarks--not because I am against earmarks. If you authorize \nan earmark, I will give you your right to do whatever you want to do. \nOn unauthorized earmarks that aren't vetted and are put out in front of \nthe rest of the Congress and the rest of the individuals on committees \nto have a vote on whether they are a priority, I am going to keep \nraising that issue. I am sorry if that is irritating, but that is the \nway it is going to be.\n  Mr. President, Senator Boxer defended an earmark she sponsored that I \nhave singled out as an example of misplaced priorities.\n  The Boxer earmark, which is one of nearly 9,000 tucked into this \nbill, is listed on page 100 of the bill's report and is described only \nas $475,000 ``for improvements to the Orange County Great Park'' from \nthe Economic Development Initiatives to ``Orange County Great Park \nCorporation, CA.''\n  Nothing more is stated as to the purpose or intent of this earmark.\n  Senator Boxer claimed that my criticism of this earmark was an insult \nto veterans in her state. This is apparently because the unwritten and \nunspecified intention of the earmark according to her statement is to \nrestore the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station Hangar Number 244 into a \nhistory museum and welcoming center.\n  The reality is this type of legislating without transparency is an \ninsult to all taxpayers.\n  With nearly 9,000 earmarks in this bill described with nothing more \nthan a few words or a single vague phrase, it is next to impossible for \nanyone other than the Senators and lobbyists who requested these \nearmarks to know the real intent of how billions of dollars in taxpayer \ndollars are intended to be spent.\n  As I found from statements made by the Senator from California and \nthe Great Park's own Website, the Great Park ``will be larger than New \nYork's Central Park and San Francisco's Golden Gate Park COMBINED.''\n  This municipal park is expected to cost $1.1 billion. Its main \nattraction is a massive helium balloon operated by two pilots with six-\nfigure salaries. According to the Orange County Great Park Corporation \nWebsite, ``The Orange County Great Park Plan will provide a wide array \nof active and passive uses, including a 2.5 mile canyon and lake, miles \nof walking and biking trails, a cultural terrace, Orange County's \nlargest sports park, a botanical garden, and a tethered helium \nobservation balloon that will be an icon for the Great Park. More than \n3,885 of the 4,700 acres will be dedicated to open space, education, \nand other public uses.''\n  As found by the Los Angeles Times, the Great Park also includes a \n$300,000 tent designed to resemble an airplane hangar that costs \n$75,000 a year to clean; a four-person visitor center crew hired under \na $370,000 annual contract; a series of orange dots painted along the \npark's entrance road at a cost of $14,000.\n  Additional costs have included $838,000 to build a road to the \nballoon, plant citrus trees and buy a $300,000 special 50-by-50-foot \ntent that will serve as the visitor center, $380,000 a year for two \nballoon pilots, a hostess and maintenance, $100,000 a year for a \nballoon replacement fund, $94,000 a year for portable restrooms, \n$52,000 annually for security between 1 and 5 a.m., and $30,000 a year \nfor trash removal.\n  This appropriation of almost half a million dollars could have gone \nto any of these initiatives none of which sound like true national \npriorities.\n  Local county officials were, in fact, outraged with what local funds \nwere being appropriated for. The bulk of the first $52 million the city \nspent on this project went to hire a team of dozens of design, \nengineering and public relations consultants, to build the balloon ride \nand to pay administrative staff.\n  ``To have nothing more than a balloon and the possibility of a 27-\nacre park is disappointing,'' said county Supervisor Bill Campbel, `` \nThey're spending a lot on engineers, PR people and other things, and \nthey're not delivering.''\n  State Assemblyman Todd Spitzer--a Republican from Orange Country--\nalso criticized the city for not building recreation facilities that \ncould be used by the public, while wasting money on ``a ridiculous, \noversized balloon and free rides.''\n  With a state-wide unemployment rate at over 10 percent and almost 2 \nmillion unemployed, Californians may also prefer these funds to be \nspent on other more pressing priorities.\n  While we all want to honor the great sacrifices or our veterans, I do \nnot believe this earmark is a national priority, especially in light of \nthe poor local spending decisions made in the past on this ambitious \nmunicipal park project. Perhaps this money and the billions spent on \nthe other pork projects in this bill could have been better spent on \nveterans health care or survivor benefits for the spouses and families \nof those who lost their lives fighting for our great Nation.\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in opposition to the Coburn \namendment No. 610, which will eliminate, among other appropriations \nrequests one that my colleague from Maine, Senator Collins, and I had \nsubmitted that would help preserve and rehabilitate historic \nlighthouses along the Maine coast.\n  At a time when our economy continues to cascade downward with \nunemployment at record highs, I do believe it is critical to scrutinize \nthe size and scope of spending measures which is frankly what we did in \nregard to the recently enacted stimulus package--so I understand the \nimpetus behind my colleague's amendment. At the same time, regrettably, \nhis amendment would potentially harm not only the existence of an \nhistoric emblem of my State and our Nation, but also a key economic \ncatalyst for tourism that is part and parcel of my home State and the \nlivelihood of many of her citizens.\n  Each lighthouse tells a different story and each one is as integral \nto the history and narrative of our State as the magnificent landscapes \non which they proudly stand. That is why, in 1995, I introduced a bill \nthat would later become law to establish the Maine Lights Program. We \nsucceeded in preserving this significant component of American heritage \nthrough collaboration among the Federal Government, the State of Maine, \nlocal communities, and private organizations, while at the same time, \nrelieving what had become a costly strain on the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  Across the country, responsibility for the care of our lighthouses \nhas been assumed by nonprofit historic societies--many of which are \nstruggling in these uncertain economic times. That is why this bill \nwould appropriate $380,000 to the American Lighthouse Foundation, \nstewards of 11 of Maine's 83 historic lighthouses.\n  I believe that the essential word in my previous sentence is \n``stewards''--because the structures are still federally owned \nproperty. It is not private property, it is not city or town property \nor even State property, but Federal property. It is also imperative to \nnote that these lighthouses are operable aids to navigation. \nLighthouses may seem a quaint relic of a bygone era, however they are \nnot an anachronism. Daily, lighthouses lead our Nation's mariners and \nfishermen away from danger.\n  Given that the maintenance of lighthouses is now being transferred \nunder the National Lighthouse Preservation Act from Federal ownership \nto nonprofit historical societies like the American Lighthouse \nFoundation, the task of providing the required resources to ensure the \nlongevity and viability of these lighthouses would also represent a \nwelcomed economic boost both to tourism and also to job creation.\n  The fact is, tourism has become increasingly crucial to Maine's \neconomy, as manufacturing jobs have fled our\n\n[[Page S2759]]\n\nState, not to mention our Nation. In fact, in 2006, the most recent \nyear for which statistics are available, approximately one-fifth of \nState sales tax revenues were attributable to tourism, and, when income \nand fuel taxes are added, the Maine State government collected $429 \nmillion tourism-related tax dollars in that year.\n  The Maine State Planning Office, which has quantified more precisely \nthe pivotal role tourism plays in the Maine economy, found that in \n2006, tourism generated $10 billion in sales of goods and services, \n140,000 jobs, and $3 billion in earnings. Tourism accounts for one in \nfive dollars of sales throughout Maine's economy and supported the \nequivalent of one in six Maine jobs. The Planning Office also \ndiscovered that an estimated 10 million overnight trips and 30 million \nday trips were taken that year in Maine, with travelers spending nearly \n$1 billion on lodging, $3 billion on food, and $1 billion on \nrecreational activities.\n  But those statistics are from 3 years ago--before the economy began \nto unravel at an accelerating rate, and so given these economic times \nconfronting all of us, the financial necessity of our lighthouses, \nespecially to tourism, has grown, not dissipated.\n  And so, I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment and send a \nmessage not only that historic preservation of our nation's prominent \nbuildings and structures--like our lighthouses--continues to be in the \nnational interest, but also that tourism is an industry we should be \nstriving to support as a key antidote to our ailing economy.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, my colleague from Oklahoma has offered an \namendment which seeks to eliminate funding for 11 initiatives. Among \nthose initiatives he seeks to eliminate is language authorizing the \nNational Park Service to expend up to $300,000 to defray the costs of \nthe events associated with the 150th anniversary of John Brown's raid \non the arsenal at Harpers Ferry.\n  For those whose memories need refreshing, on the evening of October \n16, 1859, abolitionist John Brown led a group of men to Harpers Ferry \nto seize control of the town and steal weapons from the old Federal \narmory to be used in the cause against slavery. By the morning of \nOctober 18, the engine house, later known as John Brown's Fort, was \nsurrounded by a company of U.S. Marines under the command of COL Robert \nE. Lee of the U.S. Army. With most of his men either dead or captured, \nJohn Brown was taken into custody, tried, and found guilty of treason, \nconspiring with slaves to rebel, and murder. Although John Brown's \nshort-lived raid on Harpers Ferry failed, his trial and execution \nhelped to focus the Nation's attention on the moral issue of slavery \nand constituted a major step toward the Civil War.\n  I had requested $300,000 to enable the National Park Service to fully \nsupport the myriad activities that have been planned in the Harpers \nFerry area throughout this year to highlight the relevance of John \nBrown's raid to the history of this country. Ultimately, the Interior \nAppropriations Subcommittee, rather than supporting direct funding, \nincluded language to provide the National Park Service the authority to \nexpend up to $300,000 for the anniversary effort.\n  The Park Service is expecting that nearly 100,000 people will \nparticipate in the series of reenactments, dramatic productions, family \nactivities, and special tours that have been planned by the John Brown \nSesquicentennial Quad-State Committee. Supporting the events for such \ncrowds at the Harpers Ferry National Historical Park will largely be \nthe burden of the National Park Service. Without the additional \nsupport, the agency reports that planned activities at Harpers Ferry \nwould likely have to be reduced in scope by 75 percent.\n  As a Congress, we should be doing all in our power to keep the unique \nhistory of our country alive and accessible to anyone who wants to \nlearn. In better understanding the significance of the Harpers Ferry \nraid, we learn about our Nation's failures, our mistakes, and the \ninequities of our past. But we also learn about the values and ideals \nupon which our Nation was founded--the values and ideals that have \ninspired the American people throughout our history. Writing about the \nthousands of soldiers who lost their lives during the Civil War battle \nat Antietam, historian Bruce Catton explained that those men did not \ndie for a few feet of a cornfield or a rocky hill. They died that this \ncountry might be permitted to go on, and that it might be permitted to \nfulfill the great hope of our Founding Fathers.\n  So may be said of all those courageous men who participated in the \nhistoric raid on Harpers Ferry. They paid the ultimate sacrifice to \npermit this country to go on, to fulfill the great hope of our Founding \nFathers. They sacrificed to promote and to protect the freedom and \nliberties of all Americans. As President Abraham Lincoln said of those \nsoldiers who fell in the Battle of Gettysburg, they ``gave their lives \nthat this Nation might live.''\n  Without this knowledge of our heritage, we cannot appreciate the \nhard-won freedoms that are now our birthright. As I have said before, \none does not protect what one does not value. And one does not value \nwhat one does not understand.\n  Mr. INOUYE. Mr. President, many of my colleagues whose spending \ninitiatives are under attack by this amendment have spoken today to \nprovide a more detailed explanation of what the funding would be used \nfor.\n  If we took the time to listen, we discovered that what may appear \nfrivolous based on a three word description is actually relevant to the \nprograms under which the funding is provided, and relevant to improving \nthe lives of our constituents.\n  For example, the tattoo removal earmark on this list is for a program \nrun by Providence Holy Cross Hospital in Mission Hills, CA, to remove \ngang insignia tattoos of reforming gang members. It is an effective \nanti-crime program founded by Sister June Wilkerson.\n  For ex-gang members, having a tattoo often means not getting hired \nfor a job, or beaten or killed. It is that simple. It is that \neffective.\n  I have a few comments about the bill as a whole and earmarks. I would \nalso like to note that this bill reflects a reduction in earmarks of 45 \npercent from fiscal year 2006 and a 5-percent reduction from last year.\n  These initiatives are not a surprise to anyone in this chamber. Every \nearmark in this bill is on the Internet.\n  A few Members are simply trying to pick a project here and a project \nthere to attack to further their effort to amend and delay passage and \npossibly kill this bill.\n  We need to finish our work here.\n  I have no problems with reforming the way we do business, in fact, in \nour continuing effort to provide unprecedented transparency to the \nprocess, Chairman Obey and I announced further reforms to begin with \nthe 2010 bills, including: (1) a further reduction in earmarks. We have \ncommitted to reducing earmarks to 50 percent from fiscal year 2006 \nlevel; (2) posting requests online to offer more opportunity for public \nscrutiny of member requests. Members will be required to post \ninformation on their earmark requests on their web sites at the time \nthe request is made explaining the purpose of the earmark and why it is \na valuable use of taxpayer funds; and (3) early public disclosure to \nincrease public scrutiny of committee decisions.\n  Earmark disclosure tables will be made publically available the same \nday as the House or Senate subcommittee rather than full committee \nreports their bill or 24 hours before full committee consideration of \nappropriations legislation that has not been marked up by a Senate \nsubcommittee.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The majority leader is recognized.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, if I don't finish my remarks before 5:35, I \nask that everybody recognize that the vote may occur a minute or two \nright after 5:35.\n  This amendment directs the Senate to eliminate 13 separate science \nand education projects from this bill. The Senator from Oklahoma claims \nthese projects are somehow associated with a lobbying outfit that is \nunder some kind of an investigation. He acknowledges that the quality \nof the congressionally directed spending is not questioned, that the \npersons whose names are associated with these congressionally directed \nfunding matters are not in question. So what is this all about?\n\n[[Page S2760]]\n\n  I wish to remind my colleagues of the many reforms this Congress has \nimposed on the earmarking process. The days of unlimited and \nunaccountable congressionally directed spending are gone. Those days \nare behind us. We passed the most sweeping ethics and lobbying reform \nin the history of the country--and rightfully so. We have never gone \nbeyond that.\n  Last year, when we were back in power for the first time in a number \nof years, we Democrats dramatically reduced the volume of earmarks in \nthe bills--by 43 percent. In this bill, we reduced them another 5 \npercent. The volume of earmarks is less than half what they were in \n2006 when our Republican colleagues were in the majority.\n  Just as important, under our reforms, each and every congressionally \ndirected spending earmark in this bill is fully disclosed and \ntransparent to the public. What does that mean? Each of these is backed \nby a letter from a House or Senate sponsor certifying that they and \ntheir family members have absolutely no financial interest in the \nearmark. For every one of these earmarks, the name of the grantee and \nthe House or Senate sponsor are posted on the Internet for the public \nto see. So there is the name of the person requesting it, a \ncertification that no one benefits from it other than the person to \nwhom the money is directed, and they are posted on the Internet before \nany of these are voted on in the House or Senate.\n  This amendment is the third separate amendment the Senator from \nOklahoma sought to present to the Senate on this topic of \ncongressionally directed spending. Everybody knows how I feel about \nthese. I am a Member of the Congress of the United States. I believe in \nthe Constitution. I believe that when the Founding Fathers set up this \ncountry, they set up three separate and equal branches of Government. \nWhat Congress has been doing since we became a country is have the \nCongress involved in where spending takes place. I have an obligation \nto the people of Nevada to make sure there is not some bureaucrat down \nin one of these big offices in Washington, DC, who determines every \npenny spent in Nevada. I think I have a better outlook on this than a \nlot of people who are bureaucrats. I have been here going on 27 years, \nand I have done my best to direct congressional spending to places in \nNevada where I think it helped. It has helped. I am one who believes we \nare going to reduce these earmarks even more. We have made that \ncommitment. But no one should lecture me on what my role is as a Member \nof Congress.\n  I say that this amendment, I repeat, is the third separate amendment \nthe Senator from Oklahoma has sought to present on this topic. A couple \nof days ago, the Senator filed amendment No. 609 to address this \nlobbying outfit known as PMA. I don't even know what that stands for; I \nhave no idea. Yesterday, he filed a completely different amendment, No. \n623, which he called to the floor. That amendment purported to list \nearmarks in this bill that are associated with this suspect lobbying \norganization. Then, after he presented No. 623 to the Senate, he \nrealized he had a project listed in this amendment for DePaul \nUniversity that probably had absolutely nothing to do with this \nlobbying group. So he got consent--we didn't object to changing the \namendment--to remove that project from the list.\n  That is the central point. We don't necessarily know who the lobbying \ngroups are behind the projects that are asked to be appropriated by \nMembers of Congress, just as Senator Coburn didn't know who the \nlobbyist was for this project for DePaul. We don't include earmarks at \nthe behest of lobbyists; we include them at the behest of elected \nMembers of Congress. That is what the Appropriations Committee does.\n  There are famous firms in town--Tommy Boggs--everybody knows Patton \nBoggs, but that firm has nothing in here. They are a big lobbying \noutfit. Their name doesn't appear on anything. The only thing that \nappears is what is in the Record, and it is so transparent, you could \nnot try to hide anything if you wanted to anymore. You have to list \neverything, and it appears in the Record days before we vote on it.\n  For the projects I champion in Nevada, I don't check to find out if a \nlobbyist cared. I don't really care, Mr. President. A lot of my \nconstituents in the city of Las Vegas, Clark County; the city of Reno, \nBoulder City; North Las Vegas, and the universities have lobbyists. I \ndon't give those entities I just mentioned an earmark because some \nlobbyist asked for it. I support projects in Nevada because they are \nbrought to me by my mayors, community organizations, and universities. \nI support them because I believe they will improve the lives of people \nin my State.\n  We cannot start picking and eliminating earmarks because we think we \nknow who the lobbyist may be, just like DePaul University. Lobbyists \ndon't face the voters. Lobbyists are not accountable for the merits of \nthese projects, and nobody has focused more attention on lobbyists than \nPresident Obama. Congressmen and Senators are accountable for these \nprojects, not lobbyists. Congressmen and Senators will be held \naccountable by constituents, not lobbyists. Every one of these \nobjections to funding that the Senator from Oklahoma has raised has the \nname of a Member of Congress by it. That is the person responsible.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in defeating this vexatious \namendment which is without any foundation.\n\n\n                             Cloture Motion\n\n  Mr. President, I send a cloture motion to the desk.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

I think the time has come to bring it to a close. We can \nvote either Friday morning or we can vote sometime tomorrow. Other \namendments will be offered, and I understand that.

Madam President, the leader is correct.\n  Mr. REID. That gives us six votes to work out sometime tomorrow. I \nthink, from our perspective, we are drawing to the end of a little \nsituation on which we have been here all week. I think we have given \neveryone the opportunity to offer amendments. We have filed now about \n70-some-odd amendments. I think we have been more than reasonable on \nthis bill. The time for this CR runs out the day after tomorrow.\n  Originally, as some will recall, Friday was listed as a ``no vote'' \nday and we were hopeful that could take place. I am still hopeful we \ncan work out something tomorrow. If we cannot work out something with \nthe minority tomorrow, we will have a cloture vote, probably about 9:30 \non Friday. We hope that is not necessary but that we will see. We are \ngoing to do our best.\n  I have been informed by the distinguished manager of the bill on the \nRepublican side that he believes that each of the three Senators--\nCrapo, Inhofe and Kyl--would agree to time agreements on their \namendments.\n  The other three amendments have had some discussion but we will have \nto have some more because, of course, they were laid down yesterday.\n  I think that gives the body an understanding of where we are and \nwhere we are going to go tomorrow. We will probably come in about 9:30 \ntomorrow and try to work through these amendments.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Mississippi is recognized.\n\n\n                   Amendments Nos. 634, 613, and 638\n\n  Mr. COCHRAN. Madam President, in keeping with the statement of the \nmajority leader, I ask unanimous consent that the pending amendments be \nset aside and that amendment No. 634 by Senator Kyl, No. 613 by Senator \nInhofe, and No. 638 by Senator Crapo be called up.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. Kyl, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 634.\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. Inhofe, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 613.\n       The Senator from Mississippi [Mr. Cochran], for Mr. Crapo, \n     for himself, Mr. Vitter, and Mr. Corker, proposes an \n     amendment numbered 638.\n\n  The amendments are as follows:\n\n\n                           AMENDMENT NO. 634\n\n (Purpose: To prohibit the expenditure of amounts made available under \nthis Act in a contract with any company that has a business presence in \n                         Iran's energy sector)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n       Sec. __.

Madam President, I wish to offer for the record \nthe Budget Committee's official scoring of H.R. 1105, the Omnibus \nAppropriations Act for fiscal year 2009.\n  The bill, as passed by the House, provides $407.6 billion in \nnonemergency discretionary budget authority, BA, for fiscal year 2009, \nwhich will result in new outlays of $244.5 billion. When outlays from \nprior-year budget authority are taken into account, discretionary \noutlays for the bill will total $468.1 billion.\n  The bill also includes $100 million in emergency discretionary BA for \n2009 resulting in $85 million in new outlays for the Secret Service.\n  When the nonemergency funding in H.R. 1105 is combined with the \nfunding included in H.R 2638, the Consolidated Security, Disaster \nAssistance, and Continuing Appropriations Act for fiscal year 2009, the \noverall level equals the Appropriations Committee's 302(a) allocation \nfor budget authority and is $2.5 billion below the committee's \nallocation for outlays.\n  Each appropriations subcommittee included in H.R. 1105 is at its \nrespective 302(b) suballocation for budget authority and outlays.\n  The bill would cause the 2009 budget resolution spending aggregates \nto be exceeded and would therefore be subject to a point of order under \nSection 311(a)(2)(A) of the Congressional Budget Act. In addition, \nseveral provisions in the bill make changes in mandatory programs--\nCHIMPs--that are subject to a point of order under section 314 of S. \nCon. Res. 70, the concurrent budget resolution for fiscal year 2009. \nFinally, the bill includes an emergency designation pursuant to section \n204 of S. Con. Res. 21, the concurrent resolution on the budget for \nfiscal year 2008. No other points of order lie against the bill as \npassed by the House.\n  I ask unanimous consent that the table displaying the Budget \nCommittee scoring of the bill be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n\n               HR. 1105, Omnibus Appropriations Act, 2009\n\n   [Spending comparisons--House Passed Bill (in millions of dollars)]\n\n                                                          Total Funding\nHouse-Passed Bill:\n    Budget Authority............................................407,602\n    Outlays.....................................................468,067\nPreviously-enacted:\n    Budget Authority............................................605,084\n    Outlays.....................................................636,433\nTotal:\n    Budget Authority..........................................1,012,686\n    Outlays...................................................1,104,500\nSenate 302(a) allocation:\n    Budget Authority..........................................1,012,686\n    Outlays...................................................1,107,004\nHouse-Passed Bill Compared To:\n                                              Senate 302(a) allocation:\n    Budget Authority..................................................0\n    Outlays......................................................-2,504\n\nNote: The bill also includes $100 million in emergency funding for the \nSecret Service.\n\n  Mr. REID.

Madam President, I wish to pay tribute to a young man \nwho worked for me for many years--actually, for 12 years. He has been a \nvery vital part of the Landrieu staff. He is retired. He left our \noffice after 12 years of wonderful service.\n  Jason Matthews started out with me as an assistant in my first \ncampaign for the Senate as literally a young kid right out of college. \nHe worked his way up. He had no real political connections other than \njust a passion for the work, a heart for people, and a good mind. He \ncame to Washington with me 12 years ago and started out, maybe even \nanswering the phones some days, and worked his way up as military LA \nand then as legislative director and then general counsel and then left \nour office with the title chief of staff.\n  Besides serving with such great humor and a great mind for policy \nand, as I said, a great heart for people, he served with great cheer \nthrough very difficult times that our office and many of my colleagues \nfrom Louisiana have been through considering the storms of the past \nrecent years and the extra work our staffs have had to go through \nbecause of them. Jason led that effort with good humor. Because of him, \nmany wonderful accomplishments in our office have been achieved. One I \nwill mention, and I will share the rest for the record, is Louisiana's \nlongstanding effort to achieve some balance and fairness in the \ndistribution of oil and gas royalties and revenues which interior \nStates have enjoyed since 1927 and coastal States have not because of \nthe peculiarity in the law. Jason helped us fight a 10-year battle and \nfinally was successful.\n  The people of all of Louisiana will be grateful for many years for \nhis service. He has led the people of Louisiana to great achievements. \nHe has served the people of our country well. I wanted to pay tribute \nto him today and to wish him the best as he goes on to future endeavors \nhere in the Washington, DC, area.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/04/senate-section/article/S2762-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2762]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TROUBLED ASSET RELIEF PROGRAM OVERSIGHT ENHANCEMENT ACT\n\n  Mr. INHOFE. Madam President, to date, over 380 companies have \nreceived some $300 billion taxpayer dollars from the Troubled Asset \nRelief Program, supposedly to improve their financial stability. These \ninclude some of the largest corporations and financial institutions in \nAmerica.\n  Yet in recent years, many of these same firms found enough money to \ncontribute annually to some of the most radical organizations in the \nnation.\n  They have donated large sums to ACORN, Friends of the Earth, Planned \nParenthood, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and Conservation \nInternational Foundation, to name just a few. The vast majority of \nAmericans do not support the agendas of these fringe groups, whose \nexcesses have been well-documented over the years.\n  Companies that get bailed out cannot carry on as if it were business \nas usual. They should not grab for taxpayer dollars help with one hand \nand give money to these radical organizations with the other.\n  That is why I have introduced the Troubled Asset Relief Program \nOversight Enhancement Act.\n  This legislation would let us see how these companies are spending \ntheir money. If they are not focused on increasing their solvency or \nliquidity, if they are not working on lending to small businesses and \nindividuals, if they are not helping get this economy back on track, \nand are instead financing extremist organizations, then the American \npeople need to know about it.\n  ``Transparency'' is one of the new watchwords in Washington. Let's \nhave some of that transparency for the sake of the American taxpayers, \nwho deserve to see how these companies are behaving after receiving \nhard-earned tax dollars.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/04/senate-section/article/S2762-4", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2762-S2764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Madam President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share \nwith me how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they \nresponded by the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those\n\n[[Page S2763]]\n\nwho took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am submitting every \ne-mail sent to me through an address set up specifically for this \npurpose to the Congressional Record. This is not an issue that will be \neasily resolved, but it is one that deserves immediate and serious \nattention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. Their stories not only \ndetail their struggles to meet everyday expenses, but also have \nsuggestions and recommendations as to what Congress can do now to \ntackle this problem and find solutions that last beyond today. I ask \nunanimous consent to have today's letters printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       I run a small 1-man truck brokerage business. The fuel \n     prices are all but driving my company out of business. The \n     quotes I receive from truckers leave little to no room for me \n     to make a living. I have been in the transportation business \n     for over twenty years and this is the first time I feel I \n     will have close my company. Any assistance that can be \n     offered to help lower fuel prices would be greatly \n     appreciated. Also, health care needs a serious reform. For \n     the first time in my adult life, my insurance premiums exceed \n     my home mortgage payment. If all this keeps up, I will be \n     forced to choose between my home and my insurance. My vote \n     this next election depends on who is willing to actually help \n     with these issues. Something must change soon or millions of \n     Americans will be in financial trouble.\n     Randy.\n                                  ____\n\n       We need to let technology repair this gas war. It has been \n     said that necessity is the mother of invention. We need to \n     loosen up on new oil well drilling and other forms of energy. \n     The communities that have the wind turbines and oil wells \n     should have cheaper power and fuel. It really eats at \n     Idahoans in Idaho Falls to have wind turbines in our yards \n     and not reap the benefits. We need a few nuclear reactors \n     making energy and ethanol. We need to remove fields from CRP \n     and give farmers incentives to plant. We need technology to \n     invent better engines that use higher blends of ethanol and \n     less oil-based fuels. In the meantime, record numbers of \n     Americans are going to go broke. I personally have cut back \n     my driving by half.\n     Todd, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       The president needs to overturn the executive order not to \n     develop natural energy resources. [Conservatives] need to be \n     hollering to anyone who will listen that we need oil, natural \n     gas, coal production and nuclear power plants. Americans are \n     not against alternative energy, but let us develop it before \n     we shut off the oil spigot. The Green movement is whispering \n     in the ears of the [liberals] and they have no choice but to \n     be against developing our petroleum resources. Believe me, \n     [liberals] drive as much as I do and are as mad. Help us go \n     forward. There needs to be leadership in D.C., let [liberals] \n     keep saying no to oil, they will cut their own throat. If \n     nothing is done, 1861 is around the corner. T\n     Wade.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for working hard for us in Idaho. I am a 64 year \n     old man, disabled and on SSA. I have a wife and a 14-year-old \n     son. I live 50 miles from the nearest place where I can shop \n     for food and supplies. I use to go to town once a month. Now \n     I have to try to make my supplies last me a lot longer. Since \n     the price of gas has gone so high, I have a lot less money to \n     buy food after I fill my truck with gas. I go nowhere else \n     except to the doctor.\n       Congress talks about everyone conserving and using less, \n     but how much less do you intend for us to conserve. We could \n     go back to the 18th century and become a Third World country, \n     but that seems a little bleak, does not it! I do not \n     understand why our Congressmen are working so hard to make it \n     a reality.\n       Congress also tells us to use alternative sources of \n     energy, but there are no sources available, affordable, or \n     viable. Congress is making laws to force us to use energy \n     sources that have not been invented yet (just talked about) \n     or have not been perfected.\n       Please weigh the consequences of your actions. The quality \n     of life and the security of America are at stake. Please tell \n     your fellow Congressmen to do what is best for our survival \n     and our way of life.\n     Jim.\n                                  ____\n\n       We can all say our woes, and how much it cost, but we have \n     to keep going. What I do not get it, why are we not using our \n     own resources? Why are we not becoming self sufficient. If we \n     are ever under attack, I ask you, who will come to our aid? \n     Exactly--no one!\n       We need to pull back to the basics here. We are fighting \n     terrorist, as rightly we should. But, they cannot just hurt \n     us with guns and bombs. They can infect our food we receive \n     from overseas, send disease, and undermine our food sources, \n     our fuel sources. This does not take a rocket scientist to \n     figure out. I am just a wife, mother, grandmother working her \n     everyday job and I can see the light.\n       America needs to wake up before we are in worse shape than \n     we are now. We send so much overseas. Send them the knowledge \n     to care for themselves. We import so much; why-I have no \n     idea. Wonder why we have so many out-of-work people. We do \n     nothing but outsource everything and take away from our own \n     American families. And why?\n       I have lived in Nebraska and Kansas; I see oil pumps \n     standing still. Can you please explain why that is? I see no \n     reason. Please, this is your country going down the tubes and \n     no one is going to save it but us.\n     Cindy.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to express my thoughts on the \n     current gasoline price/oil price fiasco. As an retiree in the \n     state of Idaho, I have a fixed income. It is not quite to the \n     point of ``gas or food,'' but could be soon under the current \n     trend. We have significantly altered the way we live.\n       Some people have said how much it now costs them to go to \n     the coast. We cannot afford to go to the coast as much as I \n     would like to see family and do some chartered fishing. We \n     carefully evaluate local trips to see if they are truly \n     necessary, and attendance at many events within a couple \n     hours drive is eliminated. The cost of oil is tied to most \n     things for transportation, extraction/harvesting and \n     processing. That results in less we can buy as the cost goes \n     up.\n       It seems we are unofficially under ``economic sanctions'' \n     by OPEC.'' Under a pure supply and demand situation, we \n     should see the price of oil/gasoline drop when the demand \n     drops. Lately when we drop our demand for oil, the OPEC \n     scales back oil production-keeping the supply low to keep the \n     demand up and the prices high. This is basically declaring \n     economic war on the world in general, and the US in \n     particular. We need to increase our production to override \n     some of this manipulation of our economy. It is time to \n     remove the restrictions on energy development from oil shale.\n       The argument that oil companies have ``lots of unused land \n     they have leases on'' is an argument from someone with no \n     idea of how the system works. The companies lease the land to \n     explore and then develop when it is profitable. The oil \n     companies know the potential of lands under their leases by \n     geologic maps and test drilling, and for many areas the time/\n     price is not right for extraction of that oil to be \n     profitable. On other acres under lease there may be no oil at \n     all!\n       Oil speculation is another issue that keeps us on high \n     alert. I understand the rules have been changed to allow wild \n     speculation without controls. It is time for the US to become \n     energy self-sufficient, including the use of our own oil, \n     wind and other resources.\n     James, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       So, how are gas prices affecting us? Not much. You see, we \n     have always considered it a civic duty to try and limit our \n     use of our natural resources. We drive modest, fuel-efficient \n     cars. We choose to live in an area that allows us options to \n     use alternate transportation such as bicycles, public \n     transport, and walking. I am not writing this to be smug. My \n     point is that citizens can, and should, take measures to \n     reduce their use of fossil fuels. Nowhere in the Constitution \n     does it guarantee cheap gas.\n       Just as I think the citizens have a duty to limit their use \n     of natural resources, I think our political leaders need to \n     make the tough call and instead of reading melodramatic \n     letters about someone not being able visit their dying \n     relative, explain to them that the days of cheap gas are gone \n     and we need to invest in public transport and more fuel \n     efficient vehicles. The drumbeat for more drilling is not the \n     answer either. Our political leaders are doing a disservice \n     to us by bringing up the issue. We need to wean ourselves \n     from our reliance on oil and not add to it.\n       Boise is a great city and could be a leader in innovative \n     alternatives to gas guzzling vehicles caught in gridlock. It \n     will take strong political will and citizens ready to do \n     their civic duty to their neighbors and their children.\n     Tim, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       If we would drill for our own oil instead of allowing our \n     enemies drill for our oil it would make a big difference. \n     Another thought that might help would be to at least limit \n     the amount of refined oil that leaves our country and keep it \n     here it would also make a big difference.\n     Bob and Cindy.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to speak out. I have lived in \n     Idaho Falls my whole life. I am a father of three, married, \n     and have a modest home. Over the past five years, my wife and \n     I have made it our goal to get out of debt, pay off our home \n     early, and save for retirement. I am sure you have heard \n     similar stories before. I am an average guy, with an average \n     income, with an average house.\n       In order to put things into perspective, I would like to go \n     back to December 2002. Gas prices at that time were $1.30 per \n     gallon give or take a few cents. In 2003, they rose to $1.80. \n     By 2004, they rose again to nearly $2.00 per gallon. In 2005 \n     we saw prices hit $2.50 mark and above. By 2006, Idahoans \n     were paying $3.00 and above for a gallon of gas. As 2007 \n     approached, gas prices were in the $3.50 range. As we \n     approach the mid-point of summer 2008, a gallon of fuel is \n     now at the $4.00 mark for regular. I might add here that gas \n     is typically cheaper as winter approaches and demands for \n     fuel are not as great. So these figures are just \n     representative numbers at a glance.\n       As you can see, a gallon of gas has tripled in price since \n     2002. If you were to look at historical data, you would find \n     that gasoline\n\n[[Page S2764]]\n\n     prices were stable from about 1985 through most of 2002. For \n     about 17 years, Americans enjoyed what I would consider a \n     fair price for a gallon of gas. I did some research on \n     current gas prices in Iran and Iraq.\n       Currently Iran pays 5 cents per liter and Iraq pay 8 cents \n     per liter. If you were to convert liters to gallons, it would \n     take 3.78 liters per gallon. If you were to buy 4 liters of \n     gas (over a gallon), it would cost 20 cents in Iran, 32 cents \n     in Iraq. See link for pricing http://www.nationmaster.com/\nred/graph/ene_gas_pri-energy-gasoline-prices_desc=1. I \n     could go on, but you get the point. Oil being produced by \n     these countries is reaping the benefit of cheaper prices.\n       I must digress a moment. I now need to complain. Remember, \n     I am the average guy with the average income. I would like to \n     talk about how rising fuel prices have affected my family. As \n     fuel prices rise, so have other commodities. Produce, meats, \n     poultry, grains, and dairy have all spiked in the last year. \n     Consumer goods and durables have also risen. The past three \n     years have been very difficult to stay on a budget since gas \n     prices have raised so dramatically. Our family is committed \n     to stay out of consumer debt. We have no credit cards nor do \n     we have any store credit that we borrow from. Both of the \n     vehicles we own are pre-2000 year models. We do not overspend \n     what we make but we feel the crunch and feel that we make \n     less money now than when we did four years ago. The dollar \n     just does not stretch enough these days. It is frustrating \n     and depressing as we budget our money each month down to the \n     penny.\n       Now that I have got that off my chest, what is the \n     solution? I firmly believe that America has the technology \n     now to manufacture and make our own fuels. There are many \n     alternative fuels out there that can and already have been \n     developed. Grain alcohol is viable. Continued exploration of \n     fossil fuels is also very important. Alternative energy \n     sources need to be used more. Wind Power in south east Idaho \n     needs to be tapped. Solar energy is another avenue. Electric \n     cars are also viable and cheaper to drive and cleaner than \n     any gas engine. Countries that manufacture their own fuels \n     always pay less at the pump. Why cannot we do the same? \n     Another idea is to offer incentives to states to develop, \n     manufacture, and sell the cheapest (and best) fuels. \n     Regardless of what people think, nuclear power is one of the \n     cheapest and cleanest sources of power on the planet. There \n     are many countries that use nuclear power (Japan) and have \n     for many years without mishap. We need to move forward start \n     implementing existing technology that is proven to work.\n       Again, my ideas are not new. This technology is here now. \n     It has been developed. We just need to implement it. Thank \n     you for your time and hope this letter reaches you in good \n     health. I think you are doing a super job for us in the \n     Senate.\n     Mark, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would like to see the speed limit reduced to 55 mph. \n     Everybody knows how that would benefit energy and lives. The \n     75 mph speed limit between Boise and Mountain Home should be \n     the first one reduced. Then cut the 65 mph between Boise and \n     Mc Call. (and right up the line)\n     Donabeth, Boise.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am 63 years old and last year, right before the prices \n     went out of control, already had purchased an electric bike \n     to use to get to work. Fortunately I only live a little over \n     a mile away and can use this bike that goes 15 miles an hour. \n     My determination to ride this bike increased as the hot days \n     turned into colder ones and I was able to ride my bike \n     through November so I would not have to fill the pick-up with \n     gas too much. Government wants us to recycle to help \n     environment and I am all for it, but when we try to do our \n     part, we do not get any help in return. If you do get an \n     electric car which no one can afford but the wealthy.\n       I see my single parent daughter trying to commute and make \n     ends meet and it gets increasingly difficult because with gas \n     prices she goes with less food for family, etc.\n       I think it is outrageous for our country and politicians to \n     allow these price increases when we have the means to take \n     care of this country. 20 years ago they spoke of getting \n     alternatives and did not push this issue and had they done so \n     much more could have been done. I am afraid that before long \n     we will see violence in this country mainly because our jobs \n     are gone, price increases in every area of products, but no \n     one ever increases the wages to meet the demands of other \n     increase. What is the matter with people in government and \n     businesses?\n       I do not like to see government control but because our \n     business people will not use common sense to see what happens \n     when the jobs go there is not sufficient jobs to go and buy \n     the products. What is wrong with this picture? We need to \n     start taxing products from overseas that come here so \n     business's will come back to the states and put our people \n     back to work. How sad our government has deserted their own \n     people.\n       I am hoping with all my heart that someone will step up to \n     the plate and really try to make a difference. We have to do \n     something as everything is getting out of control and it is \n     sad because of what our forefathers have tried to do before \n     us to make it a great country. I am angry and I do not like \n     politics but when I see people trying to do well for their \n     families and that means is taken away from them someone needs \n     to speak up.\n     Devera, Nampa.\n                                  ____\n\n       Many of our family members are opting out of a treasured \n     activity this summer because of the fuel prices: we normally \n     have a family reunion (as everyone is all over the place) and \n     meet each other and catch up. Many aren't coming because as \n     they said, ``I just cannot afford to pay the gas to drive \n     there and plane tickets are just as expensive.'' My sister \n     and I would not think twice normally about taking a drive \n     down to our relatives or drive to get to our vacation spot, \n     but now we are rethinking going on vacation at all. My family \n     and I have also started buying online because it is cheaper \n     than driving around town to find what we need. We have also \n     cut down our ``dining out'' to practically once every two \n     months (if that). If the local businesses aren't feeling the \n     consequences of that, I'll be surprised because my family is \n     not the only one that is doing it.\n       We aren't getting as much fresh produce in our diets this \n     year because they just cost too much (the grocer claims that \n     the fuel prices are affecting the food prices). This also \n     makes us buy less food and the cheaper brands. I have even \n     caught myself of suspecting the grocer and the gas station \n     manager of glutting themselves by gouging us with the ``it is \n     OPEC's fault you pay so much'' (and these people are my \n     neighbors, which makes me feel a little ashamed of myself).\n       All of this is only the parts of my life where I have seen \n     the biggest impact. I really cannot think of many aspects in \n     my life that have not been affected by the fuel hikes. Hope \n     this enlightens you to the trials of at least one voter.\n     Jeorgette.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not have much of a different story than many other \n     Idahoans. I work hard each day 11 to 12 hours. I live in a \n     rural area of Canyon County, so ride-sharing or carpooling is \n     not a viable option for me. I have to drive 18 miles to work \n     so riding a bike is not an option especially after putting in \n     a 12 hour day. I drive a small pick up Chevy S-10 to help \n     reduce my gas usage, my wife in I traded in our ford tarsus \n     for a KIA Spectra last November to help save money and \n     protect our budget of the current (November 07) high gas \n     prices.\n       What I can say is that the only way out of our current \n     situation is for our Congress to show OPEC, that we are \n     willing to take back control of our oil dependence.\n     Robert.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/04/senate-section/article/S2764-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/04/senate-section/article/S2764-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2764]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/04/senate-section/article/S2764-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2764-S2765]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  NOTICE RELATIVE TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE NATIONAL EMERGENCY WITH \n     RESPECT TO THE ACTIONS AND POLICIES OF CERTAIN MEMBERS OF THE \n   GOVERNMENT OF ZIMBABWE AND OTHER PERSONS TO UNDERMINE ZIMBABWE'S \n              DEMOCRATIC PROCESSES OR INSTITUTIONS--PM 10\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER laid before the Senate the following message \nfrom the President of the United States, together with an accompanying \nreport, which was referred to the Committee on Banking, Housing, and \nUrban Affairs:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nprior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the President \npublishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the Congress a \nnotice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect beyond the \nanniversary date.

A bill to resolve the claims of the Bering Straits Native \nCorporation and the State of Alaska to land adjacent to Salmon Lake in \nthe State of Alaska and to provide for the conveyance to the Bering \nStraits Native Corporation of certain other public land in partial \nsatisfaction of the land entitlement of the Corporation under the \nAlaska Native Claims Settlement Act; to the Committee on Energy and \nNatural Resources.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise to speak to a bill that I am \nintroducing today to resolve a land conveyance dispute in Northwest \nAlaska, the Salmon Lake Land Selection Resolution Act.\n  Shortly after Alaska became a State in 1959, Alaska selected lands \nnear Salmon Lake, a major fishery resource in the Bering Straits Region \nof Northwest Alaska. In 1971, Congress passed the Alaska Native Claims \nSettlement Act to resolve aboriginal land claims throughout the 49th \nState. In that act Congress created 12 regional Native corporations in \nstate, providing the corporations with $966 million and the right to \nselect 44 million acres of land in return for giving up claims to their \ntraditional lands in Alaska. The land and money was to go to make the \ncorporations profitable to provide benefits to their shareholders, the \nnative inhabitants of Alaska. The Bering Straits Native Corporation, \none of those 12 regional corporations, promptly selected lands in the \nSalmon Lake region overlapping state selections, because the lake and \nthe waters upstream and downstream from the lake spawn and\n\n[[Page S2768]]\n\ncontain fisheries resources of significance to Alaska Natives and also \noffer land suitable for a variety of recreational activities.\n  For the past 38 years there have been conflicts over the conveyances, \ndelaying land from going to the corporation, harming the economic and \ncultural benefits of the corporation to Native shareholders, and \ncomplicating land and wildlife management issues between federal \nagencies and the State of Alaska. Starting in 1994, but accelerating in \n1997, talks began among the State, Federal agencies and native \ncorporations and towns in the region, located north of Nome--Salmon \nLake itself is located 38 miles north of Nome--to reach a consensus on \nland uses in the region. Those talks reached agreement on June 1, 2007 \nwith a resolution that satisfied all parties. This seemingly non-\ncontroversial legislation will implement the new land management regime \nin the area and finally complete the conveyance of ANCSA lands to the \nBering Straits Native Corporation--giving the corporation title after \nsurveys to the last of the 145,728 acres it was promised by Section 14 \n(h)(8) of ANCSA nearly four decades ago.\n  By this bill the Corporation will gain conveyance to 1,009 acres in \nthe Salmon Lake area, 6,132 acres at Windy Cove, northwest of Salmon \nLake, and 7,504 acres at Imuruk Basin, on the north shore of Imuruk \nBasin, a water body north of Windy Cove. In return the Corporation \nrelinquishes rights to another 3,084 acres at Salmon Lake to the \nfederal government, the government then giving part of the land to the \nState of Alaska for it to maintain a key airstrip in the area. The \nFederal Bureau of Land Management also retains ownership and \nadministration of a 9-acre campground at the outlet of Salmon Lake, \nwhich provides road accessible public camping opportunities from the \nNome-Teller Highway. The agreement also retains public access to BLM \nmanaged lands in the Kigluaik Mountain Range.\n  The bill fully protects recreation and subsistence uses in the area, \nwhile providing the Corporation with access to recreational-tourism \nsites of importance to its shareholders and which might some day \nproduce revenues for the Corporation. The agreement has prompted no \nknown environmental group concerns and seems to be the classic ``win-\nwin-win'' solution that all sides should be congratulated for crafting. \nThe key, however, is for Congress to ratify the land conveyance changes \nby 2011, when the agreement ratification window closes.\n  Passage of this act is certainly in keeping with the spirit of the \nAlaska Lands Conveyance Acceleration Act that this body passed 5 years \nago that was intended to help settle all outstanding land conveyance \nissues by 2009--the 50th anniversary of Alaska statehood. In Alaska \nwhere controversy abounds over land use, this is a hard-fought \ncompromise agreement that seemingly satisfies all parties and makes \ngood sense for all concerned. I hope this body can ratify this bill \nswiftly and move it to the House of Representatives for its concurrence \nand eventual signing by the President. The bill is important for \nresidents of Nome who utilize the area and for all Alaska Natives who \nlive in the Bering Straits Region.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. FEINGOLD (for himself and Mr. McCain):\n  S. 524. A bill to amend the Congressional Budget and Impoundment \nControl Act of 1974 to provide for the expedited consideration of \ncertain proposed rescissions of budget authority; to the Committee on \nthe Budget.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I am pleased to once again offer this \nmeasure, the Congressional Accountability and Line-Item Veto Act of \n2009 with my colleague from Wisconsin, the Ranking Member of the House \nBudget Committee, Congressman Paul Ryan. I have worked with Congressman \nRyan on this issue for the last two years. He and I belong to different \npolitical parties, and differ on many issues. But we do share at least \ntwo things in common--our hometown of Janesville, WI, and an abiding \nrespect for Wisconsin's tradition of fiscal responsibility.\n  I am also delighted to be joined by my colleague, the senior Senator \nfrom Arizona, Mr. McCain, in introducing the Congressional \nAccountability and Line-Item Veto Act of 2009. Senator McCain has been \none of the preeminent champions of earmark reform, and I have been \npleased to work with him in fighting this abuse over the last two \ndecades.\n  The measure we are each introducing today would grant the President \nspecific authority to rescind or cancel congressional earmarks, \nincluding earmarked spending, tax breaks, and tariff benefits. This new \nauthority would sunset at the end of 2014, ensuring that Congress will \nhave a chance to review its use in two different presidential terms \nbefore considering whether or not to extend it. While not a true line-\nitem veto bill, our measure provides for fast-track consideration of \nthe President's proposed cancellation of earmarks. Thus, unlike current \nlaw, it ensures that for the specific category of congressional \nearmarks, the President will get an up or down vote on his proposed \ncancellations.\n  There have been a number of so-called line-item veto proposals \noffered in the past several years. But the measure we propose today is \nunique in that it specifically targets the very items that every line-\nitem veto proponent cites when promoting a particular measure, namely \nearmarks. When President Bush asked for this kind of authority, the \nexamples he gave when citing wasteful spending he wanted to target were \ncongressional earmarks.\n  When Members of the House or Senate tout a new line-item veto \nauthority to go after government waste, the examples they give are \ncongressional earmarks. When editorial pages argue for a new line-item \nveto, they, too, cite congressional earmarks as the reason for granting \nthe President this new authority.\n  That is exactly what our bill does. It provides the President with \nnew expedited rescission authority--what has been commonly referred to \nas a line-item veto--to cancel congressional earmarks. The definitions \nof earmarks that we use are the very definitions upon which each house \nhas agreed in passing the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act in \nthe 110th Congress.\n  Unauthorized congressional earmarks are a serious problem. By one \nestimate, in 2004 alone more than $50 billion in earmarks were passed. \nWhile some in Congress may wish to dismiss this issue, this year a \nsingle bill, the omnibus appropriations bill we are considering in the \nSenate, has by one count over eight thousand earmarks that cost over $7 \nbillion. That is just one bill. We haven't even begun the \nappropriations process for the coming i cal year.\n  There is no excuse for a system that allows that kind of wasteful \nspending year after year, and while I have opposed granting the \nPresident line-item veto authority to effectively reshape programs like \nMedicare and Medicaid, for this specific category, I support giving the \nPresident this additional tool.\n  Under our proposal, wasteful spending does not have anywhere to hide. \nIt is out in the open, so that both Congress and the President have a \nchance to get rid of wasteful projects before they begin.\n  The taxpayers--who pay the price for these projects--deserve a \nprocess that shows some real fiscal discipline, and that's what we are \ntrying to get at with this legislation.\n  President Obama recognizes the pernicious effect earmarks have on the \nentire process. When he asked Congress to take the extraordinary step \nof sending him a massive economic recovery package, he knew such a \nlarge package of spending and tax cuts would naturally attract \nearmarks. He also recognized that were earmarks to be added to the \nbill, it would undermine his ability to get it enacted, so he rightly \ninsisted it be free of earmarks.\n  I was pleased to hear reports that President Obama looks forward to \ngiving the line item veto a ``test drive.'' I very much hope that with \nthis bill we can give him that opportunity.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 524\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n[[Page S2769]]\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON ABUSE OF PROPOSED REPEALS AND \n                   CANCELLATIONS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress no President or any executive \n     branch official should condition the inclusion or exclusion \n     or threaten to condition the inclusion or exclusion of any \n     proposed repeal or cancellation in any special message under \n     this section upon any vote cast or to be cast by any Member \n     of either House of Congress.\n\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I am honored to once again be joining my \nfriend, colleague, and partner in reform, Senator Feingold, in \nintroducing the Congressional Accountability and Line-Item Veto Act. \nAdditionally, I would like to thank Republican Paul Ryan from Wisconsin \nfor introducing this legislation in the House of Representatives. I \napplaud my two colleagues from Wisconsin for their leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n  Our bill does a number of things. First, it provides the President \nwith a constitutional line item veto authority. This legislation would \nensure timely consideration of earmark rescission requests by the \nPresident, which must be submitted to Congress within 30 calendar days \nof signing a bill into law. It gives the House and Senate 12 \nlegislative days to act after the President sends a rescission. It \nrespects and preserves Congress's constitutional responsibilities, as \nit requires both the House and Senate to pass a rescission request \nbefore it can become law. This bill limits the number of rescission \nrequests per bill to guard against gridlock in Congress due to multiple \nrescission proposals. Finally, it sunsets at the end of 2014 in order \nto review how the authority is working after the administration has had \nthe opportunity to work with Congress to employ this tool to control \nspending and to determine if it should be renewed.\n  Why do we need to grant the President a line-item veto authority? \nCurrently the Senate is debating a pork-filled $410 billion, 2,967 page \nOmnibus appropriations bill to fund the Federal Government through the \nsecond half of the fiscal year. Not surprising, the measure is chock \nfull of over 9,000 unnecessary and wasteful earmarks. We need serious \nreform and we need it now--this Omnibus appropriations bill is a \nperfect example of what is wrong with this system.\n  Here are some examples of the earmarks contained in the omnibus \nlegislation:\n  $1.7 million for pig odor research in Iowa; $2 million for the \npromotion of astronomy in Hawaii; $6.6 million for termite research in \nNew Orleans; $2.1 million for the Center for Grape Genetics in New \nYork; $650,000 for beaver management in North Carolina and Mississippi; \n$1 million for mormon cricket control in Utah; $332,000 for the design \nand construction of a school sidewalk in Franklin, Texas; $870,000 for \na wolf breeding facilities in North Carolina and Washington, $300,000 \nfor the Montana World Trade Center; $1.7M ``for a honey bee factory'' \nin Weslaco, TX; $951,500 for Sustainable Las Vegas; $143,000 for Nevada \nHumanities to develop and expand an online encyclopedia; $475,000 to \nbuild a parking garage in Provo City, Utah; $200,000 for a tattoo \nremoval violence outreach program in the LA area; $238,000 for the \nPolynesian Voyaging Society in Honolulu, Hawaii; $100,000 for the \nregional robotics training center in Union, SC; $1,427,250 for genetic \nimprovements of switchgrass; $167,000 for the Autry National Center for \nthe American West in Los Angeles, CA; $143,000 to teach art energy; \n$100,000 for the Central Nebraska World Trade Center; $951,500 for the \nOregon Solar Highway; $819,000 for catfish genetics research in \nAlabama; $190,000 for the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Cody, WY; \n$209,000 to improve blueberry production and efficiency in GA; $400,000 \nfor copper wire theft prevention efforts; $250,000 to enhance research \non Ice Seal populations; $238,000 for the Alaska PTA; $150,000 for a \nrodeo museum in South Dakota; $47,500 to remodel and expand a \nplayground in Ottawa, IL; $285,000 for the Discovery Center of Idaho in \nBoise, ID; $632,000 for the Hungry Horse Project; $380,000 for a \nrecreation and fairground area in Kotzebue, AK; $118,750 for a building \nto house an aircraft display in Rantoul, IL; $380,000 to revitalize \ndowntown Aliceville, AL; $380,000 for lighthouses in Maine; $190,000 to \nbuild a Living Science Museum in New Orleans, LA; $7,100,000 for the \nconservation and recovery of endangered Hawaiian sea turtle \npopulations; $900,000 for fish management; $150,000 for lobster \nresearch; $381,000 for Jazz at Lincoln Center, New York; $1.9 million \nfor the Pleasure Beach Water Taxi Service Project, CT; $238,000 for \nPittsburgh Symphony Orchestra for curriculum development; $95,000 for \nHawaii Public Radio; $95,000 for the state of New Mexico to find a \ndental school location; $143,000 for the Dayton Society of Natural \nHistory in Dayton, OH; $190,000 for the Guam Public Library; $143,000 \nfor the Historic Jazz Foundation in Kansas City, MO; $3,806,000 for a \nSun Grant Initiative in South Dakota; $59,000 for Dismal Swamp and \nDismal Swamp Canal in Virginia; and $950,000 for a Convention Center in \nMyrtle Beach, SC;\n  This waste is outrageous, and the President should veto this omnibus \nspending bill. The process is clearly broken, and the American public \ndeserves better.\n  We need to curtail earmarks, not just disclose them. Again, the \nexamples I have just mentioned are earmarks that are among the over \n9,000 contained in the omnibus legislation currently\n\n[[Page S2772]]\n\nbeing considered in the Senate--so it is clear that the lobbying and \nethics reform bill that was enacted in August 2007 has done nothing to \ncurb this process--even though it continues to be touted for its \n``tough'' and ``historic'' earmark reform provisions.\n\n  Perhaps even more troubling than the number of earmarks is to whom \nand how some of this funding is being directed. Contained within the \nOmnibus appropriations legislation are 14 earmarks, totaling nearly \n$9.7 million, directed to clients of the PMA Group, a lobbying firm \nrecently forced to close their doors after being raided last November \nby the FBI for suspicious campaign donation practices. That firm \nremains under investigation today. I have long spoken of a broken \nappropriations process, vulnerable to corruption and abuse, and the \nallegations against the PMA Group and some Members of Congress stand as \na testament to the urgent need for reform. It is wholly inappropriate \nfor Congress to allow these provisions to move forward while their \nprincipal sponsor is under Federal investigation. Together with my \ncolleague from Oklahoma, Dr. Coburn, we offered an amendment to strip \nthese earmarks from the omnibus. If our amendment fails we will \neffectively be giving our tacit approval to the abuses we have \nrepeatedly declared our intention to eliminate.\n  Six months ago, in a debate in Oxford, MS, President Obama stated \nthat ``We need earmark reform, and when I'm president, I will go line \nby line to make sure that we are not spending money unwisely.'' I fully \nagree. All one needs to do is read the Omnibus appropriations bill \npending before the Senate to know that we need serious, comprehensive \nearmark reform and we need to grant the President a constitutional \nline-item veto authority so that he can go line by line through these \nbloated, earmark filled appropriations bills and send rescission \nrequests to Congress.\n  Our current economic situation and our vital national security \nconcerns require that now, more than ever, we prioritize our Federal \nspending. But our appropriations bills do not always put our national \npriorities first. The process is broken and it needs to be fixed. We \nhave entered the second year of a recession. Record numbers of \nhomeowners face foreclosure. The national unemployment rate stands at \n7.2%--the highest in 16 years--with over 1.9 million people having lost \ntheir jobs in the last 4 months of 2008. Additionally, we learned just \nFriday that the GDP sank 6.2 percent in the last quarter of 2008--far \nworse even than what was expected--with the economy contracting by the \nfastest pace in a quarter century.\n  Even when faced with these tremendous difficulties, Congress's \nappetite for pork seems bigger than ever. When are people going to wake \nup and truly grasp the seriousness of the economic situation \nconfronting us? We cannot afford, literally, to continue to operate \nunder the same Washington status quo.\n  Let's consider some cold, hard facts: current national debt: $10.7 \ntrillion; 2009 projected deficit: $1.2 trillion; total cost of the \neconomic stimulus enacted two weeks ago: $1.124 trillion; ($789 billion \nplus interest; TARP I and II: $700 billion; TARP III: $250 billion-$750 \nbillion, or more; President's Budget Request for 2010: $3.6 trillion.\n  I was encouraged in January 2007 when the Senate passed, by a vote of \n96 to 2, an ethics and lobbying reform package which contained real, \nmeaningful earmark reforms. I thought that, at last, we would finally \nenact some effective reforms. Unfortunately, that victory was short \nlived. In August 2007, we were presented with a bill containing very \nwatered down earmark provisions and doing far too little to rein in \nwasteful earmarks and porkbarrel spending. We can change that and enact \nreforms that will help to restore the faith and confidence of the \nAmerican people in their elected representatives--and passing this bill \nshould be the first step we take.\n  Again, the bill we are introducing today will ensure timely \ncongressional consideration of earmark rescission requests by the \nPresident. This will enable the President to propose the removal of \nwasteful earmarks from legislation that arrives on his desk for \nsignature and send these earmarks back to Congress for expedited votes \non whether or not to rescind funding; give the House and Senate 12 \nlegislative days after the President sends a rescission request to \nCongress to bring a rescission bill to consideration on the floor of \nthe full House and Senate; respect and preserve Congress's \nconstitutional responsibilities, as it requires both the House and \nSenate to pass a rescission request before it can become law. If either \nthe House or Senate votes against a rescission by a simple majority, it \nis not enacted; require the President to submit earmark rescission \nrequests to Congress within 30 calendar days of signing a bill into \nlaw; limit the number of rescission requests per bill, to guard against \ngridlock in Congress due to multiple rescission proposals. Under this \nlegislation, the President can propose one rescission package per \nordinary bill, or two rescission packages for omnibus legislation. Each \nrescission package may include multiple earmarks; sunset at the end of \n2014, providing a President this tool to control spending over the \nportions of two different Presidential terms. The sunset provision \nwould give Congress the ability to review this legislation and decide \nwhether to renew it.\n  As my colleagues are well aware, for years I have been coming to the \nSenate floor to read list after list of the ridiculous items we have \nspent money on--hoping enough embarrassment might spur some change. And \nyear after year I would offer amendment after amendment to strip \nporkbarrel projects from spending bills--usually only getting a handful \nof votes each time. Earmarks are like a cancer. Left unchecked, they \nhave grown out of control. And just as cancer destroys tissue and vital \norgans, the corruption associated with the process of earmarking is \ndestroying what is vital to our strength as a Nation, that is, the \nfaith and trust of the American people in their elected representatives \nand in the institutions of their Government.\n  We must keep in mind that even strong line-item veto authority will \nnot solve all of our fiscal problems. We also desperately need to \nreform our earmarking process and our lobbying practices--and we must \nremember that it is ultimately Congress's responsibility to control \nspending. However, granting the President the authority to propose \nrescissions that then must be approved by the Congress would go a long \nway toward restoring credibility to a system ravaged by congressional \nwaste and special interest pork. I look forward to the Senate's \nconsideration of this legislation. It is abundantly clear that the time \nhas come for us to eliminate the corrupt, wasteful practice of \nearmarking.\n  In his final State of the Union Address, President Reagan stood for \nthe last time before both Houses of Congress and asked for line-item \nveto authority for future Presidents. On that evening, the President \nhad with him three pieces of legislation: an appropriations bill that \nwas 1,053 pages long and weighed 14 pounds; a budget reconciliation \nbill that was 1,186 pages long and weighed 15 pounds; and a continuing \nresolution that was 1,057 pages long and weighed 14 pounds. President \nReagan slammed down on the lectern the 43 pounds of paper and ink, \nwhich represented $1 trillion worth of spending. He did so to emphasize \nthe magnitude of wasteful spending in the bills--spending that the \nPresident could not stop unless he was willing to veto each piece of \nlegislation in its entirety. In the case of the continuing resolution, \nthat would have meant that the Federal government would shut down.\n  More than 20 years later we are in exactly the same situation we were \nin when President Reagan said to Congress, ``Let's help ensure our \nfuture of prosperity by giving the President a tool that, though I will \nnot get to use it, is one I know future Presidents of either party must \nhave. Give the President the same authority that 43 Governors use in \ntheir States: the right to reach into massive appropriation bills, pare \naway the waste, and enforce budget discipline. Let's approve the line-\nitem veto.''\n  The time has come to heed Ronald Reagan's call for line-item veto \nauthority.\n\n[[Page S2773]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/04/senate-section/article/S2773-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S2773-S2775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n  SENATE RESOLUTION 63--TO AMEND THE STANDING RULES OF THE SENATE TO \n      ENSURE THAT ALL CONGRESSIONALLY DIRECTED SPENDING ITEMS IN \n APPROPRIATIONS AND AUTHORIZATION LEGISLATION FALL UNDER THE OVERSIGHT \n  AND TRANSPARENCY PROVISIONS OF S. 1, THE HONEST LEADERSHIP AND OPEN \n                         GOVERNMENT ACT OF 2007\n\n  Mrs. McCASKILL (for herself and Mr. Udall of Colorado) submitted the \nfollowing resolution; which was referred to the Committee on Rules and \nAdministration:\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, I disagree with earmarks. I disagree \nwith the process. Although we have made great strides in reforming \nearmarks, I do think there are further steps we need to take.\n  Today, I have introduced a resolution, a Senate resolution, with the \nsenior Senator from Colorado, Mr. Udall, to bring even more \ntransparency to this process. Basically, this resolution requires all \nrequests to be posted on committee Web sites and the Member's Web site \nwithin 48 hours of request. It requires all information in the request \nletter be listed online, including location, purpose, and cost. This is \nnot presently required. It requires electronically searchable text of \nall bills and conference reports, and it strengthens the ability to \nremove earmarks by a point of order.\n  There are some loopholes that we, I think inadvertently, created when \nwe did S. 1 early in my first year as a Senator.\n  This resolution will require earmarks to be in the bill text. I \ndiscovered that there were some airdropped earmarks in a bill. Because \nthey were in a managers' statement, the point of order was not \npossible. So this requires all the earmarks to be in the bill text, \nwhich will subject them to the rules. It applies the airdrop point of \norder to the authorization bills in addition to the appropriations \nbills, and it further limits earmarks to public projects only.\n  In this time, I do not believe we can afford to be earmarking in the \nprivate sector or anywhere other than the public sector as we struggle \nwith our deficits and our spending.\n  But I really rose today not to speak so much about the resolution I \nhave introduced today but more to speak a little bit about how confused \nI have been over the last few weeks by many of my friends on the other \nside of the aisle. While we have a lot of work to do in regard to \nearmarks, I congratulate my party because we have created transparency. \nWe now know who is earmarking, and because of that we now know that \nearmarking has nothing to do with party. Yes, there are thousands of \nearmarks in this bill by Democrats, but there are thousand of earmarks \nin this bill by Republicans.\n  Earmarking is not about party. Earmarking is about power. This is \nabout whether you have the power to get an earmark, and power depends \non various things when it comes to earmarking. It depends on what \ncommittee you are on. It depends on whether you are an appropriator. It \ndepends on your seniority. It depends on whether you have a tough \nelection fight. It depends, to some extent, on whether you are in the \nminority party or in the majority party because the split is 60-40 \nright now. Sixty percent of the earmarks--it is kind of an unwritten \nrule--go to the majority party and 40 percent go to the minority party. \nIt was the other way around when the Democrats were not in power. That \ndoesn't seem to me to be a very logical way to spend public money. It \nshould be about the merit of the project. It should be about cost-\nbenefit.\n  There are many people making the argument that we should not let \nbureaucrats decide. Congress has had the power of the purse for over \n200 years. Congress has been directing spending in this country for \nover 200 years.\n  Earmarks are a new creation. The first earmarking started in the \n1970s, that ability to make a solitary, lonely decision as to where \nmoney is going to be directed. In fact, in 1991, there were only 541 \nearmarks, and at the height of earmarking, under President Bush and \nunder a Republican-controlled Congress, there was $27 billion in \nearmarks. In fact, the number of earmarks has been cut in half under \nthe leadership of my party.\n  This notion that bureaucrats are doing the decisionmaking is wrong--\nwe have the power to tell the bureaucrats how to spend the money. We \ncan tell them it is formula grants. We can tell them it is competitive \ngrants. In fact, that is what we do for 99 percent of the budget. We \ntell the executive branch how to spend the money. It is now only for 1 \npercent that we decided we cannot tell the bureaucrats how to spend the \nmoney, so this notion that somehow we need to do earmarks because the \nbureaucrats are going to run amok--I don't get it.\n  In fact, most earmarks skim money off other programs. You can look at \nthe history of the Byrne grants. They have gone down over the last 8 or \n9 years. Now we are increasing them--which is great. Byrne grants are \ncompetitive at the local level. But what happened while the Byrne \ngrants were going down? In the same time, earmarks were going up. There \nis a connection.\n  When money is skimmed off the formula for highways, that is just more \nlocal projects that the local people want to build that are not built \nbecause a Senator or Congressman knows better.\n  Now, here is the weird part about this. This is what I want to focus \non today: my friends on the other side of the aisle. I listened while \npodiums were pounded about wasteful spending during the debate on the \nstimulus bill, during the debate on the economic recovery bill. I \nwatched as my friends across the aisle took to the airwaves and gave \nmany different speeches about wasteful spending in the stimulus bill.\n  Let me quote some of the things they said:\n\n       Pet programs. Honey pot for whatever you need. A porkulus \n     bill. Wasteful spending. Pet projects. Earmarks. Earmarks. \n     Earmarks. An orgy of spending.\n\n\n[[Page S2774]]\n\n\n  That was what they said about the stimulus bill, when, in reality, \nthere were no earmarks in the stimulus bill. Everything that was spent \nin the stimulus bill was either competitive grants or formula funding.\n  Now, here is the weird part. They went on and on and on during the \nstimulus bill about earmarking. No fewer than 17 different Senators \nstood, and with absolute righteous indignation, talked about the pet \nprojects in the stimulus bill. Guess what? Every single one of them has \nearmarks in this bill. One member of Republican leadership said:\n\n       That is the problem with earmarks. All Senators are equal, \n     except some Senators are more equal than others when it comes \n     to slipping things in bills.\n\n  Every single member of the Republican leadership has earmarks in this \nbill. Every single one of them. Every single one of those people \nrejected the stimulus that was one of the largest tax cuts in American \nhistory, but had no earmarks, because supposedly they were so upset \nabout wasteful spending.\n  Those very same Senators have earmarks in this bill, such as the \nInterstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference. The Interstate Shellfish \nSanitation Conference, beaver management, parking lots, all brought to \nyou by the very same people who called out wasteful spending in the \nPresident's economic recovery bill.\n  If you do not take my word for it, check out the Taxpayers For Common \nSense Web site. According to their statistics, 6 of the top 10 \nearmarkers in this bill are my friends on the other side of the aisle. \nIn fact, the Republican leader has twice as many solo earmark dollars \nin this bill than the Democratic leader.\n  America, do not be fooled. Earmarking is an equal opportunity \nactivity. It is a bad habit. The minority party is taking full \nadvantage of it. Do not take anyone seriously who says one thing and \ndoes another. That is the worst sin of all. Any parent knows one basic \nrule: The example you set is way more important than anything you say.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I rise in support of the \nMcCaskill-Udall resolution on earmark reform, and I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this legislation so ably authored by my \ncolleague, Senator McCaskill. I have appreciated the opportunity to \nwork with her in developing this bill, which is designed to strengthen \ntransparency and accountability in the way Congress authorizes and \nappropriates Federal dollars.\n  If there was ever a time in our history when we needed to reassure \nthe American people that Congress understands the need for reform and \nintegrity in the process of authorizing and appropriating Federal \nfunds, it is now. It is today. As our economy continues a deep slide \ninto recession, we have found it necessary to stimulate recovery with \nhistoric levels of public spending.\n  Now, the American people expect us to act with speed but not haste. \nThey also expect Federal spending will reflect critical national \npriorities and broader public purpose. Most of all, they expect \nCongress to pass funding bills in ways that ensure wise use of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  Those are the purposes of this legislation. It is not just about \npreventing the abuse of so-called congressional earmarks, it is, \nrather, about reassuring the American people that their dollars and the \ndebt future generations will incur as a result of our spending will be \ndebated in the sunshine of public scrutiny.\n  In short, this bill is about restoring integrity to a legislative \nprocess that has, for a number of reasons, gone off track. It is about \nrestoring public confidence in the legislative branch. Now, I say this \nwithout casting any aspersions on the motive of my colleagues in this \ninstitution or my former colleagues in the other body. Most of us have \nsought earmarks for our States and our districts because of a sincere \ndesire to help our constituents and support worthy projects.\n  Along the way, however, the public has lost confidence in the \nintegrity of this process. Although there have been too many ``bridges \nto nowhere,'' the problem is as much about the process that yields \nthese earmarks. They are tucked into spending bills without an \nopportunity to debate or consider their merits or even their true \nauthors.\n  This bill brings important reform to the earmark process. First, it \nrequires that all earmarks be included in the text of bills rather than \na separate ``statement of managers'' that is not technically part of \nthe bill text. Previously legislation allows Senators to strip out \nearmarks from bill text only, not from the statement of managers.\n  This reform will result in greater transparency because it will make \nit possible for any earmark to be stripped out of the bill. Second, the \nbill requires that all earmarks requested by a Senator be posted on a \nSenator's Web site within 48 hours after the request. It also requires \ncommittees to post on their Web sites all information that Senators are \nrequired to submit about an earmark request, including the name of the \nproposed recipient, the location, purpose, and financial certification \nfrom Senators certifying they have no financial interest in that \nproject and all within 48 hours of receiving that request.\n  This reform, in short, offers a check against the information that \nSenators post on their own Web sites and provides fuller transparency \nby requiring this information to be compiled in a central location. \nCitizens know how to use the Web, and it has increasingly become a \nwatchdog tool for Government. Instead of shrinking from it, I believe \nwe should embrace this technology to inform our constituents and, yes, \ninvite their comment and even criticism.\n  Third, this bill prohibits earmarks from private or nonprofit \nentities. By limiting earmark requests to the public sector, we avoid \nthe risk of inadvertently helping a campaign donor or mixing a private \ngain with a public purpose. An earmark to help our communities ought to \nbe community based and community supported. There ought to be a public \nbenefit that is recognized in a way that is accountable to public \ndecisionmakers.\n  Fourth, this bill prevents earmarks from mysteriously surfacing in \nconference negotiations on authorization bills. Previous legislation \nalready prohibits this air dropping of earmarks in conference \nnegotiations on appropriations bills, but this reform would broaden \nthat proposition to include authorization bills, which are often \nconsidered to be blueprints for the annual funding bills.\n  Let me be clear. I admire the hard work of our committee chairs and \ntheir staffs, and my experience in both Chambers has led me to the \nconclusion that great effort is made to ensure integrity and \naccountability in spending bills. Important, and often very complex \nbills, can be undermined in the public eye when individual earmarks are \nnot carefully scrutinized. We can all agree that it often takes only \none bad apple to spoil even the best barrel, and this provision is \ndesigned to keep out the bad apples.\n  Fifth, the bill requires that all appropriations and authorization \nconference reports be electronically searchable at least 48 hours \nbefore they can be considered by the full Senate. This reform will help \nthe public and Congress identify earmarks that were added during the \nconference in appropriations bills that can be thousands of pages long.\n  In conclusion, I believe we can begin the important work of restoring \npublic confidence in the way Congress legislates if we continue on the \npath we began in 2007, with earmark and ethics reform. This bill closes \nloopholes in the law we passed in 2007, and strengthens accountability, \ntransparency, and integrity.\n  Now, there are some who would argue for abolishing all earmarks, \nincluding those supporting governmental entities. I have to tell you, I \nthink that may be a case of throwing the baby out with the bathwater. \nAt a time of economic crisis, I believe it is important for Senators to \nhave the tools that can direct Federal funding to job-creating projects \nin their home States.\n  For those of us who are not fortunate enough to be appropriators, the \nopportunity to offer carefully considered earmarks is important. I have \nnot come to the conclusion that all earmarks are bad; in fact, it is \nthe process of their consideration and inclusion that needs reform.\n  Along with a constitutional line item veto and other reform measures, \nI believe that, in fact I know, we can construct a path of reform that \nis both fiscally responsible and in keeping with the highest ethical \nstandards.\n\n[[Page S2775]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "04"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/04/senate-section/article/S2775-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S2775]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 64--RECOGNIZING THE NEED FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL \n    PROTECTION AGENCY TO END DECADES OF DELAY AND UTILIZE EXISTING \n     AUTHORITY UNDER THE RESOURCE CONSERVATION AND RECOVERY ACT TO \n  COMPREHENSIVELY REGULATE COAL COMBUSTION WASTE AND THE NEED FOR THE \n  TENNESSEE VALLEY AUTHORITY TO BE A NATIONAL LEADER IN TECHNOLOGICAL \n       INNOVATION, LOW-COST POWER, AND ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP\n\n  Mrs. BOXER (for herself and Mr. Carper) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works:\n\n                               S. Res. 64\n\n       Whereas the burning of coal creates more than 130,000,000 \n     tons of coal combustion waste a year;\n       Whereas coal combustion waste is made up of various types \n     of waste, including fly ash, bottom ash, boiler slag, and \n     flue gas emission control waste;\n       Whereas the National Academy of Sciences found that coal \n     combustion waste ``often contain a mixture of metals \n     [including arsenic, lead, selenium, mercury, cadmium, \n     beryllium, chromium, thorium and uranium] and other \n     constituents in sufficient quantities that they may pose \n     public health and environmental concerns if improperly \n     managed.'';\n       Whereas the 2 most common forms of disposal for coal \n     combustion waste are landfills and surface impoundments, with \n     impoundments generally holding a ``wet'' waste mixture of \n     water and landfills holding a ``dry'' waste that does not \n     include intentionally added water, although other forms of \n     disposal also occur in other areas including mines;\n       Whereas a 1993 report prepared for the United States \n     Department of Energy found that over the preceding 50 years, \n     roughly 500,000,000 tons of coal combustion waste were \n     disposed of at then-existing or operating waste management \n     units, and that about 1,000,000,000 tons of coal combustion \n     wastes had been disposed of at an estimated 759 closed units;\n       Whereas the United States Environmental Protection Agency \n     reported to Congress in 1999 that there were roughly 600 \n     fossil fuel combustion waste disposal units operating at \n     approximately 450 coal-fired power plants;\n       Whereas the United States Department of Energy in 2006 \n     found: ``The total number of [coal combustion waste] disposal \n     units permitted, built, or laterally expanded between January \n     1, 1994 and December 31, 2004 (`new units') is not known, as \n     no industry organization or government agency tracks this \n     information,'';\n       Whereas on Monday, December 22, 2008 at 1:00 a.m. a wall \n     constructed of coal combustion waste and dirt failed on a 84-\n     acre surface impoundment holding coal combustion waste and \n     water at the Kingston Fossil Plant in Harriman, Tennessee, 40 \n     miles west of Knoxville;\n       Whereas the spill from this ``wet storage'' impoundment at \n     the Kingston plant released 5,400,000 cubic yards of waste, \n     equaling more than 1,000,000,000 gallons or an amount nearly \n     100 times greater than the amount of oil spilled in the Exxon \n     Valdez disaster, into the Emory River and the surrounding \n     valley and community;\n       Whereas the spill from the Kingston plant covered half of a \n     square mile of land and water with waste up to 12 feet deep, \n     destroying roads, waterways, wildlife, trees, railroad \n     tracks, and impacting 42 properties, 40 homes, and sections \n     and coves of the Emory River used by businesses, community \n     members, families, and children;\n       Whereas the Kingston spill occurred around 1:00 a.m. in the \n     morning in December, but if it had occurred at midday during \n     the summer, when businesses, community members, families, and \n     children regularly use the river and coves, the already-\n     extensive property damage could have been far greater and the \n     loss of life could have been catastrophic;\n       Whereas the United States Department of Energy has \n     information demonstrating wet storage impoundments present \n     risks to public safety, health, and the environment: ``[W]et \n     impoundment systems require substantially greater disposal \n     site volumes than dry systems. . .
