Mr. President, at the moment, I think it is safe to \nsay that the most important issue for the American people is the state \nof the economy and the massive amount of taxing, spending, and \nborrowing that some in Washington are proposing as an antidote to the \ndownturn.\n  Yet now comes news of another proposal out of Washington that is sure \nto make most Americans join together in unison and exclaim, ``Only in \nWashington.''\n  Earlier this week, the Washington Post reported on the return of a \nuniquely bad idea. I am referring to bailouts for politicians or what \nsome people politely refer to as public financing of campaigns.\n  In recent years, this horrible idea has been championed by some who \nlater abandoned this very system during their own campaigns. Well, it \nis hard to defend a system that is rejected even by its strongest \nadvocates. It is harder still to justify handouts for politicians at a \ntime of soaring deficits, a shrinking economy, and massive job losses.\n  At a time when most Americans are outraged that tax dollars have been \nused to pay million-dollar bonuses to executives at failed financial \nfirms, it's hard to convince anyone that taxpayer dollars should cover \nthe cost of balloons, bunting, and campaign barbecues.\n  But don't take it from me--every year, Americans register their \nopposition to the idea of taxpayer-funded campaigns in the largest \nnationwide poll ever devised. On April 15, Americans are asked on their \ntax forms whether they support taxpayer-funded elections. The question \nis clear and straightforward: Do we want our money to go to soldiers \nand schools or streamers and stump speeches? Well, more than 90 percent \nof us vote for the former--and the percentage only seems to get higher \nevery year. In 1980, the percentage of Americans who agreed to divert \ntheir tax money from the Treasury to pay for political campaigns \nreached its high water mark at 28.7 percent. Since then, it's \nplummeted. In 2007, the last year for which figures are readily \navailable, 8.3 percent of taxpayers thought taxpayer funded elections \nwere a good idea.\n  America faces many challenges at the moment, and the American \ntaxpayer is justifiably worried about the prospect of what too much \nspending, too much taxing, and too much borrowing will mean for the \nfuture of our country and for our children. Congress should heed the \nadvice of nearly all Americans: Don't use our tax dollars to pay for \nyour political campaigns. Taxpayer-funded campaigns are a bad idea at \nany time, according to 90 percent of Americans. They are a really bad \nidea in the middle of a recession.\n  I yield the floor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/26/senate-section/article/S3818-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3818]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       RESERVATION OF LEADER TIME\n\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, I understand the Senator from North \nDakota, the chairman of the Budget Committee, may come to the floor. If \nhe does and wants to speak, I will defer to him.\n  In the meantime, I will address the President's budget, which the \nSenate will begin to consider this morning at 10 o'clock. Those of us \nwho have spent a lot of time around schools, children, and education \nknow there is a very good way to get a picture of the future and that \nis to walk into a first-grade class in Arkansas, Tennessee or anywhere \nelse in America and take a photograph of the first graders. If you do \nthat, you have a picture of that town, that neighborhood, that \ncommunity, and our country 10, 15, 20 years out.\n  The President's budget plan for the next 10 years gives us that kind \nof photograph of the future of our country. I commend the President for \nhis candor, but I don't like the picture I see. I think, increasingly, \nour friends around the world and people in this country feel the same \nway. The Budget Committee chairman, Senator Conrad, has developed a \ndifferent budget--somewhat different. He says it is about 98 percent \nsimilar to the President's budget. What the chairman, Senator Conrad, \ndoes is say let's look 5 years out, not 10 years, as the President has \nsuggested. Senator Conrad has moved a few ``children'' out of the \npicture--the alternative minimum tax ``child'' is over here during the \nclass photograph, so we will not be seeing that person. I think the \n``doc fix'' to avoid cuts in physician payments, which we are going to \nspend money on, is over here, so we will not see that ``child'' during \nthe class picture. The money for the banks--I think we all hope \nSecretary Geithner's plan to begin to get toxic assets out of the banks \nwill work. If it doesn't, we may have to go to plan B, and we should \nhave the money in reserve if that is necessary. That ``child'' is also \nout of the class photograph.\n  With all respect, the attempt of the chairman of the committee to \npresent a 5-year budget, leaving out items that we know we will be \nspending money on, doesn't come nearly as close to giving us an \naccurate picture of what the country would be like 10 years from now \nwith the budget we are acting upon.\n  The President's photograph of the future is a more accurate picture, \none we should pay attention to. But it is a blueprint for America that \nis a very different kind of America--an America with less freedom, with \nmore Government, with more taxes, with more spending, with more \nborrowing, and an America that our children and our grandchildren will \nhave difficulty affording. This blueprint that President Obama has laid \nout for us includes a trillion dollars more in spending for health care \non top of the trillion dollars in so-called stimulus money that was \nspent. It includes more than a trillion dollars in taxes, including a \nnational sales tax on energy in the middle of a recession. It would \ndouble the debt in 5 years and nearly triple the national debt in 10 \nyears.\n  There is nothing in the President's budget that would seriously get \nto work on something he said he wants to work on, which is out-of-\ncontrol entitlement spending, which accounts for more than 60 percent \nof the spending in this budget.\n  It is important for the American people to know this budget that we \nbegin working on at 10 a.m. this morning is a budget of which 60 \npercent is out of Congress' hands. It is on automatic pilot. It is \nspending for Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, and it is going up--\neveryone agrees--at an unsustainable rate, which means we cannot earn \nenough money to pay at that rate 10, 15, 20 years out; and there is \nnothing in the budget that would begin to take charge of that problem, \nsuch as the commission that Senator Gregg and Senator Conrad have \nproposed; whereby, we would, as a Congress, come up with a plan and \npresent the plan for controlling entitlement spending, and we would \nvote it up or down--much in the same way that we deal with the \ndifficult problem of closing defense bases.\n  This 10-year picture of America's future is causing concern around \nthe world. In China, where the savings rate is as high as 50 percent, \ncompared to ours of about 1 percent--although it is up temporarily in \nthe recession to about 5 percent. In China, a country that buys many of \nour dollars, leaders there express extraordinary concern about the \nvalue of the dollar and whether they should continue to buy our \ndollars.\n  Of course, if people overseas do not find buying our dollar as \nattractive,\n\n[[Page S3819]]\n\nthe price of our dollar goes down and the cash we are paid when we work \nis worth less and we can buy less and our standard of living will be \nless.\n  We are a very lucky country. Here we are in the middle of this \nrecession where people are hurting, where people are having difficulty \nfinding jobs, and still in this year, we will be producing nearly a \nquarter of all the money in the world to be distributed among just 5 \npercent of the people in the world. One way we keep that high standard \nof living compared with the rest of the world is to make sure the \ndollars we produce and earn and spend are valuable dollars. If we spend \ntoo much and tax too much and borrow too much, they become worth less \nand China and other countries will not buy those dollars.\n  Not only is it causing concern in China, we have our European friends \nexpressing concern about the U.S. financial condition. This is a turn \nof affairs. I have heard a lot of comment on this floor and over in the \nHouse of Representatives about: Oh, my goodness, we don't want to be \nlike France, we don't want to be like some European country. We are \nalready worse than that in some ways. In order to be admitted to the \nEuropean Union, a country's annual deficit has to be less than 3 \npercent of its gross domestic product. We are already exceeding that. \nThe President's 10-year budget plan would have us settle in, after the \nrecession is over, at about 4 percent. So we would be permanently \ndisqualified from joining the European Union, according to the plan \nthat is laid out before us.\n  The plan also shows that every year of the 10 years of this budget, \nour total gross debt, which is all of the public debt we have--that is, \ndebt that we individuals have when we loan money to our own Government \nor that we owe to the Chinese when they buy our dollars, or other \ncountries around the world--that debt every year exceeds 90 percent of \nour gross domestic product, 90 percent of everything we work and earn \nand produce every year in this country that produces 25 percent of the \nworld's income. We would be at that level for each of the 10 years. \nThat is an alarming number. That is the highest amount of debt compared \nto our gross domestic product that we have had since the end of World \nWar II. And, of course, during World War II we were just paying no \nattention to what we spent, what we borrowed, what we taxed because we \nhad to win the war. Still we find ourselves today with that level of \ndebt.\n  Polls show this not only is causing concern around the world, it is \ncausing concern at home. I normally do not think it is wise for elected \nofficials to rely on public opinion polls when they vote. We are sent \nhere, of course, to respect the views of the people who elected us but \nalso to make some independent judgments.\n  The Peter G. Peterson Foundation--which is headed by with David \nWalker, the former Comptroller General of the United States--has done \nsome very important work over the last few years to try to bring to the \nAmerican people the seriousness of the problem of our debt. Earlier \nthis month, the Peter G. Peterson Foundation released a public opinion \nsurvey that was done jointly by Democratic and Republican pollsters. It \nshowed the following: that voters rank the need to address our budget \nchallenges as a top priority for the Obama administration second only \nto the need to get the economy back on track and get Americans back to \nwork; that Americans see the threat to our future posed by our growing \ndeficit and debt as more grave and more significant than global \nwarming, more grave and more significant than declines in education, \nmore grave and more significant than manufacturing, and more grave and \nmore significant than the prospect of a rogue nation developing a \nnuclear weapon.\n  In other words, the American people, like people in the rest of the \nworld, look at our fiscal condition, look at this budget discussion we \nare beginning at 10 a.m. today--in just a few minutes--and they are \nconcerned about this issue. We are the world leaders. Our dollar is the \nworld's currency by choice. People who buy and people who follow our \nleadership are concerned.\n  Another way to think about the importance of the debt is this way: In \nthe 10th year of the President's budget, we will be spending $800 \nbillion on interest alone. Our credit card will have that big a monthly \npayment just for interest. That means we will be spending more on \ninterest in the 10th year than we will on national defense, which is \n$700 billion. We will be spending eight times as much on interest as we \nwill be spending on education, eight times as much on interest as we \nwill be spending on transportation. Every dollar we spend on interest \nis a dollar we will not be spending on investments to protect our \nnation's competitive edge in the future, it is a dollar we will not \nhave in our pocket to spend for our families, it is a dollar the small \nbusinessperson will not have in his or her pocket to create a job, and \nit is a dollar that makes us a little less wealthy.\n  No one is suggesting that President Obama single-handedly caused \nthese large deficits this year or that he is responsible for the \neconomic mess in which we find ourselves. Our friends on the other \nside, the Democrats, always like to begin their speeches by blaming \nwhatever they can on President Bush. But I think the American people \nare ready for a talk about where do we go from here.\n  President Bush did not cause Hurricane Katrina, but he got in some \ntrouble for how he dealt with the cleanup after Hurricane Katrina. In \nthe same way, President Obama had nothing to do with the economic mess \nin which we find ourselves today, but he will be judged and his \nadministration will be correctly judged based upon how well they lead \nus in responding to the economic mess in which we find ourselves today. \nWe would suggest that spending this much, taxing this much, and \nborrowing this much will not help get us out of our economic mess.\n  The right way to deal with this is not to increase our debt levels to \nlevels that have not been seen since World War II. The right way to \ndeal with it is not to spend another trillion dollars on health care at \na time when we are already spending 17 percent of the gross domestic \nproduct, which is that much more than every other industrialized \ncountry in the world is spending. The right way to do it is not to put \na national energy tax on the American people in the middle of a \nrecession.\n  There is a better way, and I will be offering an amendment in a few \nminutes in the Budget Committee to show how we can deal with climate \nchange and clean air without new taxes.\n  We can do it by starting with conservation, with construction of 100 \nnew nuclear powerplants. That is 70 percent of our carbon-free energy \ntoday. We can do it by electrifying half our cars and trucks and \nplugging them into nuclear plants and to coal plants at night when they \nhave plenty of extra electricity. We do not have to build one new \npowerplant in the next 20 years for the purpose of charging plug-in \nelectric cars unless we wish to. We need to have aggressive research to \nmake solar power cost competitive, to find a way to capture the carbon \nproduced by coal plants, to have the safe processing of nuclear waste. \nWe need to be very aggressive on conservation and efficiency, which is \nthe easiest way for us to deal with clean energy.\n  We need to develop our oil and gas offshore. We can do it 10 miles \noffshore so we cannot see it, but we need to do it because the natural \ngas is important for home heating and, to some extent, for electricity. \nWe are going to be using oil even if we do electrify half our cars and \ntrucks, and we should be using our own oil instead of sending billions \nof dollars overseas and making us hostage to countries that are not \nalways friendly to us.\n  This is an important day in the Senate. This is a day when we begin \nto talk about the budget. We Republicans appreciate the fact that the \nPresident has given us a photograph of the future, in the same way we \nwould take a photograph of first graders, and imagine what the country \nwould look like in 10 years. We admire and appreciate his honesty in \ndoing that, but we do not like the picture we see--too much spending, \ntoo much debt, too much borrowing, levels that concern the world and \nlevels that concern the American people. It is not necessary to do \nthat. It is not a wise way to create jobs in this country and to begin \nto get us out of this economic mess--but it will give us in that \npicture of our future a very different kind of country with more \nGovernment, more debt, less freedom, and a country that our children \nand\n\n[[Page S3820]]\n\ngrandchildren will have a difficult time affording.\n  I yield the floor.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Mr. President, I rise today to discuss the coming debate \non the budget resolution. I am very concerned about the use of the \nbudget process to pass very complex climate legislation.\n  When you think about it, cap-and-trade bills are enormous bills. They \nare complex, they require discussion, thought, debate, and a very \ncareful weighing of the costs and the economic impacts of the \nlegislation. Such a thoughtful, careful approach is simply not possible \nif we were to choose to move ahead with a cap-and-trade bill through a \nbudget reconciliation process.\n  I am not alone in believing this. At least 32 of my colleagues agree \nwith me, and I suspect there are more. But these 32 colleagues cosigned \na letter which I circulated together with a man I admire and respect a \ngreat deal--the senior Senator from West Virginia--to the Budget \nCommittee. The letter plainly stated that we oppose the use of the \nbudget reconciliation process to consider complex cap-and-trade \nlegislation. Thereafter, the junior Senator from North Dakota, another \nman I admire and respect, also from the other side of the aisle, sent a \nletter to the Senate Budget Committee expressing similar concerns.\n  Some of the cosigners support cap and trade. Yet they also oppose \nusing budget reconciliation to enact it, to make it the law of the \nland. A group of Democrats in the House recently expressed identical \nconcerns.\n  Despite this very bipartisan, bicameral expression of clear \ndisapproval, there are some who continue to push the use of the budget \nreconciliation process for cap and trade. Press reports indicate that \nthe leadership in the Senate and in the House continue to discuss \npassing cap and trade through the budget reconciliation process. Just \nthis last weekend, administration officials indicated ``all options \nremained on the table.''\n  Even more troubling to me, yesterday we learned that the House \nincluded reconciliation instructions for the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, directing it to reduce the deficit by $1 billion by \n2014. But don't be deceived by the stated goal of reducing the deficit. \nThe House language, in my opinion, is a Trojan horse.\n\n  The fact is, this language opens the door to cap-and-trade \nlegislation at some point in the budget process. It could be set up to \nbring in $900 billion in fees and spend only $899 billion, for example. \nAuthors could claim to have reduced the deficit by $1 billion, but in \nreality every American family will have to pay thousands of dollars per \nyear in increased energy costs. The use of such language would clearly \nserve one purpose: to slip through a piece of legislation that could \nliterally change the economic landscape of this country under the cloak \nof the budget process.\n  To be very clear, my comments today are not meant to address the \ngeneral merits of climate change. I am simply saying no to \nshortchanging the legislative process and supporting instead a very \ncareful, deliberate, and meaningful review of the legislation. It is \ntroubling that leadership would even consider trying to put it in under \nthe mask of another bill.\n  When the Senate considered climate legislation last year, the bill \nset caps on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions through the year 2050. That \nis 40 years. The cost of such a cap is estimated to be $900 billion, \naccording to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It would \nreportedly require 400 additional staff at the Environmental Protection \nAgency just to set up the program and write the rules. What does that \nmean? It means requiring almost $1 trillion in permits for the first 10 \nyears, and according to the President's budget director, of course, \nthis will cost consumers.\n  In Senate testimony last year, the CBO Director at the time noted:\n\n       Firms would not ultimately bear most of the cost of the \n     allowances, but instead would pass them along to customers in \n     the form of higher prices.\n\n  Under the President's proposal, an average American family would pay \n$3,000 a year in increased energy bills. In this day and age, that is a \nvery heavy burden. It simply is not right to contemplate imposing a tax \nof $3,000 per family in legislation that is passed under the cloak of \nanother bill.\n  To summarize, Mr. President, cap and trade is complex. It is as \ndifficult a piece of legislation as we will face this year. It will set \nlimits on economic growth for the next 40 years, it will require a \nsmall army of additional Federal employees, and it will require every \nAmerican family to pay a price. So I urge my colleagues to support a \nthoughtful, deliberate, transparent effort to address this country's \nenergy challenges. I urge them to oppose the use of the budget to pass \ncap and trade in any form or fashion.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nthe text of the two letters I referenced earlier in my remarks.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                  U.S. Senate,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 12, 2009.\n     Hon.

Judd Gregg,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on the Budget, U.S. Senate, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Conrad and Ranking Member Gregg: We oppose \n     using the budget reconciliation process to expedite passage \n     of climate legislation.\n       Enactment of a cap-and-trade regime is likely to influence \n     nearly every feature of the U.S. economy. Legislation so far-\n     reaching should be fully vetted and given appropriate time \n     for debate, something the budget reconciliation process does \n     not allow. Using this procedure would circumvent normal \n     Senate practice and would be inconsistent with the \n     Administration's stated goals of bipartisanship, cooperation, \n     and openness.\n       We commend you for holding the recent hearing, entitled \n     ``Procedures for Consideration of the Budget Resolution/\n     Reconciliation,'' which discussed important recommendations \n     for the upcoming budget debate. Maintaining integrity in the \n     budget process is critical to safeguarding the fiscal health \n     of the United States in these challenging times.\n           Sincerely,\n         Mike Johanns; Robert C.

Kent Conrad,\n     Chairman, Senate Budget Committee, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Judd Gregg,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Budget Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Conrad and Ranking Member Gregg: Global \n     climate change is a serious problem that demands the full \n     attention of the Congress and the President. However, I \n     believe that the budget reconciliation process is not an \n     appropriate mechanism to expedite passage of climate change \n     legislation. It unnecessarily short circuits Congress's \n     ability to more fully debate this complex and multifaceted \n     public policy issue.\n       I fully expect that the U.S. will enact mandatory \n     legislation that will reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the \n     near future, and we must do so in a way that balances our \n     energy security, economic development and environmental \n     integrity goals. The far reaching implications of this \n     legislation affect all sectors of the economy and require \n     appropriate time for debate in a number of key standing \n     committees.\n       I look forward to working with you to review and respond to \n     the Administration's budget request in a way that will allow \n     us to enact innovative policy measures for the future of our \n     nation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Byron L.

Mr. President, I rise today to speak about the budget that \nis before the Congress, before the Senate, and before the American \npeople. Like many others in this Chamber, as well as people from across \nthe country, we look forward to working with President Obama to get \nthis budget passed.\n  When we consider what a budget is, I believe it is a lot of things, \nof course, but it is not just a series of proposals and policies and \nnumbers and charts and data. I believe a budget is really a reflection \nof our values. It is a mirror into which we look--at least here in the \nFederal budget--once a year to make an assessment or a reassessment of \nour values and our priorities. I think President Obama understands \nthat. His budget reflects that understanding; that a budget is a set of \nvalues and priorities, and in the end it is also about people. It is \nnot just about data and programs, but a budget is about people.\n  I was thinking this morning about some people with whom I have had \ncontact through correspondence--people who write to our office and talk \nabout their lives--such as Trisha Urban, who wrote to our office not \ntoo long ago. She is from Berks County, the county that has the city of \nRedding in it, on the eastern side of our State.\n  Trisha has a story about her life, her family, and about health care. \nImagine this happening, Mr. President, in the life of one family--in \nthis case Trisha Urban's family. Trisha was pregnant and awaiting the \nbirth of a child, and at the same time her husband dies, literally \nwithin the same timeframe. She wrote to me and said:\n\n       We were anxiously awaiting the birth of our first child. A \n     half hour later, two ambulances were in my driveway. As the \n     paramedics were assessing the health of my baby and me, the \n     paramedic from the other ambulance told me that my husband \n     could not be revived.\n\n  This happened all in 1 day, all in 1 hour, literally.\n  She goes on to say in her letter:\n\n       My husband's death may have been prevented. Like many other \n     Americans, we have difficulty with our health insurance. My \n     husband had to leave his job for 1 year to complete an \n     internship requirement to complete his doctorate in \n     psychology. The internship was unpaid; we could not afford \n     COBRA.\n\n  COBRA is the extension of health insurance. Continuing to quote her \nletter:\n\n       Because of preexisting conditions, neither my husband's \n     health issues nor my pregnancy would be covered under private \n     insurance.\n\n  And she goes on from there to talk about her own predicament. Mr. \nPresident, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record the \nfull text of this letter that I received from Trisha Urban.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Dear Mr. Casey, Exactly one week and 7 hours ago, I was \n     frantically trying to revive my husband who was doing some \n     last minute errands before taking me to the hospital. My \n     water had broke the night before, we were anxiously awaiting \n     the birth of our first child. A half-hour later, 2 ambulances \n     were in my driveway. As the paramedics were assessing the \n     health of my baby and me, the paramedic from the other \n     ambulance told me that my husband could not be revived.\n       My husband's death may have been prevented. Like many \n     Americans, we have difficulty with our health insurance. My \n     husband had to leave his job for one year to complete an \n     internship requirement to complete his doctorate in \n     psychology. The internship was unpaid; we could not afford \n     cobra. Because of pre-existing conditions, neither my \n     husband's health issues nor my pregnancy would be covered \n     under private insurance. I worked 4 part-time jobs and was \n     not eligible for any health benefits. We ended up with a \n     second rate health insurance plan through my husband's \n     university. When medical bills started to add up, the \n     insurance company decided to drop our coverage stating the \n     internship did not qualify us for the benefits. We were left \n     with close to $100,000 worth of medical bills. Concerned with \n     the upcoming financial responsibility of the birth of our \n     daughter and the burden of current medical expenses, my \n     husband missed his last doctor's appointment less than one \n     month ago. I am a working class American and do not have the \n     money or the insight to legally fight the health insurance \n     company. We had no life insurance. I will probably lose my \n     home, my car and everything we worked so hard to accumulate \n     in our life will be gone in an instant.\n       If my story is heard, if legislation can be changed to help \n     other uninsured Americans in a similar situation, I am \n     willing to pay the price of losing everything. I am asking \n     you to share my story with others in congress and I am \n     willing to speak on behalf of my husband so that his death \n     will not be in vain.--Trisha Urban\n\n  Mr. CASEY. Mr. President, here is how Trisha Urban concluded her \nletter. She said:\n\n       If my story is heard, if legislation could be changed to \n     help other uninsured Americans in a similar situation, I am \n     willing to pay the price of losing everything. I am asking \n     you to share my story with others in Congress and I am \n     willing to speak on behalf of my husband so that his death \n     will not be in vain.\n\n  In this one single letter from a woman in Pennsylvania, a mother and \nnow a widow, is contained all the challenges that we face in this \nbudget, specifically with regard to health care. But I think it speaks \nto so many other challenges we face as well. So every budget we do, and \nespecially at this time of economic crisis, is about people, and we all \nhave to remember that.\n  I think President Obama understands this budget is about people--it \nis about people who are leading lives of struggle and sacrifice and \nsetback. But at the same time he understands the American people, even \nat this difficult time in our Nation's history, understand we will \novercome this. We will pass a budget, and we will get to work on these \nimportant priorities--priorities such as health care, the priority of \neducation, and also of making progress on a whole range of energy \nissues.\n  As we are passing this budget, we should remind the American people \nthat even as we work on health care, energy, and education, this budget \ncontains plenty of middle-class tax relief, and it is important to talk \nabout that.\n  Now, I don't want to look in the rear-view mirror and talk about the \npast too much, but I think it is important to provide a brief \nassessment of where we are. We can't make progress ahead of us if we \ndon't know where we are and where we have been. Here is where we have \nbeen the last couple of years.\n  The prior administration inherited a $236 billion surplus. When the \nprior administration ended, it was the exact opposite--record deficits \nat that time. The Congressional Budget Office projected the surplus--\nthis is back in the early part of this decade--the projection was the \nsurplus would grow at $710 billion--a surplus of $710 billion--by 2009. \nWe know that is not the case today.\n  President Obama and the American people have inherited a deficit of \nalmost $1.3 trillion. If you look at it in terms of gross debt, it is \nlike looking at the side of a mountain. We went from $5.8 trillion up \nto over $12 trillion in debt. That is what we face. And I think it is \nimportant to understand that is where we start.\n  But President Obama didn't spend a lot of time talking about the \nproblem he inherited, he focused on solutions. So he put before the \nCongress an open, honest, and accountable budget. This is a budget that \nwill come about because of his work and his leadership as President but \nalso the work that Chairman Kent Conrad and others in Congress do. I \nwant to commend Chairman Conrad for the work he has done on this \nbudget. He has a great array of charts we are going to be using in the \nnext couple of days to highlight some of these issues.\n  But this is an honest budget. It is not perfect, but it is honest, \nand it focuses on those priorities I mentioned before--health care, \nenergy, education, deficit reduction, and tax relief.\n  Let me take a couple of moments to talk about health care. The story \nI told before, encompassing the letter from Trisha Urban, is an unusual \nstory, a graphic and difficult story to tell about tragic events in the \nlife of one family. But the problems that families are having with \nhealth care are not all that unusual. For the first time in a decade, \nwe have a budget that tackles one of the biggest problems in the \ncountry--the health care crisis. We can't put it off to 2010, 2011, or \n2012. We have to deal with this now, this year, with a new President \nand a new Congress committed to doing that.\n\n[[Page S3822]]\n\n  Across Pennsylvania this issue comes up all the time when I talk to \npeople in our State. If you look at it in terms of the Nation, there \nare nearly seven times the number of Americans without health insurance \ntoday as there were in 2000. Families USA is an organization that \nanalyzes health care in the country, and then they focus specifically \non a particular State. The most recent report of Families USA finds \nthat nearly 3 million Pennsylvanians under the age of 65 were uninsured \nfor some period of time in 2007 and 2008. The overall number of \nPennsylvanians without health insurance is growing faster than the \nnationwide average.\n  So we have a major challenge on our hands with regard to health care, \nand the President has been very focused on making sure health care is a \nmajor component of this budget. We are going to be talking about the \nspecifics of that in the days ahead.\n\n  The President also made a strong commitment to energy independence. \nWe all know it is important. We know it is an urgent priority, and we \nhave talked a lot about it--year after year of talking and not acting, \nyear after year of explaining the problem instead of putting the \nsolutions into law, into the budget, into the programs we know can \nwork.\n  Energy independence is not just a nice thing to do, it is not just \nanother way to go about heating our homes and powering our economy. \nEnergy independence is essential for our national security. The more we \nignore it, the less safe we are. The more we ignore energy \nindependence, the more the terrorists have an increasing advantage over \nus. We have to deal with this this year as well. We are dependent for \noil on some of the most politically unstable areas of the world. We \nknow that, but we can't just acknowledge that, we have to act on it.\n  This budget addresses the need for investments in clean energy that \nwill help us combat global warming and create the new green jobs of the \nfuture--not just any jobs, the green jobs that will pay wages on which \nyou can sustain a family.\n  This budget, with regard to energy, builds on the investment we made \nthrough the recovery and reinvestment bill we passed not too long ago, \nfor renewable energy, energy efficiency and conservation, electric grid \nmodernization, and low-carbon coal technology, which is so important \nfor our transition to this new energy economy.\n  I wish to conclude today by addressing the issue of education. We \nknow that the challenge we have with regard to education is a lifetime \nof challenges, and we have to think about education as a continuum, a \ncontinuing series of challenges we have to face as Americans.\n  We cannot say we want a growing economy or higher GNP growth or a \nskilled workforce to compete in the world economy--we cannot really say \nthat with any degree of truth or integrity unless we are willing to \nmake investment in children in the dawn of their lives. As Hubert \nHumphrey said a long time ago--he talked about how the test of \ngovernment is how we treat those in the dawn of life, the shadows of \nlife, and those in the twilight of life. When he spoke of the dawn of \nlife, of course he was speaking of our children.\n  The United States of America today has no prekindergarten education \npolicy beyond the important program of Head Start. But we have to not \njust make the funding commitment to Head Start, which has been so \nimportant to our economy and to our children and our families, we have \nto do more than Head Start. We need a full commitment to \nprekindergarten education--early learning. President Obama understands \nthat. He campaigned on it. He promised the American people he was going \nto work on it, and he put it in his budget. It is so critically \nimportant to make this a priority in our budget. But he knows that \nmaking sure a child has access to early education and health care and \nthe promise of a bright future will not reach fulfillment unless we \ninvest in higher education as well. Access to higher education and the \nopportunities it affords is one of the fundamentals of what makes this \ncountry strong. I really believe his commitment on higher education is \na seminal part of his budget.\n  But I really believe also that when President Obama talks about \neducation, he is not just talking about it in some abstract form. When \nhe focuses on the needs of our children, it is not an abstraction--not \nonly because he is a husband and a father but because President Obama \nbelieves, as I believe, that every child in America, no matter where \nthey live, no matter who they are, no matter who their parents are, \nevery child in America is born with a bright, scintillating light \ninside them. It is up to us, those of us who are elected officials, who \nare given power to help people, who are given power to get things right \nin this country as best we can, it is up to us to make sure that \nwhatever that light is inside a child, it burns ever brighter, that \nthat child's full potential--if it is unlimited or if it is much more \nlimited--whatever that potential is, whatever the brightness of that \nlight is, we have an obligation here to make sure that potential, that \nlight burns brightly. I really believe what President Obama has tried \nto do on education speaks directly to that obligation we have as \nMembers of the Senate or Members of Congress.\n  We have a lot more to talk about in the days ahead. We have a lot \nmore challenges to face as we face the challenge not only of passing a \nbudget but of making sure these programs work for people. But in the \nend, this is about people. It is about Trisha Urban and families who \nface the impossible challenge of having health care for their family. \nIt is also about a lot of families in Pennsylvania and across the \ncountry who lost their homes, may have lost their jobs, and have lost \ntheir hopes and their dreams.\n  I believe with all my heart that this budget is one of the ways we \nspeak to their concerns, one of the ways we do our best to speak to the \nworries they have about their own future, one of the ways we give \nintegrity to the promise we have when we say we are working here to \nmake sure the families of America can reach their potential: that \nchildren's lives will be better than their parents' lives. There are \nmany people worried about that basic feature of American life.\n  This budget is not perfect. We will continue to work on it. I and \nothers will have amendments, but President Obama has put us on a path \nto make the investments in health care, education, and energy; to cut \nthe deficit in half; to provide tax relief; and also by making those \ninvestments to put us on a path not just to getting our economy out of \nthe ditch and back on the road but making sure we are making the \ninvestments to grow our economy in the future--to create jobs, to \ncreate opportunity, and to create a future for our families and \nespecially for our children.\n  We have a long way to go, but I really believe President Obama--\nworking with leaders such as Chairman Conrad here in the Senate and \nothers in the House as well to make sure we are on that path to fiscal \nresponsibility--is on the path to investing in priorities such as \nhealth care, education, and energy. If we work together, we can \nreestablish the kind of economy we used to have and reestablish and \nreenergize the priorities the American people elected us to work on. I \nknow we can do that together, but it is not going to be easy. We look \nforward to the challenge. We look forward to working with President \nObama.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

My mother always told me service to others is the rent we \npay for the space we take up. This bill will help millions of Americans \nfulfill that rent payment. After 16 years, we finally have the \nopportunity to take a hard look at the law surrounding national service \nand making necessary changes to improve accountability, reduce \nbureaucracy, and ensure we get the maximum return on the investment we \nare making.\n  Although the process we took to reach this point was rushed, it was \nbipartisan throughout. It is not a perfect agreement, but it includes \nkey Republican concepts such as eliminating waste, and it addresses \nserious concerns about the management and operations of the AmeriCorps \nprogram. Senators Hatch and McCain have been stalwarts in keeping us \nfocused on the importance of national service. Each of them has given \nback to their communities and country through their individual \nsacrifices and commitment to service. Without their leadership, we \nwould not be here today.\n  I also congratulate Senator Mikulski on the work she has done to \nensure this bipartisan process and her willingness to focus on the 80 \npercent we can agree on to get this bill done. We do need to get it \ndone.\n  Finally, I cannot proceed without acknowledging our friend and \ncolleague, Senator Kennedy, and his lifelong commitment to the issue of \nnational service. He is dedicated to making sure everyone who is called \nto national service has the opportunity to serve in programs that \naddress the needs of their communities. We look forward to his speedy \nrecovery and return to the Senate.\n  A comprehensive reauthorization of our national service programs is \nlong overdue. Congress has not given these programs a hard look for 16 \nyears. Working across the aisle and with our colleagues in the House, \nwe have been able to identify areas where we can enact reforms, \neliminate waste, and expand our national service efforts responsibly. \nThis bill strengthens the management, oversight, and fiscal \naccountability of these Federal programs while it expands accessibility \nand streamlines bureaucracy, which is particularly critical for smaller \nand rural programs.\n  As the Senate's only accountant, I am particularly concerned about \nhow these programs have struggled to get their financial house in \norder. I am pleased that the bill before us strengthens the role of the \nchief financial officer and the inspector general at the Corporation \nfor National and Community Service and moves to fixed price grants that \nwill streamline these programs. This bill now requires the \nCorporation's board of directors to review the national service budget \nsubmission before it goes to OMB.\n  Additionally, when the inspector general recovers misspent national \nservice funds, the bill requires that those funds go back into the \nnational service trust. With these changes, I believe we are creating \ntools that will allow the corporation to better safeguard taxpayer \ndollars.\n  I hear from Wyoming constituents about the need to make these \nprograms more responsive to the challenges facing small grantees and \nrural communities. In this bill, we have taken steps to reduce Federal \nbureaucracy and improve access for small grantees. By giving the \ncorporation the flexibility to use fixed price grants, we are reducing \nthe significant paperwork and administrative burdens that have plagued \nthese programs in the past. We will really see the impact of \nstreamlining access to these programs as the corporation reaches out to \nmore effectively help Native American communities and tribal \ngovernments.\n  In the past, a significant portion of the 1 percent set-aside for \nprograms serving Native American communities has not been used. Too \noften, these are communities that experience the most extreme needs for \neducation, health, and workforce services. I am encouraged that the \ncorporation has recently brought on board a strategic adviser for \nNative American affairs. They are bringing to the table the kind of \nfocused expertise that can help improve the ability of tribes to access \nthe programs in the National and Community Service Act and the Domestic \nVolunteer Service Act.\n  These opportunities are critically important. One of the ways youth \nin Wyoming engage in service is through the Congressional Award Council \nwhich connects them to service opportunities and sponsors an award \nceremony. In Cheyenne, young people are conducting CPR and first aid \nclasses, improving disaster preparedness training in the community. \nThat is all on a completely volunteer basis. They get a little medal \nfor doing a lot of hours of service. Each year the council sponsors an \naward ceremony where members of the congressional delegation award \ncertificates and bronze and silver medals. Gold medal recipients have a \nspecial opportunity to travel to Washington, DC, in June to receive \ntheir medals.\n  I am also pleased this bill creates a veterans corps that provides \nveterans with an opportunity to use their skills and leadership \nabilities after they leave the military. Participating in this corps is \na way for Americans to provide the essential support that military \nfamilies need while their husbands, wives, sons, and daughters are \ndeployed.\n  An opportunity corps has been included to address challenges in \ndisadvantaged low-income communities, which is particularly fitting in \nthis time of economic uncertainty. As part of this corps, we have \nemphasized the need many Americans have for financial literacy \neducation and job placement assistance. I am very supportive of \nprovisions in this bill that build connections to the needs of our \nworkforce.\n  I thank Senator Mikulski for working with me to find a third way to \nresolve the issue of how best to introduce competition into the senior \ncorps program. In Wyoming, over 1,000 people a year participate as \nsenior companions, foster grandparents, or community volunteers. They \nperform services such as conducting safety patrols and participating in \nenvironmental cleanup projects. The original proposal around \ncompetition would have seriously disrupted the important services \nprovided by these programs. In this bill, we have arrived at a workable \nsolution that will improve the good work being done in these programs \nthrough technical assistance and responsible competition.\n  I also thank Dr. Coburn for his thoughtful contribution to the \nestablishment of metrics to be used in evaluating the performance of \nour national service programs. We reached quick agreement around his \nproposal between committee markup and today, and we will be able to \nincorporate his suggestions into this bill.\n  I want to focus on that a little bit more because this is a committee \nthat has been one of the most contentious and is now one of the most \nproductive because of this working together, working through the \nprocess, and then working after the process. Dr. Coburn brought up \nthese important changes that he thought the bill needed. We looked at \nthem. They were good ideas. We were able to get the language right and \nget it incorporated into this bill so we will have a better idea of how \neach of these programs is working.\n  I understand the concern that we are going too far in expanding these \nprograms. I agree it is not a perfect bill.\n\n[[Page S3824]]\n\nWe took out a number of programs and put in some ideas that were \nimportant to Senator Hatch and to Senator Kennedy. It has held the line \nand focused on what needs to be done.\n  By being at the table and working in a bipartisan way, we have been \nable to limit the number of new programs and control the proposed \nincreases in discretionary spending. We have also added accountability \nand performance measures at every step of the way for each program.\n  I also would like to clarify further what this bill does. In exchange \nfor an education award and small stipend, we are supporting Americans \nwho have made a commitment to mobilize their neighbors to address the \npressing needs of their communities. We are leveraging the efforts of a \nfew to mobilize millions. I am pleased we have worked in a bipartisan \nway to negotiate a bill we can support in the Senate. It should receive \nstrong support in the House. The 80 percent we have agreed upon is good \npolicy. It reinforces both Democratic and Republican principles, and it \nwill benefit disadvantaged communities across the country.\n  I am confident the House will concur with the bill ultimately passed \noff of the Senate floor. This bill will then reach the President's desk \nquickly. I do hope we can get finished in an expedited manner. I am \npleased with the cooperation and the work that people who were not even \non the committee have done. That will make a difference in getting this \nvery important bill to the finish line.\n  As I mentioned, it has been 16 years since we took a hard look at \nthese programs. The committee, particularly Senator Hatch and Senator \nMikulski, worked through this bill, along with Senator Kennedy and \nmyself. We made some very strong improvements that will make this a \nvery workable program and one that we will be proud to move forward.\n  I ask Members to restrain amendments and help us get this bill \nfinished today.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I believe we need to take a moment to \nrecognize the support the Serve America Act has received from leaders \nand organizations throughout the country.\n  I actually have in my possession a copy of a letter to the Senate \nleadership signed by 21 Governors from around the country, including \nGov. Haley Barbour from Mississippi, Gov. M. Jodi Rell from \nConnecticut, and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger from California. In the \nletter, these State leaders express their support for the Serve America \nAct and give solid testimony regarding the value of national service, \nparticularly of the States' role in our national service programs.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the Governors' \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                   March 23, 2009.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Reid, Senator McConnell, Speaker Pelosi, and \n     Representative Boehner: We write in support of reauthorizing \n     and expanding AmeriCorps and other national service and \n     volunteer programs that the Corporation for National and \n     Community Service administers. Accordingly, we support the \n     passage of the House Generations Invigorating Volunteerism \n     and Education (GIVE) Act and the Senate Serve America Act. In \n     this difficult time for our country, service remains an \n     enduring American value that brings communities together and \n     reminds us of the strength of our common bond.\n       As Governors, we witness firsthand the positive effects \n     that national service and volunteerism have in communities \n     throughout our states. Through outstanding state-federal \n     partnerships, we have a unique opportunity to support service \n     and volunteering through Corporation for National and \n     Community Service programs. Additionally, Governor-appointed \n     state commissions oversee and administer AmeriCorps, promote \n     national service and volunteering, and develop innovative \n     volunteer opportunities to meet the needs of our communities \n     and our states.\n       As Governors, we recognize the value of national and \n     community service as a tool in meeting important needs and \n     addressing pressing challenges, and we request the following \n     provisions in the final reauthorization legislation:\n       Increase administrative funding to enhance the capacity of \n     state commissions' infrastructure. The proposed legislation \n     will dramatically increase the programming commissions \n     oversee, and additional administrative funding is critical in \n     ensuring appropriate oversight and thoughtful program \n     expansion.\n       Streamline the AmeriCorps funding allocation, and at the \n     same time, allow Governors and state commissions to set \n     priorities and indicators. Current legislation revises the \n     program funding allocation model to ensure more effective \n     distribution of funds and coordination at the local level. \n     This revised model will assist our efforts to target national \n     service resources to the most pressing needs of our \n     communities,\n       Fully implement fixed amount grants to reduce the burden on \n     programs. This provision will allow AmeriCorps to become more \n     accessible to smaller organizations, especially small faith-\n     based programs and those in rural parts of the country. Fixed \n     amount grants will also focus resources on program \n     development, delivery and quality, all while maintaining \n     grantee accountability.\n       We strongly embrace the effort of both President Obama and \n     a bi-partisan group of Congressional leaders to improve and \n     expand national and community service opportunities. We \n     support the effort to enhance the capacity of state service \n     commissions and ensure that national service is mission-\n     oriented, efficient, and effective. We therefore \n     respectively request your support for the reauthorization \n     and expansion of these vital national service programs.\n           Sincerely,\n         Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, California; Governor \n           David A. Paterson, New York; Governor Mike Beebe, \n           Arkansas; Governor Bill Ritter, Colorado; Governor M. \n           Jodi Rell, Connecticut; Governor Jack Markell, \n           Delaware; Governor Pat Quinn, Illinois; Governor \n           Chester J. Culver, Iowa; Governor Steven L. Beshear, \n           Kentucky; Governor John E. Baldacci, Maine; Governor \n           Martin O'Malley, Maryland.\n         Governor Deval Patrick, Massachusetts; Governor Jennifer \n           M. Granholm, Michigan; Governor Jon Corzine, New \n           Jersey; Governor Bill Richardson, New Mexico; Governor \n           Ted Strickland, Ohio; Governor Donald Carcieri, Rhode \n           Island; Governor Christine 0. Gregoire, Washington; \n           Governor Joe Manchin III, West Virginia; Governor Jim \n           Doyle, Wisconsin; Governor Haley Barbour, Mississippi.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I also have a copy of a letter sent by \nthe ServiceNation coalition. It is signed by 441 nonprofit and \ncharitable organizations--all of which support this legislation. They \nvary from faith-based groups such as Catholic Charities to local groups \nsuch as Volunteer Florida and the Volunteer Center of Kalamazoo. Local \nUnited Way and Boys & Girls Club chapters have also signed on, as have \na number of colleges and universities. These are the kinds of groups we \nwill be empowering with passage of this legislation. They have built-in \nconnections to their communities and know the needs of the people they \nserve. The Serve America Act will help them put even more boots on the \nground in order to provide much needed services to people all over the \ncountry.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the ServiceNation \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                                     March 9, 2009\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Hart Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Russell Senate Office Building,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Majority Leader Reid and Minority Leader McConnell: \n     Thank you for your leadership as our nation faces \n     unprecedented economic challenges. We are convinced that as \n     the current crisis deepens--intensifying needs in the \n     nation's most economically vulnerable communities and forcing \n     greater and greater numbers of Americans out of their jobs \n     and homes--it is absolutely crucial that the nation invest in \n     service, social innovation, and the non-profit sector. We \n     strongly support the Serve America Act (S. 277) for precisely \n     this reason.\n       The Serve America Act, introduced by Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-\n     MA) and Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), features a number of \n     proposals for using service and social innovation to address \n     pressing challenges in areas such as\n\n[[Page S3825]]\n\n     education, public health, poverty, and energy efficiency. It \n     also provides much-needed support for the non-profit sector \n     at a time when the demand for the vital services it provides \n     is rising sharply, even as shrinking revenues decrease \n     capacity and threaten debilitating job losses.\n       The Act will strengthen the non-profit sector, empowering \n     it to respond to rising needs in communities across the \n     nation. The Serve America Act will:\n       Create four targeted problem-solving corps that will deploy \n     Americans of all ages to increase access to job training and \n     placement resources, help raise high school graduation and \n     college-going rates, enhance energy efficiency and improve \n     natural resources, and improve access to health care;\n       Establish Community Solutions Funds to invest in and scale \n     the proven, innovative solutions that are having an impact in \n     communities across our nation. The Fund will promote greater \n     innovation in the social sector and evaluate performance \n     based on results;\n       Found Youth Engagement Zones to involve in-school and out-\n     of-school youth in high-quality service learning projects and \n     recognize ``Campuses of Service,'' institutions of higher \n     learning that engage students in service activities, \n     integrate service and learning, and promote service careers;\n       Draw upon the unique insights and leadership skills of \n     individuals who have completed military and civilian service \n     through Innovation Fellowships. These fellowships will enable \n     such individuals to establish nonprofit organizations that \n     respond to local and national needs. The Act will also call \n     upon Baby Boomers to use their talents to address national \n     challenges through Encore Fellowships;\n       Honor the long-standing tradition of community volunteering \n     by creating a Volunteer Generation Fund to increase the \n     number of Americans who are able to work with community and \n     faith-based organizations to meet growing needs; and\n       Mobilize skilled Americans to serve in developing countries \n     around the world to tackle urgent problems, such as HIV/AIDS \n     and malaria through Volunteers for Prosperity.\n       Notably, the Act also emphasizes the importance of results, \n     accountability and transparency, creates indicators of civic \n     health, and requires that federal investments be matched with \n     significant contributions from private, philanthropic, state, \n     and local sources. In these ways, the Serve America Act \n     ensures that the non-profit sector's response will be both \n     effective and cost-efficient. Moreover, the Act promotes \n     collaboration between the non-profit sector, local government \n     actors, and the State Commissions, which have provided \n     leadership with respect to service since their creation, \n     thereby guaranteeing that programs are tailored to meet state \n     and local needs.\n       Most importantly the Act will, as President Obama noted in \n     his address before Congress, ``encourage a renewed spirit of \n     national service for this and future generations.'' It will \n     provide Americans of all ages and backgrounds--who are more \n     eager than ever to help shape this nation's future--with \n     opportunities to confront the challenges facing our country.\n       Thank you for your public service and your leadership in \n     this time of crisis. We hope that you will enable greater \n     numbers of Americans to serve with you to collectively \n     strengthen our nation by supporting and fully funding the \n     Serve America Act.\n           Sincerely,\n       Signed by 441 organizations.\n\n  Mr. HATCH. I also have a copy of a letter of support sent by the \nmembers of the Campus Compact, a group of 1,100 colleges and \nuniversities that promote efforts to create civically engaged campuses. \nThe signees to the letter include the presidents from the great schools \nof my State, including Utah State University, Salt Lake Community \nCollege, Utah Valley University, College of Eastern Utah, Weber State \nUniversity, Dixie State College, Snow College, Brigham Young \nUniversity, and the University of Utah. I think the administrators of \nthese schools recognize the value of engaging young people in community \nand volunteer service. I am proud to see so many schools from Utah on \nthe list, and I am quite certain that when this legislation becomes \nlaw, many students from these schools will benefit from it and, in \nturn, help to benefit others in their communities.\n  Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to have the Campus Compact \nletter printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               Campus Compact,\n\n                                       Boston, MA, March 20, 2009.\n       Dear Members of Congress, as Members of Campus Compact and \n     leaders in higher education, we wish to express our support \n     of the Serve America Act (S 277) introduced by Senator Edward \n     Kennedy and Senator Orrin Hatch. We feel strongly that \n     investment in community service, service-learning, social \n     innovation and the non-profit sector is a winning strategy at \n     this time.\n       Campus Compact is a 23 year-old coalition of over 1100 \n     college and university presidents that promote the public \n     purposes of higher education through the creation of \n     civically engaged campuses. We have been involved in the \n     evolution of the Serve America Act, serving as one of the \n     original members of the organizing committee for \n     ServiceNation.\n       We support the participation of Americans of all ages in \n     innovative service programs that leverage federal funding \n     wisely and bring much-needed relief to our country's most \n     economically vulnerable communities. The Serve America Act \n     strengthens existing national service programs as well as \n     creating new initiatives. These programs include: four new \n     volunteer corps, each focusing on a critical issue facing our \n     nation; designation of up to 30 institutions of higher \n     education as ``Campuses of Service,'' based on their records \n     of student engagement in service and service-learning; and \n     the creation of Youth Engagement Zones to support service-\n     learning partnerships between higher education institutions \n     and local education agencies.\n       As President Obama said in his speech before Congress on \n     February 24th, the Serve America Act will ``encourage a \n     renewed spirit of national service for this and future \n     generations.'' We ask you to support the Serve America Act, \n     and make it possible for millions of Americans to contribute \n     to the rebuilding of our country in the spirit of service.\n           Sincerely,\n       National Campus Compact Board Members: John J.

It is truly a national movement that has gotten \nbehind the bipartisan coalition here in Washington that has been \npushing to move this bill forward. Once again, I am proud to be a part \nof this effort, and I continue to urge my colleagues to support the \nbill as well.\n  Madam President, I would like to take a moment to discuss what I \nthink is one of the most important new programs contained in the Serve \nAmerica Act, the ServeAmerica Fellowship program. The ServeAmerica \nFellowships will basically be vouchers, enabling Americans of all ages \nand interests to work full or part time in service with nonprofit and \nfaith-based groups.\n  The bill calls for the creation of up to 1,500 fellowships by 2014. \nHere is how it will work: The Corporation for National and Community \nService will make grants to State Service Commissions to allow them to \naward the ServeAmerica Fellowships. Those receiving the fellowships \nwill work with approved service organizations and nonprofits on \nprojects directed at those areas of national need identified in the \nbill. Even with these fellowships, we want to make sure our national \nservice efforts are aimed at addressing specific needs and solving \nspecific problems. The ServeAmerica Fellowships will be administered \nalmost entirely at the State level, allowing the States to continue to \nbe 50 State laboratories of innovation for volunteer service programs. \nThe fellowships will be funded by the corporation at 50 percent of the \ntotal average annual subsistence allowance provided to VISTA \nvolunteers. The host organizations will contribute the additional \nfunding so that the fellow receives between 70 and 100 percent of the \nVISTA annual subsistence allowance. Fellows will also receive an \neducational award identical to that which is awarded to other national \nservice participants.\n  Now let me explain what we are trying to do with these fellowships. I \nbelieve that smaller nonprofit or faith-based organizations lacking \nlarge-scale capacity can nonetheless benefit from the efforts and \npresence of national servicemembers. Indeed, committed individual \nvolunteers at startup nonprofits of faith-based charitable groups can \nprovide the human capital needed to dramatically expand the charities' \nimpact and help them recruit other volunteers. Again, this multiplying \neffect is the aim of almost every program under the bill. These \nfellowships will help ensure that faith-based, rural, grassroots, and \nother smaller nonprofits will benefit from this multiplying effect by \nhaving access to national servicemembers, even if they lack large-scale \ncapacity.\n\n  In addition, this program will fulfill one of the main goals we had \nin drafting this legislation, which is allowing the people the \nflexibility to choose their own paths of service. The fellows under \nthis program will be chosen for their commitment and ingenuity, and I \nbelieve we will see some outstanding new service approaches developed \nas a result of this program.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 722 to Amendment No. 687\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I send an amendment to the desk and ask \nunanimous consent for its immediate consideration.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection to setting aside the \npending amendment?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from North Carolina [Mr. Burr] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 722 to amendment No. 687.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To strengthen criminal history checks for participants in \n     national service programs working with vulnerable populations)\n\n       On page 213, line 21, strike ``Code.'.'' and insert the \n     following: ``Code.\n       ``(d) Special Rule for Individuals Working With Vulnerable \n     Populations.--\n       ``(1) In general.--Notwithstanding subsection (b) or any \n     other provision of law, on and after the date that is 2 years \n     after the date of enactment of the Serve America Act, a \n     criminal history check under subsection (a) for each \n     individual described in paragraph (2) shall, except in a case \n     approved for good cause by the Corporation, include--\n       ``(A) a drug test for controlled substances, as defined in \n     section 102 of the Controlled Substances Act (21 U.S.C. 802);\n       ``(B) the searches described in subsection (b)(1) and \n     subparagraph (A) of subsection (b)(2); and\n       ``(C) the background check described in subsection \n     (b)(2)(B).\n       ``(2) Individuals with access to vulnerable populations.--\n     An individual described in this paragraph is an individual \n     who--\n       ``(A) serves in a position in which the individual receives \n     a living allowance, stipend, national service educational \n     award, or salary through a program receiving assistance under \n     the national service laws; and\n       ``(B) as a result of such individual's service in such \n     position, has or will have access, on a recurring basis, to--\n       ``(i) children age 17 years or younger;\n       ``(ii) individuals age 60 years or older; or\n       ``(iii) individuals with disabilities.''.\n\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I thank you, and I thank the managers of \nthis legislation.\n  It was my hope I could come to the floor with another amendment that \nwas acceptable on both sides, and I am still anxious and optimistic \nthat we can do it because the spirit of this amendment is not for the \npurpose of a poison pill to the bill. It was the recognition that when \nwe deal with an expansion of these volunteer efforts that we reach out \nin a much bigger way and cast a much bigger net to Americans.\n  Let me say this: To offer this amendment is not to imply that those \nwho work in AmeriCorps today in any way are criminals or nefarious \nindividuals; it is to recognize the fact that we are creating an \narchitecture to take care of the American people, and that includes \nspecifically children, individuals over the age of 60 who are in the \nsenior years of their lives, and individuals who are classified as \ndisabled and have some deficiencies, and we owe it to them and we owe \nit to the general population to take into consideration as\n\n[[Page S3827]]\n\nwe, the Federal Government, allow a funding mechanism for people to \ncome in and to participate.\n  So let me explain for my colleagues simply what this amendment does. \nWhat we do is apply this to individuals who, on a continual basis--a \nrecurring basis; let me make that correction--on a recurring basis work \nwith vulnerable populations: kids, the elderly, and the disabled. The \namendment allows a 2-year period to ramp up this program before \nbecoming effective. We understand rulemaking will most likely be \nneeded, and we know it doesn't happen overnight in this town. Three, \nthis legislation retains the good cause exemption language.\n  Now, let me explain. We are asking that individuals who work with \nvulnerable populations be fingerprinted. We would like them to go \nthrough the FBI check process. We would like to know there is no \ncriminal history, that there is not a reason for us to be suspect if \nthey are with our children, our parents, or with a vulnerable person \nwho is disabled.\n  The good exception clause is there and very broadly written, and I \nmight go to the language. It says ``shall except in a case approved for \ngood cause by the Corporation''--``shall'' not ``will''; it is not \nmandatory--``shall go through a fingerprint process, good cause \nexception, for good cause,'' very loosely defined. That could be the \nsize of the corporation, no access to FBI fingerprint check, it could \nbe the size of the entity without the financial capabilities to go \nthrough it.\n  Now, I added something overnight to this bill. I didn't want to do \nit, but I did. I added drug testing. Drug testing is a very applicable \nthing, I say to my good friend, the manager on the majority side. This \nis not in stone for me. It wasn't in my original amendment. I think it \nshows my frustration that I went through last night, not being able to \nwork out something that made unbelievable common sense to me.\n  I would think this would be a threshold we would set. I would prefer \nto do it in a bipartisan way versus just to have a vote because I know \ntoday the vote would be on a motion to table, I would lose, and this \ninitiative would not be in place. Although my children aren't old \nenough, my father is. If, in fact, there was any volunteer who came \ninto the facility he lives in and works with him, I would like to have \nthe comfort of knowing at least somebody said: Let's make sure the \nindividuals, in fact, don't have criminal backgrounds, that they have \ngone into this with a truly volunteer reason versus for some aspect of \ncriminal intent.\n  Now, my chief concern and the reason for wanting this is kids, the \nelderly, and the disabled. It is no more than that. We know a vast \nmajority of folks who work in these programs do it because they believe \nin it. They want to have an effect, a positive effect on somebody's \nlife, and that is what they have chosen to do. I think it is important \nfor us to realize that it doesn't matter whether it is AmeriCorps for \ntitle I schools or childcare centers or an entity that accepts CDBG \nsubsidies. When parents leave their children in the hands of somebody \nevery day while they are at work to look after their kids, they want to \nknow the volunteers who are there meet the threshold, the standard they \nwould expect. We really wouldn't have an investment except we are \ntalking about Federal Government funding, and I think the American \npeople expect us to uphold what their expectations are; and that is, \npeople who shouldn't be there aren't there.\n  So I say to my colleagues on both sides, it is my hope we can come to \nan agreement. It is my hope this can be whittled down to FBI checks \nonly. It is my hope we will all understand the full latitude of the \nclause for the exception and the word ``shall'' versus ``will.'' It is \nmy hope we can pass the bigger bill with an amendment that resembles \nwhat I have offered so we can look at every American family and say: We \nhave looked at those who are the most vulnerable, and to the best of \nour ability we have tried to make sure somebody who shouldn't be there \nisn't there.\n  Now, as every American realizes, even the FBI fingerprint check is \nnot perfect. There is no way for us to look at the population and say \nnothing can ever happen. But I would suggest today that the standard \nAmerica holds us to is that we should do something, not nothing; that \nwe should attempt, not just roll over and play dead. If, in fact, we \ncome to the tabling of this, we are going to roll over and play dead. \nWe are not going to take it on. I don't think this requirement chases \nanybody away except the individuals who shouldn't be in the program to \nstart with, who might not pass the threshold, who might be found to be \nin one of those databases, so that we certainly wouldn't want them to \nparticipate in this program.\n  So at this time, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I wish to respond to the amendment of \nmy colleague from North Carolina and reach out a hand to him as well in \nterms of seeing if we could come up with a consensus.\n  First of all, I support the goals of what the Senator from North \nCarolina wishes to achieve. There is no one from our side of the aisle \nwho would want to expose anyone in a vulnerable population--children, \nthe elderly, those with disabilities--to a sexual predator, to a \ndruggie, to a pill head, whatever terms we want to use, because the \nwhole idea of AmeriCorps is to have people who will volunteer their \nservices, and out of that will be able to help to uplift these \nvulnerable populations. So we are on the same broadband in terms of \nthat.\n  Actually, remember: This bill has not been reauthorized in more than \na decade, and in reauthorizing the bill, we actually examined these \nsituations. The bill before the Senate actually requires that national \nservice programs to run a background check through either a State \ncriminal registry or send fingerprints to the FBI for a background \ncheck. It does not deal with drug testing. That is a new concept \nintroduced by our colleague.\n  I wish to reiterate that the new legislation, the Serve America Act, \nalready requires a criminal background check for programs serving \nchildren, the elderly, disabled individuals, or any other vulnerable \npopulation. It requires that every employee and every volunteer undergo \na criminal history check in order to participate in federally funded \nprograms.\n  We also want to go the extra mile in our bill by prohibiting sex \noffenders from serving as volunteers. No registered sex offender can \nserve as either a foster grandparent, a senior companion, or \nparticipate in any activity involved in exposure to children as a \nschool volunteer. Our approach is consistent with the comprehensive \nrules promulgated by the corporation in 2007 following extensive \nconsultation with the Department of Justice and public comment. So we \ntook what they did through rule-making and we have codified it in this \nbill exactly to deal with the deep and grave and authentic concerns \nvoiced by the Senator from North Carolina.\n  So our comments to the Senator from North Carolina are, No. 1, we \ndon't think the amendment is necessary because we think we have dealt \nwith it in the bill. Also, I am going to suggest that he and I confer \noff the Senate floor so we can review the bill and see if it \naccomplishes his objectives and deal with the issue of drug testing \nwhich is in the amendment the Senator has offered today.\n  If staff on our side of the aisle did not respond to the Senator's \ninquiry, I apologize for that. We are going to have that staff here, \nsupervised by my staff and Senator Kennedy's staff, to see what we can \nwork out.\n  I have worked with the Senator from North Carolina on so many issues, \nincluding on the Health Committee where he was a stalwart ally in \nmoving the Higher Education Act. We have worked together in the area of \nintelligence. We do know about bad guys--bad guys and gals over there \nand possibly bad guys and gals here. We both want to accomplish the \nsame policy objectives. Let's see if we can't have a conversation.\n  If our failure to respond in some way needlessly triggered an \namendment, I again wish to apologize. So what I would like to do is \nleave the amendment pending, and let's have a conversation and see what \nwe can work out. But I can assure my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle that we want to make sure no vulnerable population is exposed to \nan AmeriCorps volunteer or any other volunteer receiving Federal\n\n[[Page S3828]]\n\nfunds in this bill who in any way would jeopardize their health, their \nsafety, and their well-being.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Carolina.\n  Mr. BURR. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for her \nremarks. She is right. I think we can come to a suitable agreement. I \ncan assure her that if I did not think it was necessary to do an \namendment, I would not have done it. It might not be the first time I \nhave been wrong, my wife tells me that frequently. But in my \nunderstanding of it, the teeth that are in the bill are not the teeth I \nhave in this amendment as it relates to the FBI background check.\n  Make no mistake about it. I am not married to the drug testing, \nthough I will tell my colleague this: I think a lot of Americans \nlistening to this would probably say: Why not? But I think in the \nspirit of how I started this negotiation, it is not an area I believe \nis important to make as a foundation of this amendment. So I accept the \nSenator's offer. I will bring my staff over immediately, even though I \nwon't be able to stay, and we will both then be briefed by our staffs \nand know exactly what we are dealing with.\n  If, in fact, we have misinterpreted what the content of the bill \nsays, and we believe the appropriate protections are in it, I will be \nthe first to ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I appreciate that, as we have engaged with each other \non so many other occasions. Therefore, I think that is an excellent way \nto proceed.\n  I have only two concerns. One is already in the bill, and the other \ncould be onerous costs to very small agencies. I think we can deal with \nit and approach it the way we always have--rationally, civilly, and \nwith a commitment to get the job done.\n  Mr. BURR. I hope the Senator will interpret it the same way I have \nspelled out the exception clause, and that exception clause could be \ninterpreted, and has been interpreted, to mean the lack of financial \ncapability for a company to engage.\n  I thank the Senator and yield the floor.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 716\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, the amendment offered by the Senator \nfrom South Dakota would state the sense of the Senate that the tax law \nshould not be changed in any way that would discourage taxpayers from \nmaking charitable contributions and gifts.\n  This country has a proud tradition of charitable giving. We are proud \nof that tradition. We are proud that we give to those in need, and we \nshould encourage people to keep on giving. One of the best ways to do \nthat is through the itemized deduction for charitable giving.\n  We very much support the itemized deduction for charitable giving. \nBut the Senator's amendment is overbroad. It would put the Senate on \nrecord as favoring the preservation of incentives for charitable giving \nover all other priorities.\n  Let me talk about a few other priorities the Senate might want to \nconsider.\n  What about cracking down on tax cheats? What about balancing the \nbudget? What about repealing the so-called death tax? The Senator's \namendment could be read as conflicting with each of those other \npriorities.\n  Let me explain. Let's say a tax cheat sets up a charity that is \nreally a scam. Should the IRS be able to crack down on that scam? Of \ncourse it should. But the Senator's amendment says we should preserve \nthe full income tax deduction.\n  Let's say we want to repeal the estate tax--some call it the death \ntax. There is pretty wide agreement that it is a disagreeable tax. But \nstudies have also shown that repeal of that death tax would decrease \ncharitable giving. Should we not scale back the estate tax anyway? Of \ncourse we should. But the Senator's amendment would put the Senate on \nrecord that we always want to encourage charitable giving rather than \ndiscourage it, which would put a big limitation on reducing the death \ntax.\n  What if we reach a bipartisan budget agreement to limit the deficit \nand help balance the budget? Might we want to consider limiting the \nability of upper income taxpayers to take their full deductions?\n  This is not so farfetched an idea. Under current law, itemized \ndeductions are already limited for high-income givers--taxpayers with \nmore than $166,800 in income. Congress enacted that change as part of a \nbipartisan budget agreement, negotiated by OMB Director Dick Darman, \nand signed into law by the first President Bush. Yet these Americans \nstill give. Americans who itemize deductions, as well as those who \ndon't itemize deductions, continue to give.\n  According to the CRS, only 30 percent of taxpayers claim a deduction \nfor charitable giving. Yet we know many more give to charity. The group \nIndependent Sector found that 70 percent of households give.\n  Thankfully, many taxpayers make charitable contributions, even though \nthey are not getting any tax benefit at all. Indeed, one might say the \ngreatest charity is when someone gives from the heart rather than just \nwhen it is tax deductible. So we do not need the extreme statement in \nthe Senator's sense-of-the-Senate amendment.\n  I have offered a side-by-side amendment that emphasizes Congress's \ncontinued support of tax incentives for giving. Let's show our support \nfor charitable giving without making the categorical statement in the \nThune amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Thune amendment and support the \nBaucus amendment.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 721 to Amendment No. 687\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that all pending \namendments be temporarily laid aside so that I may call up amendment \nNo. 721.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection? Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Montana (Mr. Baucus) proposes an amendment \n     numbered 721 to amendment No. 687.\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading of \nthe amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n  (Purpose: To express the sense of the Senate regarding the Federal \n              income tax deduction for charitable giving)\n\n       At the appropriate place, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. --. SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) President John F. Kennedy said, ``The raising of \n     extraordinarily large sums of money, given voluntarily and \n     freely by millions of our fellow Americans, is a unique \n     American tradition . . . Philanthropy, charity, giving \n     voluntarily and freely . . . call it what you like, but it is \n     truly a jewel of an American tradition''.\n       (2) Americans gave more than $300,000,000,000 to charitable \n     causes in 2007, an amount equal to roughly 2 percent of the \n     gross domestic product.\n       (3) The vast majority of those donations, roughly 75 \n     percent or $229,000,000,000, came from individuals.\n       (4) Studies have shown that Americans give far more to \n     charity than the people of any other industrialized nation--\n     more than twice as much, measured as a share of gross \n     domestic product, than the citizens of Great Britain, and 10 \n     times more than the citizens of France.\n       (5) 7 out of 10 American households donate to charities to \n     support a wide range of religious, educational, cultural, \n     health care, and environmental goals.\n       (6) These charities provide innumerable valuable public \n     services to society's most vulnerable citizens during \n     difficult economic times.\n       (7) Congress has provided incentives through the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage charitable giving by \n     allowing individuals to deduct contributions made to tax-\n     exempt charities.\n       (8) 41,000,000 American households, constituting 86 percent \n     of taxpayers who itemize deductions, took advantage of this \n     deduction to give to the charities of their choice.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should preserve the income tax deduction for \n     charitable contributions through the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 and look for additional ways to encourage charitable \n     giving.\n\n\n[[Page S3829]]\n\n\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, if I might, I will speak to the amendment \nI have filed, which is pending and to which the Senator has now offered \na side-by-side.\n  I want to point out, in terms of the way charitable giving works in \nthe country today, how the deduction applies, if you are in, say, a 35-\npercent tax bracket, a high-income-tax payer, and if you give $10,000 \nto a charity, it is actually only costing you $6,500. You are getting a \n35-percent tax break.\n  What the administration's proposed budget would do is reduce the \nfavorable tax treatment an individual who gives to a charitable \norganization would get in the 35-percent tax bracket down to 28 \npercent. In other words, if somebody gives $10,000 to a charity--say a \nreligious organization or some university--the benefit they would \nderive, in terms of tax treatment, would go from $3,500 to $2,800. In \nother words, instead of costing them $6,500 for that charitable \ncontribution of $10,000, it would cost them $7,200. So you would see an \nincrease of 10.8 percent in the amount it would cost someone to make a \n$10,000 contribution. After the tax treatment is applied, it would cost \nthem $7,200 under the proposed budget we have seen from the \nadministration.\n  What my amendment simply does is say we ought to keep current law in \nplace with regard to the tax treatment that is applied to charitable \ncontributions. Here is why it is important--particularly now. We have \nan economy that is struggling. We have lots of charitable organizations \nthat are noticing a dropoff in their contributions because of the \neconomy. People are seeing a reduction in the values of many of the \nassets they have had, and people are losing jobs. There are a lot of \nreasons charitable giving is dropping off, and many of the \norganizations are faced now with a very difficult challenge in order to \nbe able to keep up and meet the needs they are meeting out there across \nthis great country.\n  We rely, as a nation, significantly on the good-heartedness of the \nAmerican people when it comes to contributing to many of these fine \norganizations that are doing good work. I think we ought to keep that \nsame incentive in place--particularly now more than ever. The timing is \ncritical because you are talking about taking away a tax benefit from \npeople who give to charitable organizations at a time when those \norganizations are already suffering from a drop off in giving.\n  So my argument would be--and there is a substantial body of evidence \nout there that suggests this--that when you reduce the tax benefits for \ncharitable giving, say, by about 10 percent, you get about a 10-percent \ndropoff in giving. In other words, if you did take the 35 percent that \ncurrently would apply--if somebody is in the 30-percent tax bracket and \nmakes a $10,000 contribution and deducts that on their income taxes, \nthey get a 35-percent benefit on that, which means a $3,500 savings or, \nin other words, the actual $10,000 is only costing them $6,500.\n  But if you change the tax treatment, as is being proposed by the \nadministration, and make that a 28-percent tax benefit, you then \nincrease the amount the $10,000 contribution is costing the giver, the \ncontributor, to $7,200, which is a 10.8-percent increase in the actual \ncost of that contribution.\n  As I said, if the data that is out there is accurate--and I believe \nit is because I think it is substantial--when you reduce that tax \nbenefit by 10 percent, you also get a 10-percent reduction in the \namount that individual would give. I think that is significant, \nparticularly now when you look at the amount the American public gives \nto charitable organizations. You are talking about anywhere from $8 \nbillion to $16 billion a year in reduced charitable giving in this \ncountry. Multiplied over a long period of time--5 to 10 years--you are \ntalking about $160 billion, and potentially over 10, that would not be \ngoing into these charitable organizations that are serving great \npurposes across this country.\n  I think it is fitting right now to have this discussion. People say: \nWhy don't you do this next week on the budget? We probably will because \nthis is a part of the budget proposal. It is also important to talk \nabout this now because we are talking about expanding programs that the \ngovernment runs right now, which are designed to do good things out \nthere, and to hire volunteers to do charitable work and perform tasks \nthat are contributing to the greater good. Since that debate is focused \non what the government can do, I think it is fitting to talk about what \npeople in this country are already doing in the private sector--\nindividuals who have been blessed by this country and are willing to \ngive something back. I think we ought to encourage more of that not \ntake away from the incentive to do that today.\n  As I said yesterday in my remarks when I offered this amendment, I \ndon't believe anybody makes a charitable contribution simply because of \ntax policy. I think people give because they want to give. I do, \nhowever, believe tax policy influences the amount of giving an \nindividual makes. The statistics bear that out.\n  If you have a 10-percent reduction in a tax benefit accorded to \nsomebody who is making a charitable contribution, you are going to see \nabout a 10-percent reduction in the amount of their contribution. That \ncould cost charities significantly all across the country. That is why \nso many of them have weighed in and suggested that they think it would \nbe a very bad time to go ahead and make this change in tax policy.\n  My amendment expresses the sense of the Senate--nothing more or \nless--that puts this body on record saying we ought to keep the full \ndeductibility of charitable contributions as a matter of tax policy in \nthis country.\n  I think that is a debate that, again, hopefully we will have next \nweek as we debate the President's budget. But I think the President's \ngoal in this is to try to find ways to generate revenue to do other \nthings in their budget. I think this is a bad place to get it. I do not \nthink the savings you are achieving as a result of taking away this tax \nbenefit to charitable giving in the long run is going to in any way \noffset the decrease we are going to see from people across this country \nwho might otherwise make charitable contributions who, because you take \naway that tax benefit, are going to see the actual cost of those \ncontributions go up and therefore affect the amount they might \notherwise give.\n  I hope the Senate will go on record. The side-by-side offered by my \ncolleague from Montana affirms the deductibility of charitable \ncontributions from income tax but takes out the word ``full.'' What my \namendment does is retains what we have today in terms of tax law, tax \npolicy in its treatment of charitable giving, charitable contributions, \nand retains the full deductibility of those charitable contributions.\n  It is important that the sense-of-the-Senate amendment I offered that \nexpresses the view of this body about the deductibility of charitable \ncontributions be the one that we vote on and that we reject the side-\nby-side that is being offered by the Senator from Montana because it \ndoes take away the word ``full,'' which opens the door for changes that \nwill occur in the budget that is going to be offered next week and \nwould reduce the amount--the tax benefit that is accorded to those who \nmake charitable contributions.\n  I hope when we get to the vote--it does not sound as if it is going \nto occur until later this afternoon--the Senate will support the Thune \namendment, the sense of the Senate affirming support of the Senate for \nthe full deductibility of charitable contributions, and reject the \nside-by-side offered by the Senator from Montana which does not include \nthe affirmation of full deductibility of that tax benefit. Bear in \nmind, this is a sense of the Senate. It is not binding, it is not law, \nbut I do think it puts the Senate on record in terms of our full \nsupport of full deductibility of charitable contributions.\n  As I mentioned, timing is important. Right now, with what is \nhappening in the economy and how it is impacting charitable giving to \ncharitable organizations, this is the absolute worst time to be talking \nabout taking away the tax benefit that has produced so much giving and \nadded to the giving people might otherwise do by providing favorable \ntax treatment. It is an incentive that has worked. It has worked in \nspades if you look at the amount of giving that occurred in this \ncountry in\n\n[[Page S3830]]\n\n2007. The number I used in the amendment is $300 billion--2 percent of \nthe GDP--American people contributed to causes greater than themselves. \nWe ought to encourage it, not discourage it. Adopting my sense-of-the-\nSenate amendment would do that. I hope my colleagues will support it.\n  I yield back the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Louisiana.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 705 to Amendment No. 687\n\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent to set aside the \npending amendment and call up amendment No. 705.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Louisiana [Mr. Vitter ] proposes an \n     amendment numbered 705 to amendment No. 687.\n\n  Mr. VITTER.

Madam President, my amendment is very simple and \nstraightforward. While it may on the face of it appear narrow, it \nactually goes to the center of this debate and to a central concern a \nlot of folks sincerely have about this bill.\n  What does my amendment do? My amendment simply states that no money \nin this program can go to ACORN or any of its affiliate organizations \nin any way. As I say, on the face of it, that seems like a very \nspecific, very focused amendment, and it is. We are talking about one \norganization that has done an enormous amount of suspect political \nactivity in the past about which many people in this Chamber--more \nimportantly, many people around the country--have deep reservations.\n  The amendment also goes to the heart of this debate, and the heart of \nthis debate is whether this new Federal bureaucracy would, in effect, \npoliticize charitable activity around the country, which we certainly \ndo not want. I believe this is a very simple test about that central \nquestion, and I encourage all of my colleagues to vote for this \namendment--Democrats and Republicans--to pass this simple test and to \nsay: No, this is more proof that we are not going to allow this program \nto politicize charitable giving and charitable activity around the \ncountry.\n  As I say, this is a very simple, basic test of that question. The \nproponents of this bill say this is about furthering charitable \nactivity, this is about leveraging charitable activity, expanding that, \nnot politicizing it, not bringing it under Government control. Surely, \nif we are serious about that, if we are serious about having mainstream \nconsensus support for that, surely ACORN cannot be part of the picture. \nSurely none of ACORN's affiliate organizations can be part of this \nfunding given recent history.\n  Some proponents of this bill will immediately jump up and say we \ndon't need this amendment because there cannot be political activity \nfunded in this program. For me, just speaking for myself, that isn't \ngood enough. That assurance does not nearly cover the waterfront of my \nconcerns with regard to ACORN because ACORN has always done both \nhyperpolitical activity, such as their fraudulent voter registration \ndrives last fall, and has also done what they characterize as pure \ncharitable activity. To fund the latter, to pour millions or even tens \nof millions of dollars of taxpayer funding into ACORN so-called \ncharitable activity is certainly to underwrite the organization and \ncertainly to support indirectly, if not directly, their very \npoliticized activity with which so many folks in this Chamber and \naround the country have deep problems.\n  This is not a theoretical concern. This is proven out in practice \nthat it is a legitimate concern.\n  First of all, this bill authorizes major Federal spending--$5.7 \nbillion over 5 years.\n  Second, we know from practice, from history, from clear concrete \nexample that ACORN is in the business of trying to get lots of taxpayer \nmoney to underwrite its activity, including through so-called \nnonpolitical projects. ACORN has received significant funding directly \nfrom the Federal Government. Their so-called charitable affiliates have \nreceived conservatively over $31 million of taxpayer dollars from 1998 \nto 2007. In 2008 alone, the next year, ACORN affiliates received almost \n$10 million in Federal taxpayer funding. This includes numerous \nsubgrants, indirect funding to ACORN from the Federal Government. Over \n$7 million was awarded to the ACORN Housing Corporation, AHC, in 2008, \nfrom the National Foreclosure Mitigation Program administered by \nNeighborWorks America. Almost $800,000 was awarded to ACORN by the \nFannie Mae Foundation from 1992 to 2004. And, of course, these are just \ntwo examples. There are many more.\n  Just speaking for myself, for proponents of the bill to say this is \nnot an issue, this is not a problem because we prohibit political \nactivity in this pot of money, in this Federal program, that is not \nnearly enough reassurance for me. We have seen from actual practice, \nfrom actual history that ACORN can reap millions, tens of millions of \ntaxpayer dollars through their so-called charitable affiliates.\n  Why do I have a problem with that? Because clearly that money \nunderwrites ACORN in general and supports all of their activities, \nincluding their very political and, in many cases, fraudulent voter \nregistration activities.\n  We all know the stories from the past campaign, the registering of \nthousands of voters who were either asked to register multiple times by \nACORN or who were voters being registered without their knowledge or \nregistering voters who outright did not exist. That was a common and \ndocumented practice of this organization. For instance, the St. \nPetersburg Times in Florida reported that ACORN tried to register \nMickey Mouse in that jurisdiction. In July 2008, at least three ACORN \nworkers were convicted of voter fraud in Kansas City. One is awaiting \ntrial. These ACORN workers in Kansas City flooded voter registration \nrolls with over 35,000 false or questionable registration forms. In \nMarch 2008, an ACORN worker was sentenced in Berks County, PA, to 146 \ndays to 23 months for making 29 phony voter registration forms in order \nto collect a cash bonus. And in Washington, felony charges were filed\n\n[[Page S3831]]\n\nagainst several paid employees and supervisors of ACORN. Over 1,700 \nfraudulent registrations turned in by the employees were revoked in one \nof the largest instances of voting fraud in the United States. This is \ndocumented. This happened. If we caught these instances, if we \nprevented these instances of fraud, how many more slipped through the \ncracks and proceeded on to the voter registration rolls?\n  The question is very simple: Are we going to create this new Federal \nprogram, $5.7 billion of authorization, that could either directly or \nindirectly fund organizations such as ACORN? Right now, under the \ncurrent version of this bill, that could absolutely happen. If this \nbill passes into law, my prediction is it would absolutely happen.\n  My amendment with regard to ACORN would stop that because it is very \nsimple, it is very direct. There are no ifs, ands, or buts. None of the \nmoney could go to ACORN or any of its affiliate organizations. None of \nthe money could support ACORN activities directly or indirectly. That \nis the reassurance a lot of us need, that this is not an attempt to \npoliticize volunteer activity, this is not an attempt to put the \nFederal Government and whoever its political masters are at the time in \ncharge of directing volunteer activity across our Nation.\n  In the 19th century, a Frenchman visited America and wrote a very \nsignificant book about it. That was de Tocqueville, and the book was \n``Democracy in America.'' The fundamental thing he observed in all of \nhis travels, as documented in that important book, was that America is \ngreat because America is good. In saying that, he wasn't talking about \nGovernment and he wasn't talking about what we do in Congress or what \nany level of government does around the country. He was talking about \nindividual citizens banding together in local communities across our \nland to address real needs to help neighbors, to help feed hungry \npeople, to help meet important community priorities in a purely \nvoluntary way, the civic-mindedness of individual Americans creating \nthese purely voluntary organizations. He said that was the most \nsignificant reason for America's greatness, which had to do with the \ngoodness of its people and that activity which is more vital here than \nin any other country in the world.\n  I am concerned about putting Government more in charge of that \nactivity. I am concerned about politicizing that aspect of our country \nwhich is so fundamental to our historic greatness. My amendment is a \nvery simple but I think important test about whether this bill could \nthreaten that. If we are serious about avoiding that at all costs, then \nsurely a large majority of this body--Democrats and Republicans--will \ncome together, adopt this amendment, and take that threat with regard \nto ACORN off the table.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise in objection to the Vitter \namendment No. 705 to single out ACORN, and actually, inadvertently, \ntarget other organizations that have no involvement whatsoever with \nACORN.\n  The Senator's amendment prohibits ACORN or organizations affiliated \nor which are colocated with ACORN from receiving assistance under this \nact. First, I want to address this colocating. For whatever you feel \nabout ACORN--and I believe it is the one organization being singled \nout--this amendment would prohibit AmeriCorps funds to any organization \nsimply because they rented space in the same building as ACORN.\n  Well, in my hometown, many nonprofits are often within the same \nbuildings as other organizations. So there might be a building in \nBaltimore or Baton Rouge or Fargo, ND, or in New Orleans, where in the \nvery same building that ACORN might be located St. Ambrose Housing \nCounseling Service might also rent a floor; or it might be the \ncommunity law center renting another floor in that building; or it \nmight also be the St. Franciscan nuns who might have office space for \ntheir outreach to the senior community. So when you are in the same \nbuilding as ACORN, this amendment would mean you could not get \nAmeriCorps volunteers.\n  I am so sorry my rebuttal was considered so insignificant, so \ntrivial, that the Senator didn't even stay to hear it, but maybe \neverybody listening will hear it. The fact is, in the examples I have \ngiven--St. Ambrose Housing Counseling Service might be giving very \nimportant financial service counseling to people on financial literacy, \nand also helping them screen what they can afford or not afford; and on \nanother floor the community law center might be working with our new \ntask force organized by the U.S. attorney to go after mortgage fraud; \nand the community law center might be working with that task force \nbecause so many of our poor, in my community, have been a victim of \npredatory lending, and we are trying to track down the scams and the \nschemes and the bums to get rid of them--those organizations might have \nsome AmeriCorps volunteers working with the community to help \naccomplish our public policies. But simply because they share the same \nbuilding, they are going to be penalized and not have access to \nAmeriCorps volunteers.\n  I think that is wrong, I think it is irrational, I think it is harsh, \nI think it is punitive, and I think this amendment should be defeated.\n  The other part of the amendment singles out ACORN for exclusion from \nAmeriCorps. We want to make it clear that the amendment prohibits \nfunding for one single organization. Whatever you think about ACORN, \nknow that they do work in 110 different cities, and they do a variety \nof other kinds of things--such as weatherization. The gentleman from \nLouisiana might be interested to know that after Hurricane Katrina, \nACORN volunteers--hundreds of them--went to Louisiana to rehabilitate \n3,500 homes.\n  Now, I know the Senator from Louisiana is concerned that money not go \nto organizations to conduct voter registration, and I understand that. \nBut this is where the amendment is unnecessary: First, ACORN hasn't \nreceived any AmeriCorps funds in a decade. Let me repeat: ACORN hasn't \nreceived any AmeriCorps funds in a decade. Also, if ACORN does ever in \nthe future participate in AmeriCorps, they will not be able to use \nAmeriCorps volunteers to conduct voter registration drives or \nlegislative advocacy. But that is not only ACORN. None of our groups \ncan do voter registration or legislative advocacy.\n  The other point is that ACORN and any other group would become \nineligible if they were ever convicted of a Federal crime. As you know, \nin the last election, ACORN was viewed in a controversial way. There \nwas an indictment against them. And, by the way, that indictment charge \nwas dismissed, so, therefore, ACORN has never, to my knowledge, been \nconvicted of a Federal crime.\n  So when we look at the amendment offered by the gentleman from \nLouisiana, it is punitive toward other organizations that might be in \nthe same building as ACORN, even though it might be a totally different \norganization. It could be health care for the homeless, it could be a \nhot line for battered women dealing with violence against women. They \nwould be prohibited from getting AmeriCorps volunteers simply because \nthey are in that building.\n  As I said, this singles out ACORN, yet ACORN hasn't received any \nAmeriCorps funds in over a decade. And if AmeriCorps should ever get \nFederal funds, they would be prohibited from doing any of the \nactivities that would give the other side of the aisle pause or \nconcern. We would have that same pause or concern of, No. 1, no \nnational service participants receiving funds can engage in legislative \nadvocacy and, No. 2, an absolute red light would be if anyone applying \nfor AmeriCorps volunteers--any organization applying for AmeriCorps \nsupport--would have been convicted of a Federal crime.\n  So I oppose the Vitter amendment. Later on today, we will be voting \non the Vitter amendment. We expect that vote to occur around 2:30, and \nI ask my colleagues to reject that amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n\n[[Page S3832]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that at 2:30 \np.m. today, the Senate resume consideration of amendment No. 721; that \nupon disposition of that amendment, the Senate resume amendment No. \n716; that upon the disposition of that amendment, the Senate then \nresume amendment No. 705; that prior to a vote in relation to each \namendment, there be 2 minutes of debate equally divided and controlled \nin the usual form; and that no amendments be in order to any of the \namendments in this agreement, prior to a vote in relation thereto; that \nafter the first vote in this sequence, the remaining votes be limited \nto 10 minutes each.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  The Chair hears none, and it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. To put that in plain English, Madam President, it means \nthat we will be voting on Senator Thune's sense of the Senate on \ncharitable giving. Senator Baucus has an alternative, or a side-by-\nside, and we will be voting on that. We will also be voting on the \nVitter amendment related to ACORN. So those will be the three votes.\n  For the interest of our colleagues and others as to how this bill is \nprogressing, we are doing very well, and we thank our colleagues for \ncoming down and offering amendments and debating them. All amendments \nneed to be filed by 1 p.m. today. Upon getting that list, we hope to \nthen work down those that can be easily disposed of, but we will also \nbe reaching out to colleagues for them to come and offer the amendments \non the floor so at such time later on this afternoon we can have \nsubstantive votes.\n  We want to have substantive debate all afternoon. So if our \ncolleagues could file their amendments by 1 p.m., on both sides of the \naisle, we will be expeditiously dealing with them, and then we will be \ninviting colleagues to offer them and then voting on them later on \ntoday.\n  It would be our hope, and the hope, I believe, of the leaders on both \nsides of the aisle, that we could conclude the debate and the vote on \nfinal passage on this bill today. That would be my goal, and I know the \ngoal of Senator Kennedy. I know the goal is shared by Senators Enzi and \nHatch. With the cooperation of colleagues, we will certainly be able to \ndo it, and we thank them already for their excellent cooperation.\n  Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. WEBB. I ask consent to speak as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The remarks of Mr. Webb and Mr. Specter pertaining to the \nintroduction of S. 714 are located in today's Record under ``Statements \non Introduced Bills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Mr. WEBB. Madam President, I yield the floor and suggest the absence \nof a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Shaheen). The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the \norder for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Texas is recognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Mrs. Hutchison pertaining to the introduction of S. \n717 are printed in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced \nBills and Joint Resolutions.'')\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n\n\n                             RECONCILIATION\n\n  Mr. KYL. Mr. President, I compliment my colleague from Texas for \nthose remarks, but my reaction is, would that it were so, because I \nhave in mind what is happening now in the Budget Committee--which we \nwill all be focused on tomorrow--namely, the passage of a budget out of \nthe committee that we will be taking up in this body next week.\n  I know it is usual for us to rotate between Republican and Democrat. \nIf my colleague from New York was waiting to speak, I can advise here I \nwill just be about 3 minutes. Let me just make this point.\n  There are a lot of Democratic colleagues who have said they oppose \nusing the reconciliation process to enact an energy tax or nationalized \nhealth care because they rightly want to reach bipartisan agreement on \nbig issues. They emphasize that the Senate version of the budget does \nnot include reconciliation instructions--and that is correct. But all \nof those Senators and the American people need to know that the House \nversion of the budget does include reconciliation and even includes a \nplaceholder for Senate reconciliation instructions to be inserted in \nconference.\n  The House has only one reason to do this. It does not need \nreconciliation to pass its legislation because, of course, the House \noperates on a purely majority-rule principle. The only reason to \ninclude it is so that the House Speaker and the Senate Democratic \nleader can force a national energy tax through the Senate, a tax that \ncould cost every household more than $3,000 a year.\n  Unlike the House, the Senate operates with a supermajority principle. \nThat means anything controversial requires 60 votes. But reconciliation \nis a special rule, never intended to create new energy or health care \npolicy for our country--issues that are so significant that our regular \norder should prevail. Indeed, that is the only way to have a bipartisan \nresolution of these issues. Reconciliation would turn these issues into \npurely partisan exercises.\n  If any kind of reconciliation instruction is given to either the \nFinance Committee or the Environment and Public Works Committee, we can \nbe sure that a new national energy tax, a tax that will hit all \nAmerican families, is the goal. Reconciliation instructions are, in \neffect, the Trojan horse for a national energy tax. You don't have to \ntake my word for it. Senator Reid said yesterday, in a conference call \nwith reporters, that he would be willing to move a national energy tax \nthrough the Senate to pay for sweeping Government health care via \nreconciliation.\n  It is easy to say these are just arcane budget rules and \ntechnicalities, but we should all be crystal clear about the \nconsequences of reconciliation. If the final budget includes \nreconciliation instructions for the Senate, Senate Republicans will \nhave no recourse for stopping Democrats from enacting this national \nenergy tax or nationalized health care system. We will be forced to \ndeal with the Democratic majority in a partisan way that I thought the \nPresident wanted to avoid. The Senate Parliamentarian has confirmed \nthat if the final budget includes the special budget reconciliation \nprovision, it could be used for any tax increase, regardless of what \nDemocratic leadership promises.\n  Senate Democrats who have expressed concerns about reconciliation \nshould not take any comfort from statements that there is not \nreconciliation in the Senate budget. Now, after Senator Reid's \nstatement, they are on notice that the special rule will be used for a \nnational energy tax.\n  I hope they would indicate that they would not support a conference \nreport that included reconciliation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New York is recognized.\n  Mrs. GILLIBRAND. Mr. President, I rise today to speak in favor of the \nServe America Act. This important legislation will engage hundreds of \nthousands of Americans, from our young people to our seniors, in a new \nera of public service. This act represents the best in the American \ntradition.\n  I have seen the wonderful work it has already done throughout New \nYork. More than 76,000 New Yorkers are working to meet local needs, \nstrengthen and repair communities, and increase civic involvement \nthrough 233 national service projects all across New York. These New \nYorkers tutor and mentor children, manage and staff afterschool \nprograms, patrol neighborhoods, provide disaster response, and work to \nprotect our environment and\n\n[[Page S3833]]\n\nbuild nonprofit groups all around our communities.\n  Just yesterday, I met with 30 nuns who came from Long Island to visit \nwith me, and the work they had done in our community was for those who \nreally need the help the most. They were helping our seniors, and they \nwere helping women who have English as a second language who need to \nlearn English, and they were advocating for world peace.\n  What is so great about this act is it is for all of us who are not \nnuns. This act brings a new wave of community activism to bear on our \ncountry's needs. It inspires me when I think about all the wonderful \ndiversity of people and projects this will deploy to all parts of our \ncountry.\n  The Serve America Act will provide more than 250,000 opportunities \nnationwide by investing approximately $6 billion in new service \ninitiatives and existing service programs. These programs include a \nbrandnew national service program to create Youth Engagement Zones to \nStrengthen Communities program, providing competitive grants to assist \nprograms targeted at high-need, low-income communities and community-\nbased or State entities to engage students and out-of-school youth in \nservice learning and addressing the specific challenges of each of \ntheir communities.\n  The Learn and Serve America Program provides grants to schools, \ncolleges, not-for-profit groups, and it currently engages more than \n38,000 New York students in community services linked to academic \nachievement and the development of civic skills.\n  Third, we have the Summer of Service Program, which is a national \ncoalition of major youth-serving organizations that is committed to \nengaging youth in service during summer months.\n  In this act, we would be allowing our veterans who still want to \nserve their country the chance to lend a hand in supporting our \ndeployed troops and their families. We also give our seniors, our most \nexperienced citizens, the chance to work with and teach our children. \nWe will improve the opportunities for at-risk urban youth, giving them \nadditional volunteer and educational programs to teach them skills and \nbuild their self-confidence. It also gives young people career paths in \nthe professions where we really need their leadership and their time \nand talents--in math, science, engineering, and health care.\n  This bill starts a chain reaction of promise, service, achievement, \nknowledge, and advancement. It is the future of our country.\n  I have seen so many people in areas around New York where their \noptions are limited. This legislation will provide paths to service and \nexcellence for the young people in these neighborhoods.\n  Just last month, I was visiting students at Nazareth High School in \nBrooklyn, NY, and I met with parents who had lost their child to gun \nviolence. I also met with students who lost their classmate. What the \nstudents said was: Senator, we have problems with gangs here in our \ncommunity, and we need an answer to those gangs. We think the best \nthing you could do is help us with afterschool programming, giving us \nopportunities to learn new skills, help with our homework, to do arts \nand crafts, to do sports, to have opportunities to have job training, \nto learn about public service.\n  That is exactly what this act does. It authorizes the grants programs \nthat help these kids in these low-income areas to do things after \nschool until their parents come home from work. It gives them the \nopportunity to work with their seniors, to clean up their \nneighborhoods, to create new mentoring relationships, to work with \nYMCAs and girls clubs and faith-based groups. From our urban youth to \nour most experienced citizens, this legislation will help all of them \ngive more back to their communities.\n  This legislation helps retirees who are willing to be involved in \npublic service. It will enhance the incentives for our retirees to give \na year of service and allow educational awards to be transferred to \ntheir children or their grandchildren. It also establishes Encore \nFellowships to help our retirees transition to longer term service by \nhelping them work in the not-for-profit sector as a second career.\n  Our veterans, who have so proudly served this country, also want to \ncontinue to give of themselves. This bill allows them to help support \nour deployed Armed Forces and their families, helping young people at \nrisk, and assists our veterans in developing educational opportunities.\n  We also are going to fill the needs that are essential for our \ncountry's economic future. Everywhere I travel around my State, from \nBuffalo to Brooklyn, everyone is talking about the need for job \ncreation. This bill allows us to invest in the new areas of renewable \nfuels, energy independence, technology, and medicine so we can begin to \nfocus our youth on the math, science, engineering, and technology they \nneed to be at the forefront of these new careers. What this act does is \nprovide those opportunities for these students to participate in \nservice projects that help them learn the skills they need in these \ngreen jobs and in the health care and technology arenas.\n  In this time of economic crisis and uncertainty, so many people feel \nthe need to contribute to the greater good. We will harness these \nmillions of hearts and minds to do exactly that, to allow America to \nreach its potential. It is a critical step in moving forward the \npromise of our citizens and of our country as embodied in the Serve \nAmerica act. I encourage all Senators to support it fully.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the pending \namendment be set aside.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n          Amendment No. 690, as Modified, to Amendment No. 687\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I now call up the Ensign amendment, No. 690, and I ask \nthat the amendment be modified with the changes at the desk and that \nthe amendment, as modified, be agreed to and the motion to reconsider \nbe laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment (No. 690), as modified, was agreed to, as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To improve the provisions relating to erroneous or incorrect \n                            certifications)\n\n       On page 145, strike lines 4 through 10 and insert the \n     following:\n\n     shall assess against the national service program a charge \n     for the amount of any associated payment or potential payment \n     from the National Service Trust. In assessing the amount of \n     the charge, the Corporation shall consider the full facts and \n     circumstances surrounding the erroneous or incorrect \n     certification.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. BAUCUS.

Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 721\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate, equally divided, prior to a vote on amendment No. \n721, offered by the Senator from Montana, Mr. Baucus.\n  The Senator from Montana is recognized.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Senate is about to vote on two \namendments on the tax treatment of charitable giving. The first is my \namendment. My amendment would put the Senate on record supporting \ncharities. It says Congress should look for ways to encourage \ncharitable giving. I hope my colleagues can support it.\n  The second amendment is the Thune amendment. The Thune amendment \nfavors preservation of full taxing incentives for charitable giving, \nover all other priorities. That is overbroad. That is extreme. I will \nhave more to say about that in a few minutes.\n  But the first vote is now on my amendment to state that the Senate's \nstrong support for charitable giving. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport that amendment.\n\n[[Page S3834]]\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Who yields time in opposition?\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I encourage all time to be yielded back.\n  Mr. KYL.

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 716, \noffered by the Senator from South Dakota, Mr. Thune.\n  The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, my amendment simply expresses the sense of \nthe Senate that we maintain present law with regard to the \ndeductibility of charitable contributions, that we allow or maintain \nthe current tax treatment practice with regard to charitable \ncontributions, and that is to allow full deductibility. The amendment \nwe just voted on by the Senator from Montana opens the door to \nsomething less than full deductibility. I think it is important for the \nSenate to be on record, particularly in light of the challenges being \nfaced by many charitable organizations these days to keep up with \ngiving.\n  There was a story in the New York Times this morning that says only \n12 percent of charitable organizations expect to end the year with an \noperating surplus.\n  Dianne Aviv, president of Independent Sector, a national membership \norganization of charities, said any decrease in charitable giving \ncaused by Obama's proposal, no matter how small, would be ``seen as a \nstake in the heart.''\n\n       With all other means of income down, the idea that there \n     will be another potential cut to the income of those \n     nonprofit organizations feels catastrophic. It is utterly \n     unacceptable.\n\n  We have an opportunity to make a statement here expressing the view \nof the Senate confirming the current tax treatment for charitable \ncontributions, full deductibility.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Montana.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, the Thune amendment says: Preserve full \ntax incentives for charitable giving, over all other priorities.\n  This is a shot at President Obama's proposal to limit deductions for \nthose making more than a quarter of a million dollars a year.\n  But the Senator's amendment is broader than that. It is overbroad.\n  Should the tax law be able to crack down on charities that are \nactually scams? Of course, it should.\n  But the Thune amendment says: Preserve the full income tax deduction, \nno matter what.\n  Should we scale back the estate tax, even if it would decrease \ncharitable giving? Of course, we should.\n  But the Thune amendment says: Don't discourage charitable giving.\n  This amendment is overbroad. I urge my colleagues to oppose the \namendment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question is on agreeing to the amendment.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from North Dakota (Mr. \nDorgan) and the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Kennedy) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand).

Under the previous order, there will now be 2 \nminutes of debate equally divided prior to a vote on amendment No. 705, \noffered by the Senator from Louisiana, Mr. Vitter.\n  The Senator from Louisiana.\n  Mr. VITTER. Madam President, my amendment is very simple. It says no \nmoney under this program could go to ACORN or any of its affiliates. \nAlthough it is about that one organization, I think the amendment goes \nto the heart of this debate.\n  A lot of us are concerned this bill could politicize and put too much \nGovernment involvement in charitable work across the country. Some \nfolks may like ACORN, other folks may not, but nobody can argue that \nACORN isn't at its core political and ideological. It should not get \nmoney under this program. The language in the bill that says you can't \ndo political activity with the money clearly isn't good enough, because \nACORN and other very political and ideological groups would simply have \ncharitable offshoots that could accept the money and be underwritten \nindirectly in that way.\n\n  I reserve the remainder of my time.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator's time has expired.\n  The Senator from Maryland.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I vigorously, unabashedly, \nunreservedly\n\n[[Page S3835]]\n\noppose this amendment. This amendment is absolutely not needed.\n  First, ACORN hasn't received AmeriCorps money in over a decade. Now, \nwe would deny--deny--to groups who happen to be in the same building as \nACORN access to AmeriCorps funds. It is harsh, punitive, and I believe \nmakes no sense in terms of being able to deliver a service. It means if \nthe Franciscan nuns had a floor in the building where ACORN operated, \nthey couldn't do outreach to the poor. It means if there is a hotline \nfor battered women to call, and they happen to be in the same building \nas ACORN, they couldn't get AmeriCorps funds.\n  I think this is an amendment that has no purpose and has Draconian \nconsequences if passed. I therefore object to this amendment.\n  Madam President, I yield back my time, and I move to table this \nVitter amendment and ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second?\n  There is a sufficient second.\n  The question is on agreeing to the motion.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN.

Madam President, again, I offer this amendment on behalf of \nSenator Mikulski and myself. We worked diligently over the last several \nhours to try to fix a previous amendment. We have come to that \nagreement.\n  I remind my colleagues that what we have done is clearly targeted at \nindividuals who, on a recurring basis, deal with vulnerable \npopulations, including children, the elderly, and the disabled. We have \nallowed the 2-year ramp-up to remain in the bill. In addition, we have \nleft the ``for good cause'' exemption and added specific additional \nexemptions to the bill.\n  This is a good piece of legislation. It should give every Member a \nstrong belief that we are doing everything we can to protect those \nindividual populations by making sure those who volunteer, in fact, \nmeet the threshold we think is appropriate.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Maryland is recognized.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I rise as an enthusiastic cosponsor of \nthe Burr-Mikulski amendment. I do so because I believe what we have \nbeen able to achieve is to ensure that our vulnerable populations will \nnot ever be exposed to people who could jeopardize their health or \nwell-being if they work in the service of America.\n  Our amendment affirms very clearly that our bill will require \ncriminal history checks on all employees and volunteers participating \nin these programs. Volunteers will be checked through the national sex \noffender data base. No sexual predators will participate.\n  Also, we will be doing, where appropriate, FBI and State database \ncriminal data checking. We agree with Senator Burr there should be \nmandatory FBI fingerprint background checks of all volunteers working \nwith children, the elderly, and individuals with disabilities.\n  Our amendment makes our bill even tougher by adding Senator Burr's \nrequirement that volunteer organizations check with that FBI data base \nso that no criminals are ever working around these populations. We are \nalso making sure there is the opportunity for flexibility of these \ngroups, particularly where the entity is not authorized or is unable \nunder State law to access these national history background checks, and \nsome other technicals.\n  We are going to go a step further and ask the Attorney General to \nreport back within a year if we need to do more to strengthen these \nbackground checks. We will work to get whatever we need to get the job \ndone.\n  I want to take this opportunity to thank Senator Burr for reaffirming \na strong commitment in this area. I have worked with him on his \nCommittee and on the Intelligence Committee. I thank him for his \napproach in protecting vulnerable populations. I am glad we can work \ntogether to find a sensible center so we can get the job done. It shows \nif we listen to each other, we can work and govern together and, at the \nend of the day, the bill is better because of our efforts.\n  I thank the Senator for his cooperation, his civility, and a very \ngood idea. If the Senator from North Carolina would like, we could move \nto a voice vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. BURR. That would be fine.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask that this amendment be adopted \nby a voice vote.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question is \non agreeing to the amendment.\n  The amendment (No. 727) was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I move to reconsider the vote.\n  Mr. HATCH. I move to lay that motion on the table.\n  The motion to lay on the table was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I want to report the status. We have \nconcluded action on three amendments by a formal vote. We just \ncompleted another matter on a voice vote, as staff continues to iron \nout modest wrinkles on very few outstanding issues. Besides those \nissues, I am not aware of any other matter that needs to be considered.\n  I want Members to be aware the national service train will soon be \nleaving the station. If any Senator now wishes to offer an amendment or \nbring something to our attention, now is the time.\n  I am not in a position to ask unanimous consent for a time for final \npassage, but I alert our colleagues that after the national security \nbriefings that all Senators will shortly be attending, we would like to \nbe ready to move toward final passage.\n  Let's continue to work the way we are, and I think we can get the job \ndone.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 714 to Amendment No. 687\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, on behalf of Senator Warner of \nVirginia, I ask unanimous consent to call up amendment No. 714, and \nthat once that is reported, the amendment be agreed to, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid upon the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there objection?\n  Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for Mr. Warner, \n     proposes an amendment numbered 714 to amendment No. 687.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n(Purpose: To conduct a study regarding the establishment of a Volunteer \n                       Management Corps program)\n\n         On page 235, between lines 9 and 10, insert the \n     following:\n\n     SEC. 1713.

On behalf of myself and Senator Enzi, I call up an \namendment of technical changes, which is at the desk, and I ask \nunanimous consent that it be considered and agreed to, and the motion \nto reconsider be laid on the table.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Without objection, it is \nso ordered.\n  The clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Maryland [Ms. Mikulski], for herself and \n     Mr. Enzi, proposes an amendment numbered 728 to amendment No. \n     687.\n\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that reading \nof the amendment be dispensed with.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 26, line 25, strike ``for this part'' and insert \n     ``for this subtitle''.\n       On page 60, line 11, strike ``the report'' and insert ``the \n     report described in subsection (c)''.\n       On page 67, line 15, strike ``places'' and insert \n     ``place''.\n       On page 81, line 4, insert before the semicolon the \n     following: ``, and sending care packages to Members of the \n     Armed Forces who are deployed''.\n       On page 92, line 25, strike ``heath'' and insert \n     ``health''.\n       On page 103, lines 16 and 17, strike ``subtitles B and C'' \n     and insert ``subtitle B''.\n       On page 272, line 17, strike ``be focused'' and insert \n     ``propose to focus''.\n       On page 272, line 21, strike ``be focused'' and insert \n     ``propose to focus''.\n       On page 276, line 6, strike ``the highest'' and insert \n     ``high''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, the amendment is \nagreed to, and the motion to reconsider is considered made and laid on \nthe table.\n  The amendment (No. 728) was agreed to.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Chair.\n\n\n                           Teach for America\n\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. I would like to commend Senator Mikulski for all the \nhard work that you, Senator Kennedy, Senator Hatch and Senator Enzi \nhave put into crafting this bipartisan legislation. In a time when we \nare seeing record numbers of Americans looking to give their time and \nenergy to service, I am pleased that we are strengthening and expanding \nnational service programs to create more opportunities for those \nwilling to serve. I thank the Senator for her work on this effort.\n  In particular, I am pleased with the creation of the new national \nservice corps, which will address educational, health, veteran, and \nenvironmental needs. One professional education corps currently in \noperation, Teach For America, has been an AmeriCorps program since 1994 \nand is the Nation's largest professional service corps. Teach For \nAmerica recruits top-college graduates of all backgrounds and career \ninterests to commit to teach for at least 2 years in our Nation's most \nunderserved classrooms. To date, 20,000 Teach For America corps members \nhave enriched the lives of more than 3 million low income students at \nour Nation's lowest performing schools. I am very encouraged by the \nfact that while only 1 in 10 Teach For America corps members initially \nplanned on a career in education, two-thirds of them remain in the \nfield in some capacity. This demonstrates the life-changing impact that \nthis kind of service can have on an individual.\n  Teach For America is also experiencing remarkable growth as more and \nmore Americans look to give back to their communities. Applications \nwere up 40 percent this year, with 35,000 people applying to serve \nthrough Teach For America alone.\n  However, I am concerned that there may be some confusion about the \nability of Teach for America participants to serve in the Education \nCorps that we are creating with this bill. As I understand it, Teach \nFor America will continue to be eligible under the national service \ncorps description in section 122(c)(1)(D) and that because of that \neligibility will be eligible as a program model for service corps for \nfunding under the Education Corps and any of the newly created corps \nprograms under section 122. Is this understanding correct?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the Senator raising \nthe issue of Teach For America. As the Senator knows, I am a very \nstrong supporter of Teach For America and am very proud of the \nsuccesses that its corps members have in the classroom. Teach For \nAmerica has 240 corps members in Maryland this year, and by next year \nyou will have 140 in Tennessee, which is very exciting. Nationally, \nover 6100 corps members are enriching the lives of more than 450,000 \nunderserved students in our Nation's lowest performing schools. And \nwith more than 14,000 alumni working in all fields to combat \neducational inequity, I am confident that the impact of this program \nand its corps members will only continue to grow.\n  I am proud to be a longtime supporter of this innovative and dynamic \nprogram, and I am pleased to say that they will continue to be eligible \nto participate in AmeriCorps through the newly created national service \ncorps. Teach For America has demonstrated measurable effectiveness in \nthe classroom, and it is exactly this type of measurable success that \nwe are looking to scale up.\n  I would like to reiterate it as clearly and simply as I can so that \nthere is no confusion:\n  Teach for America is eligible to receive funding under this \nlegislation as a program model for service corps.\n  Participants in the national service corps program models are allowed \nto serve in the Education Corps--or any of the other corps--that we are \nallowing for the creation of with the passage of this law, as long as \nthey are focused on improving the appropriate outcomes.\n  And Teach for America will be eligible to serve in the Education \nCorps.\n\n\n                    Retired Senior volunteer Program\n\n  Mr. ENZI. I would like to thank Senator Mikulski for all the hard \nwork that she, Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch have put into crafting \nthis bipartisan legislation. After 16 years we finally have the \nopportunity to take a hard look at the laws surrounding national \nservice, and we are making necessary changes to improve accountability, \nreduce bureaucracy, and ensure that we get maximum return on the \ntaxpayer's investment.\n  Early in this process we recognized that an important challenge we \nwould face in the reauthorization of the Domestic Volunteer Service Act \nwas the desire of many to inject more competition into the SeniorCorps \nprograms.\n  These programs provide important services in every one of our States. \nIn Wyoming there are more than 1,300 older Americans who are working to \nmeet the needs of their communities in one of three Senior Corps \nprograms: Retired Senior Volunteers, Senior Companion, and Foster \nGrandparents. In the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program--RSVP--\nvolunteers are working in Casper and Cheyenne to conduct safety \npatrols, participate in environmental projects, and provide tutoring \nand mentoring services.\n  We have included performance indicators throughout the bill that will \nhelp us to evaluate the work of these programs. In the RSVP program, we \nreached bipartisan agreement to phase in a competitive grant process \nthat provides incentives for organizations to improve their \ncoordination with other community-based organizations, to increase \ntheir compliance with program requirements, and to assess their \nstrengths and areas in need of improvement.\n  We have included requirements that this new process put transparency \nfirst. The process by which the Corporation develops regulations and \nperformance measures should be open and inclusive. As the Corporation \nfor National Community Service moves through the regulatory process, we \nexpect them to take seriously the public comments they receive for how \nbest to move forward with greater competition in this program. There is \na lot of on-the-ground expertise within the community of RSVP \ndirectors, and we expect the Corporation will listen to their \nrecommendations, the recommendations of the National Association of \nRSVP Directors, and involve representatives from these communities in \nthe peer review process.\n  Finally, I understand that this new process has the potential for \ncreating some new paperwork and administrative burdens on grantees in \nthe RSVP program. Does the Senator see a way for those concerns to be \naddressed?\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I thank the Senator. I appreciate the Senator raising \nthe issue of competition in the SeniorCorps programs. As the Senator \nknows, I am\n\n[[Page S3838]]\n\na very strong supporter of the work that these programs perform in the \ncommunities in my State. More than 7,400 seniors participate in these \nprograms. Our Foster Grandparents serving as tutors and mentors, our \nSenior Companions are providing services to homebound seniors, and our \nRetired and Senior Volunteers are working in hundreds of community-\nbased organizations across Maryland.\n  I believe that the language we have agreed upon provides \nopportunities to address some of the additional administrative burdens \nthat may present a challenge for some of our small and rural programs. \nWhile this bill requires that RSVP programs undergo evaluations to \ngauge their performance levels, it also includes requirements for the \nCorporation to provide technical assistance to those programs that are \nstruggling. It is important that as these organizations work to improve \ntheir performance they are able to obtain the support that they need \nfrom the Corporation to be successful. We have built in sufficient time \nso that the process is not rushed, and the legislation also ensures \nthat every effort be made to minimize disruption to the volunteers and \nthe communities they serve.\n  And it is also important to note that we have directed the \nCorporation to make available an online resource guide. This resource \nguide will spell out the Corporation's expectations for high performing \nprograms, provide examples of best practices, and help demystify the \nmeaningful outcome measures that we expect to be applied to these \nprograms. We are charting a path forward that will result in the RSVP \nvolunteers providing better services to the communities in which they \nserve.\n\n\n                           roosevelt scholars\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Madam President, I wish to join Senator Kennedy and \nSenator Voinovich in a colloquy about the importance of government \nservice and the potential of the Roosevelt Scholars program to bring \nmore talented young Americans into the Federal workforce.\n  The important legislation before us today focuses its attention on \nvolunteerism and community service. I commend Senators Kennedy, Hatch \nand of course, my colleague Senator Mikulski, who has so ably guided \nthe Senate's consideration of the Serve America Act. I suggest that it \nwould be wise for this body to address the value of government service \nwith the same resolve and bipartisanship with which we have engaged on \nthe volunteer service legislation before us today.\n  Advancing service legislation without a government service component \nwould be unfortunate in ordinary times, but it is doubly so given the \nextraordinary demands being placed on our government in a time of \nnational crisis. It is incumbent upon all of us to ensure that we are \nbuilding new pipelines of talent into the Federal workforce to ensure \nthat our government is able to meet its responsibilities to the \nAmerican people.\n  The Roosevelt Scholars Act is a smart and efficient way to add one of \nthese new--and needed--pipelines. The proposal is to create a \nscholarship program in mission-critical fields in exchange for a \nFederal service commitment. The Roosevelt Scholars program would \nprovide tuition, support for room and board and a stipend for study in \noccupations critical to our government's success, including \nengineering, public health, science, foreign languages, accounting and \ninformation technology, to name but a few. In exchange for this \nsupport, Roosevelt Scholars would complete an internship in a Federal \nagency and, upon graduation, would be expected to complete a minimum of \nthree years of Federal service. A Roosevelt Scholars Foundation would \nbe established to administer all aspects of the program.\n  Mr. VOINOVICH. I thank the Senator from New Mexico. Since my election \nto the Senate, I have made improving the Federal workforce a priority. \nI know from 18 years of experience as both a mayor and a Governor that \nyou simply cannot have effective government without the right people to \nget the job done.\n  The Oversight of Government Management and the Federal Workforce \nSubcommittee, which I chaired and of which I am now the ranking member, \nhas held dozens of hearings on issues related to attracting and \nretaining talented people in government service. Roughly one-third of \ngovernment's top scientists, engineers, physicians, mathematicians, \neconomists, and other highly specialized professionals will be leaving \ngovernment service in the next 5 years. The labor needs of government \nare becoming more professional and specialized than ever before. \nUnfortunately, the same is true of the overall U.S. labor market and an \ninsufficient number of citizens are pursuing study in high need areas. \nWe need programs like Roosevelt Scholars to help address this shortage \nof skilled talent.\n  I am pleased to join the Senator as a cosponsor of the Roosevelt \nScholars proposal so more of our talented young people who answer the \ncall to service will have government service as an option.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I appreciate the remarks of my colleague and look to my \ncolleague from the State of Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, for some \nassurance that he regards government service as public service, as I \ndo, and that the HELP Committee on which we both serve will pursue the \nRoosevelt Scholars Act as one way to enable more Americans to answer \nthe call to national service.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. I thank my colleague from New Mexico and also my \ncolleague from Ohio. I certainly agree that government service is \npublic service. I also agree that we need to do more to encourage \ntalented young men and women to serve in the government and make it \nfinancially possible for them to do so. We took a significant step to \ndo so in the last Congress, with the public service loan forgiveness \nprogram in the College Cost Reduction and Access Act. I would be \npleased to work with the Senator and our colleagues in the HELP \nCommittee to see that the proposed Roosevelt Scholars Act and its \nemphasis on building new pipelines to bring talent into government \nservice receive a full hearing and consideration by the committee.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Madam President, I am pleased that the Senate is moving \nforward to vote on final passage of the bipartisan Serve America Act. \nPractical participation in the goals and ideals of our country through \nservice is a cornerstone of our success as the world's most enduring \ndemocracy, and we must continue to work together to promote such \nvolunteerism on a national level. Senator Kennedy has worked tirelessly \nto promote national service by authoring and passing the National and \nCommunity Service Trust Act, which created AmeriCorps. Senator \nKennedy's career of public service serves as an example to so many \nAmericans, and I am proud to have joined alongside him as a cosponsor \nof this legislation.\n  For dozens of years, programs aimed at assisting Americans of all \nages to participate in year-long service activities have thrived and \nnational service applications are higher than they have ever been. This \nbill would expand the opportunities for Americans to serve by boosting \nAmeriCorps programs over 8 years to a goal of 250,000 volunteers, \nengaging youth and low-income individuals to participate in Summer of \nService or Semester of Service programs, making expansions to programs \nfor retirees, and authorizing a program for short-term international \nservice opportunities. These programs have helped thousands engage in \ntheir communities and become involved in civic life and we should \nencourage even greater participation by passing this bill.\n  In this time of economic hardship, Americans are struggling to pay \nthe high costs of tuition and those who do make it through school are \nstruggling to find ways to pay the bills. Many that may be drawn toward \nyear-of-service programs are unable to commit because they cannot \nafford to do so. The Serve America Act increases the education award \nfor volunteers to $5,350 to keep up with education costs and to link it \nto Pell Grants in order to help it increase in the future.\n  The dedicated young people who have answered the honorable call to \nnational service contribute enormously to the strength of our \ncommunities. Whether they are helping to house the homeless, feed the \nhungry, or keep disadvantaged youth safe in fun and educational after-\nschool activities, they are often filling a sorely needed gap that the \ncommunity cannot otherwise fill. Since AmeriCorps' inception in 1994, \nmore than 2,900 Vermonters have\n\n[[Page S3839]]\n\nqualified for education loans through the program, allowing about 390 \nVermont students to serve each year. Additionally, 2,800 Vermont \nseniors contribute their time to the Senior Corps program by becoming \nfoster grandparents, senior companions for homebound seniors, or by \nserving in the Retired and Senior Volunteer Program. The expansion of \nthe year-of-service opportunities this bill contains will greatly \nincrease the capacity of Vermonters to join national service programs.\n  Last week, a large group of volunteers from YouthBuild came to \nWashington to participate in Green Building Service Day to build an \nenergy efficient home on the National Mall. YouthBuild volunteers have \nbeen participating in similar projects for more than 20 years. Several \nmembers of YouthBuild Burlington came to Washington to participate in \nGreen Building Service Day and described how the program turned around \ntheir lives and how they are inspired to continue public service after \ntheir time with YouthBuild is completed. National service programs such \nas YouthBuild are not merely volunteer programs, but programs that \ninvigorate the spirit of national service that will influence \nvolunteers for a lifetime.\n  We must work to make this vital part of our social safety net in \nVermont and across the nation. Service to our country is not only \nnoble, but it enriches the lives of those served as well as the \nvolunteers who commit their time to helping others. I urge support of \nthis bill as the Senate prepares to vote.\n  Mr. SCHUMER. Madam President, I rise today to express my support for \nthis important bipartisan bill, the Serve America Act.\n  Voluntarism is at the core of the ``American'' spirit. It was \nsomething that impressed Alexis de Tocqueville when he first visited \nthe new American democracy in the early nineteenth century, and it is a \ntrait that continues to improve the world around us every second of \nevery day.\n  Now, more than ever, we need to do what we can to keep the flame of \npublic service burning bright in America to give our schools, our \nchurches and temples, and our communities hope that prosperity and \neconomic recovery for all is just around the corner.\n  This legislation that we are considering today does just that.\n  The Serve America Act reauthorizes and broadens our national service \nlaws and creates a framework to develop national service programs that \nwill improve American communities and enrich the lives of all of those \nwho answer the call to serve.\n  Now is the time for us to come together to reach out a helping hand \nto one another. This is what makes our country great, it is our spirit \nof community, our willingness to hunker down and help one another.\n  The Serve America Act creates a continuum of service opportunities \nfor Americans of all ages and walks of life--from middle school kids \nthrough seniors enjoying retirement.\n  Today, I want to highlight a particular provision in this bill, the \n9/11 Day of Service and Remembrance.\n  I thank Senators Kennedy, Mikulski, Hatch and Enzi for including this \nimportant provision at my urging.\n  This provision will create a new national campaign to promote public \nservice and encourage Americans to observe September 11 as a National \nDay of Service and Remembrance.\n  This is important not only to all the families and loved ones \naffected by that terrible tragedy, but also to the next generation of \nAmericans--so that we will never forget what happened on that day, and \nwe will honor those who were killed with our own act of selflessness \nand public service.\n  I want to acknowledge several of my fellow New Yorkers who have \nworked tirelessly on this issue: Jay Winuk, cofounder and vice \npresident of MyGoodDeed.org and the brother of attorney and 9/11 \nrescuer Glenn Winuk and David Paine, president and founder of \nMyGoodDeed.org.\n  Glenn Winuk is just one of many New Yorkers who this provision will \nhonor. On September 11, 2001, Glenn was working in his law office near \nthe World Trade Center when the first plane hit.\n  Glenn was a volunteer fire fighter and EMT and he helped evacuate his \nbuilding, and then headed toward the chaos, grabbing a mask and a pair \nof gloves on the way. Tragically, Glenn died when the second tower \ncollapsed.\n  The nonprofit My Good Deed, started by his brother and friend, was \nfounded to transform the anniversary of the attacks of September 11, \n2001 into an annually observed national day of service and good deeds.\n  In 2007, more than 300,000 good deeds were posted on the \norganization's website by participants from all 50 U.S. states and150 \ndifferent countries and territories.\n  The good deeds come in all forms--large and small.\n  Giving a homeless woman a blanket on a cold night, donating blood \nregularly, sending care packages to our troops, and helping friends and \nneighbors by babysitting.\n  There is a tremendous story from 2007 of John Feal who founded the \nFeal Good Foundation. John donated a kidney to a stranger to help a \nseriously ill 9/11 rescue worker. What a wonderful act of selflessness.\n  We want to encourage more stories and acts of generosity like this.\n  Establishing 9/11 as a national service day also has the potential to \ninspire many people to consider community service for the first time--a \nkey goal of President Obama's administration.\n  MyGoodDeed.org, the nonprofit that has been leading the eight year \neffort to designate 9/11 as a national day of service, found that two-\nthirds of those who have participated in the unofficial 9/11 day of \nservice observance to date--more than three million people a year by \nits estimates--describe themselves as relatively new or new to \nvolunteering.\n  Commemorating 9/11 with a good deed to help another American in need \nwill honor great New Yorkers like John Sferazo and his organization \n``Unsung Heroes Helping Heroes''--who have already stepped up to the \nplate and volunteered their time to help their fellow countrymen.\n  John was an ironworker who sacrificed his health at Ground Zero--and \nhe and the Unsung Heroes have been helping out other first responders \never since.\n  September 11 should not only be a day for mourning--it should be a \nday to think about our neighbors, our community, and our country.\n  We can take a tragic day in our Nation's history and turn it into a \nforce for good. We can make it a day on which we can give back in \nremembrance of those who lost their lives.\n  (At the request of Mr. Reid, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n Mr. DORGAN. Madam President, I am pleased to be a cosponsor of \nthe Serve America Act, and I am glad the Senate is taking up this \nimportant bill this week. This legislation will provide better \nopportunities for all Americans to be involved in their communities. By \nengaging Americans of all ages in volunteer service opportunities, we \ncan address some of our most pressing national challenges.\n  In North Dakota, people understand the importance of civic duty and \nlending a hand to help a neighbor or their community. In fact, as we \nare debating this legislation on the Senate floor, there is a major \nvolunteer effort going on in North Dakota.\n  As I described in some detail yesterday, we are facing a major flood \nthreat up and down the Red River Valley as well as in Bismarck and \nother communities around the state. The Red River is expected to rise \nto a record level in Fargo on Saturday. The community is working around \nthe clock to fill sandbags, raise dikes and do their best to prepare. \nWe are also facing several ice jams on the Missouri River that, if they \nbreak too fast, could flood our capital city of Bismarck in a matter of \nhours.\n  Yesterday I met with President Obama, along with Senator Conrad, \nCongressman Pomeroy, and our two colleagues from Minnesota, Senator \nKlobuchar and Congressman Peterson, to brief the President on the \nsituation. The President pledged the full support of the Federal \nGovernment and signed an emergency disaster declaration to immediately \ndeliver Federal aid to the region.\n  I am heading to North Dakota today to meet with Federal, State and \nlocal officials as we make the final push to prepare for the flood. I \nam sorry that I am going to miss the final series of votes on this \nbill, but I need to be on the ground in North Dakota.\n\n[[Page S3840]]\n\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, I rise today in support of S. 277, the \nServe America Act. First, let me thank Chairman Kennedy, Senator \nMikulski, and Senators Hatch and Enzi, for their leadership and their \nvision in crafting this bipartisan legislation. I am proud to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill, because it will foster the best of \nwhat it means to be an American--our sense of community and shared \nresponsibility for one another.\n  This bill helps Americans respond to the call to national service. In \nthe 63 days since President Obama took office, nowhere have we seen a \nmore vibrant example than that set by the First Lady, Michelle Obama. \nJust last week, Mrs. Obama brought a diverse group of successful women \nto the White House--among them an astronaut, musicians, actors, \nbusinesswomen, scientists, authors--before dispersing them to \nWashington, DC, Maryland, and Virginia schools to meet with students \nand help them to aspire to greatness as well. Three weeks ago, on March \n5, she served lunch to homeless men and women at a soup kitchen in \ndowntown Washington. The menu for the day featured fruit salad made \nwith donations from White House employees. Mrs. Obama's message was \nsimple and eloquent--that times are tough and people need a helping \nhand. She said that those who could not donate food or money should try \nto donate time instead. These are but two examples of how Mrs. Obama \nhas inspired civic interest and engagement in others. But one need not \nbe First Lady or even a celebrity to serve the community and that is \nwhat S. 277, the Serve America Act, is all about.\n  The Serve America Act promotes public service as one avenue to \naddress the most pressing challenges facing America. Who can help keep \nour children in school and out of gangs? Mentors provided through \nEducation Corps. How can a single mother without insurance get her \nchildren basic dental care? Through oral health access programs offered \nthrough Healthy Futures Corps. How can a retiree better afford her \nheating bills? The Clean Energy Service Corps can weatherize her house \nto improve energy efficiency. How can a veteran recently returned from \nAfghanistan readjust to life at home? By working with volunteers at the \nVeterans Corps to pursue educational opportunities and professional \ncertification. How can a recently laid-off father get gainful \nemployment? Through the job-training and job-placement services and \nfinancial literacy programs offered through Opportunity Corps. These \nare just a few examples of how this legislation builds on the success \nof AmeriCorps to develop a volunteer base of civic engagement. It would \nreauthorize the basic AmeriCorps program with the goal of increasing \nthe number of volunteers from 75,000 up to 250,000.\n  As our recession has spread and deepened, I have talked with many of \nMaryland's nonprofit service organizations, and the message is the \nsame: our communities' need for services has increased, while donations \nhave decreased. But true to the American spirit, the number of \nvolunteers eager to serve has increased. People are willing to donate \ntheir time, even though they might be less able to afford monetary \ndonations. And for many affected by layoffs and cutbacks, time is all \nthey have to give. When I visit with high school and college students, \nI find they are more enthusiastic than ever about the notion of public \nservice. S. 277 will harness that enthusiasm and help translate their \ninterest into action.\n  By promoting the involvement of Americans of all ages, this bill \nsupports a lifetime of service. It strengthens the current Learn and \nServe America program to engage middle and high school students in \nmeeting community needs. The bill establishes youth engagement zones--\nlow-income, high-need districts where community based service learning \nprojects can be coordinated for secondary school students. For college \nstudents, in addition to AmeriCorps service opportunities, the bill \nallows institutions of higher education to include service-learning as \na component of other curriculae such as nursing and criminal justice. \nThe bill also creates a ``Campuses of Service'' program, through which \nup to 25 colleges and universities can receive grants to provide \nservice learning programs, or to share their programs with other \ninstitutions.\n  In addition, the bill provides opportunities for America's seniors. \nOur Nation can benefit from seniors' many years of experience as we \nconfront today's problems. S. 277 will enhance current Senior Corps \nprograms and offer incentives for service. It will also allow \nparticipants to transfer any earned educational benefits to their \nchildren or grandchildren.\n  I want to draw particular attention to the Healthy Futures Corps. \nThis program will provide grants to the states and nonprofit \norganizations so they can fund national service in low-income \ncommunities. Healthy Futures Corps members will address certain health \nindicators, including chronic diseases, such as diabetes, and other \nconditions where we know there are socioeconomic, geographic, and \nracial and ethnic disparities. It will allow us to put into action \ntools that can help close the gaps in health status--prevention and \nhealth promotion. For too long, we have acknowledged health \ndisparities, studied them, written reports about them. This bill will \nhelp us eliminate them through community-based interventions. I want to \nexpress my deep appreciation to the committee for adding language \nspecifying oral health as an area of focus. Often overlooked when we \nconsider health care, oral health is an essential component of health \nthroughout life. No one can be truly considered healthy if they have \nuntreated cavities, periodontal disease, or other dental problems. \nMaryland learned that lesson two years ago when 12 year old Prince \nGeorge's County resident Deamonte Driver died of a brain infection \nbrought on by an untreated tooth abscess. This measure will help \nrecruit young people to work in the dental profession, where there are \nsevere shortages of providers in many urban and rural areas. It will \nfund the work of individuals who can help parents find available oral \nhealth services for themselves and their children. It will make a \ndifference in the lives of the Healthy Futures Corps members who work \nin underserved communities and in the lives and health of those who get \naccess to care, and so I want to thank the committee for this addition \nto the bill.\n  I am proud to say that Maryland already has a great track record in \npublic service. The Corporation for National and Community Service \nreports that more than 170,000 Marylanders now participate through 115 \nnational service projects across our State. But there is always room \nfor more. This legislation gives our State and the Nation additional \ntools to answer the call to service. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis bill and it is my hope that it will receive the unanimous support \nof the Senate.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Madam President, I rise today in strong \nsupport of the Serve America Act. This bill has broad, bipartisan \nsupport--and it should. One of my colleagues said earlier that it \ncombines the best of liberal and conservative. I would say that it \nappeals to something that transcends political labels--a core belief \nthat if citizens want to serve our country, we should help them.\n  But there are a few opponents of this bill, and I want to speak \nbriefly to their concerns.\n  The basic argument against this legislation--as I understand it--is \nthat government should not have to pay for voluntarism. I understand \nthat argument. But I think it represents a basic misunderstanding of \nwhat public service is all about.\n  The AmeriCorps Web site says that that program offers young people an \n``opportunity'' to serve.\n  And it is true. Community service is an opportunity. We could spend \nhours listing prominent public careers that started in the public \nservice program. One of our colleagues got his start that way, and I \nknow he appreciated that first opportunity to serve.\n  Alexis de Tocqueville--probably the most famous observer of American \ncivil society--referred to our volunteer organizations as ``schools of \ndemocracy.'' And they are.\n  Volunteers learn to be citizens--in the fullest and truest sense of \nthat word. A Teach for America volunteer in Gallup doesn't just teach \nhis students. He learns a new culture. He learns compassion for a \ncommunity that is not his own. And he learns how to take responsibility \nfor himself and for others.\n\n[[Page S3841]]\n\n  Imagine, briefly, if we accepted the idea that the Government should \nnot pay for national service. Incoming AmeriCorps volunteers would be \nasked if they or their parents can afford to pay for a year's worth of \nfood, clothes, and housing. Peace Corps volunteers would need enough \nmoney to spend a year abroad with no source of income. Our communities \nwould not be served. And America's schools of democracy would be closed \nto all but the wealthiest Americans.\n  I do not want to live in a country where willing volunteers are \ndenied the opportunity to serve because it is unaffordable.\n  The Serve America Act reflects the belief that we should encourage \nall our citizens to serve. We should give them more opportunities to be \nactive citizens. Because a nation of volunteers does not just have \nbetter social services--it has a better citizenry and a stronger \ndemocracy.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the Serve America \nAct.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I am pleased that the Serve America bill \nwas considered through the regular legislative process. We held a \nhearing and a markup in the HELP Committee and reported it to the \nfloor. Amendments have been offered, debated and dealt with, and we are \nabout to vote to pass the bill. Although we have had to work faster \nthan most of us would have preferred, it has been a bipartisan process \nevery step of the way. While this is not a perfect bill, it is a better \nbill because we have followed regular order. The result is good policy \nwith bipartisan support.\n  We have finally taken a hard look at the laws surrounding national \nservice, and made necessary changes to improve accountability, reduce \nbureaucracy, and ensure that we get maximum return on the investment \nwe're making. The bill includes key Republican concepts such as \neliminating waste, and addressing serious concerns about the management \nand operations of the AmeriCorps programs. It strengthens the oversight \nand fiscal accountability of these Federal programs, while it expands \naccessibility and streamlines bureaucracy, which is particularly \ncritical for smaller and rural programs.\n  The role of the chief financial officer and the inspector general at \nthe Corporation for National and Community Service are strengthened. \nAdditionally, the Corporation's board of directors is required to \nreview the national service budget submission before it goes to OMB, \nand recovered misspent funds must go back to the national service \ntrust.\n  As the only accountant in the Senate I wanted to make sure that we \nprovided the Corporation with the tools it needs to be on sound \nfinancial ground as it moves forward. I believe that with the changes \nwe have made, the Corporation for National and Community Service will \nbe a better steward of the taxpayers' money, and we will see ever \nincreasing numbers of Americans serving in their communities to address \nlocally determined needs and challenges.\n  This bill is good for Wyoming because it makes programs more \nresponsive to rural needs. It reduces paperwork and administrative \nburdens through fixed price grants so that so that programs can work \nbetter for small and rural communities.\n  The impact of streamlining access to these programs will allow the \nCorporation to reach out more effectively to Native American \ncommunities and tribal governments, particularly now that it has \nbrought on board a strategic adviser for Native American Affairs. Often \nthese communities are the ones experiencing the most extreme needs for \neducation, health and workforce services. With these changes I am \nhopeful that the increased set-aside for programs serving Native \nAmerican communities will not be underutilized and used more \nefficiently.\n  During the course of this debate we have heard about the many other \nimportant changes and improvements that we have made to the national \nservice programs. I am glad that we have been able to improve the bill \neven more through the amendment process.\n  This bill represents a landmark bipartisan achievement in a time of \nfierce partisanship. By working in a bipartisan way we have limited the \nnumber of new programs and controlled increases in discretionary \nspending. We have also added accountability and performance measures at \nevery step of the way for each program. This bill will mobilize \nmillions of faith-based organizations, church groups, nonprofits, and \nindividuals to volunteer their time and energy freely to serve their \ncommunities. It does not include any mandates of any kind for \nindividuals or groups to volunteer.\n  I am pleased that this bill creates a Veterans Corps that provides \nservices so important for returning veterans and their families. The \nbill establishes an Opportunity Corps to address issues in \ndisadvantaged, low income communities, emphasizing financial literacy, \neducation and job placement assistance, which are particularly fitting \nin this time of economic uncertainty. I am very supportive of \nprovisions in this bill that build connections to the needs of our \nworkforce.\n  With Senator Mikulski I believe that we have found a way to introduce \nresponsible competition into the SeniorCorps programs. The original \nproposal around competition would have seriously disrupted the \nimportant services provided by these programs. Finding a solution was \nparticularly important in Wyoming as over 1,000 people a year \nparticipate as senior companions, foster grandparents or community \nvolunteers.\n  This is a bill that deserves our support, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to vote for it. What we have agreed upon is good policy that \nreinforces Republican principles and will benefit disadvantaged \ncommunities across the country. I am confident that the House will \nconcur with what we have done, pass the bill quickly, and send it to \nthe President for his signature.\n  As debate on this legislation comes to a close it is necessary to \nthank those who have worked long and hard on this bill. First and \nforemost I would like to thank Chairman Kennedy and Senator Hatch for \nagreeing to work together on designing the Serve America Act. It is a \nfine example of the importance of working together. I want to further \nacknowledge our friend and colleague Senator Kennedy. His is a life of \ndedication to national service and commitment to the issue of national \nservice. I am sorry that I missed him when he was here earlier this \nweek. However, I know that we all look forward to his complete recovery \nand return to the Senate.\n  I also want to thank Senator Hatch for his management and leadership \nin shepherding this bill over the past few days. He has kept us focused \non the importance of national service through his actions and \ndedication.\n  And I want to congratulate Senator Mikulski for the work she has done \nto ensure a bipartisan process and her willingness to work round the \nclock to get this bill done.\n  I would like to thank everyone on my staff who has worked tirelessly \nto get us to this point. In particular I would like to thank Frank \nMacchiarola, Greg Dean, Adam Briddell and Beth Buehlmann. I would also \nlike to thank members of Senator Kennedy's and Senator Mikulski's staff \nfor their hard work--Michael Myers, Portia Wu and Emma Vadehra, and \nMario Cardona and Ben Gruenbaum. Thank you also to Senator Hatch's \nstaff, Chris Campbell and Bryan Hickman. I also want to thank Liz King \nand Kristin Romero, the excellent legislative counsels who worked many \nlong hours to carefully draft bill language. Finally, I thank all of \nthe members of the HELP Committee and their staffs for their hard work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/26/senate-section/article/S3841-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3841-S3885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            VOTE EXPLANATION\n\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I would like to state my position on four \nvotes I missed in the Senate on March 23 to 25, 2009.\n  I was unable to vote due to being in Gillette, WY, during blizzard \nconditions.\n  If in attendance, I would have voted as follows: March 23, 2009--\n``yea'' on vote 108, motion to invoke cloture on the motion to proceed \nto H.R. 1388; and March 25, 2009--``yea'' on vote 109, confirmation of \nDavid S. Kris, of Maryland, to be Assistant Attorney General; ``yea'' \non vote 110, motion to waive Congressional Budget Act on the Crapo \namendment No. 688; and ``nay'' on vote 111, motion to table Ensign \namendment No. 715.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Madam President, today the Senate has taken a \nsignificant step toward engaging many more\n\n[[Page S3842]]\n\nAmericans in national and community service. Imagine how much stronger \nAmerica will be if millions more people of all ages answer this \nlegislation's--and our President's--call to serve.\n  The challenges facing the Nation are among the most serious in our \nhistory. Our families, our businesses, and our communities are \nsuffering from unparalleled economic challenges. Jobs are disappearing. \nHomes are being foreclosed. Debts are soaring. Our health care system \nis in crisis. Our schools are in trouble. State and local budgets are \nbeing forced to make severe cutbacks.\n  Each of these challenges is daunting, but all of them can be met more \neffectively if we devote ourselves to the task together. We must \novercome the illusion that America's problems are the responsibilities \nof others to solve.\n  Fortunately, there are signs of hope. The excitement generated on \nboth sides of the aisle by last year's Presidential campaign showed \nthat Americans young and old want to be more involved in the world in \nwhich they live. President Obama's call to service has inspired new \ninterest in doing so. And if there is any silver lining to the economic \ncrisis, it is the fact that the crisis, for all its harsh effects, has \nalso strengthened Americans' desire to do their part.\n  The greed and selfishness displayed on Wall Street in recent weeks is \nnot America. This desire to help is America.\n  Applications to City Year are up 180 percent. Teach for America \nreceived 35,000 applications for just 4,000 positions. Online \nAmeriCorps applications--which don't represent all AmeriCorps \napplications--are three to four times what they were last year.\n  As they always do, the American people are stepping up just when we \nneed them most, and this legislation will help them do even more.\n  For the past year, there has been little to agree on in Washington. \nLast year's political campaigns led to partisan bickering in Congress \nand beyond. But throughout the year, Senator Hatch felt it was \nessential to work on this legislation. We heard from Americans old and \nyoung. We received ideas from across the ideological spectrum. It \nwasn't easy, but we were able to reach agreement on the need to make \nroom for more full-time volunteers to give a year of service, and to \nhelp small organizations use more part-time volunteers who are the \nlifeblood of the service army.\n  I know some of my colleagues are concerned about any increase in \nspending because of the growing budget deficits. But at a time when all \nour communities are struggling, this bill is a responsible investment \nthat will pay itself back many times over--in service, in volunteer \nhours, in private and local investments. The cornerstone of our success \nas a Nation has always been the drive of the American people. Their \ningenuity in mastering any challenge; their compassion for those around \nthem; their strength to see us through the hard times. This bill relies \non all of these qualities.\n  The Serve America Act is fundamentally about strengthening our \nfuture, but it draws on lessons from the past. In the past two decades, \nwe have learned a great deal about the power of service. We have \nlearned that it can make a dramatic difference in meeting complex \nchallenges--from improving our schools to conserving our precious \nnatural resources. We have learned that it contributes both to the \ncommunities in which individuals serve and to the individuals \nthemselves. We have learned that even skilled professionals with \nestablished careers and retiring senior citizens with a lifetime of \nexperience are eager to dedicate their skills to giving back to others. \nThey are more than willing to take their skills and their experience \nand turn them into something useful for our country.\n  Most of all, we have learned that Americans want to serve and that \nall we have to do is ask.\n  Our bill draws on these lessons to establish the next generation of \nservice. It increases the number of AmeriCorps members from the current \nlevel of 75,000 to 250,000 over the next 8 years. We know the demand \nexists among participants and organizations, and we need to make this \ninvestment to increase the supply of opportunities. The bill will also \nfocus existing AmeriCorps programs on areas which its members are best \nequipped to handle, so we can measure the impact these members are \nhaving.\n  An Education Corps will serve disadvantaged youth through tutoring, \nmentoring, and connecting schools and parents. A Clean Energy Corps \nwill weatherize homes to increase energy efficiency, teach the Nation's \nyouth about energy use, and serve in our national parks. A Healthy \nFutures Corps will give low-income Americans greater access to health \ncare and improve their health literacy.\n  As the cost of college has skyrocketed, the Eli Segal Educational \nAward has remained stagnant for 16 years, at $4,725. Our bill will \nfinally change that by increasing the award to the same as the maximum \nPell grant, $5,350, and link it to that grant in the future to ensure \nthat it never becomes stagnant again.\n  For younger Americans, the legislation expands the existing Learn and \nServe program, which supports service-learning activities for students \nthat place them on a path to a lifetime of service. Learn and Serve was \none of the most important experiments we have undertaken in service in \nthe past, and it is still an important investment. Last year, 1.1 \nmillion students served through Learn and Serve. This legislation will \ndo more, creating Summer of Service positions for middle and high \nschool students, in return for an education award that will remind them \nof their own ability to go to college. It will also create Youth \nEngagement Zones to bring more service-learning to low-income \ncommunities with high dropout rates, so that more students will stay in \nschool.\n  As we focus on the very young through Learn and Serve, and on our \nyouth through AmeriCorps, the next generation of service must do more \nfor adults as well. The largest generation in American history--the \nbaby boom generation--is retiring, with the energy and desire to do \nmore for their communities and more for the Nation. This legislation \nwill draw on that desire and on their skills and experience, and direct \nthem to the nonprofit sector through Encore Fellowships to help them \nmake the transition into long term public service.\n  Further, since the AmeriCorps education award is not a realistic \nincentive for adults who have completed their education, the bill makes \nthe award transferable to a child or a grandchild. With the cost of \ncollege rising, and the award finally increasing, this provision will \nmake a major difference to these families.\n  In addition, the bill expands and updates the three existing Senior \nCorps programs--RSVP, Senior Companions, and Foster Grandparents. These \nprograms have been successful for decades, and will continue to be the \nbackbone for service by persons who are 55 or older.\n  The bill also creates a social innovation fund, to invest in outcome-\nfocused, effective nonprofit organizations. We should never \nunderestimate the power of a committed young person with a good idea. \nSocial entrepreneurs like those who started City Year, Citizen Schools, \nand YouthBuild are doing remarkable work, and we should help them \nexpand. It is our role to do so.\n  To help organizations manage the influx of new volunteers and provide \na better experience for occasional volunteers, the legislation creates \na Volunteer Generation Fund to improve volunteer management and \nincrease capacity in organizations that rely on volunteers.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes and focuses the Volunteers for \nProsperity program created under President Bush in 2003. For decades, \nthe Peace Corps has been demonstrating the potential of international \nvolunteering for solving practical problems and developing the human \nties that are the building blocks of diplomacy. Volunteers for \nProsperity offers opportunities for skilled professionals to engage in \nshort-term international service in developing countries to address \nspecific areas of need, from clean water to girls' education.\n  Much of this bill--and much of what we know about service more \nbroadly--draws on the lessons we have learned from leaders in \nMassachusetts. City Year began in Boston. Its volunteers show us that \nthey can focus on a specific problem, such as the dropout rate in our \nschools, and make a real difference.\n\n[[Page S3843]]\n\n  Last year, almost 2,200 AmeriCorps members served in Massachusetts, \nin schools, communities, and health centers. This legislation will \ntriple their numbers. It will also support the work of the \nMassachusetts Service Alliance, which has been an effective leader in \ncoordinating service opportunities across our State.\n  Service is a cause with champions too numerous to count in Congress \nand beyond. Invoking the power of service isn't a partisan issue. It is \na way to help our country in the current crisis. Leaders on both sides \nof the aisle agree that part of solving our greatest challenges is to \nrely on the strength, ingenuity, and compassion of our people to serve \ntheir fellow Americans. Nineteen years ago, the original National and \nCommunity Service Act was a bipartisan bill, and so is this one.\n  I commend all of those who have worked on this legislation. We all \nowe our colleague Senator Mikulski immense gratitude for steering this \nbill across the finish line.\n  Senator Enzi, as always, has been an amazing partner. His input made \nthe bill stronger, and it made the Corporation for National and \nCommunity Service stronger as well, and better able to carry out the \nnew responsibilities we are placing on it.\n  We also owe an immense debt to Senator Hatch, whose idea this \nlegislation was. I know when we work together, our friends on both \nsides of the aisle get suspicious, but as always, we came up with a \nbipartisan product the Senate can be proud of, and we made it stronger \nby working through our disagreements.\n  I particularly commend President Obama as well. From his own \nexperiences over the years, he knows the power of service both to the \nindividual and to the community. He has made clear that his own path in \nlife has been shaped by his early service, and for that we can all be \ngrateful.\n  There are also many staff members who made this legislation possible. \nSenator Hatch's staff--Chris Campbell, Bryan Hickman, and Jace \nJohnson--has been invaluable. On Senator Enzi's staff, I particularly \nthank Beth Buehlmann, Adam Briddell, and Frank Macchiarola. On Senator \nMikulski's staff, Julia Frifield, Ben Gruenbaum, and Mario Cardona have \nworked hard to bring this legislation to the Senate and get it through.\n  I also thank Senate Legislative Counsel Liz King, Kristin Romero, and \nAmy Gaynor, and for his technical assistance, the Corporation's General \nCounsel, Frank Trinity.\n  Finally, I thank the members of my staff who worked so long and hard \nand well on this legislation--Sarah Whitton, Thomas Showalter, Brian \nCarter, Christine Leonard, Charlotte Burrows, Janice Kaguyutan, Melissa \nWagoner, Jay McCarthy, Portia Wu and Michael Myers. Most of all, I \nthank Emma Vadehra, my senior education counsel, who has worked \nskillfully and tirelessly on this bill since the beginning. Her \nleadership was indispensable in bringing us to this successful \nconclusion.\n  Now the real work begins: to implement this new vision of service and \nmake it as effective as it can be in the years ahead.\n  It has been 16 long years since Congress last looked fully at these \nprograms. More and more of us believe that the time has come to do much \nmore. And now we will. President Kennedy's call to service still echoes \ntoday, and I am proud we have renewed that call for our day and \ngeneration by passing this important legislation.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maryland for the \nwonderful leadership she has provided on this bill for and on behalf of \nthe majority and, I think, all of us. She is a terrific Senator and \nsomebody for whom I have a great deal of respect. It has been a \nprivilege to stand side by side with her and her staff and work \ntogether on this monumental piece of legislation. This is landmark \nlegislation, and it will make a real difference in all of our lives.\n  As we close out this debate, I can't help but think about the road \nthat has led us here. I know that I have said that this bill is 2 years \nin the making, but, given the work that many of our colleagues have \ndone in national service, it is probably been longer than that. I am \nproud to have played a role in this effort and I believe that, with \nthis as we close out this legislation, we are bringing something of \nreal value to the American people.\n  Once again, my interest in volunteer service began long ago when, as \na 20-year-old young man, I spent 2 full years serving as Mormon \nmissionary. That experience was, for me, a pivotal time in my life. It \naltered my world view and gave a greater understanding of people and of \nthe world around me. I have said numerous times I would not trade my \ntime as a missionary those 2 years with being a Senator. It was that \nmeaningful.\n\n  I have to say I learned a great deal from that mission--how to deal \nwith people, how to work with people, how to work with people who had \nproblems, how to consult with people, how to counsel people. I can tell \nstory after story the ways I grew in those 2 years and the respect I \nhave for my fellow human beings.\n  Other Members of this Chamber have similar stories to tell about \ntimes in their lives when they were able to set aside their own desires \nto help others in need. We heard many of those stories this week on the \nSenate floor, including Senator Mikulski's experience as a social \nworker and Senator Dodd's time in the Peace Corps. The common thread \namong all these stories is that each of us was left with a lifelong \ndesire to serve.\n  As I mentioned, Senator Kennedy and I have been working on this \nlegislation for nearly 2 years trying to find the right balance of new \nprograms and the best way to expand upon the existing national service \nsystem. I have to be honest, I consider him to be among one of my \ndearest friends. Senator Kennedy and I do not agree on much. We have \nfound ourselves on opposing sides of some of the toughest battles in \nmodern Senate history, oftentimes in fierce disagreement. But \nthroughout our time together in the Senate, we have also been able to \ncome together on a number of efforts that, in the end, have improved \nthe lives of our fellow citizens. Although there have been numerous \nlegislative efforts to bear the Kennedy-Hatch, Hatch-Kennedy label, \ndepending on who is in the majority, I have never been more pleased \nwith a bill than I am with this one. I know he feels much the same way. \nI am grateful to have had this opportunity to lock arms with the senior \nSenator from Massachusetts once again on the Serve America Act. What \nhas made this particularly wonderful for me is being able to lock arms \nwith my distinguished friend from Maryland, Senator Mikulski, Senator \nEnzi, and others who on this floor have expressed how important this \nlegislation is.\n  There has been a lot of good will on this floor this week. Most of \nthe floor speeches have been supportive, and I have appreciated this. \nAs I have been managing this bill on the floor, I have been directing \nmany of my comments toward those who are not as supportive because, \nfrom the outset, it has been my hope that whatever bill we end up \npassing receives broad, bipartisan support. I think we are going to get \nthat in the vote today--at least I hope so. But I wish to make a few \nfinal pitches anyway in case any of my colleagues are still on the \nfence.\n  This is a bill that will address many of our Nation's needs during \nthese difficult economic times, but it will do so not by growing the \nFederal bureaucracy but by powering individuals and private \norganizations to work in their communities and to recruit others to \njoin in their efforts. All the programs in this bill have been designed \nwith that purpose in mind.\n  We are not paying people to volunteer, and we are not creating new \npositions in Government employment. Over the next 8 years, the bill \nwill expand national service participation to 250,000 participants. \nThat is a significant number to be sure, but in a country of 300 \nmillion, it cannot be the measure of our efforts. What matters is what \nthese people will do as they participate in national service.\n  The participants in these programs will serve as leaders or as \nanchors for community efforts driven by faith-based and nonprofit \norganizations. They will recruit, train, and supervise the efforts of \nmillions of traditional volunteers. The model has a proven multiplying \neffect, leveraging 30 traditional volunteers for every national service \nparticipant.\n\n[[Page S3844]]\n\n  This bill will provide opportunities for people to take the lead in \nthese efforts at all stages of their lives. Everyone from the young \nadult who wants to make a difference in his or her community and \nreceive some college assistance to the baby boomers and senior citizens \nwanting to put their skills and experience to good use in all our \nneighborhoods.\n  What do these participants receive in return? They get a small living \nstipend; that is, those who are the 250,000, that puts them below the \npoverty level, and a modest educational award that will pay only some \nof the costs of higher education. These are not jobs or careers. People \ndo not go into national service because the pay is good. They do it \nbecause they have a desire to give back to their country and to their \ncommunities. With this bill, we will be giving more Americans the \nopportunity to do so.\n  I have said it many times this week, but I believe it bears \nrepeating, I believe this is a bill that every Member of the Senate can \nsupport without reservation. This is not a Democratic bill or a \nRepublican bill, but it is both. The Serve America Act speaks to the \nbest instincts and ideals of both parties. It is a landmark piece of \nlegislation and, once again, I am proud to have been part of this \neffort.\n  As we close debate on this legislation, I must express my gratitude \nto a number of people. Foremost, I wish to, once again, thank Senator \nKennedy. His leadership on this bill has been instrumental. Indeed, the \nServe America Act basically embodies everything we know about Senator \nKennedy.\n  I also thank Senator Enzi, who worked with Senator Kennedy to make \nsure that along with the new programs in the Kennedy-Hatch bill, we \nhave reauthorized and reformed the existing national service \ninfrastructure. The Corporation for National and Community Service has \nnot been authorized for over 16 years. It is high time we got around to \nit. Senator Enzi's efforts have ensured that this, too, was a \nbipartisan effort.\n  Of course, we all need to thank Senator Mikulski who has been an \nadvocate and architect for national service for more than a decade. She \nis, indeed, the godmother of national service, and she has led us \nthrough the final stages of this effort at the negotiating table, in \nthe HELP Committee, and on the Senate floor. All things considered, the \nfloor debate has gone pretty smoothly this week, and that is because of \nSenator Mikulski's tireless encouragement to keep things moving.\n  I also wish to pay tribute to the President. President Obama is \ncertainly a very brilliant man. He immediately recognized the \nimportance of this bill. I was pleased he mentioned it during his State \nof the Union Address. He did not have to mention our names, but the \nfact of the matter is he did because he knows Senator Kennedy played a \nmajor role.\n  A number of our staff members need to be mentioned as well. From my \nown staff, I thank Chris Campbell and Bryan Hickman for their work on \nthis bill. They worked a lot of late nights and early mornings on this \nlegislation. I know about this because they let me hear about it all \nthe time.\n  Senator Kennedy's staff has had to pull double and sometimes triple \nduty in this effort. I wish to single out the efforts of Emma Vadehra, \nPortia Wu, and Michael Myers--three great staffers. They have carried \nthe breadth of the Herculean load in getting this legislation \nintroduced in committee and ready for passage.\n  From Senator Enzi's staff, I need to recognize the work of Adam \nBriddell, Beth Buehlmann, Greg Dean, and Frank Macchiarola. From \nworking on the reauthorization provisions and carrying much of the load \non the floor for the Republican side, they have been indispensable.\n  Of course, Senator Mikulski's staff has been wonderful as well, \nparticularly the work of Mario Cardona and Ben Gruenbaum.\n  I wish to say, again, I am grateful to be part of this legislation, \nand I am thankful to my colleagues for their support. I know there are \nmany other staff members who deserve credit. I hope they realize what \nthey have done is very important.\n  I have a feeling we will see a pretty sizable margin in favor of \nfinal passage. I hope so. This bill is worth it. I think we can all \nwalk away feeling like we have done something good, in the most \nbipartisan way we possibly can, at a time when it is difficult to \ndevelop bipartisanship and in a time when our Nation needs it the most.\n  I thank everybody involved who has helped and even those who oppose \nthis bill. I know they have done so out of sincerity. I think they are \nsincerely wrong but, nevertheless, I respect them for their particular \nviewpoints.\n  This is an important body. It is the most important legislative body \nin the world today. This body has more freedoms in it than any other \nbody in the world. Even the filibuster rule, which many decry, is a \nrule for freedom. It protects the minority. We all know when we were in \nthe majority on the Republican side, it was a great protection to \nDemocrats so they could not get run over on everything we wanted to do. \nAnd it protects us as Republicans so we cannot get run over on \neverything the Democrats want to do. Even though sometimes people say: \nWhy do you have all these problems, stopping all these things, \nsometimes it is good to stop things. Sometimes it is good to stop bad \nstuff. Sometimes it is just good to see real debate on the floor of the \nSenate.\n  In that regard, with this bill, we have had real debate. I think they \nhave been fruitful, they have been helpful, and they have been honest. \nI thank everybody concerned. I hope that when we vote at approximately \n5 o'clock tonight--is what I understand--everybody will consider voting \nfor this bill. It is worth it. It is something that will do an immense \namount of good in our society, and it is something we can all walk away \nand feel pretty good about.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \nquorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that no further \namendments be in order; that the Mikulski and others substitute \namendment, as amended, be agreed to, the motion to reconsider be laid \nupon the table; that the bill be read a third time and the vote on \npassage of the bill occur at 5 p.m. today, notwithstanding rule XII, \nparagraph 4; that the vote on passage require an affirmative 60-vote \nthreshold, and if that threshold is achieved, the motion to reconsider \nbe considered made and laid upon the table; that the Hatch title \namendment which is at the desk be considered and agreed to, the motion \nto reconsider be laid on the table; further, that the cloture motions \non the substitute amendment and the bill be withdrawn.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I now ask consent that the time until 5 \np.m. be equally divided and controlled between the leaders or their \ndesignees, that the 10 minutes prior to the vote at 5 p.m. be equally \ndivided and controlled between Senators Mikulski and Hatch or their \ndesignees, and that Senator DeMint control 5 minutes prior to the time \nspecified above.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, this will be the last vote for today and \nthis week. We are going to come back Monday. We don't know the time we \nare going to start. There is a statutory 50 hours on the budget \nresolution. I would lay on the record, Senator Conrad has had an \nextremely difficult time this week, with the burden he has trying to \nget this bill out of the committee. He is faced with a very difficult \nsituation in the State of North Dakota. They have record snow. The Red \nRiver, as I understand it, is 20 feet over crest. That is hard to \ncomprehend. As you know, it is a pretty flat area and that water will \nrun for miles. He is hopefully going to, with the help of Senator \nGregg, complete the budget out of the committee today so he can go back \nto his State. Because of that we don't know exactly what time he can \nget back. It took Senator Enzi 2 days to get out of Wyoming with the \nsnows that have been occurring there in the last 2 days.\n  We will start Monday. If Senator Conrad for some reason can't be \nhere,\n\n[[Page S3845]]\n\nwe will make sure we are able to proceed with that legislation until he \ncan return. But we do have to start using up the time on Monday.\n  I would further say that I appreciate very much Senator Conrad's \npersistence and willingness to be here. He has worked on these budgets \nfor a long time. I don't know what I would do without him. He is very \ngood.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent the order for the \ncall of the quorum be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. When I asked for the quorum to begin, I should have asked \nthe time be divided equally between both sides.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. REID. I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I ask unanimous consent the order for the quorum call \nbe rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  The Senator from Louisiana is recognized.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I thank the Chair.\n  (The remarks of Ms. Landrieu pertaining to the introduction of S. 727 \nare located in today's Record under ``Statements on Introduced Bills \nand Joint Resolutions.'')\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Ms. Klobuchar.) Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n\n                             Midwest Floods\n\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. Madam President, I thought I would take a minute while \nI was on the floor to speak about a subject you are well aware of, \nbecause in North Dakota and Minnesota, people are struggling right now \nand have been now for several days. There is a lot of fear that is \ngripping the community, and I wanted to come and show solidarity to the \ndelegation that represents this area.\n  This picture was quite gripping in the paper this morning and brought \nback horrible memories of what we in Louisiana experienced almost 4 \nyears ago, with water up to the rooftops of people's homes. The only \ndifference is that the temperature was 105 degrees in Louisiana; here \nit looks like it is 5 degrees below zero or worse. I do not know \nwhether it is worse to be sweltering from the heat or freezing from the \ncold. But, in any case, it is not pleasant at all to have your home and \neverything you own under 14 or 15 or 20 feet of water, it looks like in \nthis case. It is horrible. I wanted to come to the floor to say I hope \nthe work that the Homeland Security Committee has done over the last 2 \nyears--and particularly the work our subcommittee has put into place--\nprovides sharper tools so that when this delegation goes to work with \nthe Governors and mayors and local officials, as that work is going on \nnow with the sandbags, and the sheriffs, and the communication, the \nstrain on the communications system, about where this water is going to \ngo and how people need to evacuate and what shelters are available for \nthem, and what insurance might be available for them, they will know \nhow these communities will be rebuilt, whether they can get a $2,000 \nauthorized loan or a $50,000 loan on their home, or what their \ncommunity is entitled to by virtue of community loans, and when those \nloans have to be paid back, and whether the SBA can grant them quick \naccess.\n  I hope a lot of the work we have done will go to help this community. \nAnd it may be more rural in nature, it may not be the kind of urban \nsetting that affected literally hundreds of thousands before, but it \nstill is catastrophic and devastating to rural communities. In some \ncases, I understand it potentially could threaten a town that had not \ntoo long ago been completely destroyed or in large measure destroyed.\n  So let's hope that the system will work better. And if it does not, I \nwanted to say publicly that I am willing to continue to work through \nour subcommittee and many other subcommittees to make sure the people \nof North Dakota and Minnesota have what they need to recover in a swift \nway and to be a great help. Because, in my view, and I will conclude \nwith this, the Federal Government should never again be absent or \nanemic in situations such as this. And they were in some cases absent \nand anemic. They need to be bold and muscular and aggressive and work \nwith local governments to get this job done.\n  These are hard-working, taxpaying American citizens who deserve to \nhave their Government step up. We are not a third world nation. We are \nnot a developing nation. We are a sophisticated nation of governments \nand law, where people pay insurance, they pay their taxes. This is \nsomething beyond the wildest imagination or completely out of control, \nlike ice getting stuck in the river where the ice is--I understand \nthere may be chunks that are as big as an automobile or a truck.\n  Madam President, this is your area, and the water is backed up \nbecause of these ice packs. Again, I would just get this off my chest \ntoo. People sometimes on the other side of the aisle say: Let \nindividuals find their own way. Well, there are times when individuals, \neven collectively, are not strong enough to do what needs to be done \nand the Government needs to come in and blow up this ice and provide \nhelp for these victims of the flooding, along with the private sector, \nproperly, and the nonprofit groups.\n  So I wanted to come to the floor to speak and to say to you, Madam \nPresident, if I or my office can be of any assistance to you, please \nlet me know.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Kaufman). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI. Mr. President, I am excited that we are wrapping up \nthis historic legislation.\n  We all know that our Nation is facing many challenges. But times of \ncrisis are times of great opportunity. They are the times in which our \nNation's character is forged and in which Americans show their mettle. \nWe are a nation of believers. We believe in ourselves, and we believe \nin our country's ability.\n  And at such a time of national need, we here in the Congress also \nknow how to come together.\n  This bill is the result of extensive bipartisan work by Senators \nKennedy and Hatch who have worked for more than a year on this \nlegislation. They have lived lives that are a testament to the values \nexpressed in this legislation. Thus, it is more than just a bipartisan \nbill, it is an American bill, and exemplifies everything that is good \nabout our country.\n  It exemplifies not only their great friendship but their shared \npassion for service and for giving back and working across the aisle to \ndo get things done. This really shows the Senate acting at its best.\n  I am no stranger to National Service. In 1989 I introduced the \nNational and Community Service Act with Senators Kennedy, Nunn, and \nMcCain to establish the Commission on National and Community Service, \nto oversee and coordinate our national volunteer efforts.\n  That legislation also created a demonstration program that evolved \ninto AmeriCorps. That program provided vouchers for full and part-time \nservice, to pay for education, job training, and homeownership\n  In 1993, we took national service to the next level, by enacting the \nNational and Community Service Trust Act. We worked on that landmark \nlegislation with President Clinton. It created the framework for the \nprograms we are strengthening and expanding today.\n  National service is not just another social program. We created \nnational service as a social invention. It was\n\n[[Page S3846]]\n\ncreated to address two critical questions, a practical question and an \nidealistic one:\n  How would young people pay for their education?\n  How could we reinstall the habits of the heart that made our country \ngreat?\n  And it worked. As our economy struggles, these American habits of the \nheart are shining through. Americans across the country are also doing \ntheir best by signing up to serve their communities and their country. \nCity Year applications are up 180 percent. AmeriCorps applications are \nup as much as three to four times over last year's levels. Teach for \nAmerica received 35,000 applications for just 4,000 slots. The help \nthey get with student loans through the educational award is a real \nincentive for these young people. That worked as well.\n  This legislation will help us to harness a renewed energy for service \nto our communities and our country. It increases the number of \nAmeriCorps volunteers to 250,000 a year over 8 years, from 75,000. This \nwill provide opportunities for more Americans to serve while ensuring \nthe Corporation has time to handle the growth.\n  This bill isn't just about growth. It is about focusing AmeriCorps on \nareas of the most pressing national need, and where service can do the \nmost good. That is why we include an education corps, a health futures \ncorps, a clean energy corps, a veterans corps, and an opportunity corps \nfocusing on poverty. This is why we are focusing our service efforts.\n  If we are going to do more in service we need to be sure it is done \nright. That is why this bill contains many vital accountability \nmeasures, to measure outcomes for specific service grantees and \noutcomes for the Corporation itself. And for this we can truly thank \nour colleague, Senator Enzi, the Ranking Member of the HELP Committee \nand a vital partner in this bill. He has once again brought his very \nsound accounting skills to the table, and we came up with a way to, \nagain, ensure value for the taxpayer, value for the community.\n  One of the things that is so exciting about this bill is what it does \nto encourage service among young people. We all know that our future \nlies with the next generation, with America's youth. And we know that \nyoung people who learn to serve take those lessons with them for a \nlifetime. I look at my colleagues--Senator Hatch, Senator Dodd, and \nSenator Rockefeller. Many of them had important service experiences \nwhen they were young that encouraged them to embark on a career of \npublic service. Indeed, working on this bill has reminded me of many \nthings that I did in my own life.\n  When I started my career as a social worker, I wasn't just working in \nthe jobs that paid. I was volunteering with nuns to help women get \ntheir lives back on track after getting out of prison. I was working \nwith foster children and children with special needs--our most \nvulnerable population--to help them get the services and the care they \nneeded. I was a trainer at the very first VISTA training center in \nBaltimore, making sure that those VISTA members weren't just working to \nbuild President Johnson's ``Great Society,'' but that they were doing \ngreat work in their communities.\n  I didn't do all of this because anyone asked me to, I did it because \nnobody asked me to. I saw the compelling human need, and I used my \nskills as a community organizer to do the best I could in my \nneighborhood, and my hometown of Baltimore. It led to me fighting to \nstop a highway, which led to the city council in Baltimore, then to the \nHouse of Representatives and, now, to the floor of the U.S. Senate. I \ndidn't know that I would be here when I started my career, but I know \nthat what I did in those early years as a social worker, and volunteer \nhas impacted everything that I've done since.\n  These experiences that we have when we are young truly shape the \nhabits of a lifetime. That is why it is so important that this \nlegislation makes key investments in our Nation's young people.\n  The bill will increase service-learning opportunities for students. \nWorking with Senator Dodd, who has been such a leader on these issues, \nwe create ``summer of service'' opportunities for middle and high \nschool students. In return for spending the summer doing service, \nstudents will receive an educational award--which will not only help \nthem pay for college, but will send them a signal that college is \nwithin reach. It will also create ``youth engagement zones,'' which \nprovide for coordinated community-wide service learning programs in \nareas with high dropout rates. Both of these programs provide students \nwith meaningful service experiences and put them on a path to a \nlifetime of service.\n  College is where so much of our young people's character and \nexperiences are shaped, and our colleges must do a good job instilling \nthe virtues of service. This bill recognizes those that are going the \nextra mile by allowing for the designation of 25 ``Campuses of \nService'' across the country, schools which are undertaking activities \nto help their students engage in service, service-learning, and go on \nto public service careers.\n  As I mentioned, this bill will also help students pay for college and \ndecrease student debt for those who serve in AmeriCorps. This was \nsomething we thought about very carefully when we created this program. \nAnd with college costs rising, it is more important than ever that we \nreaffirm this commitment. Across AmeriCorps, it will increase the Eli \nSegal Education Award to $5,350 for the first time since its creation. \nWe also pegged the award to the Pell grant, to ensure it does not get \nstuck once again in the future.\n  This bill also recognizes we must to do more to appreciate what older \nAmericans have to give back and more to ask them to do them. The \nlargest generation in American history is retiring, but in many cases \nthey have more to give. Recent surveys show that many older Americans \nare interested in continuing to do more to help the greater good, and a \nfull 58 percent of the first wave of baby boomers reported that they \nwould consider entering ``encore'' careers in service.\n  To help them help us, this bill makes AmeriCorps work better for \nadults. It allows adults over the age of 55 to transfer their \neducational award to a child or grandchild, to help such a young person \ngo to college. This keeps the tie between service and educational \nbenefit, but makes it work better for adults.\n  The legislation also creates encore fellowships to help adults \ntransition to longer-term public service. This is a way to bring in \npeople who have retired and who have incredible skills, such as that \nretired accountant who can help a nonprofit get its books together and \nmaybe find new grant opportunities.\n  Finally, the bill updates and expands the Senior Corps programs, \nRSVP, Senior Companions, and Foster Grandparents. These programs have \nbeen providing opportunities for seniors across the country for \ndecades, and this bill will ensure they continue to do so.\n  Some of the most important work this bill does is around supporting \nsocial innovation. We don't know ahead of time what these will be, but \nevery generation comes up with a social invention that shapes our \nnation for years to come.\n  Often, these ideas come from a young social entrepreneur who has the \ncourage to think they have a new way to solve a tough problem--and \nthey're right. From Teach for America to the Community Health Corps to \nNew Song Urban Ministries' Youth Mentoring Program in Baltimore, they \nhave so much to teach us.\n  The Social Innovation Fund in this bill will do just that, by \ncreating public-private funds to support the expansion of effective, \noutcomes-based nonprofits that are meeting real needs.\n  One of the things that is truly a hallmark of the American character \nis our willingness to help each other. There is an overwhelming \nmajority of Americans that donate a few hours of their time each week \nto do just that. Particularly in this time of need, we must continue to \nfocus on these part-time volunteers. To help organizations better \nrecruit and manage these volunteers, this legislation creates a \nVolunteer Generation Fund to improve volunteer management and increase \ncapacity at small organizations that rely on volunteers.\n  From part-time volunteers to full-time volunteers, from students to \nretirees, this bill will help every American at every stage of life \ngive back.\n  By doing so, it will draw on some of our best attributes as a \nnation--our strength, our compassion, our ingenuity--to address the \nchallenges we are\n\n[[Page S3847]]\n\nfacing. We all agree there is nothing about our country's current \nsituation that is easy. But there are some easy steps on the path to \ngetting back on our feet. This legislation is one such step.\n  In a very short time, we will vote on final passage of the Serve \nAmerica Act. This is going to be a great day for the Senate and a great \nday for people everywhere who wish to give back to their country. The \ncontent of the bill is outstanding. The way the process has worked has \nbeen amazing. What is so wonderful about this bill is, it showed that \nthe Congress and the Senate can work together. We can check our party \nhats at the door and then concentrate on what we need to do to help the \nAmerican people.\n  This legislation passed in the House. In the Senate, we have been \ndeliberating on it this week. This bill is the result of extensive \nbipartisan work by Senators Kennedy and Hatch who have worked for more \nthan a year on the legislation. They, too, have devoted their lives to \nservice. Senator Kennedy's role is well known. For more than 40 years, \nhis steadfast commitment to the Peace Corps, to the VISTA volunteers, \nto being a founding father of AmeriCorps, he has been there every \nsingle time benchmark legislation has passed that has led to the \nopportunity for greater service.\n  Senator Hatch brings his wonderful background, his Mormon commitment \nto service, where he himself went on a service mission and to know how \nit would change their lives. They have brought extensive work on the \nbill, and they brought a lifetime of experience.\n  I am no stranger to national service because in 1989, I introduced \nthe National Community Service Act with Senators Kennedy, Nunn and \nMcCain to establish a commission and a demonstration project to look at \nnational service. We actually wanted to test out ideas.\n  Then, in 1993, working with President Clinton, we took national \nservice to the next level by enacting the National and Community \nService Trust Act. We worked on that landmark legislation with \nPresident Clinton. It created the framework for the programs we are \nstrengthening and expanding today.\n  When we did this in 1993, we did not want national service to be just \nanother social program. We wanted to see this as a social invention \nthat would spark a social movement. At that time in the 1990s, everyone \nwas worried about the me generation, where young people were forgetting \nthe legacy of what this country is, the habits of the heart, of \nneighbor helping neighbor. We wanted to stimulate a movement from the \nme generation to the we generation. At the same time we faced the hard \nreality that access to the American dream, particularly higher \neducation, was slipping away from many young people.\n  It worked. We found that the framework for AmeriCorps and other \nimportant programs that are in the Corporation for National Service did \ngenerate exactly what we wanted. Thousands and thousands of people \nstepped forward to volunteer, people of all ages, young people and not \nso young people, in AmeriCorps, the foster grandparent corps, the RSVP, \nand Senior Companions Programs. It absolutely changed their lives.\n  What is it that we see now? What we see now, as we come into the new \ncentury, those habits of the heart continue to burn brightly among our \npopulation. We are seeing that as the economy struggles, the American \nhabits of the heart are shining through.\n  All across America, people want to volunteer, if they have the \nopportunity to do so. City Year applications are up 180 percent. Teach \nfor America has received 35,000 applicants for 4,000 slots. AmeriCorps \napplications are three or four times last year's level. That is not \nbecause they don't have a job and they see AmeriCorps or Teach for \nAmerica as a substitute for a job. They see it as a calling. They see \nit as an opportunity to take all this talent and put it to work for our \nsociety.\n  We are going to do that. This legislation helps us to harness a \nrenewed energy for service to our communities and our country. It \nincreases the number of AmeriCorps volunteers to 250,000 volunteers a \nyear. But we do it in a well paced way and also in an affordable way. \nIt increases the number of AmeriCorps volunteers to 250,000 a year over \n8 years. We will get the job done. It will provide opportunities for \nmore Americans to serve while we ensure that the corporation has time \nto handle the growth.\n  Also, we wanted to reform, reinvigorate, and refocus AmeriCorps. In \nAmeriCorps now we are refocusing it on the areas of the most pressing \nnational need and where service can do the most good. That is why we \nhave included the permissible use of establishing an education corps to \nwork at improving school outcomes for young people, more literacy, more \nmath skills, better attendance. We also have a healthy futures corps \nwhich will work to make sure people who are eligible for benefits can \nget them but also to go into schools to be able to help develop those \nnew healthy habits that will last over a lifetime. We have a clean \nenergy corps that will work on weatherization and helping clean our \nparks and neighborhoods. We have an opportunity corps to focus on \npoverty, and a veterans corps to help those families where men and \nwomen are deployed. That is why we are focusing our service efforts.\n  This bill also includes many accountability measures to ensure to not \nonly measure outcomes but to ensure fiscal stewardship. I thank Senator \nEnzi, the ranking member of the HELP Committee, a vital partner on this \nbill. He brought his very sound accounting skills to the table. Working \ntogether, we found a way to ensure value for the taxpayer and value for \nthe community. That is what I mean about working together, taking the \ntime to listen to one another, to recognize there is not only talent \nout there in the community, there is talent right here in the Senate.\n  If we take the time to listen to one another and the ideas we have, \nsort them through, pay attention to one another, talk with one \nanother--first of all, talk with one another, and do it in a civil way, \nwow, we can really do some very special things. That is what we did in \nthis bill.\n  We know our future lies with the next generation. We know young \npeople who learn to serve take those lessons with them for a lifetime. \nMy colleagues Hatch, Dodd, and Rockefeller did a year of service. My \nown work as a social worker had a profound impact on me. My work as a \nfoster care worker and a child abuse worker will stay with me all of my \nlife, when I think about vulnerable populations and what we need to do. \nThe work I was able to do in my own community, working with women who \nwere in jail, who had no programs to assist them when they came out, to \nthe work in the church I belonged to in the African American community, \nwhere they did not have access to credit except to the gougers and \nscammers and schemers, to work to establish a credit union. And then, \nof course, as a grassroots volunteer, I helped fight a highway that \nsaved neighborhoods in Baltimore and took me into politics.\n  In our country, sometimes those of us who are active in those \nactivities raise the dickens, or in dissent, end up in jail. I ended up \nin the city council, the House of Representatives, and the Senate. I \nturned my protest signs into amendment and legislative signs. This is \nwhat we see today.\n  Habits last a long time. When we look at what is happening in the \nhealthy futures corps where young people are already working in their \ncommunity health centers and so on, when they finish their year of \nservice, many of them are going into health careers. They go into \nmedicine, nursing, allied health, or in the great area of public \nhealth. Eighty five percent of the people who volunteer in this area \nwant to go into some kind of career that produces improvements in \nhealth outcomes. So this is what AmeriCorps is all about.\n  When I worked in the community, I didn't do this because somebody \nasked me. I did it because it needed to be done. It is not only about \nwhat I did as a young volunteer. It is about what young volunteers are \ndoing now. Sure, President Obama is inviting them to participate. But a \nlot of young people out there see compelling human need, and they want \nto make a difference. These experiences are going to shape them for a \nlifetime. We cannot minimize the impact this will have on communities. \nIn its decade and a half of existence, AmeriCorps has already changed \nlives and communities.\n\n[[Page S3848]]\n\n  When we talk to people where our young people have volunteered in \npublic schools, we know that attendance went up, behavioral problems \nwent down, motivation increased. Working with those volunteers, they \neven took the time to look at what were the opportunities for \nscholarships and loans and grants that they could go on to higher \neducation.\n  They make a difference.\n  When we take a look at what they were able to do working in response \nto disaster assistance, weren't we proud of what our volunteers were \nable to do--working side-by-side-down there dealing with Katrina where \nthey helped New Orleans dig out? But not only dig out, they dug in to \nhelp Louisiana and New Orleans move to a better future. Those \nAmeriCorps young men and women helped clean up after the debris, clean \nup after the terrible hurricane that hit. They are working with Habitat \nfor Humanity to build housing or to repair housing and also working \nside-by-side with public school leadership to create a new New Orleans \npublic school system.\n  This is fantastic. Every community that has been hard hit in many \nways enjoys the benefits of these programs. There were other programs \nwe were able to do. One of the things we are especially pleased with \nwas that we were able to increase the education award named after its \nfirst founder, Eli Segal, and increased it to $5,300. There are other \nprograms in here.\n  When we talk about programs, it sounds so bloodless, so ``there they \ngo again.'' But that is right; here we go again. We are creating an \nopportunity ladder for people to be able to participate in our society. \nThere is no other country in the world that does this. I am not just \ntalking about bragging rights for the United States, but it is a lesson \nlearned that in our society, we have a public sector and a private \nsector. But we have a vibrant sector that is really in the nonprofit \nfield where people can get involved and get engaged. It is what we call \nthe intermediary institutions. It is what de Tocqueville called the \nhabits of the heart. It is what sociologists called the little platoons \nof neighbor helping neighbor. It is what George Bush the elder called \nthe Thousand Points of Light. But whatever you call it, it is called \nserving America.\n  Shortly, we will be voting on this bill. I think we have done a very \ngood job. We have created opportunity. We have done it in a way that is \naffordable. We have built-in, sound accountability measures, and we \nhave governed on a truly bipartisan basis.\n\n  I thank Senator Kennedy and Senator Hatch for being the lead \narchitects on this bill. I also thank Senator Enzi and Senator Dodd for \ntheir very important contributions in improving this bill.\n  I thank all of the staff who have participated in this effort: from \nSenator Hatch's staff, Chris Campbell, Bryan Hickman, and Jace Johnson; \nfrom Senator Kennedy's staff, Christine Leonard, Charlotte Burrows, \nJanice Kaguyutan, Portia Wu, Michael Myers, and Emma Vadehra; from \nSenator Enzi's staff, Beth Buehlmann, Adam Briddell, Frank Macchiarola, \nand Greg Dean; from my own staff, Julia Frifield, Ben Gruenbaum, and \nMario Cardona. And the Corporation's general counsel was available to \nus all the time through Frank Trinity.\n  So I thank the staff who put in so many hours in helping design the \nbill but also working with other Senators to get the best ideas and the \nbest thinking on how we could get the bill done, but to do it in a way \nthat has accountability and outcome measurements.\n  But also, when the American people hear about what we have done this \nweek, it is such an antidote to last week, when we were talking about \nAIG and bonuses and ``ain't I greedy,'' and all of those things. What \nwe are talking about here today is about the very best of the American \npeople and how we can draw upon it, and also the very best of the \nSenate. We do govern best when we work together.\n  So today we were not a red State, we were not a blue State, we were \nthe United States of America States, and we will be ready to vote on \nit.\n  Mr. President, at the appropriate time--or even now--I urge passage \nof this bill.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, Senators are trying to catch planes, so I \nam just going to say this much: Thanks. Thanks to those who vote for \nthis. Thanks to this wonderful Senator from Maryland, without whom we \ncould not be this far along. Thanks to Senator Kennedy, Senator Enzi. \nThere are so many people whom I would like to thank, and all the \nstaffers who have worked so hard.\n  This is going to be a very monumental, landmark bill that should \nreally help this country and help people to get in the mood of being \nvolunteers. I am very pleased we have come this far.\n  Thank you, Mr. President. I yield the floor, and I hope we can go to \na vote.\n\n\n                     Amendment No. 687, as Amended\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Under the previous order, amendment No. 687, \nas amended, is agreed to, and the motion to reconsider is considered \nmade and laid upon the table.\n  The question is on the engrossment of the amendment, as amended, and \nthird reading of the bill.\n  The amendment, as amended, was ordered to be engrossed and the bill \nto be read a third time.\n  The bill was read the third time.\n  Ms. MIKULSKI.

SENSE OF THE SENATE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--The Senate finds the following:\n       (1) President John F. Kennedy said, ``The raising of \n     extraordinarily large sums of money, given voluntarily and \n     freely by millions of our fellow Americans, is a unique \n     American tradition . . . Philanthropy, charity, giving \n     voluntarily and freely . . . call it what you like, but it is \n     truly a jewel of an American tradition''.\n       (2) Americans gave more than $300,000,000,000 to charitable \n     causes in 2007, an amount equal to roughly 2 percent of the \n     gross domestic product.\n       (3) The vast majority of those donations, roughly 75 \n     percent or $229,000,000,000, came from individuals.\n       (4) Studies have shown that Americans give far more to \n     charity than the people of any other industrialized nation--\n     more than twice as much, measured as a share of gross \n     domestic product, than the citizens of Great Britain, and 10 \n     times more than the citizens of France.\n       (5) 7 out of 10 American households donate to charities to \n     support a wide range of religious, educational, cultural, \n     health care, and environmental goals.\n       (6) These charities provide innumerable valuable public \n     services to society's most vulnerable citizens during \n     difficult economic times.\n       (7) Congress has provided incentives through the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage charitable giving by \n     allowing individuals to deduct contributions made to tax-\n     exempt charities.\n       (8) 41,000,000 American households, constituting 86 percent \n     of taxpayers who itemize deductions, took advantage of this \n     deduction to give to the charities of their choice.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should preserve the income tax deduction for \n     charitable contributions through the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 and look for additional ways to encourage charitable \n     giving.\n         Amend the title so as to read: ``Entitled The Edward M. \n     Kennedy Serve America Act, an Act to reauthorize and reform \n     the national service laws''.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The motion to reconsider is considered made \nand laid upon the table.\n\n\n                           Amendment No. 729\n\n  The clerk will report the amendment to the title.\n  The legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The Senator from Utah [Mr. Hatch] proposes an amendment \n     numbered 729.\n\n  The amendment is as follows:\n\n                     (Purpose: To amend the title)\n\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``Entitled The Edward M. \n     Kennedy Serve America Act, an Act to reauthorize and reform \n     the national service laws.''\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the amendment is agreed to.\n\n\n                             change of vote\n\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, on rollcall vote No. 115, I voted ``nay.'' \nIt was\n\n[[Page S3885]]\n\nmy intention to vote ``yea.'' I ask unanimous consent that I be \npermitted to change my vote, which will not affect the outcome.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  (The foregoing tally has been changed to reflect the above order.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Utah is recognized.\n  Mr. HATCH. Mr. President, it is a great honor that we have been able \nto add the name of a distinguished Senator--one of the most \ndistinguished of all time--to this bill. We expect this to multiply \ninto 7 million volunteers. To call it the Edward M. Kennedy bill is a \ngreat honor for all of us, even for those who voted against it. It was \nan overwhelming vote under the circumstances. There were a lot of \nsincere people on both sides. I am very happy we could name this after \nour friend and colleague whom we have served with all these years, who \nhas made such a great difference.\n  What is great about it is the whole Kennedy family has been a service \nfamily. I look at Ted's sister Eunice and what a whirlwind of great \nachievement and giving she has been all these years. I am sure she is \nvery proud of her brother this evening. I am very pleased we could do \nthis, and I am very grateful to all our colleagues for having \nparticipated in this.\n  It is an honor for all of us to honor our friend, Senator Edward M. \nKennedy.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Brown). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/26/senate-section/article/S3885-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3885-S3886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               THE BUDGET\n\n  Ms. STABENOW. Mr. President, I have just come from an all-day session \nwith the Budget Committee. I am very pleased that we have voted it out \nto the floor, and we will be taking up next week President Obama's \nbudget, his priorities. Certainly the chairman of the committee, \nSenator Conrad, gets tremendous credit for his hard work, as usual, and \nhis expertise, and his staff's expertise as well.\n  Particularly, on a personal level, since it is such a difficult time \nfor those Senator Conrad loves in North Dakota, we know his heart and \nmind has been there, as well as shepherding this budget through. We \nappreciate his diligence in this very challenging time.\n  What was clear from the budget debate not only in the committee \nyesterday and today but in the comments that have gone on in the last \ncouple of weeks from Republican colleagues is that they have dusted off \na 15-year-old set of arguments about the budget, which is in front of \nus. You could use the headline: GOP Dusts off, Reuses 15-year-old \nMessage of ``No.''\n  We have heard no on equal pay and from too many people around here on \nhealth care and on protecting public lands. The issues go on and on--\nwhether it has been slow walking, filibustering, or just plain saying \nno.\n  So when we look at what is happening, I think it is important to put \nit into context. This year, 2009, we saw multiple headlines. One was: \n``GOP Warns About Budget Hardball.''\n  We know they are going to come to the floor and play hardball on the \nbudget next week and fight us every step of the way on our priorities \nand the President's vision for education, health care, and energy \nindependence. They clearly have indicated that.\n  If you roll back the clock, this is not a new message. It is very \nmuch recycled. This was a headline in 1995: ``GOP Plan For Budget To \nTake No Prisoners.''\n  They took on President Clinton and his priorities of investing and \ncreating children's health insurance and focusing on jobs and on ways \nto bring down the deficit, which, by the way, created 22 million jobs \nin this country.\n  I can tell you coming from a State with now 12 percent unemployment, \nwe would be happy to have taken the Clinton budget and the era of \ncreating jobs. I know the Presiding Officer comes from a State also \nhard hit. When we talk about what is best for people, people in this \ncountry would love to go back to an era of creating 22 million jobs.\n  President Obama is focusing on getting us back to that point by \nmoving forward to invest in jobs, invest in the economy and what people \ncare about.\n  But all we are hearing over and over again is how we are going to \nhave a fight, it is going to be tough. One more time it is no.\n  1993: ``GOP's Politics of No.'' ``One-word vocabulary hobbles GOP.'' \nSound familiar? ``Republicans grouse as Senate takes up budget bill.'' \nThis was back in June 18, 1993. At that time, we had a Democratic \nPresident putting forward priorities for the American people--not the \nwealthiest in the country but middle-class families working hard every \nday, playing by the rules, who wanted to know their country was focused \non them and their families.\n  We fast forward to today, and in the Budget Committee and on the \nfloor, what do we see? We see a Republican repeat: Same old politics, \nsame old policies that have gotten us to where we are, that have gotten \nus into this crisis.\n  The debate in the Budget Committee was very much about going back to \nthe policies that did not work, that have created such financial chaos \nand job loss in this country. Whether to move us forward, that is what \nwe are talking about, changing course, moving us forward, a different \nset of values and priorities, a different vision about what is \nimportant for America.\n  The American people have rejected the same old politics and the same \nold policies. But yet every day we see the same old politics, forcing \nus to go to 60 votes rather than working together to move legislation \nforward.\n  H.R. 1388 is a terrific bill on community service, the national \nservice bill. Rather than being able to move it forward every step of \nthe way together, there was constant effort to force cloture votes, to \nmove in a way that has slowed it down, even though we know the majority \nof people were supporting it.\n  So we see the same old politics over and over again and the same old \npolicies. When you listen to Republican colleagues over and over again, \ntheir mantra is always about tax cuts for the wealthy, we will solve \ngreat problems for everybody else. I can assure you the 11 million-plus \npeople in this country who are unemployed right now are not concerned \nabout another supply-side tax cut. They were waiting a long time, for \nthe last 8 years, for it to trickle down to them, and all that trickled \ndown to them was job loss, home loss, health care costs up, education \ncosts up, energy costs up, food costs up.\n  This budget goes in a different direction. We reject the same old \npolicies that got us where we are, that got us into this crisis.\n  Instead, we have put forward under the President's leadership a \nbudget that is investing in America's future, investing in jobs. I am \nvery proud to have led an effort in the committee to make sure we are \nfocused on manufacturing, to focus on jobs in our budget resolution. I \nknow our Presiding Officer shares my deep concern about those issues, \nand I am proud to partner with him on so many initiatives around \nmanufacturing and jobs.\n  Health care: to make sure we have put in place the ability to tackle \nhealth care costs and health care access. We are in a unique position \nin health care. It is one of those rare situations where the more \npeople are covered, the more you provide health care, you actually \nbring the cost down because you have fewer people using emergency rooms \ninappropriately, fewer people unable to go to the doctor before they \nget very ill, being able to get preventive care. This budget focuses on \nhealth care.\n  This budget focuses on energy independence. I am very proud to have \nauthored in the bill a clean energy fund. This is based on work we are \ndoing in the Energy Committee. I am so appreciative of the leadership \nand commitment of the chairman, Senator Bingaman, to work with us on \nmanufacturing and energy independence, focusing on green technologies, \nfocusing on a clean energy fund that will help us invest in those \ntechnologies and create great new manufacturing jobs. This is a part of \nthe budget, energy efficiency efforts, creating the opportunity for us \nto work\n\n[[Page S3886]]\n\ntogether to address climate change in a way that is responsible and \nallows us to focus on jobs and creating new opportunities in the green \neconomy.\n  Finally, and certainly not least, education. In terms of access to \ncollege or whether it is preschool and Head Start or whether it is \nfunding our K-12 system, it is critically important that we not forget \neducation and job training for the future. We have a lot of people who \nare going through transition today from one job to another, and job \ntraining is particularly critical.\n  In the Obama budget, we are investing in America's future: jobs, \nhealth care, energy independence, and education.\n  I am also very proud of the fact that we make a strong commitment \nagain this year. For the last 2 years, with our Democratic majority, we \nhave made veterans a priority, veterans health care a priority. It is \nso terrific to see the commitment of President Obama and his \nadministration, the commitment they put in the budget that we have \nsustained a strong commitment to keep the promise of America for our \nveterans and their families, those who have served us, are serving us \nnow, and come home and expect us to keep our promises as well.\n  There are many important values reflected in this budget, from \nfocusing on veterans, focusing on jobs, as well as addressing what \nhappens when a plant closes. I am very pleased to have put language in \nto increase money for communities, where there are closed plants, to \ncreate new opportunities for jobs and economic development.\n  There are a lot of different strategies that are represented and \nfunded in this budget.\n  Again, it all comes down to how we view America, what are our \npriorities, what are our values, whom do we represent? Do we have a \nbudget for American families? Do we have a budget for the middle class \nof this country which, by the way, gets significant tax cuts? We have \nsignificant tax cuts in this bill as well. The difference between the \ntax cuts in this budget and in budgets when our friends on the other \nside of the aisle were in the majority is these tax cuts go to the \nmiddle class. These tax cuts go to working families.\n  We also in the committee under Senator Cardin's leadership have \nincreased the dollars going to SBA, for small business, because we \nunderstand small business is an engine of this economy.\n  This budget does reflect jobs, strengthening manufacturing, support \nfor small business, addressing job training, and where we go in the new \ngreen economy around jobs and energy independence. It focuses on health \ncare. It focuses on education. We are keeping the promise that has been \nmade by this country to our veterans.\n  I am very proud of this budget. I am very proud of this President for \nsubmitting this budget to us. It is different. We will hear honest \ndisagreements about philosophy and how we stimulate the economy, \ndifferences in how we put together a budget and whether we invest in \npeople or whether we continue the ways of the past that have gotten us \nwhere we are today.\n  This budget is a change. This budget is a commitment to the American \npeople, a commitment to families, a commitment to communities, American \nbusinesses, keeping our jobs here at home. That is what this budget is \nabout. Yes, it is different. Frankly, we tried it for 8 years under the \nphilosophy and the direction that came from former President Bush and \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle, and it did not work. We \ncannot sustain having the same old politics and the same old policies \nif we are going to move America forward. We cannot sustain that any \nlonger.\n  I urge colleagues to come together on a bipartisan basis and stand \nfor the values and the people represented in this budget.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I was intending to walk through here on the \nway back to my office when I saw the sign blaming Republicans for \neverything--it blames us for the crisis, it blames us for--we keep \ntalking about bipartisanship, but that is not the way you develop \nbipartisanship.\n  We did have some bipartisan votes today in the Budget Committee. One \nof them was to have an investigation into what is happening. I bet you \nare not going to point the finger at just one party on that. I am \nbetting there is plenty of blame to go around on the situation we are \nin. Congress has contributed, as well as business, as well as \nemployees. We are going to find out the country has been on a path and \nis still on a path that is not sustainable. We maxed out our credit \ncards and that causes a lot of problems. Now we are still trying to \nfigure out how to spend more money.\n  I was disappointed that we went into a partisan speech right after \nsuch a bipartisan effort that happened in this Chamber. We passed a \nbill this afternoon that is going to provide 7 million volunteers \nacross America, that is going to make a real difference for America.\n  One of the problems I have with Washington is when something good \nlike that happens, it kind of disappears overnight; when something \nnasty happens, it is talked about forever. We have to talk more about \nbipartisanship. We have to stop blaming each other and start working \ntogether.\n  One of the ways that bill got done this afternoon is we have been \nfollowing an 80-percent rule. We know we can agree on 80 percent of the \nstuff, and we did. Actually, we went a little further than that because \nwe found some third ways in part of the other 20 percent. That made a \nbill that both sides could agree on that could get finished. There will \nbe more work to do in that area.\n  I am glad we got that done this afternoon. I hope it is not a little, \ntiny paragraph in the paper. It probably will not be because it was \nnamed after the Senator from Massachusetts, Mr. Kennedy, because he has \nbeen such a leader in this effort and worked on this bill for years and \ncertainly deserves to have the bill named after him.\n  That should not be the only reason we get publicity on something such \nas this bill. There ought to be people looking at what we achieved and \ntalking about what was achieved and talking about how, on a bipartisan \nbasis, Democrats and Republicans sat down and said: This is what we \nneed. We also said these are programs that are not working; let's \nreplace them. We did that, and we did that in a very fiscally \nresponsible way.\n  That is what can happen when both sides work together. We need to do \nmore of that. We need to do a little bit less blaming. We are not even \nclose to an election right now. So the blame game does not need to be \ndone.\n  I certainly hope we can work for some common goals. I think we have \nsome common goals. Next week, we will be talking about the budget, and \nthere are even some common things on that. But I am willing to bet what \nwe talk about on this floor will be the 20 percent we do not agree on, \nand that is the 20 percent that can ruin America.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Begich).

Mr. President, there are good examples, as Senator Enzi \ndeclared, of bipartisan work in this Senate. We have a lot of those \nexamples. I would point out, however, that a budget is a document that \ntends to favor an individual party's belief. It tends to point out \nwhere they want to take the country. It is a roadmap for the country, \nand that budget is a vehicle to achieve the goals that party has.\n  I want to say this about the budget: A budget is not just something \nan individual has to submit. The President submits one, but the numbers \ncontained in it, the directions contained in it, are the choices made. \nYou can choose to spend less, you can choose to spend more, you can \nchoose to reduce debt, you can choose to increase debt. It might be \nmore popular to spend more and run up more debt today, but it may not \nbe good for the long-term interest of America.\n  We just left the budget markup, and the Democratic majority passed \nout of the committee on a straight party-line vote--with no Republicans \nsupporting\n\n[[Page S3887]]\n\nit--what I believe is the most irresponsible budget in the history of \nour Nation. It takes our spending, as a percentage of the gross \ndomestic product, to the highest level we have had since World War II, \nwhen we were fighting for our very existence. We had been attacked at \nPearl Harbor. We were facing the Nazis and Hitler. The problems we face \nnow are not like that, but that is the level of spending we have now, \nand it is a very dangerous thing.\n  Does anybody doubt the conventional wisdom that nothing comes from \nnothing; that there is no free lunch; that somebody had to produce it; \nthat debts must be paid when incurred; and that if you borrow money, \nyou have to pay interest on it? Does anybody doubt that?\n  From the beginning of the founding of our Republic until this year, \nwe, the public, have accumulated $5 trillion in debt. That is the whole \nfounding of our country. That is what we have accumulated. Under the \nbudget that the President has submitted to Congress--in a bound volume, \ncarefully put together--in 5 years alone that $5 trillion debt will \ndouble, and in the following 5 years it will triple. So in 5 years, we \nwould add twice as much debt--according to the President's own numbers \nhe submitted to us--as we have today and three times as much in 10 \nyears. I am not making this up. These numbers are in the book. And it \nis pretty disturbing to me.\n  The chairman offered an alternative budget. He got clever. He said: \nWe will do a 5-year budget. We won't do a 10-year budget. We will move \nsome things around and make things look better, and then we can all \nvote for it. That is basically what happened today. But when you look \nat it carefully, it is no big change. And the chairman's mark that was \npassed out of committee today, that mark is disturbing because it was \nless honest and it was more gimmicked up than the President's budget.\n  President Obama's budget was pretty honest about two or three big \nissues. One of them is the alternative minimum tax fix. It costs quite \na bit to fix that. We only fix it 1 year at a time, but we fix it every \nyear. President Obama assumed we would fix it. I think he \nunderestimated the cost of a 10-year fix, but he had it in there. It \ncost hundreds of billions of dollars to do that--$500 billion. I think \nit is probably closer to $700 billion or $800 billion, but that was in \nthere. That was omitted from the chairman's mark that was voted out. \nBut that is going to be fixed, and when you fix it, you reduce the \nalternative minimum tax's impact in the country, you lose revenue, and \nthat makes your debt look worse.\n  Also, every year we have been fixing the doctors' reimbursement rate \nunder the Balanced Budget Act. A decade ago, we required those payments \nto be cut, and we required them to be cut too much. They can't be cut \nthat much, but that is the current law. They are dropped about 20 \npercent today. So every year, we come back and we put the money in. We \nspend the money necessary to keep the doctors with a modest increase in \ntheir reimbursement rate. We don't let them take a 20-percent cut. The \nchairman's mark assumes we don't fix the doctors' bills. That is not \ngoing to happen. That makes his numbers look somewhat better.\n  But when charted out carefully, the Budget Committee, on the \nRepublican side, put the numbers together and found discretionary \nspending over 5 years under the chairman's mark was 98.8 percent--the \nsame as President Obama's budget. Total outlays over 5 years was 96.6 \npercent--the same as the President's budget. And revenue was 99.8 \npercent--the same. So it is basically the President's budget. But since \nit was getting so much flak and that budget was so irresponsible, \npeople wanted to pretend that the budget they voted out of the \ncommittee was more responsible and deserved more support. But it is \njust not so, really. There is nothing in it that suggests a confronting \nof the serious financial situation we are in.\n  It has an incredible increase in spending, and that is why the debts \nare so large. It creates these deficits. As I indicated, we go from $5 \ntrillion to $10 trillion in debt held by the public in 5 years. Where \ndoes that $5 trillion come from? Where does it come from? It comes from \nborrowing. And you borrow by going out and offering Treasury bills on \nthe U.S. Treasury. You offer people an opportunity to buy them, and you \npay them interest to loan you the money. So they loan you the money, \nand you pay them interest.\n  We have been in a time in which the interest rates have been \nunusually low because people were so scared around the world and other \ncountries were shakier than we were, and so they wanted to buy Treasury \nbills--because we always pay them, basically. We have historically been \na very safe investment. So that is how we get there. We borrow the \nmoney.\n  Now, I want to suggest that costs money. I am not making these \nnumbers up. These are the numbers that the Congressional Budget Office \ncalculated. The Congressional Budget Office is hired by the Congress--\nboth Houses of Congress--though it is controlled by the Democratic \nmajority. They essentially have the final choice on who becomes the \nhead of that office and who can control that office. But CBO takes \npride in being nonpartisan and doing the right numbers. We use them a \nlot. They are the best numbers we can get. This is what they have \ncalculated that interest payments on the debt will be.\n  People can understand interest. How much are you paying on your \ncredit card in interest? How much are you paying on your house note in \ninterest? When you borrow money, you pay interest. When the United \nStates borrows another $5 trillion, we pay interest on that 5, plus the \n5 we have already borrowed. And when it goes to $17 trillion, as CBO \nexpects this budget deficit to do based on the budget the President \nsent us, you would see these kinds of numbers. And these are the \nPresident's numbers, but on these numbers, I think he is low. I trust \nCBO. But we will look at both of them.\n  According to CBO's estimates, we will spend $170 billion for interest \nthis year. It goes up slowly. In 2011, $216 billion; then $282 billion, \n$460 billion, $601 billion, $734 billion; and in the 10th year, $806 \nbillion in interest. One year's interest. How much of that is for \nforeign countries--China and Saudi Arabia and other countries who \nbought our Treasury bills? That is $806 billion.\n  How much is $806 billion? My State of Alabama is an average-size \nState--maybe a little smaller, not much--and we are about one-fiftieth \nthe population of the country. Our entire general fund budget, \nincluding our State school spending and teachers, is less than $10 \nbillion a year. The Government will be paying $806 billion in interest \nin 1 year.\n  The Federal highway program today is $40 billion. We send that out to \nthe States, where they get an 80-20 or a 90-10 split, and they use it \nto repair interstates and highways, and they do a lot with that. It is \n$40 billion. We're talking about 20 times as much as the highway money.\n  I am very concerned about that interest number. Can we not understand \nwhy this is important? And we are not sure what this number will be \nbecause we are not perfectly sure what the interest rates will be.\n  There are some developments today in the world that cause us quite a \nbit of concern. In the Washington Post today, there is a report that \nthe President of the European Union blasted U.S. spending. Subheadline: \n``Czech Premier Calls Obama Administration's Economic Policies `a Road \nto Hell.' '' The article is talking about the United States urging \nother countries to borrow more money and spend more money, as we have \ndone. Let me quote from the article:\n\n       Some countries, led by Germany, have strongly resisted, \n     predicting that such a path could lead to unsustainable debts \n     and runaway inflation. Luxembourg's prime minister . . . who \n     heads a coordinating body . . . said European countries had \n     already spent enough to jumpstart their economies.\n\n  They haven't spent as much as we have, yet we are urging them to \nspend more.\n  To further quote from the article:\n\n       The European stimulus plans are muscular. They are \n     demanding, they are important in volume and in quality. . . . \n     There was ``no question'' that the European Union would \n     reject requests from Obama to spend more.\n\n  Well, what happens when you do that? What happens when you borrow too \nmuch money?\n  There was an article in today's Washington Times talking about Mr. \nGeithner's difficulties in misspeaking\n\n[[Page S3888]]\n\nand causing the dollar to plunge and the market to plunge, and then \nrebalance after he corrected himself. The article said:\n\n       By afternoon, a poor showing of buyers at a Treasury bond \n     auction sent interest rates sharply higher, raising fears \n     about the U.S. ability to sell a massive load of $2.5 \n     trillion of debt this year.\n\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       Buyers may have been spooked by . . . the unveiling of \n     budget plans on Capitol Hill that would double the amount of \n     debt the Treasury has to sell in the next 5 years to nearly \n     $12 trillion.\n\n  The markets are worried about this. So if you are going to buy a \nTreasury bill and you think the United States is selling too many of \nthem, or there are too many on the market and not enough money out \nthere to buy them, or the interest rates are low and you want higher \ninterest rates, you just don't buy. And then what is going to happen? \nTo sell our bonds, to get people to loan us money, we are going to have \nto promise to pay them higher interest rates. That is the deal.\n  The New York Times had an article about this a month ago. Chairman \nConrad, our very able chairman of the Budget Committee, passed it out \nto our committee members. This is a warning. When you get too much debt \nand you are demanding that too many people loan you money, countries \nsuch as China--which have a fraction of the surplus in their trade \naccount today than they had a number of years ago--are not going to buy \nas much of our debt, even if they wanted to, because they do not have \nthe money to buy it with. Who is going to buy this? To get enough \npeople to send us their money to finance our spending spree, we are \ngoing to end up having to pay higher interest rates. That is a fact.\n\n  The article goes on to say:\n\n       The mounting worries about the debt also snuffed out a \n     rally in the stock market . . .\n\n  He talked about China. You have heard a lot of people talk about \nChina and buying our Treasury bills and our concern about being \nobligated to them. This is what the article said today:\n\n       China and other investors recently have taken to worrying \n     about whether the United States may debase its currency in \n     its drive to address economic problems.\n\n  I think the world is worrying about that. Are we going to debase our \ncurrency? Are we going to inflate our currency to bail ourselves out \nand pay back those who loaned us money with dollars worth less than the \ndollars they loaned to us? If they think that, what they will demand is \neven higher interest rates. Because then they have to have interest \nrates that will assure them that even if the money is inflated, they \nwill be paid back in an amount similar to that which they loaned us.\n  It goes on to say:\n\n       But the investors worry about the lingering effects of the \n     legacy of debt and the inflationary impact of the Federal \n     Reserve's program to help finance that debt with $300 billion \n     of Treasury bond purchases.\n\n  So the Federal Reserve is basically printing money and buying these \nTreasury bills themselves to try to help us out, and that is worrying \npeople because nothing comes from nothing. Debts must be repaid. It \ngoes on to say:\n\n       Apprehension about these matters is apparently what led to \n     the Treasury's difficulty in selling $24 billion of the five-\n     year notes Wednesday afternoon.\n\n  That is yesterday afternoon.\n\n       To attract buyers, the Treasury had to pay interest rates \n     that were significantly higher than its previous auction, \n     touching off fears about the nation's ability to finance ever \n     bigger loads of debt in the future. It didn't help that \n     Britain on Tuesday experienced its first failed bond auction \n     in nearly seven years--a bad portent since Britain, like the \n     United States, has gone deeply into debt to finance large \n     economic stimulus and bank bailout programs.\n\n  The Brits have followed us. The Central Europeans are saying no. The \nBrits are spending like we are and the other countries are rejecting \nthat. They pushed back and we have urged them to spend like we do and \nthey said: No, we are not going to do it.\n  I think it is embarrassing. It is mortifying to me, as an American \nwho believes in limited Government, lower taxes, and free enterprise, \nto be in a position where we are being lectured by the Europeans and \ntold no, when we want to spend more, tax more, and create more debt and \nthey are saying it is irresponsible. We have always believed we were \nmore responsible and we had more honesty in our system and we were more \nfrugal in what we spent and our economy has been more robust than the \nEuropean economies over the last 15 or 20 years. But now it looks like \nthe situation has shifted. CreditSights--an organization that deals \nwith these kinds of interest issues--CreditSights' Ms. Purtle was \nquoted in the article. She said that:\n\n       . . . the most serious problem the Treasury faces is a lack \n     of buyers worldwide for its growing mountain of debt. In \n     particular, countries like China and Japan that invested \n     their trillions of dollars in export earnings in the Treasury \n     market have been hit by plummeting exports--\n\n  They are not selling as much as they used to.\n\n     --which means they have less money to invest in Treasury \n     Bonds, she said.\n\n  She concludes by saying:\n\n       ``. . . funds simply aren't available to continue the \n     purchases.''\n\n  That is something I have been talking about for some time. It is \npretty obvious, unless you believe something can come from nothing.\n  Julie Andrews had it right:\n\n       Nothing comes from nothing, nothing ever could.\n\n  In the course of this debate, a lot of efforts were carried out to \ntry to do something about the stark numbers that are revealed in the \nPresident's bound book he sent to us. This chart reflects what is in \nhis book. I didn't make up the numbers. They came right out of the book \nhe wrote, or his staff did, and it reflects the total of the debt held \nby the public which is the best hard number we have, I think, of what \nthe debt of the country is.\n  We start out in 2008 with $5.03 trillion. You can see the deficits, \nhow they increase. By the first 5 years, debt held by the public is \n$11.55 trillion, virtually a doubling in 5 years of that debt. Then, in \nthe 10th year, it is $15.370 trillion, more than three times the \namount, about three times the point of the 2008 figure.\n  The numbers don't lie. Nobody is disputing this. They are saying, you \nknow what, as my colleague said on the floor in a very partisan speech: \nWell, we are investing. We admit we are in a changed environment. We \nare trying to do things in a different way, and get over it, you guys, \nyou mossbacks, worrying about debt. Don't worry about debt. Don't worry \nabout spending. We are investing. We are going to spend more in \neducation--like we haven't done that year after year--and we are going \nto have such an improvement in the quality of our graduates it is going \nto make America better and we are going to pay all this back. I guess \nthat is what the argument is. But at some point, you just don't have \nthe money. We do not have the money.\n  It would be nice if we could double every program in the world. Maybe \nwe'll send more as foreign aid. Somebody offered that amendment in the \nBudget Committee today to spend more on foreign aid. Spend everything \nmore and more and it will all work out.\n  I do not think that is acceptable, and these numbers represent, I \ncontend, the most irresponsible budget since World War II, and since we \nwere in a life-or-death struggle in World War II, those deficits were \nnecessary.\n  Well, somebody might say: Sessions, we are in a recession. That is \nwhy the President's numbers look bad.\n  But hold your hat: the President's budget says we will have, this \nyear, a negative GDP of 1.2 percent. He projects in this budget, to \nmake the numbers look better, actually--I think, that is the only thing \nI can say; I hope it would be right--he projects that unemployment \nwould cap out, the highest we would ever have in this recession is 8.1 \npercent. It is already at 8.1 percent. Wouldn't it be great if it \ndoesn't get any higher? Maybe it won't. I surely hope not, but I \nsuspect it will.\n  Look at this. This is the projections through 5 years. He doesn't \nproject--the reason we are having these deficits is not because of lack \nof economic growth. The reason we have these deficits is spending, \nunprecedented spending. Look, in 2009, this fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, they predict a GDP decline of 1.2 percent. The \nindependent, Blue Chip consensus, which is the most respected group, \nthey project it will be worse, at 2.6 percent.\n  In 2010, that is next year--we are in 2009. In 2010, the President is \nprojecting 3.2 percent growth. That is robust\n\n[[Page S3889]]\n\ngrowth. That is not a little growth, that is robust growth. In 2011, it \nis 4.0; 2012, 4.6; 2013, 4.2.\n  The point I am trying to make is, the reason the deficits are here in \nthe outyears is not because the President is saying we are going to be \nin a sustained economic slowdown. President Clinton in his best years \nin the 1990s, President Reagan in his best years, I think it very \nrarely broke 4 percent or 5 percent growth. Four percent growth is \nrobust growth. Great Scott, it would be great to have that every year.\n  We are not having these deficits because we are assuming we are going \nto be in an economic slowdown or a war. That is not assumed either \nbecause the defense budget is one thing that is getting reduced.\n  Amendments were offered. Senator Gregg offered an amendment, the \nranking Republican on the committee--and such a smart and experienced \nmember of the committee. To get into the European Union, you have to \ncommit that your annual deficit will not exceed 3 percent of your GDP \nand that your total debt will not exceed 60 percent of your gross \ndomestic product, the GDP. This budget, I think, is taking us--this is \nwhere we are. In 2009, this year, we are at 55 percent of GDP is our \ndebt. It goes up next year to 61, in 2010, because of the budget, with \nsuch huge deficits. That already takes us outside of being admitted in \nthe European Union. The European Union says if you are going to be a \nmember of our economic union, you have to show you have financial \ndiscipline in your country. Every new member has to go through this.\n\n  But under the President's budget in 2011, it is 64 percent; in 2012, \nit is 65 percent; 2013, it is 66 percent; and 2014, it is 66 percent. I \nthink it hits about 80 percent. It goes on up in the second 5 years.\n  This is a troubling trend. So Senator Gregg said: Why don't we at \nleast make it a situation in which at least to pass a budget such as \nthis you have to have 60 votes if we violate the standards of the \nEuropean Union? It was voted down. Every Democrat voted against that \nreform, that containment mechanism.\n  Senator Gregg also offered an amendment dealing with the budget \npresented by the chairman. I think he had a little humor in him when he \noffered this. The budget presented by the chairman projected a 7-\npercent increase in spending this year; 7 percent over the baseline. \nBut over 5 years, he claimed it only would increase spending by about \n2.5 percent. That is pretty good, a 2.5-percent increase. It is not \ngreat. I offered an amendment lower than that but 2.5 percent. OK? \nThen, Senator Crapo, a Republican member of the committee and a very \nexperienced and knowledgeable person, he said one thing I have learned \naround here, the budget that counts is the one for this year. You can \nproject anything in your next year's budget and the next year's budget \nand the fourth and fifth year's budget. You can project any spending \nlevel you want because we will be back here next year, sitting in this \nroom, and we will be voting on what this year's increase will be.\n  In other words, it appeared we were dealing with a gimmick. It \nappeared we were talking about spending a lot this year in the budget \nthat counts--this fiscal year--and having reductions next year when we \nwill have every opportunity to increase it.\n  OK. So Senator Crapo says: OK, you said you are going to keep it at 2 \npercent. That is what your budget says. I am going to offer an \namendment that sets up a budget point of order that takes 60 votes if \nyou go above that. Fair enough, right? So if next year--actually, I \nthink next year they are proposing a 1-percent increase, which is not \ngoing to happen, I assure you.\n  And he proposed we hold them to that 2.5, and we would have a 60-vote \npoint of order if they went over 2.5. Every Democrat voted it down \nbecause they knew they were not going to stay at 2.5. Everybody knows \nit.\n  I will just say this: No matter what is in the budget that comes out \nof this Senate, if it is any kind of real reduction from President \nObama's budget, and I do not think it will be, but if it is, when it \ngoes to conference and they meet with Speaker Pelosi, they are going to \nput the money back in. When the bill comes over here, it is going to \nessentially be the Obama budget. We have seen that is the tone of this \ndiscussion.\n  So that is why he offered that amendment. That is why they voted it \ndown, because they flatly intend not to stick to a 2.5-percent-per-year \nspending increase in nondefense discretionary spending.\n  Senator Lindsey Graham offered an amendment--get this--that would \nlimit each household's share of the debt in America to $80,000 per \nhousehold. Our debt today is $60,000 per household. The Federal debt, \nif divided out per household, is $60,000. So Senator Graham said: Well, \nlet's just put a mechanism in here, if you go over $60,000 and get up \nto $80,000, we have a budget point of order; at least it would take \ntwo-thirds to pass it.\n  No. They voted that down because the budget clearly puts us on a \ntrack to go well above $80,000 per household. It would have the \npotential to bite and be a potential way to contain this growth of \nspending.\n  Senator Alexander offered an amendment that said there would be a \nbudget point of order if the amount of our total debt reached 90 \npercent of the gross domestic product of our country. I just told you \nthat you cannot get in the European Union if your debt exceeds 60 \npercent of your GDP. But this budget puts us on track to going beyond \n90 percent of GDP, and Senator Alexander offered an amendment. How \nreasonable is that? And it was voted down, on a straight party-line \nvote.\n  Senator Cornyn offered an amendment that would create a 60-vote point \nof order if we doubled the debt. If we double our debt, we ought to at \nleast have 60 votes to do that. It was voted down, straight party-line \nvote.\n  These are troubling instances. We are not making this up. The issue \nis critical for the future of our Nation. It also says something more \nthan just debt; it says this President meant something when he said: We \nare going to remake the American economy.\n  At a point in last year's campaign, many will remember this, when our \nPresident met Joe the Plumber, and he said: Well, we are going to take \nthis money and spread it around a little bit, Joe.\n  People said: Wait a minute. Was that revealing who he really was? Is \nnot that the socialist impulse to take money from people who have it \nand spend it on people you want to have it? Is not that the socialist \nimpulse?\n  People talked about President Obama--Senator Obama then--is that the \nway he really thinks? Is that what he is going to do if he gets \nelected?\n  Oh no, they said, we are not socialists. We do not believe in those \nthings. But budgets are not campaign rhetoric. The campaign is over. We \nare dealing with real books, a proposal to triple the debt in 10 years \nout of his budget office, with his name on it. I think the name of the \nbudget document is ``A New Era of Responsibility.'' That is what is on \nit. That is what is right here. Here it is. ``A New Era of \nResponsibility.'' You tell me how tripling the debt is an era of \nresponsibility. You tell me how raising the interest payment per year \nfrom $170 billion to $800 billion is responsible, in 10 years. It is \nnot responsible.\n  We will have this debate next week. The Members will have a chance to \nspeak about it and talk about it. For some people listening out there \nin the great American countryside, you may think this is just another \nRepublican-Democratic dust-up, just another flim-flam fight, a burning \nof political hot air about nothing. And why does everybody not get \ntogether and just agree and work in a bipartisan way and pass \nsomething?\n  Well, what if they passed something that you think is bad for \nAmerica, the legislation that has been offered. Every amendment that \nwill make a difference gets voted down on a straight party-line vote, \nand it is going to be voted out of this Senate with an overwhelming \npartisan vote. I doubt a single Republican will vote for it.\n  But because a budget is passed--unlike most legislation--with a \nsimple majority, there are plenty of votes to pass this. So there have \nbeen a lot of votes in this Senate, and a lot of times Republicans, I \nhave often thought, have saved our Democratic colleagues from \nthemselves by taking the hard votes by asking: How much is it going to \ncost? Do we really have the money? And not vote for things that in the\n\n[[Page S3890]]\n\nlong run have not been wise for America.\n  OK. It is not going to happen this time because the votes are here. \nSenator Reid, the majority leader, has the votes. This budget is going \nto pass. I suppose it is possible that the American people will have \ntheir voices heard and something could change and it could come out \nbetter. That would be my hope. But unless something changes in the \ndynamic, and the only thing that can change this dynamic is if the \nAmerican people make their voices heard through their representatives \nand tell them that is not what we intended when we voted for President \nObama. Or almost half the people voted for John McCain; that is not \nwhat we intended you guys to do. You did not tell us you were going to \ntriple the debt. You did not tell us you were going to do these things.\n  What about our Member who ran for reelection recently in the last \nseveral years? They have been attacking President Bush. They have been \nattacking President Bush as a profligate spender and saying they were \ngoing to do better. This is better? Give me a break.\n  Let's talk about that. I think a relevant year is 2003, after 9/11, \nafter that recession, the commencement of the war on terrorism, \nPresident Bush had a deficit of around $400 billion. He was savagely \ncriticized for that, and some of that was justified. At the time that \nwas the biggest deficit since World War II.\n  It dropped for 3 consecutive years. In 2007, the year before last, \nthe budget had dropped to $161 billion. We were on a good path, and \nthen this recession hit. The President sent out $150 billion last year, \nunwisely. That did very little good. All of a sudden the deficit last \nyear, September 30, was $459 billion.\n  Well, that was the biggest since World War II. And I think he was \nrightly criticized for that. I did not vote to send out the checks. \nSorry, constituents. I did not think it was going to work. I do not \nthink it has. Most economists say it did not benefit us.\n  But this year, hold your hats, with the $800 billion stimulus bill we \npassed this year, the deficit for this 1 year will not be $455 billion, \n$600 billion, $700 billion, $800 billion, $1,000 billion. No, it is \n$1.8 trillion. It is $1.8 trillion this fiscal year, and they are \nscoring the Wall Street bailout all this year. They are scoring Freddie \nMac and Fannie Mae this year. There are some one-time things in that \nscore.\n  But next year it is going to be $1.1 trillion, according to the \nCongressional Budget Office. If you look at Congressional Budget Office \nnumbers--here are the President's numbers. He projects, with a robust \ngrowing economy, the debt will be $1.75 trillion in 2009; $1.1, almost \n$1.2 trillion in 2010; almost $900 billion in 2011; and he goes down. \nAnd it starts coming back up in the outyears when he has solid growth \nand no projections of an economic slowdown. He projects continued \ngrowing deficits to $712 billion. And that is that 1 year. OK. There is \nnot a single year, not a single year in these 10 years of the \nPresident's budget that the deficit is as low as the highest deficit \nPresident Bush ever had. Not one.\n  But my staff tells me, let's not forget, that is the President's \nscore. It has been doctored too. It is really worse than that based on \nthe money they plan to spend. Our own Congressional Budget Office, \ncontrolled by the majority Members of our body, this is what they have \nfor the deficit. They have this year being $1.845 trillion, $1,845 \nbillion; 1.4 the next year; not at $712 billion but at $1.2 trillion in \nthe tenth year.\n  So that is why Senator Conrad, our Democratic chairman, has said it \nis unsustainable. You cannot sustain these kind of deficits, even with \na healthy economy.\n  USA Today, when this crisis began to hit us, they wrote an article \nthat said simply this: An economy founded on excessive personal debt, \nexcessive Government debt, and excessive trade deficits is not healthy.\n  So what we have to do is get off debt and get back to an honest \ngrowth economy that we have always been able to have. We have had a \nclear housing bubble that has burst. It has impacted the financial \ncommunity significantly.\n  We have done a lot of things. Some of them are of dubious value. But \nwe have done a lot of things to work our way through, and certainly \nPresident Obama projects the economy to bounce back strongly. But we \ncannot keep spending. We have to control that.\n  So as we go forward next week, I hope the American people will be \nalert to the most important issues; that they will make their voices \nheard; that all of our colleagues will go home, and as they sit down in \nquiet time, ask themselves: Can I vote for this? Can I go on record as \nvoting for a plan that will increase the annual interest payment of \nAmericans from $170 billion to $800 billion? And I am going to triple \nthe debt in our country in 10 years, put us on a plan that will do \nthat? I think not. I hope not.\n  I encourage my colleagues to study it carefully and vote no and let \nus see if we cannot come back with a much better budget. The only way \nto fix some of these issues is a bipartisan effort because some of \nthose spending programs are tough. They have been growing out of \ncontrol. It is going to take mature, tough decisionmaking to bring it \nunder control.\n  Some special interests are going to holler as soon as you try to do \nit, and you have to listen to them. But you cannot let them set the \nnational policy.\n  You can't let the person who is getting a benefit from a single \nprogram set a policy that adversely impacts everybody else in the \ncountry. That is what we are paid to do, to make the tough choices. We \nare not doing it now. The President's budget is not responsible. I hope \nwe can confront it honestly and make some positive changes.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, this month marks the 50th anniversary of one \nof the most important institutions in the growth and prosperity of the \nState of Nevada--the Nevada Gaming Commission.\n  On March 30, 2009, the William S. Boyd School of Law at the \nUniversity of Nevada, Las Vegas, will mark this anniversary and honor \nthose who have contributed to the stability, integrity, and success of \nthe world's first gaming control system.\n  The Nevada State Legislature approved the Nevada Control Act in \nresponse to Gov. Grant Sawyer's request for gaming reform in his first \nstate of the State address. Governor Grant and others recognized that \nclearer rules and oversight were necessary to show America that Nevada \nwas serious about fair and ethical gaming.\n  When Governor Sawyer appointed the first members of the Gaming \nCommission in 1959, he said that the key characteristic of his \nappointees must be integrity. Governors since that time have followed \nthat guideline and ensured 50 years of an ethical Commission.\n  This 50th anniversary leads me to reflect upon my 4 years as chairman \nof the commission, from 1977 to 1981. During these 4 years, we \ntransitioned to a new world of gaming where Nevada shared the legal \ngaming stage with New Jersey. I will always remember the support I \nreceived as Commission Chairman from Governors Mike O'Callaghan, Robert \nList and my fellow commissioners. Over the course of my years in public \nservice, nothing has given me more satisfaction than the progress we \nmade during those years.\n  The current members of the Gaming Commission--Chairman Peter \nBernhard, Arthur Marshall, Sue Wagner, Radha Chanderraj and Tony \nAlamo--personify the qualities of leadership Nevada expects and \ndeserves.\n  To all the members of the Nevada Gaming Commission, past and\n\n[[Page S3891]]\n\npresent--and all the support staff who have helped them succeed--I \nextend my warm congratulations on this 50th anniversary.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/26/senate-section/article/S3891-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TRIBUTE TO LOUISVILLE SLUGGER\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise today to pay tribute to a fine \nLouisville product that is recognizable around the world and to the \nwonderful company behind it that is still knocking it out of the park \nafter 125 years. Hillerich & Bradsby Co., makers of the famous \nLouisville Slugger, has made over 100 million bats since 1884.\n  Legend has it that the company's first bat was made by 17-year-old \nJohn A. ``Bud'' Hillerich in his father, J.F. Hillerich's, woodworking \nshop, after local baseball star Pete Browning broke his bat. Bud \ninvited him to the shop and handcrafted a new one on a steam-powered \nlathe.\n  The next day, after Browning got three hits in three at bats, \nbaseball players from all over the region began to visit the Hillerich \nshop. From this, the Louisville Slugger was born.\n  The company has remained family owned for five generations, and in \nthat time has become the most iconic brand in the game of baseball. \nPlayers from T-ball to the Major Leagues all have used Louisville \nSluggers, including such greats as Lou Gehrig, Joe DiMaggio, Jackie \nRobinson, and Babe Ruth. Ruth personally gave bat makers at the company \nspecifications for the Louisville Slugger bats he would use to hit his \nrecord 60 home runs.\n  In 1996, after operating elsewhere, Louisville Slugger baseball bats \ncame home to Louisville, as Hillerich & Bradsby Co. placed their \nexecutive offices, wood bat plant, and a museum in downtown Louisville, \njust 10 blocks away from where Bud Hillerich made the first Louisville \nSlugger in 1884. The Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory is now one of \nthe major tourist attractions of Louisville, with more than 2 million \nvisitors since its opening.\n  If any of my colleagues happen to be in Louisville, my hometown, and \nwant to visit the Louisville Slugger Museum & Factory, it is very easy \nto find. Just look for the 120-foot-long giant Louisville Slugger bat \nthat marks the building's entrance. Every kid in town knows where to \nfind the world's biggest bat and knows it marks the spot where you can \ntour the factory and actually see a Louisville Slugger being made. \nToday, Hillerich & Bradsby Co. manufactures more than 1 million wood \nbats a year, as well as aluminum bats, for professional and amateur \nuse.\n  For millions of fans, the word ``Louisville'' will always evoke the \nsatisfying crack of a bat and the celebration of a home run. This is \nthanks to the Louisville Slugger. The 2009 baseball season marks the \nLouisville Slugger's 125th anniversary, and I know all my colleagues \njoin me in congratulating Hillerich & Bradsby Co. for 125 years of \nsuccess in baseball, our national pastime.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/26/senate-section/article/S3891-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3891-S3892]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          CREDIT FOR INVESTMENT IN ADVANCED ENERGY FACILITIES\n\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise for a colloquy with the chairman \nof the Finance Committee, Senator BAUCUS, to discuss section 1302 of \nthe American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, ARRA, which the President \nsigned into law on February 19, 2009 (Public Law 111-5). That section \nestablishes a new tax credit, known as the section 48C credit, for \ninvestment in advanced energy facilities.\n  I am very pleased that ARRA establishes this new credit. Because \nuntil now, all of our investment tax credits for renewable energy \ntechnologies have been concentrated downstream that is, at the \ncommercial or individual consumer level. While those incentives have \ncreated some U.S. jobs, such as in installation, most advanced energy \ntechnologies that are installed in the United States continue to be \nmanufactured overseas. One major driver for this overseas manufacturing \nis the significant tax incentives that other countries offer. For \ninstance, Malaysia and the Philippines offer solar photovoltaic \nmanufacturers income tax holidays, for 15 years in the case of \nMalaysia, while Germany offers them up to 50 percent of investment \ncosts. As a result, the U.S. is far behind, and is falling further \nbehind, in ``clean tech'' manufacturing. According to one recent study, \nJapan represents 45 percent of global solar cell production while the \nUnited States accounts for just 9 percent. And European manufacturers \nnow account for more than 85 percent of the global wind component \nmarket.\n  But just as the U.S. is losing ground in advanced energy \nmanufacturing, we can anticipate rapid near- to mid-term growth in \ndomestic demand for renewable energy technologies. This demand will be \ndriven by numerous factors, including last year's extension of the \ncommercial and residential investment tax credits through 2016; \nextension by ARRA of the production tax credit through 2013--2012 for \nwind; and declining product costs; anticipated enactment of national \nrequirements for renewable electricity deployment; and anticipated \nenactment of a market-based system or tax to limit carbon emissions. \nBut under the status quo, the corresponding growth in domestic demand \nwould largely have been satisfied by imports.\n  For that reason, I worked with my friend from Montana, Senator \nBaucus, to establish in ARRA the first tax credit for investment in \nadvanced energy facilities those that manufacture property that enables \nAmericans to harness renewable resources to generate energy, to make \nenergy efficient improvements, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \nI thank Senator Baucus for sharing my commitment to putting our country \non the path to being a leader in advanced energy manufacturing.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I thank my colleague from New Mexico, the chairman of the \nEnergy and Natural Resources Committee, for his dedication to this \nissue. I am pleased to have worked with Senator Bingaman, the chairman \nof the Finance Subcommittee on Energy, Natural Resources, and \nInfrastructure, on this new incentive. And I wholeheartedly agree with \nSenator Bingaman that we cannot allow the United States to miss the \nopportunity to add thousands of green manufacturing jobs. This new tax \ncredit for investment in advanced energy facilities will level the \nplaying field so that the U.S. can compete for these jobs, and I was \npleased to include it in my chairman's mark when the Finance Committee \nconsidered this legislation.\n  Under section 1302 of ARRA, the Treasury Secretary is authorized to \naward total credits of up to $2.3 billion for qualifying projects. \nWithin 180 days of enactment, the Treasury Secretary, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of Energy, is required to establish a program to \nconsider and award certifications for projects that qualify for the \ncredit. The bill enumerates selection criteria that the Treasury \nSecretary shall take into consideration. The Finance Committee \ndeveloped these criteria with the Energy and Natural Resources \nCommittee, and through the Chair, I would like to ask Senator Bingaman \nto explain the criteria and clarify how Congress intends the \nadministration to implement this credit.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. I thank the Senator. At the outset, I note that this \ncredit is a product of the Senate; it was not included in the \npreconference legislation that was passed by the House.\n  Overall, we intend the credit to promote the manufacture of property \nthat, until recently, has not been widely deployed in the United \nStates. In particular, the credit is intended to benefit manufacturers \nof property (including component parts of property) that (a) harnesses \nrenewable resources to produce energy; (b) enhances the efficient use \nof energy derived from conventional or renewable resources; or (c) \nreduces greenhouse gas emissions from energy produced by conventional \nresources.\n  Treasury's creation of transparent scoring criteria will be critical \nfor efficient delivery of the allocated credit amount, which, in turn, \nwill drive efficient deployment of private capital.\n  The new section 48C requires the Treasury Secretary to make awards \nonly to projects for which there is a reasonable expectation of \ncommercial viability. Commercial viability primarily considers \nreadiness for deployment. It also considers capital requirements to \nreach end-consumers in a cost-effective manner. Projects that have \nimmediate and fungible markets and are positioned to compete in those\n\n[[Page S3892]]\n\nmarkets have greater commercial viability than those that will require \nsignificant additional market development. Additionally, in determining \nviability the Secretary should consider the potential scale of market \napplications, and therefore the project's broader impact.\n  In allocating credits, section 48C directs the Secretary to consider \nfive additional factors.\n  First, the Secretary shall consider projects that will provide the \ngreatest domestic job creation, both direct and indirect, during the \ncredit period. Because of their potential to catalyze additional \ngrowth, ARRA's stimulus objective will be maximized if the program \nsupports emerging sectors and technologies. Accordingly, the Secretary \nshould consider job creation estimates that include some evaluation of \nthe potential breadth and scale of the property's applications, \nincluding job creation potential of the property's supply chain, \ndistribution, installation, and maintenance.\n  Second, the Secretary shall consider projects that will provide the \ngreatest net impact in avoiding or reducing air pollutants or \nanthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases. Emissions from both the \nmanufacturing project's operations and the installed energy property \nshould be considered. Applicant projects should be compared to the \nexisting most-likely alternatives, and also to alternative new \ncompeting property. We expect that the Treasury Secretary will consult \nwith the Department of Energy in estimating direct greenhouse gas \nemissions on a lifecycle basis for applicant projects. Additionally, \nthe Treasury Secretary shall ensure that any potential project has \nreceived all Federal and State environmental authorizations or reviews \nnecessary to commence construction of the project.\n  Third, the Secretary shall look to projects that have the greatest \npotential for technological innovation and commercial deployment. This \ncriterion will ensure that tax credits are directed to those projects \nthat have the greatest opportunity to catalyze new technologies, and \nthus multiply the tax credit's impact. The Secretary might implement \nthis standard by preferring projects that are first- or second-of-a-\nkind, or that employ significantly improved technologies--i.e., those \nthat will achieve significant improvements in cost or technology \nperformance relative to existing solutions.\n  Fourth, the Secretary shall prioritize projects that have the lowest \nlevelized cost either of generated or stored energy, or of measured \nreduction in energy consumption or greenhouse gas emissions. Because it \ntakes into account the installed system price and associated costs, \nsuch as financing and operation, levelized cost of energy is an \naccepted and common metric for comparing the cost of generating energy \nor saving energy across properties. In the case of property that \ngenerates or stores energy, the appropriate measure is levelized cost \nof generated or stored energy, which factors the cost per kilowatt \nhours of energy generated. In the case of property that conserves or \nmore efficiently deploys energy, such as smart grid and metering \ntechnologies, or that reduces greenhouse emissions, the appropriate \nmeasure is levelized cost of measured reduction in energy consumption \nor greenhouse gas emissions, which factors the cost per kilowatt of \nenergy saved or ton of carbon captured. Section 48C mentions the ``full \nsupply chain'' and, in the case of reductions in energy consumption or \ngreenhouse gas emissions, the Secretary should also consider emissions \nreductions in other parts of the supply chain that are enabled by the \napplicant project.\n  Finally, the legislation directs the Secretary to consider projects \nthat have the shortest project time from certification to completion. \nARRA's overarching goal is to create jobs as quickly as possible; the \ncredit is intended to benefit firms that are able to move quickly and \nwith certainty.\n  Through the Chair, I would like to ask Senator Baucus to confirm his \nagreement with my description of these factors.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. I most certainly agree with the Senator's description and \nI thank him for his collaboration in developing this robust new tax \ncredit.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/26/senate-section/article/S3892-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3892-S3894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       First of all thank you for all your efforts to help the \n     people of Idaho and the USA.\n       We have a disabled daughter that lives on a very small \n     income. We subsidize her income monthly and daily. It is all \n     she can do to make ends meet. We are retired and on fixed \n     income. Even before these terrible gas price increases and \n     using ``level pay'' for heating and cooling all year round, \n     trips to the many doctors and Elks Rehab, it is all but \n     impossible for her to maintain a lifestyle where she can pay \n     all her bills and eat.\n       How very sad our country has come to this. We seem to be \n     able to help everyone else in the world but not our own \n     citizens.\n       Everyone in the news keeps saying it will not do any good \n     for years if we start drilling and building refineries. Well, \n     we have to start somewhere and sometime. Foreign countries \n     are virtually taking our oil resources and we are standing by \n     and letting it happen. What is so hard to understand about \n     our dilemma? It affects our source of food and many other \n     vital areas that are urgent to our very survival. Let us \n     bring back our capability to support ourselves by \n     reactivating our nuclear capabilities. We have the technology \n     and even some facilities that were up and running. Why did \n     not we stick with a good thing when we were using it?\n       As far as drilling and the environmentalists are concerned, \n     since when do the minority control the majority? Granted, we \n     need to protect the environment but we all know it can be \n     done along with doing what we need to do to survive.

Every day, my salary \n     is reduced because of the additional costs of commuting to \n     work. Additionally, my home and water are heated by propane, \n     so making it thru this past winter was especially difficult. \n     I had to call on my church leaders for assistance 3-4 times \n     to pay the propane bills. The $600 stimulus check issued by \n     the government was not even enough to cover the cost for one \n     bill. I had to come up with the additional $180 shortage on \n     my own. Needless to say, the stimulus check did not \n     ``stimulate'' much of anything.\n       We are in a national crisis, and something must be done \n     now. My husband walked away from our family approximately \n     three years ago, leaving me with four children and two \n     mortgages to pay on less than $25,000 per year income. I \n     cannot afford to file for divorce because my funds are so \n     limited--so I am just stuck. I do not want to lose my home, \n     but that is becoming more of a potential outcome each day. It \n     breaks my heart to see the things I have worked my whole life \n     for slowly dwindle away. So much for the ``American Dream''.\n       I feel powerless and frustrated much of the time as I have \n     to choose whether to buy fuel to be able to go to work, or \n     buy food for my family.

I have never liked overregulation \n     of business, but I think now they need some regulating, as do \n     all those who are profiting by this miserable situation.\n       We are on a fixed income: Social Security, small pension \n     (that never changes) and a 401K saved while working--which by \n     the way is shrinking due to the stock market problems. The \n     only thing that can be done about our income would be a \n     decent cost-of-living rise in the Social Security next \n     January.\n\n[[Page S3893]]\n\n       Now, the story of how life has changed since the rise in \n     gasoline--and all other--costs. We no longer: subscribe to a \n     newspaper, buy any non-essential food, feed our pets as much \n     as they used to get, buy clothing, eat out, go to movies, \n     have a TV movie package, take any non-essential trips, and \n     soon will cancel our Medicare supplemental health policy. We \n     have enjoyed having a few horses, but hay prices are double \n     over last year--to $185/ton.

We are not starving, yet, or homeless, but that for \n     the first time in our life, these things now appear \n     possible--if things continue as they are. Every time we go to \n     the pump or the grocery story, or buy anything at all; the \n     prices have been increased.\n       Yes--please work for the things you state in your letter--\n     increased domestic exploration, production and refining of \n     petroleum; promotion and development of alternative energy \n     sources, lower our dependence on foreign energy sources--and \n     most important--do it now.

The home I rent is \n     heated by a furnace that burns heating oil. Last winter, I \n     could not afford to buy enough heating oil to keep my house \n     warm all winter. Even by keeping the thermostat at 55 \n     degrees, (enough to keep the pipes from freezing, but not \n     enough to really be warm), there were still two months during \n     the winter that I could not run my furnace because I could \n     not afford the oil. I set up two space heaters in either my \n     bedroom or the living room, and that one room was where I \n     spent all my time when I was at home. I got used to wearing \n     my jacket and two pairs of socks in the house all the time. I \n     hated showering because the bathroom was so cold. I would \n     move a heater into the bathroom 15 or 20 minutes before to \n     heat the room up a little bit. In this way, I saved myself \n     money on heating oil, but then my electric bill nearly \n     doubled. That was last year when oil was less than $3 per \n     gallon. I still have not figured out a way to get heating oil \n     for this year. I just have to trust that God will provide, \n     and give me the strength to cope with whatever situation I am \n     faced with.\n       I wish the government would open the way for more of our \n     natural resources to be utilized. Living in this beautiful \n     state, I love the environment, the animals, the beauty, but \n     are not the needs of human beings more important than leaving \n     billions of acres untouched and untouchable? We cannot even \n     get out to see these spaces anymore because we cannot afford \n     the gas for our vehicles!\n     Jenny, Blackfoot.\n                                  ____\n\n       I do not have any great stories about how the gas prices \n     have affected my family, but I can tell you that I sold our 4 \n     Runner last year to save on gas and just put a trailer hitch \n     on my minivan so I can pull our utility trailer to mow lawns \n     at some apartments. I always think I look a little funny \n     driving down Broadway in a minivan pulling a trailer.\n       I would encourage you to propose legislation and/or vote \n     for legislation that opens up all public lands for drilling \n     for oil. This should include ANWR and all offshore drilling. \n     I oppose states dictating whether or not drilling will take \n     place on federal lands or offshore. States only should have \n     the right to restrict drilling on state owned lands. Any \n     federally owned lands should be under the sole jurisdiction \n     of the federal government. Furthermore, neither the state nor \n     the federal government should restrict drilling on any \n     private lands.\n       We also need more refinery capacity. Whether this is in the \n     form of new refineries or expanding existing refineries, \n     congress needs to pass legislation to ease environmental \n     restrictions.\n       Do not let them bully you around when others say that it \n     will take ten years to get any oil out of new wells. Any \n     amount will help and even the realistic forecast of more oil \n     will scare OPEC into lowering prices. We need it now! I work \n     in the automotive industry and in all my conversations at \n     home and throughout the country on sales calls, I have not \n     once found a person who thinks we should drill less and have \n     less refineries.\n       We also need more nuclear, wind, tidal, hydroelectric, and \n     clean coal power plants. I do not believe government should \n     subsidize any of these, but I believe you should loosen the \n     restrictions for private enterprise to develop such. Rising \n     electricity costs are every bit as detrimental to the well \n     being of our economy as the rising petroleum costs.\n     Clay, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       You asked Idahoans to email you how the current high \n     gasoline prices are affecting them. I do not think listening \n     to the complaints of Idahoans about gas prices contributes to \n     a solution. As I understand it, devaluing of the dollar \n     versus other currencies, among other things, helped the \n     economies of developing countries to where they can afford \n     more energy intensive products such as food and \n     transportation. Increased demand increases prices if supply \n     remains constant. Look at China, for example. Their economy \n     seems to be exploding, increasing their demand for food and \n     energy and consequently driving up costs for others.\n       Some of the sillier ``solutions'' proposed by presidential \n     candidates has been to suspend federal gasoline taxes, and \n     raise taxes on oil companies. Environmentalists have long \n     contributed to this developing energy shortage by frightening \n     the public and politicians away from atomic energy. Instead \n     of letting NASA play with $B probes to Mars, why were they \n     not tasked with solving negatives of atomic plants such as \n     depleted fuel rod disposal?\n       I am pointing fingers here at past errors because it helps \n     to illustrate how we have gone wrong in the past, and which \n     directions our present thinking should take. But first, let \n     us understand who is supposed to be running this country, and \n     who has the clout to dictate what this country is to do? Our \n     U.S. Congress! But when its present preoccupation (increasing \n     subsidies to already wealthy farmers) is compared with the \n     impact of high fuel prices on our citizens, one ceases to \n     expect any help from our politicians.\n       Fight against foolish short term fixes for high fuel \n     prices. Call for somebody to assemble experts in relevant \n     fields to get the facts behind the energy prices, publish \n     them to reassure the public something is being done, then \n     work to reduce the problem. Keep it non-political and do it \n     fast.\n     J. K.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to respond to you regarding \n     our nation's energy situation. We are indeed in a lamentable \n     situation. I believe that our current state of affairs should \n     be no big surprise to anyone. Have we not seen this coming \n     for a number of years? Why has nothing been done sooner to \n     allow development of more efficient vehicle engines and \n     renewable domestic energy sources? While we cannot change \n     what should have been done years ago, you and your colleagues \n     in Congress now have the opportunity to not wait another day \n     to take action. All of us must take responsibility for the \n     predicament we are in and do something about it. Every \n     American has the responsibility to conserve energy and use \n     our resources wisely, without being wasteful. All of us have \n     a responsibility to make decisions that will assure future \n     generations a clean, healthy environment. Congress can take \n     aggressive action to encourage production of energy efficient \n     vehicles, homes, and businesses. I believe there is much \n     technology available to reduce energy consumption. The \n     biggest challenge is to be able to put that knowledge into \n     mass production. Congress can create tax-breaks or other \n     incentives for the implementation of energy-saving technology \n     both in the business and private sectors. We, as individuals, \n     can make some difference in energy consumption, but in order \n     to make a significant difference, there must be strong \n     incentives for businesses to change the way they are doing \n     things! Those changes will only take place if the result is \n     increased bottom-line profits for them. Otherwise, they will \n     just keep passing along their increased energy costs to their \n     customers, further bankrupting our already strained economy. \n     We are seeing stress fractures everywhere in our economy, but \n     we must remember that the time of greatest challenge may also \n     offer the most opportunity to accomplish something truly \n     great. We are looking to you to lead us through these \n     challenging times; please do not let us down!\n     Jeanne Marie, Grace.\n                                  ____\n\n       Mr. Crapo, My husband and I are retired and both on \n     Medicare. We live in McCammon, so we have to drive at least \n     40 miles to get to our doctor, dentist, grocery store, etc, \n     We try to make as few trips as possible and car pool with \n     neighbors many times. We can limit our trips but we are \n     having problems with propane since it is our main source of \n     heat. We are now paying more than $300 a month for our \n     propane and it looks as if we will be paying more this \n     winter. We need to use our own resources and stop our \n     dependence on foreign oil. I think that we, as Americans, \n     take good care of our country and have consideration for the \n     earth and its resources. We are tired of being led by \n     conservationists that think they know what is best for all. \n     Many of my neighbors and family are worried and angry because \n     no one seems to be doing anything about the situation. We \n     need you to do something. Thank you.\n     Nancy, McCammon.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am horrified by the prospect of selling my Hummer. I am \n     also considering driving at 55 mph--is not that awful?\n       It is disgusting that Americans now have to pay almost as \n     much for gasoline for our gas-guzzlers as we do as for \n     bottled water.\n       Better drill every possible source of oil in the US--that \n     should allow us to continue to use up resources at the \n     highest rates in human history . . . for another year or \n     maybe two.\n     Debra Patla.\n                                  ____\n\n       Of course this has affected my wife and myself. We just \n     very recently retired, hoping to do some traveling. We have \n     already canceled a trip that we had so looked forward to \n     simply because of the cost of fuel. We will have to stay very \n     close to home now. Most of our disposable 'fun' income now \n     goes for gasoline.\n       You know that this happened on your watch.

If we did not have petroleum in the US \n     to make gas it would be different, but we have ways to have \n     gas brought in and it would not take that long. They need to \n     reevaluate this.\n     Deanna.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are small farmers and small business owners. We live 25 \n     miles from town which makes it a 50 mile round trip for \n     everything we do. These rising fuel prices has greatly \n     affected us and has made it hard. We have tried to conserve \n     by buying fuel economy cars, but because of the rising costs \n     we are paying substantially more for fuel than we were a year \n     ago or even six months ago. We believe that what should be \n     done is to use more of our domestic oil, cut environmental \n     red tape on refineries and other things and give incentives \n     for people to conserve. I do not think that by adding taxes \n     to the oil companies is going to solve anything. It will just \n     be passed on to the consumer, which is something we do not \n     need.\n     Randy.\n                                  ____\n\n       It is my opinion that we need to become independent from \n     Middle Eastern Oil. We need to reduce use, but also we need \n     to build more energy plants, of all kinds, in our own \n     country, including Nuclear, and responsibly drill our own \n     oil. If we are not dependent on foreign oil we are not held \n     hostage; We are not depleting our wealth while contributing \n     to theirs.\n       Thank you for asking for my opinion. I hope you listen to \n     everybody and I hope that you and your colleagues quit \n     playing politics and get it done. I am very tired of the \n     political drama. I have come to distrust all of you.\n     Janine.\n                                  ____\n\n       I would suggest that the government tell the people who \n     want more drilling that the oil companies should drill the \n     millions of acres they already hold hostage under contract \n     before we give them the rest. As an alternative let \n     wildcatters have the new options rather than more big oil \n     hostage land.\n     Kurt.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am single. I raised two boys on my own, assuming the role \n     of Mr. Mom for a number of years. Currently I work in \n     industrial sales. I am compensated through straight \n     commission. Year to date, my sales are off 30%. As \n     commissions have shrunk, costs have not. My employer has \n     informed me in September the cost for the company vehicle I \n     use will increase an additional hundred dollars a month. One \n     of my sons is out of work and had nowhere left to turn and is \n     home for the moment working odd jobs. He is a new commercial \n     pilot.\n       I am speaking in literal terms, not figuratively. I do not \n     know how I am going to pay the bills, put food on the table, \n     and gas in my personal vehicle. I will buy a half a tank of \n     gas for my vehicle payday (cannot use company rig), buy a lot \n     of hamburger, and I will draw on my credit line to cover the \n     bills the paycheck cannot.\n       Somehow I will make it. Not sure how, but I will. This \n     would be easier to accept what we are experiencing had it \n     been unavoidable. The fact of the matter is our current \n     situation was completely avoidable. Congress has failed at \n     every turn to demonstrate the kind of leadership needed. Both \n     parties are to blame. There is absolutely no excuse what so \n     ever for us importing any oil period!\n       We need to drill now and drill wherever possible while \n     developing other alternative energy systems.\n     Roger, New Plymouth.\n                                  ____\n\n       Thank you for the opportunity to share the affect rising \n     energy prices have on me and my family.

Mr. President, I congratulate the six-member team \nfrom Iolani School for winning the national title in the U.S. \nDepartment of Energy's 2009 Real World Design Challenge, RWDC. The \nchallenge is an annual competition that provides high school students \nwith the opportunity to apply the lessons of the classroom to important \nenergy and environment problems currently encountered in the \nengineering field. Iolani School's team placed first of 10 teams \ngathered from across the Nation in the competition finals held on March \n21, 2009 at the Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum. The theme \nfor the 2009 challenge was ``Aviation and Fuel Consumption.''\n  I wish to acknowledge the students' diligence, team work, and \ningenuity in crafting their winning solution to this year's daunting \nchallenge. Teams were provided detailed specifications and flight \ncapabilities of an actual twin-engine jet aircraft. Teams were then \nasked to improve the aircraft's fuel efficiency without drastically \nreducing its load capacity. I wish to acknowledge all team members on \ntheir success: Amy Ko, Adeline Li, Anya Liao, Celia Ou, Jessica Lynn \nSaylors, Julia Zhang. Their parents and families are recognized as well \nfor their commitment, sacrifice, and support that helped to encourage \nand instill the important values that led to their success.\n  However, these young women could not have achieved what they have \ndone without the additional support and knowledge of the fundamentals \nof science given to them by their coach, Dr. Carey Inouye. I commend \nDr. Inouye and all of their teachers at Iolani School on their \ndedication to instructing, nourishing, and inspiring the next \ngeneration of scientists and engineers.\n  I would also like to echo the comments made by U.S. Secretary of \nEnergy Steven Chu, who said that this ``competition shows that U.S. \nstudents, when challenged to excel, are able to perform at the highest \nlevels in science, math and engineering.'' I encourage these students \nto continue to study and follow their passions for science and \nengineering. I wish nothing but the best for the students, their \nfamilies, and coach and wish them and the program continued success in \nfuture endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/26/senate-section/article/S3894-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                OHIO NATIONAL GUARD'S 179TH AIRLIFT WING\n\n Mr. BROWN.

Mr. President, I wish to pay tribute to a native \nson of Iowa as he prepares to leave the nest he has diligently \nfeathered for more than three decades. A journalist who has earned his \nkeep for 34 years at the Des Moines Register, David Yepsen honed his \nskills as a fair and balanced reporter upon whom his readers grew to \ndepend to separate the wheat from the chaff.\n  With a few strokes of the keyboard, David Yepsen cut through layers \nof political posturing to identify stalemates at the statehouse or \nexpose stonewalling from Terrace Hill. A no-nonsense newspaperman, \nDavid built a reputation for his astute understanding of Iowa politics \nand policymaking on the local, State, and Federal levels of government. \nFrom local boards of education to county seats of government, \nstatehouse politics, and the Presidential campaign trail, David Yepsen \nknew how to boil down an issue and size up a candidate's prospects.\n  Like most Iowans, pomp and circumstance isn't his style. The genius \nof his political commentary is his ability to cut off grandstanding and \nget down to brass tacks. If the political leadership got bogged down in \npartisan gridlock, David would simply explain to voters in his next \ncolumn how their elected representatives were baling political hay on \nthe public's dime instead of ironing out the looming State budget \ndeficit.\n  A shrewd journalist, David Yepsen understood how to cultivate \ncontacts and build a reputation built on trust and truth. Cut from the \ngold standard cloth of journalism, David exercised independence and \ndiscovered that loyalty, like representative government, is a two-way \nstreet. No doubt the mutual agreement or lively disagreement with his \nsubjects, readers, and publishers made his job all the more satisfying.\n  Although schooled decades before the Internet, blogs, and other tools \ndelivered news to our laptops and cell phones, this seasoned reporter \nembraced the 24-hours news cycle. His profession bears the \nresponsibility and privileges granted by the freedom of the press in \nAmerican society. He upheld his end of the bargain by holding \nofficeholders, public officials, and candidates accountable to the \npeople. But he didn't fall victim to the ``gotcha'' style of ambush \njournalism that adds to public cynicism about the media and politics.\n  Instead, David fell back on his commitment to fairness and \nevenhandedness. That is the legacy David Yepsen will leave behind as he \npursues the next chapter in his professional career. Next month, he \nwill hang up his press credentials to assume leadership of the Paul \nSimon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University in \nCarbondale.\n  As I mentioned earlier, David Yepsen for more than 30 years has \nearned his paycheck and served the public as a reporter and political \ncolumnist at the Des Moines Register. For more than three decades, he \nimmersed himself whole hog into politics, issues, and campaigns that \nhave colored Iowa's landscape from the Missouri to the Mississippi \nRivers. David earned a scholarly grasp of public policy that will \nprepare him well for his new position. Hot-button issues in recent \ntimes have included regulating hog lots; legalizing gambling; preparing \nfor natural disasters and flood control; consolidating government from \nthe courthouse to the schoolhouse; harmonizing Iowa's production \nagriculture heritage with sustainable stewardship of our natural \nresources; investing in renewable energy; bringing 21st century \ntechnology to rural areas; developing tourism, parks, and trails; \nbalancing needs of an aging society; addressing Iowa's ``brain drain'', \nhandling immigration; and juggling interests of labor and business or \nrural and urban. Instead of treating these issues as lightning rods \nthat polarize people, David took the opportunity to challenge Iowans, \nwhether newcomers or oldtimers, to find common ground that would make \nour State an even better place to work, raise a family, enjoy a \nvacation, earn a world-class education, and retire.\n  David could slice through the debate with a lucid and logical \nreminder about just why it matters to taxpayers if the gas tax is \nraised during a recession or why Iowa lawmakers should seize the \nopportunity to take bold steps to restore and improve crumbling \ninfrastructure projects. He provoked Iowans to think outside the box, \nchoosing flattery or insult when necessary.\n  David faced the relentless scrutiny of his readers and also enjoyed \nmany personal and professional rewards. Iowa's David Yepsen was often \ncalled upon by national news organizations for his respected analysis \nof Presidential politics. His departure leaves behind a big set of \nfootprints in the fields of Iowa journalism and politics. I will really \nmiss seeing ``what Yepsen had to say in the Register'' but wish him all \nthe best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/26/senate-section/article/S3895-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S3895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING CHAD MECHELS\n\n Mr. THUNE. Mr. President, today I wish to pay honor to Deputy \nSheriff Chad Mechels of Madison, SD, who was killed in the line of duty \non Sunday, March 15, 2009, at the age of 32. He is survived by his wife \nJamie Mechels and two children, Avery, age 7, and Thomas, age 3.\n  Chad dedicated his life to a career in law enforcement. He graduated \nfrom the South Dakota Law Enforcement Academy in 2005. After \ngraduation, Chad worked with several law enforcement agencies including \nthe Lake County and Kingsbury County Sheriff's Departments. He was \ncurrently serving with the Turner County Sheriff's Department when his \nlife was tragically taken.\n  The sacrifice made by this brave officer is something we should \nalways remember.

A resolution adopted by the House of \n     Representatives of the State of Missouri urging the United \n     States Congress to reject the Freedom of Choice Act; to the \n     Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n                               Resolution\n\n       Whereas, the 111th United States Congress is considering \n     the Freedom of Choice Act, which purports to classify \n     abortion as a ``fundamental right'', equal in stature to the \n     right of free speech and the right to vote--rights that, \n     unlike abortion, are specifically enumerated in the United \n     States Constitution; and\n       Whereas, the federal Freedom of Choice Act would invalidate \n     any ``statute, ordinance, regulation, administrative order, \n     decision, policy, practice, or other action'' of any federal, \n     state, or local government or governmental office, or any \n     person acting under governmental authority that would ``deny \n     or interfere with a woman's right to choose'' abortion, or \n     that would ``discriminate against the exercise of the right . \n     . . in the regulation or provision of benefits, facilities, \n     services, or information''; and\n       Whereas, the federal Freedom of Choice Act would nullify \n     any federal or state law ``enacted, adopted, or implemented \n     before, on, or after the date of its enactment'' and would \n     effectively prevent the State of Missouri from enacting \n     similar protective measures in the future; and\n       Whereas, the federal Freedom of Choice Act would invalidate \n     more than 550 federal and state abortion-related laws, laws \n     supported by the majority of the American people; and\n       Whereas, the federal Freedom of Choice Act would \n     specifically invalidate the following commonsense protective \n     laws properly enacted by the State of Missouri:\n       (1) A parental consent law for minors seeking an abortion;\n       (2) A prohibition on government funding or use of public \n     facilities for abortions;\n       (3) Health and safety regulation for abortion facilities;\n       (4) A twenty-four-hour waiting period and informed consent \n     law that provides an opportunity to consider the gravity of a \n     decision to abort a child;\n       (5) A partial birth abortion ban (Infant's Protection Act);\n       (6) A requirement that only physicians can perform or \n     induce abortions and that such physicians maintain medical \n     malpractice insurance;\n       (7) Conscience protections for doctors and hospitals not \n     wanting to perform or induce abortions;\n       (8) A prohibition on performing or inducing abortions in \n     order to use fetal organs or tissue for transplantation or \n     experimentation;\n       (9) Licensing of most abortion clinics as ambulatory \n     surgical centers to ensure basic health and safety of \n     patients;\n       (10) Alternatives to abortion programs to encourage and \n     support women who do not want abortions; and\n\n[[Page S3897]]\n\n       Whereas, the federal Freedom of Choice Act will not make \n     abortion safe or rare, but will instead actively promote and \n     subsidize abortion with federal and state tax dollars and \n     will do nothing to ensure its safety; and\n       Whereas, the federal Freedom of Choice Act will protect and \n     promote the abortion industry, endanger women and their \n     health, promote a political ideology of unregulated abortion-\n     on-demand, and silence the voices of Americans who want to \n     engage in a meaningful public discussion and debate over the \n     availability, safety, and even desirability of abortion: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the members of the House of Representatives \n     of the Ninety-fifth General Assembly, hereby strongly oppose \n     the federal Freedom of Choice Act and urge the United States \n     Congress to summarily reject it; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Missouri House of Representatives \n     strongly opposes the federal Freedom of Choice Act because:\n       (1) It seeks to circumvent the states' general legislative \n     authority as guaranteed by the 10th Amendment of the United \n     States Constitution;\n       (2) It seeks to undermine the right and responsibility of \n     the states and the people to debate, vote on, and determine \n     abortion policy;\n       (3) The protection of women's health through state \n     regulation on abortion is a compelling state interest that \n     should not be nullified by Congress; and\n       (4) Its enactment would nullify laws in the State of \n     Missouri that the Missouri General Assembly and the people of \n     Missouri strongly support; and be it further\n       Resolved, That the Chief Clerk of the Missouri House of \n     Representatives be instructed to prepare a properly inscribed \n     copy of this resolution for Barack Obama, President of the \n     United States; the Majority Leader and Minority Leader of the \n     United States Senate; the Majority Leader and Minority Leader \n     of the United States House of Representatives; each member of \n     the Missouri Congressional delegation;

A bill to amend title XVIII of the Social Security Act to \nimprove the Medicare program for beneficiaries residing in rural areas; \nto the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today, along with my colleague Senator \nCollins from Maine, I am introducing legislation to address the needs \nof the nearly one-quarter of all Medicare beneficiaries who live in \nrural America. These beneficiaries are systematically disadvantaged in \nthe Medicare program. The beauty of Medicare is its equity, its \nuniversality, and its accessibility. But we have compromised these \nvalues by stratifying payments, by under-representing rural voices on \nthe Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, and by continuing to use \nobsolete payment data that hurts rural America.\n  First, we must stop indexing physician payments for work based on \ngeographic differences. Rural areas already have a hard enough time \nrecruiting and retaining the Nation's top talent. Currently, even \nthough 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries live in rural areas, only \n10 percent of the nation's physicians serve them. Lower payments to \ndoctors in these areas only perpetuate this dangerous shortage of \nmedical expertise. We should not be discouraging medical school \ngraduates from moving to underserved rural areas by continuing to offer \nsub-par pay--in fact, we should be providing incentives to encourage \nthem to work in underserved areas. My legislation proposes a project to \nhelp rural facilities to host educators and clinical practitioners in \nclinical rotations.\n  Lack of dollars to rural health facilities has also prevented \ncommunities from investing in vital information technology. The \nInstitute of Medicine published a report in 2005 detailing the ways in \nwhich health IT could assist isolated communities. For example, since \nrural physicians tend to be generalists rather than specialists, \nvirtual libraries within physician offices would provide both doctors \nand patients with a wider and deeper source of information at their \nfingertips. Rural residents can also be quite far from health \nfacilities, so technology that allows emergency room physicians to \ncommunicate with EMS workers in an ambulance can help patients receive \nlife-saving treatment before they physically reach the hospital. These \nkinds of technologies will improve both the quality and efficiency of \ncare given in rural areas. My legislation offers funding for quality \nimprovement demonstration projects, to allow isolated communities to \ninvest in this otherwise out of reach technology.\n  Lastly, this legislation will end the disproportionately low \nrepresentation of rural interests on the Medicare Payment Advisory \nCommission. This lack of representation has resulted in policies that \nhurt rural communities. Those policies have hurt--and continue to \nhurt--the people of my State of Wisconsin, and they hurt my colleague \nSenator Collins' constituents as well. For every dollar that Medicare \nspends on the average beneficiary in the average state in this country, \nMedicare spends only 82 cents on a beneficiary in Wisconsin. In Maine, \nMedicare spends only 80 cents per dollar it spends on the average \nbeneficiary.\n  How is this the case, if beneficiaries in Wisconsin and in Maine pay \nthe same payroll taxes as beneficiaries in other states? Because the \ndistribution of Medicare dollars among the 50 States is grossly unfair \nto Wisconsin, and to much of the Upper Midwest. Wisconsinites pay \npayroll taxes just like every American taxpayer, but the Medicare funds \nwe get in return are lower than those received in many other States.\n  With the guidance and support of people across my State who are \nfighting for Medicare fairness, I am introducing this legislation to \naddress Medicare's discrimination against Wisconsin's seniors and \nhealth care providers. My bill will decrease some of the inequitable \npayments that harm rural areas. It will provide rural areas the help \nthey need to grow crucial health information technology infrastructure. \nIt will offer the necessary incentives to help attract the Nation's top \nmedical talent to underserved rural areas. It will mandate rural \nrepresentation on the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission. Rural \nseniors are already underserved in their communities; they should not \nbe underrepresented in Washington as well.\n  Rural Americans have worked hard and paid into the Medicare program \nall their lives. In return, they deserve full access to the same \nbenefits as seniors throughout the country: their choice of highly \nskilled physicians, use of the latest technologies, and a strong voice \nrepresenting their needs in Medicare policy.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 712\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to establish the National Criminal Justice Commission; \nto the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. WEBB. Today I am pleased to be introducing a piece of legislation \ndesigned to establish a national criminal justice commission. I do so \nwith, at the moment, 12 cosponsors, including our majority leader, the \nchairman and the ranking Republican on the Senate Judiciary Committee, \nthe chairman and the ranking member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on \nCrime and Drugs, and other members of our leadership. I introduce this \nbill after more than 2 years of effort here in the Senate that I will \nexplain shortly; also with the prior conferral with Supreme Court \nJustice Kennedy and having discussed this matter with the President and \nthe Attorney General, both of whom I think are strongly supportive of \nthis concept.\n  Our design, our goal in this legislation, is to create a national \ncommission with an 18-month timeline, not to simply talk about the \nproblems that we have in our criminal justice system but actually to \nlook at all of the elements in this system, how they are interrelated \nin terms of the difficulties that we have in remedying issues of \ncriminal justice in this country, and to deliver us from a situation \nthat has evolved over time where we are putting far too many of the \nwrong people into prison and we are still not feeling safer in our \nneighborhoods; we are still not putting in prison or bringing to \njustice those people who are perpetrating violence and criminality as a \nway of life.\n  I would like to say that, although I am not on the Judiciary \nCommittee, I come to this issue as someone who first became interested \nin criminal justice issues while I was serving as a U.S. marine, \nserving on a number of courts-martial and thinking about the \ninterrelationship between discipline and fairness; then after that, \nfrom having spent time as an attorney at one point representing, pro \nbono, a young former marine who had been convicted of murder in \nVietnam. I represented him for 6 years pro bono. He took his life \nhalfway through this process. I cleared his name 3 years later, but I \nbecame painfully aware of how sometimes inequities infect our process.\n  Prior to joining the Senate, I spent time as a journalist, including \na stint 25 years ago as the first American journalist to have been \ninside the Japanese prison system, where I became aware of the systemic \ndifficulties and challenges\n\n[[Page S3901]]\n\nwe have. At that time, 25 years ago, Japan was half our population, and \nhad only 40,000 sentenced prisoners in jail. We had 480,000. Today, we \nhave 2.38 million prisoners in our criminal justice system and another \n5 million involved in the process, either due to probation or parole \nsituations.\n  This is a system that is very much in need of the right sort of \noverarching examination. I do note the senior Senator from Pennsylvania \nhas joined me on the Senate floor. I am very gratified he has also \njoined me as the lead Republican on this measure. I look forward to \nhearing from him as soon as I am finished with my remarks.\n  The third thing I would like to say at the outset is, I believe very \nstrongly, even though we are a Federal body, that there is a compelling \nnational interest for us to examine this issue and reshape and reform \nour criminal justice system at the Federal, State, and local levels. I \nbelieve the commission I am going to present would provide us with that \nopportunity.\n  I start with a premise I do think not a lot of Americans are aware \nof. We have 5 percent of the world's population. We have 25 percent of \nthe world's known prison population. We have an incarceration rate in \nthe United States, the world's greatest democracy, that is five times \nas high as the incarceration rate in the rest of the world.\n  There are only two possibilities. Either we have the most evil people \non Earth living in the United States or we are doing something \ndramatically wrong in terms of how we approach the issue of criminal \njustice. And I would ask my fellow Senators and my fellow citizens to \nthink about the challenges that attend these kind of numbers when we \nare looking at people who have been released from prison and are \nreentering American society.\n  We have hundreds and thousands of American people who are reentering \nAmerican society without the sort of transition that would allow a \ngreat percentage of them to again become productive citizens.\n  I think we need to look at this in terms of our own history, our own \nrecent history. This is a chart that shows our incarceration rate from \n1925 until today. Beginning in about 1980, our incarceration rate \nstarted to skyrocket. What has happened since 1980 is not reflective of \nwhere our own history has been on this issue. That is another need, why \nwe need to examine it fuller. We also, for a complex set of reasons, \nare warehousing the mentally ill in our prisons. We now have four times \nas many mentally ill people in our prisons than we do in mental \ninstitutions. There are a complex set of reasons for that, but the main \npoint for all of us to consider is, these people who are in prison are \nnot receiving the kind of treatment they would need in order to remedy \nthe disabilities that have brought them to that situation.\n  Drug incarceration has sharply increased over the past three decades. \nIn 1980, we had 41,000 drug offenders in prison. Today we have more \nthan 500,000. That is an increase of 112 percent.\n  Those blue disks represent the numbers in 1980. The red disks \nrepresent the numbers in 2007. A significant percent of these \nindividuals are incarcerated for possession or nonviolent drug \noffenses, and in many cases, criminal offenses that stem from drug \naddiction and those sorts of related behavioral issues.\n  African Americans are about 12 percent of our population. Contrary to \na lot of thought and rhetoric, their drug use, in terms of frequent \ndrug use rate, is about the same as all other elements of our society, \nabout 14 percent. But they end up being 37 percent of those arrested on \ndrug charges, 59 percent of those convicted, and 74 percent of those \nsentenced to prison, by the numbers that have been provided to us and \nto the Joint Economic Committee. This is a disturbing statistic for us. \nI emphasize to my colleagues and to others that the issues we face with \nrespect to criminal justice are not overall racial issues. They involve \nissues, in many cases, of how people are treated based on their ability \nto have proper counsel and other issues like that. But this is a \nstatistic with respect to drugs that we all must come to terms with.\n  At the same time, I say we are putting too many of the wrong people \nin prison, and we are not solving the problems that will bring safety \nto our communities. Gangs are a hot issue today. I am on the Armed \nServices Committee. I am on the Foreign Relations Committee. There has \nbeen a lot of back and forth in recent months about the transnational \ngangs that are emanating across the Mexican border. Approximately 1 \nmillion gang members are currently in our country today. And I emphasis \nthis is not an issue that is simply existent along the Mexican border. \nThis is an issue that affects every community in the United States, and \nit is not simply an issue with respect to the Mexican drug cartels, \nalthough theirs are the most violent and the most visible today.\n  The Mexican drug cartels are operating in more than 230 American \ncities, not simply along the border. The incidents along on the border \nilluminate the largeness of this problem and of this challenge. Gangs \nin many areas of the United States commit 80 percent of the crimes. \nThey are heavily involved in drug distribution, but they are involved \nin other violent activities as well.\n  There has been some talk over the past few days about how our \nposition toward drugs and our gun policies feed this problem. I would \nask my colleagues to think very hard about that. Drugs are a demand-\npull problem in the United States, there is no question about that. \nThere are a lot of weapons that are going back and forth across the \nborder. But we should remember the Mexican drug cartels are capable of \nvery sophisticated levels of quasi-military violence.\n  Many of the members who are brought into the gangs by the drug \ncartels are former Mexican military. Some of them have been trained by \nour own special forces, and the weapons they use are not the kind of \nweapons you are going to buy at a gun show. You do not get automatic \nweapons, RPGs, and grenades at a gun show.\n  We have to realize these cartels have a lot of money. By some \nindications they make profit levels of about $25 billion a year. They \ncan buy the weapons they want. We have to get on top of this as a \nnational priority. Again, it is not simply the transnational gangs that \ncome out of Mexico. Many of them are Central American.\n  In Northern Virginia, right across the Potomac River, we have \nthousands of members who belong to the MS-13 gangs emanating out of \nCentral America, who are very active up the I-95 corridor. There are \nAsian gangs. We have to get our arms around this problem as we address \nthe other problem of mass incarceration in the United States.\n  Another piece of this issue I hope we will be able to address with \nthis national criminal justice commission is what happens inside our \nprisons. When I was looking at the Japanese system many years ago, \ntheir model in terms of prison administration was basically designed \nafter a traditional military model. You could not be a warden in a \nJapanese jail unless you started as a turnkey. They had national \nexaminations. They had a year of preparation, training in psychology, \nin counseling techniques, before an individual was allowed to be a \nturnkey in a jail. The promotion systems were internal, like the U.S. \nmilitary. It provided a quality career path, and it brought highly \ntrained people in at the very beginning.\n  We do not have that in America. Prisons vary warden to warden; they \nvary locality to locality. We need to examine a better way to do that \nin our country.\n  We also have a situation in this country with respect to prison \nviolence and sexual victimization that is off the charts. We must get \nour arms around this problem.\n  We also have many people in our prisons who are among what are called \nthe criminally ill, people who are suffering from hepatitis and HIV who \nare not getting the sorts of treatment they deserve.\n  I started, once I arrived in the Senate, working on this issue. I was \npleased to be working with Senator Schumer on the Joint Economic \nCommittee. He allowed me to chair hearings to try to get our arms \naround this problem and see what sort of legislative approach might \nhelp. I chaired a hearing on mass incarceration in October of 2007. I \nchaired another hearing last year on the overall impact of illegal \ndrugs from point of origin through the criminal justice system. How \ndoes this work in terms of the underground\n\n[[Page S3902]]\n\nbusiness environment? How does it work in terms of the disparity in \ntreatment of people who end up incarcerated? How does it affect \npeople's long-term lives? What are the costs associated with it?\n  I was able to work with the George Mason University Law Center to put \ntogether a forum bringing people in from across the country to talk \nabout our overall drug policy. Once we started talking about this, \nparticularly over the last year, we started being contacted by people \nall across the country, people from every different aspect of the \npolitical and the philosophical areas that come into play when we talk \nabout incarceration. It is a very emotional issue.\n  As I said, I heard from Justice Kennedy at the Supreme Court. I have \nheard from prosecutors, judges, defense lawyers, former offenders, \npeople in prison, police on the street. All of them are saying we have \na mess; we have a mess. We have to get a holistic view of how to solve \nit. There are many good pieces of legislation that have been introduced \nin the Congress to deal with different pieces of this issue. But after \ngoing through this process over the past year, I have come to the \nconclusion that the way we should address this is with a national \ncommission that will examine all of these pieces together and make \nspecific findings so we can turn it around.\n  These are examples of some of the editorial support that we have \nreceived. I have written a piece for Parade magazine which will be out \nthis weekend to summarize the challenges we have; I hope our fellow \ncitizens will take a look at it.\n  As to the design of this legislation, we are looking for two things. \nOne is to shape a commission with bipartisan balance: the President \nnominating the chairman; the majority and minority leaders in the \nSenate, in consultation with the Judiciary Committee, each nominating \ntwo members; the Speaker of the House and the House Minority Leader, in \nconcert with the Judiciary Committee, each nominating two members; and \nthe National Governors Association, Republican and Democrat, each \ngetting one member. The idea is not to have a group of people who are \ngoing to sit around and simply remonstrate about the problem. It is to \nget a group of people with credibility and wide expertise to examine \nspecific findings and to come up with policy recommendations on an 18-\nmonth time period.\n  This commission will be asked to investigate the reasons in our own \nhistory that we have seen this incredible increase in incarceration. \nWhat do other countries do, particularly countries that have the same \nbasic governmental systems we do? How do they handle comparable types \nof crime? What should we do about prison administration policies, \nprison management? How can we bring more quality, stability, and \npredictability in terms of the prison environment itself? What are the \ncosts of our current incarceration policies, not only in terms of the \nbillions of dollars we spend on building prisons or the billions we \nspend on housing people in prisons but also in terms of lost \nopportunities with our post-prison systems, and how we can better \nmanage that area. What is the impact of gang activities, including \nthese transnational gangs, and how should we approach that issue, not \nsimply in terms of incarceration but as a nation that is under duress \nfrom not being able to respond properly? Importantly, what are we going \nto do about drug policy, the whole area of drug policy, and how does \nthat affect sentencing procedures and other alternatives we might look \nat? We need to examine the policies as they relate to the mentally ill. \nWe should look at the historical role of the military when it comes to \nhow we are approaching these cross-border situations, particularly on \nthe Mexican border. Finally, importantly, any other area the Commission \ndeems relevant.\n  This is our best effort, after 2 years of coming up with the universe \nof issues that need to be examined. There are many people, including \nthe senior Senator from Pennsylvania, who have worked on these areas \nfor a number of years. If they have specific findings they believe the \nCommission should review, we are very happy to accommodate that.\n  The first step for the commission would be to give us findings, \nfactual findings. From those findings, then give us recommendations for \npolicy changes. The same areas I addressed in terms of findings apply \nin terms of the policy recommendations: How we can refocus our \nincarceration policies, work toward properly reducing the incarceration \nrate in fair, cost-effective ways that still protect communities; how \nwe should address the issue of prison violence in all forms; how we can \nimprove prison administration; how we can establish meaningful reentry \nprograms. I believe with the high volume of people coming out of \nprisons, we must, on a national level, assist local and State \ncommunities in figuring out a way to transition these people so those \nformer offenders who are not going to become recidivists will have a \ntrue pathway to get away from the stigma of incarceration and move into \na productive future.\n  Again, importantly, the last category, any other aspect of the system \nthe Commission or the people participating in it determine necessary.\n  This is our approach. I am gratified to have had as initial \ncosponsors six members of the Senate Judiciary Committee, including the \nchairman, Senator Leahy; the ranking Republican, Senator Specter; the \nchairman of the Subcommittee on Crime and Drugs, Senator Durbin; the \nranking Republican on that subcommittee, Senator Graham; and a number \nof others, including key Democratic leadership--most importantly, our \nleader.\n  I hope we can get this legislation done this year. This is an issue \nthat does not percolate up in the same way. It doesn't have a \nprogrammatic element to it in many cases, but it is an issue that \nthreatens every community and begs for the notion of fairness.\n  I see the senior Senator from Pennsylvania is on the floor. I greatly \nadmire the work he has done in this area over many years, and I \nappreciate his support on this endeavor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. SPECTER. I begin by complimenting my distinguished colleague from \nVirginia for his initiative in proposing the creation of a national \ncommission to examine criminal justice. There have been many \nCommissions in recent years, recent decades. But the problems which we \nare now confronting warrant a fresh look. Senator Webb has proposed \nthat. This Commission has the potential to be not just another \nCommission but to make some very significant advances on this very \nserious problem.\n  The principal issue on crime is public security, protection from \nviolent criminals. I have long believed the issue could be divided into \ntwo parts. One is the violent career criminals. They are defined as \nsomeone who has committed three or more serious crimes. One of the \nfirst bills which I authored was the armed career criminal bill, which \nwas enacted in 1984, which made it a Federal offense punishable by what \nis the equivalent of a life sentence under the Federal system, 15 years \nto life, for anyone caught in possession of a firearm who has committed \nthree or more offenses--a robbery, burglary, rape, arson or the sale of \ndrugs. Statistics show that about 70 percent of violent crimes are \ncommitted by career criminals. It is my view, shared by many, that \nthose people ought to be sent to jail for life. They ought to be \nseparated from society. The second category involves those who have \nbeen convicted of crimes and who are going to be released. With respect \nto juveniles, we call that juvenile delinquency, at least in \nPennsylvania we do, as opposed to a criminal charge. They are going to \nbe released. First and second offenders are going to be released. The \nobject is, how do we deal with them to, No. 1, protect society and, No. \n2, to take them out of the crime cycle so they can have productive, \ncontributing lives in society? We know what to do, but we have never \ndone it. The steps are to work with those who suffer from drug abuse or \nalcohol abuse. We find that 70 to 80 percent of the people arrested \nhave drug or alcohol problems. They have to be treated, detoxification. \nThen they need literacy training. So many cannot read or write. Then \nthey need job training so they will have a trade or skill. Then they \nneed to be placed in society.\n  It is no surprise, when someone who is a functional illiterate, \nwithout a trade or skill, gets out of jail, that the\n\n[[Page S3903]]\n\nodds are high they will go back to jail. There are a number of programs \nbut not enough, not sufficiently carefully thought through, to place \npeople. We have tax credits which will encourage employers to hire \npeople. In the stimulus package for veterans or juvenile offenders, \nthere is a 40-percent tax break on the first $6,000 of a job which is \npaid. That is a start. But it doesn't go very far. We have been \nunwilling to make the kind of investment to provide that kind of \nrealistic rehabilitation. Therefore, we have recidivism and the \nrevolving door in our jails. The public is the principal loser because \nthese people come out and commit more crimes. Individuals are lost. So \nboth in terms of the individual on rehabilitation, to have a productive \nrole in society, a decent life, and for public safety. Candidly, you \ndon't get too far on legislation looking out for the criminals on \nrehabilitation. But when you talk about the threat to society from \nrepeat crimes, then people pick up their ears.\n  There has been a fascinating debate recently about whether we can \nafford to have a criminal justice system that keeps people in jail and \nprotects the public, whether we can afford to have the death penalty \nimposed. Is it too expensive to undertake the litigation process for \nsociety. I do not think we can make a decision on public safety based \nupon cost. Security is the basic purpose, fundamental first purpose of \nGovernment. National security on the international scene, protection \nfrom attacks; now we have a new form of security in terrorism. When we \ncome to the domestic scene, it is a matter of having safety on the \nstreets. There is a debate as to whether we ought to have the death \npenalty. That is a worthwhile debate. The Supreme Court has been moving \nin a number of areas to limit the application of the death penalty.\n  From my experience as district attorney of Philadelphia, I believe \nthe death penalty is a deterrent. I questioned FBI Director Mueller \nabout it yesterday in the Judiciary oversight hearing. Director Mueller \nthinks the death penalty ought to be retained.\n  When I was an assistant DA many years ago, I had a case in the \nPennsylvania Supreme Court when I was chief of the appeals division. \nThere were three young hoodlums, Williams, Caters, and Rivers. They \nwere 19, 18, and 17. They planned a robbery. The two younger ones, \nCater and Rivers, said to Williams, who had a gun: We are not going if \nyou take the gun along. They had IQs under 100 but were smart enough to \nknow that if a gun was taken, there might be a killing. That would be \nfelony murder and they could get the death penalty. Williams said: I \nwon't take the gun. He put it in the drawer, slammed it shut. Then, \nunbeknownst to Cater and Rivers, he took the gun back, put it in his \npocket, went to rob a grocer in north Philadelphia, a tussle ensued. \nWilliams pulled the gun and shot and killed a man named Viner. All \nthree were sentenced to death in the electric chair. Williams actually \nwas executed. This goes back to about 1960. Cater and Rivers got a life \nsentence.\n  I argued the case in the State Supreme Court which upheld the death \npenalties and then later, when I was district attorney, I joined in the \nrecommendation of a life sentence for Cater and Rivers. The point is \nthat even with a marginal IQ, there was a deterrent effect. The \ncritical factor in my thinking on their not having the death penalty \nwas they didn't want to take the weapon. In the eyes of the law, they \nwere as guilty as Williams. They were coconspirators. When you rob and \na killing ensues, a murder ensues, it is murder in the first degree and \ncalls for the death penalty.\n  The commission which has been proposed here today ought to take a \nlook at white-collar crime, and ought to make an evaluation of the \nsentencing which has been imposed and whether it is adequate. If you \nare dealing with a domestic quarrel, a husband-wife dispute--there are \nmany homicides arising in that context--a jail sentence is not a \ndeterrent. If you are dealing with white-collar crime, there is a \ndeterrent.\n  Today, we have--and I questioned FBI Director Mueller about this \nyesterday. He said they have many investigations being undertaken as a \nresult of what has happened with corporate fraud, the misrepresentation \nof assets, leading us to the tremendous economic problems which we face \ntoday. There is no doubt about the deterrent effect. I urged Director \nMueller to expedite some of the cases.\n  There is great public concern about whether there will be \naccountability. I said yesterday--and repeat to--we do not want to send \nanybody to jail who does not deserve to go to jail, but you do not have \nto investigate a case for years and bring forth 100 charges, 100 counts \nof an indictment. It can be done on a much more rapid pace and have an \nappropriate trial and have a result, and it would be important to show \nthe example and to show the American people there is accountability.\n  When we talk about the jails, the commission ought to make a \ndetermination as to whether there are people in jail who ought not to \nbe in jail. This morning's news has a report about the State of New \nYork reexamining sentencing on drug laws. There is a lot of thought \nthat the drug laws catch too many people, and many people go to jail \nwho ought not to be in jail. Well, that is a question that ought to be \nexamined.\n  Our whole prison system in Pennsylvania is called a correctional \nsystem, which is a misnomer. It does not correct people. It does not \nhave the facilities to correct people. What they do is warehouse.\n  A related issue that considerable work has been done on recently is \nthe issue of mentoring. We have some 80,000 at-risk youth in the city \nof Philadelphia, determined by a hearing which was held recently. Those \nat-risk youth can go one of two ways: They can move through the \neducation system, if they have proper guidance; or they can be on the \nstreets and turn into criminals, as so many of them do.\n  Mentoring is a way of providing some guidance. There are so many \nsingle-parent homes--a working mother, nobody to give guidance. We have \nappropriated federally, recently, $25 million nationally for five \ntarget cities, one of which is Philadelphia, but that is a very modest \nbeginning. But to be a surrogate parent, you have an opportunity. That \nis a subject which a commission ought to undertake.\n  Those are some of the ideas which are current in this very complex \nfield. In trying to estimate the cost of crime, it is hard to do. My \nown judgment would be, if you put a billion-dollar price figure on the \ncost of robberies, burglaries, corporate fraud, automobile thefts, to \nsay nothing about the pain and suffering people have--the anxiety in \nthe middle of the night when there is a loud noise in your house; the \nconsolation you have, to some extent, from an alarm system that does \nnot go too far--but this is a big problem in America, and it is a \nproblem which has largely gone unsolved.\n  Problems of crime are the same today as they were when I first \nentered the field as an assistant district attorney decades ago. There \nare ways to deal with violent crime. There are ways to deal with \nrealistic rehabilitation. There are ways to deal with deterrence on \nwhite-collar crime--that it ought not to be only a fine, which turns \nout to be a license to do business. In the confirmation hearing of the \nnew Assistant Attorney General for the Criminal Division, that point \nwas emphasized.\n  But what Senator Webb has had to say today, and the blueprint he has \noutlined, could be a major advance on a very complex problem, which \nneeds a--I was about to say ``solution,'' but there is not going to be \na solution--but there can be an enormous amelioration if we tackle the \nproblem with the guidance that could be provided by the Webb \ncommission. May I give it the name: The Webb commission? Hearing no \nobjection, so ordered.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Virginia.\n  Mr. WEBB. I wish to express my appreciation to the senior Senator \nfrom Pennsylvania for joining me on this legislation and in this \nendeavor because it will be an endeavor, as the Senator knows, well \nbeyond the legislative approval of the commission. I think this is \ngoing to take years. But I wish to express my appreciation for that, \nfor his comments today, and for all the work he has done in this field.\n  I wish to emphasize a couple of things, in reaction to what the \nSenator mentioned. I agree. I do believe we can\n\n[[Page S3904]]\n\nmeaningfully address this problem. And ``solution'' is perhaps a more \nillusive word. But we can certainly meaningfully address this problem. \nI think it is very important to say that it is in the interest of every \nAmerican we do so.\n  There are a lot of people who will look at this and talk about \nspecific elements of who has committed a crime and whether you should \ndo the time and these sorts of things, but we do need to sort it out. \nWhen we have 5 percent of the world's population and 25 percent of the \nworld's prison population, there are better ways. When we still have \npublic safety issues in every community because of gang violence, and \nparticularly transnational gang violence at this moment, there are \nbetter ways.\n  That is the purpose of having a commission: getting the greatest \nminds in this area in the country together, with a specific timeline, \nto bring us specific findings and recommendations for the entire gamut \nof criminal justice in the country--not simply incarceration, not \nsimply gang violence, not simply reentry--but all of those and other \nissues together, so we can have a much needed and long overdue \nrestructuring of how we address the issue of crime in this country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that Senator Kennedy be added as an original \ncosponsor on this bill.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEVIN (for himself, Ms. Snowe, Ms. Stabenow, Ms. Collins, \n        and Mr. Schumer):\n  S. 715. A bill to establish a pilot program to provide for the \npreservation and rehabilitation of historic lighthouses; to the \nCommittee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. President, today, with Senators Snowe, Stabenow, \nCollins and Schumer, I introduce The National Lighthouse Stewardship \nAct. This legislation creates a three-year competitive grant program at \nthe Department of the Interior that will help to pay for the \npreservation and rehabilitation of historic lighthouses in Michigan and \nacross the country. The grants will help nonprofit organizations, which \nserve as caretakers for these historic landmarks, to help them preserve \nand rehabilitate the historic lighthouses and keep them accessible to \nthe public.\n  This legislation complements a bill that was enacted in October 2000, \nthe National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act, which I joined Sen. \nFrank Murkowski in offering. With the Coast Guard getting out of the \nlighthouse business, the National Historic Lighthouse Preservation Act \nhelped facilitate the process of transferring historic lighthouses from \nthe government to non-profit historical organizations who would take \nover the responsibility for their care. It established an expedited \nprocess through the Government Services Agency to help ease lighthouse \ntransfers by helping to cut through the bureaucratic red tape. As a \nresult of the law, 46 lighthouses to date--9 in Michigan--have been \ntransferred to custodians who will preserve them and keep them \naccessible to the public.\n  Many of these lighthouse structures are in need of significant repair \nand rehabilitation, which is now the responsibility of their nonprofit \ncustodians. Unfortunately, after obtaining custody of the lighthouses, \nmany of the nonprofit organizations have struggled to raise the funds \nto adequately restore and maintain the lighthouses. To address this \nproblem our legislation establishes a pilot program that would enable \nstate and nonprofit groups to apply for competitive grants to help with \nrestoration and maintenance efforts. This pilot program would authorize \nthe secretary to distribute $20 million a year for 3 years.\n  Funding for Lighthouse restoration is important to Michigan and to \nthe Nation's historic preservation efforts. There are approximately 740 \nlighthouses in 31 coastal states. Michigan alone has over 120 \nlighthouses, more than any other State. They draw thousands of visitors \nto Michigan and other States each year and create jobs throughout our \nStates. Michigan's and the Nation's lighthouses are national treasures \nthat beautify our shorelines. These historic lighthouses are part of \nour Nation's rich maritime heritage. The grants are needed to help \nnonprofit organizations, which serve as caretakers for the historic \nlandmarks, to maintain the beauty of the lighthouses and keep them \naccessible to the public.\n  My office worked closely with lighthouse preservation groups in \ndrafting this legislation. The Michigan Lighthouse Fund in my home \nstate was invaluable in providing information on the needs of our \nNation's lighthouses. This week in Washington, the American Lighthouse \nCoordinating Committee is meeting to coincide with the introduction of \nthis act. These funds are desperately needed by these groups who work \ntirelessly to preserve our Nation's maritime heritage.\n  This funding would help ensure our lighthouses remain cultural \nbeacons for generations to come. America's lighthouses are national \ntreasures that we cannot let deteriorate to the point beyond repair. I \nhope my colleagues will support the swift enactment of the National \nLighthouse Stewardship Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that letters of support be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be placed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                                               American Lighthouse\n\n\n                                       Coordinating Committee,\n\n                                     Evanston, IL, March 26, 2009.\n       Members of the United States Senate: I'm writing to urge \n     your support of the National Lighthouse Stewardship Act of \n     2009 as introduced by Senators Levin and Stabenow (MI), and \n     Snowe (ME).\n       Since passage of the National Lighthouse Preservation Act \n     of 2000, responsibility for management of many historic \n     lighthouses has been transferred from the US Coast Guard to \n     the public sector. While these facilities remain the property \n     of the federal government, the cost for their preservation \n     and programming is borne by local government and nonprofit \n     organizations with very limited economic resources. As a \n     result, these agencies require assistance in meeting the \n     demands of maintaining historic lighthouses so that they are \n     safe and accessible. The proposed National Lighthouse \n     Stewardship Act of 2009 recognizes the important role of this \n     new generation of administrative organizations in properly \n     managing these facilities. And, it provides a means by which \n     some dedicated funding is made available from the US \n     Government to support projects that will maintain structural \n     integrity.\n       Since this transfer program began, historic lighthouses \n     still brighten our lives and are now adaptively used for many \n     different purposes that include museums and centers of \n     education for the interpretation of U.S. maritime history; as \n     facilities to aid in environmental research of oceans and \n     Great Lakes; and to promote local and regional tourism. This \n     has resulted in an overwhelmingly positive public response \n     and is testimony to Americans' desire to preserve and use \n     these built resources.\n       Passage of the National Lighthouse Stewardship Act of 2009 \n     is essential to the continued success of this federal \n     transfer program and mirrors public sentiment for the \n     preservation of historic lighthouse properties to benefit \n     public interests.\n       The American Lighthouse Coordinating Committee (ALCC) is a \n     consortium of organizations and individuals across the United \n     States that actively engage in the operation of historic \n     lighthouse properties and which strongly supports adoption of \n     this legislation.\n       Respectfully submitted, this 26th day of March 2009.\n                                                 Donald J. Terras,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                 Michigan Lighthouse Alliance,\n\n                                                   March 20, 2009.\n     Senator Carl Levin,\n     Russell Office Building,\n     U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator Levin: We are writing to you in support of \n     your bill to redirect the nominal port fees towards \n     lighthouse restoration grant programs. The amount of money \n     your office has identified that could be coming to those of \n     us on the front lines of the restoration effort would make a \n     huge difference in the quality of our work.\n       Most lighthouses are located in out of the way places. As \n     such, the number of people living around these remote \n     structures is limited, and thus the local funding available \n     for work is limited. It is difficult to keep the numbers of \n     volunteers and find resources for materials in such a \n     challenging situation.\n       But to see a large increase in the available grant funds \n     not only in our home state of Michigan, but throughout the \n     US, would surely help us get these wonderful icons of our \n     collective maritime history restored and ready for the next \n     generations to learn from and support as well. Being able to \n     attract the next generations of stewards is a constant \n     subject of conversation in our circles, and having sufficient \n     funding available to make this volunteer effort attractive \n     would really help out.\n       In addition, MLA would like to make a request. As you know \n     things are very tight in our state budget now, and it would \n     be extremely helpful for us if a small part of our state \n     allocation could go towards a full time MLA staff person who \n     could support the grant program by visiting our members and\n\n[[Page S3905]]\n\n     reaching out with education on how to fill out the grant \n     requests, and other technical support. Right now our Alliance \n     is all volunteer as well, and we love what we do, but often \n     lament the loss of the staff person we had at MI SHPO. As the \n     representative voice now for all of Michigan's lighthouse \n     groups, we can be much more supportive and effective if we \n     had funding for a full time staffer.\n       Thank you as always for all you have done to advance the \n     lighthouse movement in Michigan and throughout the country. \n     You can count on the MLA and it's dozens of member groups and \n     their volunteers to be behind you on this bill, just ask for \n     what help you need!\n           Sincerely,\n         Buzz Hoerr, President, Harbor Beach Lighthouse \n           Preservation; Lou Schillinger, Vice President, Port \n           Austin Reef Light Association; Sally Frye, Sec'y/\n           Treasurer, Fox Point Lighthouse Association; Ann Method \n           Green, DeTour Reef Light Preservation Society; John \n           Gronberg, Holland Harbor Lighthouse Historical \n           Commission; Dick Moehl, Great Lakes Lightkeepers \n           Association; Jeff Shook, Michigan Lighthouse \n           Conservancy; Susan Skibbe, Thunder Bay Island; Gail \n           Vander Stoep, Michigan State University.\n\n  Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, I rise in support of the National \nLighthouse Stewardship Act, which will create a 3-year competitive \ngrant program to be administered by the Department of the Interior that \nwill help preserve and rehabilitate historic lighthouses across the \ncountry.\n  In my State of Maine, we are lucky to be home to 83 lighthouses. \nFurther, there are approximately 740 lighthouses in 31 other States. \nThe Coast Guard has not traditionally had the resources to maintain the \nlighthouses which are now being transferred under the National \nLighthouse Preservation Act from Federal ownership to non-profit \nhistorical societies who have taken on the responsibility. Helping to \nprovide the resources necessary to ensure these lighthouses are not \nlost would be a boost to both tourism and jobs. Failure to do so would \npotentially harm not only the existence of an historic emblem of my \nState and our Nation--but also a key economic catalyst for tourism that \nis part and parcel of my home State and the livelihood of many of her \ncitizens.\n  Each lighthouse tells a different story and each one is as integral \nto the history and narrative of our State as the magnificent landscapes \non which they proudly stand. That is why in 1995, I introduced a bill \nthat would later become law to establish the Maine Lights Program. We \nsucceeded in preserving this significant component of American heritage \nthrough collaboration among the Federal Government, the State of Maine, \nlocal communities, and private organizations, while at the same time, \nrelieving what had become a costly strain on the U.S. Coast Guard.\n  Across the country, responsibility for the care of our lighthouses \nhas been assumed by non-profit historic societies--many of which are \nstruggling in these uncertain economic times. This bill would authorize \n$20 million for a three-year competitive grant pilot program that would \nprovide grants to stewards of historic lighthouses to help them \npreserve and rehabilitate the lighthouses under their care.\n  I believe that the essential word in my previous sentence is \n``stewards''--because the structures are still federally owned \nproperty. It is not private property; it is not city or town property, \nor even state property; but federal property. It is also imperative to \nnote that these lighthouses are operable aids to navigation. \nLighthouses may seem a quaint relic of a bygone era, however they are \nnot. Daily, lighthouses lead our nation's mariners and fishermen away \nfrom danger.\n  Given that the maintenance of lighthouses is now being transferred \nunder the National Lighthouse Preservation Act from Federal ownership \nto non-profit historical societies, the task of providing the required \nresources to ensure the longevity and viability of these lighthouses \nwould also represent a welcomed economic boost both to tourism and to \njob creation.\n  The fact is, tourism has become increasingly crucial to Maine's \neconomy, as manufacturing jobs have fled our State, not to mention our \nNation. In fact, in 2006, the most recent year for which statistics are \navailable, approximately 1/5 of State sales tax revenues were \nattributable to tourism, and, when income and fuel taxes are added, the \nMaine State government collected $429 million tourism-related tax \ndollars in that year.\n  The Maine State Planning Office, which has quantified more precisely \nthe pivotal role tourism plays in the Maine economy, found that in \n2006, tourism generated $10 billion in sales of goods and services, \n140,000 jobs, and $3 billion in earnings. Tourism accounts for one in \nfive dollars of sales throughout Maine's economy and supported the \nequivalent of one in six Maine jobs. The planning office also \ndiscovered that an estimated 10 million overnight trips and 30 million \nday trips were taken that year in Maine, with travelers spending nearly \n$1 billion on lodging, $3 billion on food, and $1 billion on \nrecreational activities.\n  But those statistics are from 3 years ago . . . before the economy \nbegan to unravel at an accelerating rate, and so given these economic \ntimes confronting all of us, the financial necessity of our \nlighthouses, especially to tourism, has grown, not dissipated.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and send a message not only \nthat historic preservation of our Nation's prominent buildings and \nstructures--like our lighthouses--continues to be in the national \ninterest, but also that tourism--especially international tourism--is \nan industry we should be striving to support as a key component of \nreviving our ailing economy.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. KENNEDY (for himself, Mrs. Hutchison, and Mrs. Feinstein):\n  S. 717. A bill to modernize cancer research, increase access to \npreventative cancer services, provide cancer treatment and survivorship \ninitiatives, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Health, \nEducation, Labor, and Pensions.\n  Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, 37 years ago, a Republican President and \nDemocratic Congress came together in a new commitment to find a cure \nfor cancer. At the time, a cancer diagnosis meant almost certain death. \nIn 1971, we took action against this deadly disease and passed the \nNational Cancer Act with broad bipartisan support, and it marked the \nbeginning of the War on Cancer.\n  Since then, significant progress has been made. Amazing scientific \nresearch has led to methods to prevent cancer, and treatments that give \nus more beneficial and humane ways to deal with the illness. The \ndiscoveries of basic research, the use of large scale clinical trials, \nthe development of new drugs, and the special focus on prevention and \nearly detection have led to breakthroughs unimaginable only a \ngeneration ago.\n  As a result, cancer today is no longer the automatic death sentence \nthat it was when the war began. But despite the advances we have made \nagainst cancer, other changes such as aging of the population, emerging \nenvironmental issues, and unhealthy behavior, have allowed cancer to \npersist. The lives of vast numbers of Americans have been touched by \nthe disease. In 2008, over 1.4 million Americans were diagnosed with \nsome form of cancer, and more than half a million lost their lives to \nthe disease.\n  The solution is not easy but there are steps we can and must take \nnow, if we hope to see the diagnosis rate decline substantially and the \nsurvival rate increase in the years ahead. The immediate challenge we \nface is to reduce the barriers that obstruct progress in cancer \nresearch and treatment by integrating our current fragmented and \npiecemeal system of addressing the disease.\n  Last year, my colleague Senator Hutchison and I agreed that to build \non what the nation has accomplished, we must launch a new and more \nurgent war on cancer. The 21st Century Cancer ALERT Act we are \nintroducing today will accelerate our progress by using a better \napproach to fighting this relentless disease. Our goal is to break down \nthe many barriers that impede cancer research and prevent patients from \nobtaining the treatment that can save their lives.\n  We must do more to prevent cancer, by emphasizing scientifically \nproven methods such as tobacco cessation, healthy eating, and exercise. \nHealthy families and communities that have access to nutritious foods \nand high quality preventive health care will be our best defense \nagainst the disease. I\n\n[[Page S3906]]\n\nam confident that swift action on national health reform will make our \nvision of a healthier Nation a reality. Obviously, we cannot prevent \nall cancers, so it is also essential that the cancers that do arise be \ndiagnosed at an initial, curable stage, with all Americans receiving \nthe best possible care to achieve that goal.\n  We cannot overemphasize the value of the rigorous scientific efforts \nthat have produced the progress we have made so far. To enhance these \nefforts, our bill invests in two key aspects of cancer research--\ninfrastructure and collaboration of the researchers. We include \nprograms that will bring resources to the types of cancer we least \nunderstand. We invest in scientists who are committed to translating \nbasic research into clinical practice, so that new knowledge will be \nbrought to the patients who will most benefit from it.\n  One of the most promising new breakthroughs is in identifying and \nmonitoring the biomarkers that leave enough evidence in the body to \nalert clinicians to subtle signs that cancer may be developing. \nBiomarkers are the new frontier for improving the lives of cancer \npatients because they can lead to the earliest possible detection of \ncancer, and the Cancer ALERT Act will support the development of this \nrevolutionary biomarker technology.\n  In addition, we give new focus to clinical trials, which have been \nthe cornerstones of our progress in treating cancer in recent decades. \nOnly through clinical trials are we able to discover which treatments \ntruly work. Today, however, less than 5 percent of cancer patients \ncurrently are enrolled in clinical trials, because of the many barriers \nexist that prevent both providers and patients from participating in \nthese trials. A primary goal of our bill is to begin removing these \nbarriers and expanding access to clinical trials for many more \npatients.\n  Further, since many cancer survivors are now living longer lives, our \nhealth systems must be able to accommodate these men and women who are \nsuccessfully fighting against this deadly disease. It is imperative for \nhealth professionals to have the support they need to care for these \nsurvivors. To bring good lifelong care to cancer survivors, we must \ninvest more in research to understand the later effects of cancer and \nhow treatments affect survivors' health and the quality of their lives.\n  We stand today on the threshold of unprecedented new advances in this \nera of extraordinary discoveries in the life sciences, especially in \npersonalized medicine, early diagnosis of cancer at the molecular \nlevel, and astonishing new treatments based on a patient's own DNA. To \nmake the remarkable promise of this new era a reality, we must make \nsure that patients can take DNA tests, free of the fear that their \ngenetic information will somehow be used to discriminate against them. \nWe took a major step toward unlocking the potential of this new era by \napproving strong protections against genetic discrimination in health \ninsurance and employment when the Genetic Nondiscrimination Act was \nsigned into law last year.\n  In sum, we need a new model for research, prevention and treatment of \ncancer, and we are here today to start that debate in Congress. We must \nmove from a magic bullet approach to a broad mosaic of care, in which \nsurvivorship is also a key part of our approach to cancer. By doing so, \nwe can take a giant step toward reducing or even eliminating the burden \nof cancer in our Nation and the world. It is no longer an impossible \ndream, but a real possibility for the future.\n  Mr. President, I ask by unanimous consent that the text of the bill \nbe printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 717\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

FINDINGS AND PURPOSE.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) One in 2 men and one in 3 women are expected to develop \n     cancer in their lifetimes.\n       (2) Cancer is the leading cause of death for people under \n     the age of 85 and is expected to claim more than 1,500 lives \n     per day in 2008.\n       (3) At least 30 percent of all cancer deaths and 87 percent \n     of lung cancer deaths are attributed to smoking.\n       (4) The National Institutes of Health estimates that in \n     2007 alone, the overall cost of cancer to the United States \n     was more than $219,000,000,000.\n       (5) In recent decades, the biomedical research enterprise \n     has made considerable advances in the knowledge required to \n     understand, prevent, diagnose, and treat cancer; however, it \n     still takes 17 years, on average, to translate these \n     discoveries into viable treatment options.\n       (6) While clinical trials are vital to the discovery and \n     implementation of new preventative, diagnostic, and treatment \n     options, only 3 to 5 percent of the more than 10,000,000 \n     adults with cancer in the United States participate in cancer \n     clinical trials.\n       (7) Where people reside should not determine whether they \n     live, yet women in rural areas are less likely to obtain \n     preventative cancer screenings than those residing in urban \n     areas.\n       (8) Two-thirds of childhood cancer survivors are likely to \n     experience at least one late effect from treatment and one-\n     fourth are expected to experience a late effect that is life \n     threatening.\n       (9) In 1971, there were only 3,000,000 cancer survivors. \n     Today, cancer survivors account for 3 percent of the United \n     States population, approximately 12,000,000.\n       (10) The National Cancer Act of 1971 (Public Law 92-218) \n     advanced the ability of the United States to develop new \n     scientific leads and help increase the rate of cancer \n     survivorship.\n       (11) Yet in the 37 years since the national declaration of \n     the War on Cancer, the age adjusted mortality rate for cancer \n     is still extraordinarily high. Eight forms of cancer have a \n     5-year survival rate of less than 50 percent (pancreatic, \n     liver, lung, esophageal, stomach, brain, multiple myeloma, \n     and ovarian).\n       (12) While there have been substantial achievements since \n     the crusade began, we are far from winning the war on cancer.\n       (13) Many obstacles have hindered our progress in cancer \n     prevention, research, and treatment.\n       (b) Purposes.--The purposes of this Act are as follows:\n       (1) To reauthorize the National Cancer Institute and \n     National Cancer Program in order to enhance and improve the \n     cancer research conducted and supported by the National \n     Cancer Institute and the National Cancer Program in order to \n     benefit cancer patients.\n       (2) To recognize that with an increased understanding of \n     cancer as more than 200 different diseases with genetic and \n     molecular variations, there is a need for increased \n     coordination and greater flexibility in how cancer research \n     is conducted and coordinated in order to maximize the return \n     the United States receives on its investment in such \n     research.\n       (3) To prepare for the looming impact of an aging \n     population of the United States and the anticipated financial \n     burden associated with medical treatment and lost \n     productivity, along with the toll of human suffering that \n     accompanies a cancer diagnosis.\n       (4) To support the National Cancer Institute in \n     establishing relationships and scientific consortia with an \n     emphasis on public-private partnership development, which \n     will further the development of advanced technologies that \n     will improve the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of \n     cancer.\n\n     SEC. 3.

ACTIVITIES OF THE FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION.\n\n       It is the sense of the Senate that the Food and Drug \n     Administration should--\n       (1) integrate policies and structures to facilitate the \n     concurrent development of drugs and diagnostics for cancer \n     diagnosis, prevention, and therapy;\n       (2) consider alternatives or surrogates to traditional \n     clinical trial endpoints (for example, other than survival) \n     that are acceptable for regulatory approval as evidence of \n     clinical benefit to patients; and\n       (3) modernize the Office of Oncology Drug Products by \n     examining and addressing internal barriers that exist within \n     the current organizational structure.\n\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. I rise to talk about legislation that has been \nintroduced today. My colleague and friend, Senator Ted Kennedy, and I \nand Senator Feinstein are introducing a bill that we hope will help \nadvance America's efforts to find cures for cancer.\n  We all know that cancer is a relentless disease. It does not \ndiscriminate between men and women, wealthy or poor, elderly or young.\n  In 2008, over 1.4 million Americans were diagnosed with some form of \ncancer. It may have been you, it may have been a friend, it may have \nbeen a coworker, a parent, a sibling, a spouse or even a child. More \nthan half a million Americans lost their battle with cancer last year.\n  During the last session of Congress, Senator Kennedy and I began \nworking on what we would say would be the next generation of the war on \ncancer. Senator Feinstein has been a leader in this area as well. She \nis vice chairman of C-Change, which is an organization that is led by \nPresident George Bush--the 41st--and his wife Barbara. Dianne has been \nvery active in the cancer cause for a long time, having lost her \nhusband to cancer.\n  All of us have been touched by it. We know very poignantly what \nhappened in our body last year; that Senator Kennedy himself was \ndiagnosed with a brain tumor. We have watched him valiantly fight off \nthe scourge of this disease. I know in my own family my mother died \nfrom a brain tumor, and my brothers have also had cancer. It is such a \nreminder to all of us, especially when we see one of our own family \nmembers or one of our beloved colleagues fighting this disease. Arlen \nSpecter has had amazing feats of living through brain tumors, and he \nhas been so valiant. He, too, is one of the leaders in the cause we are \ntrying to fight today, and that is to win against cancer.\n  After Senator Kennedy's diagnosis was announced, I stood on the floor \nand said I would have an absolute commitment to introduce legislation \nwith him, which we had already been working on for months. We were \nworking with many of the groups that have come together to fight \ncancer. There are so many in our country that are banding together to \ntry to put all our resources and all our experiences and all of what we \nhave learned to work to do that magic thing that will finally bring \nabout a cure for this disease.\n  Today, we are keeping the promise we made. We waited, of course, for \nSenator Kennedy to go through surgery and to be in treatment before we \nintroduced it, and he is back with us today. He is part of introducing \nthis bill today. So we are calling the bill the 21st Century Cancer \nALERT Act. Here is why we must start again and renew our efforts.\n  Since the war on cancer was declared in 1971, we have amassed a \nwealth of knowledge, but our success in battling the disease has not \nbeen as great as with some of the other health concerns we have faced \nin our country, such as heart disease. When we adjust the mortality \nrate of cancer by age, it is still extraordinarily high when compared \nto mortality from other chronic diseases.\n  The impact that cancer has on all lives cannot and should not be \nunderestimated. Today, one out of every two men and one out of every \nthree women in our country will develop cancer in their lifetimes. That \nis an incredible statistic, and it shows how important it is that we \nget a handle on how we can either find the cure or, the next best \nthing, to be able to treat it and be able to live with the disease.\n  Let me tell you about some of the women who have fought with this \ndisease. A woman named Elayne in Corinth, TX, is 44 years old and \nfighting cancer for the second time in her life. She says:\n\n       I would like to see more research and options, especially \n     for people like me who tend to have few options left as a \n     stage 4 cancer patient. I think there is great hope in \n     targeted therapies, and this should be a continued area of \n     research and development.\n\n  The Kennedy-Hutchison-Feinstein bill will do several things: It will, \nfirst of all, promote cancer diagnosis at an early and more curable \nstage. We must encourage the discovery and advancement of early \nrecognition and treatment. One promising research method is the use of \nbiomarkers.\n  Biomarkers leave evidence within the body that alert clinicians to \nthe\n\n[[Page S3915]]\n\nhidden activity that indicates cancer may be developing. Identifying \nbiomarkers could represent the earliest possible detection of cancer in \npatients where it might otherwise be a long time before the person \nwould see or feel any symptoms.\n  However, even if we strengthen our ability to diagnose cancer, \nimpediments remain that prevent many Americans from undergoing routine \nscreening for cancer. With early screening, the chances of catching the \ndisease at a treatable stage are greater and improve the rate of \nsurvival.\n  No. 2, our bill will adopt a cooperative, coordinated approach to \ncancer research. By establishing a network of biorepositories, we will \nenable investigators to share information and samples. An integrated \napproach will accelerate the progress of lifesaving research.\n  Furthermore, finding cures should be a collaborative goal. Great \nresearch is being done by so many researchers who are not aware of \nadvancements in the trials. We have the research that might be \nconcentrated in one area, but people don't have the communication they \nneed to know what is going on in another area that might be helpful in \nfurthering the research going on in a different area.\n  The culture of isolated career research must shift toward cooperative \nstrides to achieve breakthroughs. We must encourage all the \nstakeholders in the war on cancer to work in concert. This is perhaps \ngoing to be a difficult hurdle, but we must do it. If our researchers \nare just involved in their own microscope, they are not going to be \nable to have the full body of knowledge that might contain that one \nthing that triggers the end to cancer as we know it.\n  Next, our bill will increase enrollment in clinical trials. Clinical \ntrials expand treatment options for patients while enabling researchers \nto explore new methods in prevention, diagnosis, and therapy. This is \nso valuable because these are the experimental stages of treatment \nwhere people who sign up--who know there are risks here but are willing \nto try--can help us learn what works and what might not work. This is \nessential for us to make real strides in this war on cancer.\n  One woman who understands the importance of clinical trials is Maria \nfrom El Paso. She is participating in a clinical trial, but she says:\n\n       Every day we encounter women who are either unaware of the \n     option for clinical trials or who want to participate but do \n     not have access to them. It's not right that some of us have \n     access to the most cutting-edge treatments, while others are \n     shut out and left mired in a web of confusion.\n\n  Less than 5 percent of the 10 million adults with cancer in the \nUnited States participate in clinical trials. We need to raise \nawareness about clinical trials so more cancer patients will know they \nare available and have the full information of what they could do. \nDisincentives in the health insurance market to enrolling in clinical \ntrials must be eliminated.\n  Last, as our knowledge of cancer advances and survivors live longer, \nwe must move toward establishing a process of providing comprehensive \ncare planning services. There is great value in arming patients with a \ntreatment plan and a summary of their care once they enter remission. \nThis can help ensure continuity of therapy and prevent costly \nduplicative or unnecessary services.\n  Together, Senator Kennedy, Senator Feinstein, and I hope this will be \na bipartisan effort to reinvigorate this fight by enacting these \nnecessary changes through legislation. One of the people who will \nbenefit from our bill is Suzanne. After 10 years of treatment for \ncancer, at a cost of over $3 million, Suzanne came to my office this \nweek to show her support for this bill. She said:\n\n       I don't want my two daughters to go through what I went \n     through. Screening saves lives and money.\n\n  She is right. Another woman who has been in touch with my office is \nJodie. At the age of 36, she was diagnosed with cancer. After 5 years \nof treatment, she said: ``It is a gift to be here.''\n  The Kennedy-Hutchison-Feinstein bill, through screening programs, \nresearch, and clinical trials, will give people such as Suzanne, Maria, \nElayne, Jodie, and many others in our country more time to spend with \ntheir loved ones.\n  This bill we are introducing today is not a finished product. There \nmay need to be changes to this bill. It is not perfect. I already have \nhad some point out the need for us to sit down and try to come up with \nthe absolute right approach. The HELP Committee will be looking at this \nbill. They will be marking it up. We have already had hearings last \nyear, but there will be more of a look and it will be important that \nthis happen.\n\n  We want a bipartisan and resounding victory. We want this to be a \nvictory for all of our country--a victory over this disease. It is the \nkind of bill that can be bipartisan, that should be bipartisan, and \nshould have overwhelming support from this Congress and from the \nAmerican people.\n  I am wearing today the ``Live Strong'' bracelet. This is from the \nLance Armstrong Foundation. We all know Lance Armstrong is a cancer \nsurvivor. He is also a hero to many of us because of his wins of the \nTour de France. He is the premier bicyclist in the world. \nUnfortunately, Lance is in the hospital right now--or he might be just \ngetting out. He doesn't have cancer. That is the good news. He broke \nhis collar bone--in about six places, apparently--and because he has \ninsisted he is going back into cycling, he is recovering from that \ninjury.\n  But we know the grit and determination of this man. After his Tour de \nFrance wins, and setting the ``straight record'' for Tour de France \nwins, he came home and decided to take on cancer for everyone. He has \nbeen a role model in showing us it can be defeated, because after his \nbout with cancer, he went on to win these grueling bicycle races all \nover the world. So he has been a role model in that regard, but he has \nalso, through his foundation, been a champion of making sure other \npeople have the same chance for survival that he has had. So while we \nwish him well on the mending of his collar bone, we already owe him a \ndebt of gratitude, and I am going to wear his bracelet as we introduce \nthe bill today to show what one person can do to defeat cancer.\n  We can all come together to help Lance get the message out throughout \nthe world that we can defeat cancer, and no one is a better leader in \nthis cause on the Senate floor today than Senator Edward Kennedy. He \nnot only helped craft the legislation--even as he was in treatment he \nwas making edits to this bill--but he also is another person who has \nshown courage, as Lance Armstrong has, by not giving up, by coming \nright back to the Senate after his cancer treatments and showing us \nthat he, too, is joining with Lance Armstrong to make sure everyone has \nthe same chance he has for early detection and for a chance to live a \nfull life. That is what we want for every American.\n  I am very proud to be standing here for Senator Kennedy to say we are \ngoing to fight for this together. We are going to work together, and we \nare going to try to have a resounding bipartisan victory on this bill. \nWorking with the HELP Committee and utilizing their input, we will win \na victory for all Americans. Maybe we will make Americans see that we \ncan work together here in Washington. Maybe that will be the change in \nhow things are done in Washington that we have all been looking for. It \nwould be a change for the better.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. HARKIN (for himself, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Leahy, Mr. Cardin, \n        Ms. Mikulski, Mr. Kerry, Mr. Durbin, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Merkley, and Mrs. McCaskill):\n  S. 718. A bill to amend the Legal Services Corporation Act to meet \nspecial needs of eligible clients, provide for technology grants, \nimprove corporate practices of the Legal Services Corporation, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. HARKIN. Mr. President, today, I am proud to introduce the Civil \nAccess to Justice Act of 2009, which will expand and improve vital \ncivil legal services to our most vulnerable Americans.\n  This is an issue that is very personal with me. Before I was elected \nto Congress, I practiced law with Polk County legal aid. I know first-\nhand how crucial legal assistance is to struggling families who have no \nplace else to turn\n\n[[Page S3916]]\n\nwhen they have lost a job and are facing a foreclosure. I know the \ninvaluable assistance that legal aid provides to battered women trying \nto leave abusive marriages while fearing for their safety and the \nsafety of their children. I know that, without access to an attorney, \nthe poor are often powerless against the injustices they suffer. I can \nhonestly say that the work I did with legal aid is some of the most \nrewarding work of my career.\n  The type of assistance I was able to provide needy clients in Iowa \noccurs throughout the country every day. Much of that assistance is the \ndirect result of a commitment the federal government first made over \nforty years ago. In 1965, the Office of Economic Opportunity created \n269 local legal services programs around the country. Ten years later, \nin 1974, Congress--with bipartisan support, including that of President \nNixon--established the Legal Service Corporation, LSC, to be a major \nsource of funding for civil legal aid in this country. LSC is a \nprivate, non-profit corporation, funded by Congress, with the mission \nto ensure equal access to justice under the law for all Americans by \nproviding civil legal assistance to those who otherwise would be unable \nto afford it. LSC distributes 95 percent of its annual Federal \nappropriations to 137 local legal aid programs, with more than 900 \noffices serving all 50 states and every congressional district.\n  These LSC funding programs make a crucial difference to millions of \nAmericans. Recipients help clients secure basic human needs, such as \naccess to wrongly denied benefits including social security, pensions \nand needed health care. Just in the past decade, families of 9-11 \nvictims, flood victims, and hurricane evacuees have received crucial \nlegal assistance in obtaining permanent housing, unemployment \ncompensation and government benefits. Further, members of our Armed \nForces and their families receive help with estate planning, consumer \nand landlord/tenant problems and family law.\n  It is LSC-funded attorneys who help parents obtain and keep custody \nof their children, help family members obtain guardianship for children \nwithout parents, assist parents in enforcing child support payments and \nhelp women who are victims of domestic violence. In fact, three out of \nfour legal aid clients are women, and legal aid programs identify \ndomestic violence as one of their top priorities. Recent studies \nconfirm, moreover, that the only public service that reduces domestic \nabuse in the long term is a woman's access to legal assistance.\n  Unfortunately, as the economy continues to wane, those needing legal \nassistance increase. Yet, the Federal commitment to legal services and \nLSC is not as effective as it needs to be. LSC has not been authorized \nsince 1981, and since 1995 Congress has slashed funding for legal \nservices for the poor, from $415 million to $350 million in fiscal year \n2008, with only a recent increase to $390 million for fiscal year 2009. \nFurther, severe restrictions on LSC funded attorneys impede the ability \nof legal aid attorneys to provide the most meaningful legal \nrepresentation to low-income Americans. The result is that access to \njustice and quality representation has become far from a reality for \ntoo many of our citizens.\n\n  In many parts of the country, more than 80 percent of those who need \nlegal representation are unable to obtain it. Nationally, 50 percent of \neligible applicants who request legal assistance from LSC funded \nprograms are turned away largely because such programs lack adequate \nfunding. That translates into over one million eligible cases per year.\n  Bear in mind, to be eligible for Federal legal assistance, one must \nlive at or below 125 percent Federal poverty level--an income of about \n$25,000 a year for a family of four. This means that we are turning \naway half of the families in America who need and seek civil legal help \nwho make less than $25,000 a year. That is wrong and it makes a mockery \nof the principle of equal justice under the law.\n  Unfortunately, a combination of limited federal funding, state budget \ncuts and an increased demand for services due to the recession has \nexacerbated the problem. As the Chief Justice of the Texas Supreme \nCourt recently noted, legal aid programs have reached a ``crisis of \nepic proportions.'' This year, requests for services have risen by 30 \npercent or more across the country while cutbacks in staffing are \nexpected to reach 20 percent or more over the coming months. \nConnecticut Legal Services expects to lose as many as 150 legal \npositions. Boston's legal aid expects to lay off one-fifth of its \nlawyers. Two whole offices in New Jersey recently had to shut their \ndoors. When legal aid lawyers lose their jobs and when offices close, \nunfortunately it is our most vulnerable citizens who suffer as their \nlegal needs go unmet.\n  The housing crisis highlights this problem. Today, millions of \nAmericans are struggling to meet their housing needs, including making \ntheir mortgage payments, in many cases traceable to predatory lending \npractices. Foreclosures are at a historic high and continue to soar. As \nmore and more people face the devastating prospect of losing their \nhome--their most prized possession--legal assistance is necessary to \nhelp renegotiate terms of loans or enforce truth-in-lending protections \nin court. The result is that many legal aid offices have seen a drastic \nincrease in those seeking help. Between 2007 and 2008, for example, \nIowa Legal Aid saw a 300 percent increase in foreclosure related cases. \nThe Legal Aid Society of San Diego saw a 250 percent increase. Yet, \nlegal aid is too often unavailable. A recent study, for example, \nrevealed that in New Jersey, 99 percent of defendants in housing \neviction cases go to court without an attorney.\n  Given these needs, the Civil Access to Justice Act of 2009, which I \nam proud to introduce today with Senators Kennedy, Leahy, Mikulski, \nCardin, Kerry, Durbin, Lautenberg, McCaskill and Merkley, renews our \ncommitment to equal justice for all Americans and will improve both the \nquantity and quality of legal assistance in this country.\n  The bill is supported by, among others, the American Bar Association, \nBrennan Center for Justice, National Legal Aid & Defender Association, \nNational Organization of Legal Service Workers and United Auto Workers.\n  First, this bill authorizes funding for LSC at $750 million, which is \napproximately the amount appropriated in 1981, adjusted for inflation, \nthe high water mark for LSC funding. That year, Congress allocated \n$321.3 million to LSC. At the time, that was seen as the level \nsufficient to provide a minimum level of access to legal aid in every \ncounty. Adjusted for inflation, this ``minimum access'' level of \nfunding would need to be about $750 million in 2009 dollars.\n  Second, this bill lifts many of the restrictions Congress imposed in \n1996 on federally funded attorneys. That year, Congress significantly \nlimited whom federally funded attorneys could represent and the types \nof legal tools these attorneys could use in representing their clients. \nProponents of these restrictions argued that LSC funded lawyers had \noverreached and were using federal funds to pursue what some considered \nan ideological political agenda through the courts, while neglecting \nbasic legal work for poor Americans.\n  I vigorously disagreed with this characterization of legal aid \nattorneys and opposed the restrictions at the time; and I continue to \ndo so. The restrictions have harmed our neediest Americans and in many \ninstances prevent legal counsel from doing what attorneys are ethically \nbound to do--provide zealous representation for their clients. Further, \nthe restrictions, by limiting the range of tools that legal aid \nattorneys can employ compared to other members of the bar, have created \na system of second-class legal representation. That is why this \nlegislation lifts limits on the legal tools that LSC-funded attorneys \ncan use to represent their clients--for example, prohibitions on \nattorneys seeking court-ordered attorneys' fees, lobbying with \nnonfederal funds or representing clients in class action law suits.\n  With respect to attorney fees, Congress and state legislatures have \nrecognized that such fees are an important remedy, and are critical in \nensuring that civil rights and consumer protection suits are brought. \nAs Congress stated in enacting the Civil Rights Attorneys' Fees Awards \nAct of 1976, ``fee awards have proved an essential remedy if private \ncitizens are to have a\n\n[[Page S3917]]\n\nmeaningful opportunity to vindicate the important Congressional \npolicies which these laws contain.'' That is why Congress has enacted \nnearly 200 statutes, and states have enacted approximately 4,000 \nstatutes, that provide for attorney fees. The current restriction \npreventing LSC-funded attorneys from receiving attorney fees has the \neffect of weakening the effectiveness of these statutes.\n  Lifting the restriction on attorney fees makes sense for additional \nreasons. First, because of the restriction, defendants who otherwise \nwould pay attorney fees are unjustly enriched because they happen to \nface LSC-funded attorneys as opposed to a private counsel. Second, the \npotential for attorney fees is important leverage for attorneys as they \nnegotiate settlements, leverage now not available to LSC-funded \nattorneys. Finally, by prohibiting collecting attorney fees, Congress \nhas needlessly limited potential resources that can be used to provide \nlegal aid to other clients.\n  The bill also lifts the restriction on LSC-funded attorneys' ability \nto lobby with non-federal funds for changes in the law that would \nbenefit disadvantaged clients. Legal service attorneys are immersed in \nthe day-to-day legal issues faced by low-income communities and, as a \nresult, are often most knowledgeable about the true impact of state and \nFederal laws on low income Americans. Yet, LSC-funded attorneys may not \nparticipate legislative and administrative efforts unless they are \nresponding to a written request from a legislator or other official.\n  When legal aid attorneys' input is requested, the results are \ntelling. For example, Maryland Legal Aid Bureau was recently invited by \nthe legislature to testify on an overhaul of state foreclosure and \nlending laws. Although the lending, mortgage and banking industries \nwere well represented, the legal aid attorney was the only person there \nrepresenting borrowers' views. While the attorney's voice was critical \nin ensuring appropriate consumer protections, it is significant that \nthat voice was only heard because legislators chose to seek input from \nlegal aid. Because of the current restrictions, absent an invitation, \nthe experiences and knowledge of that attorney would be silenced, \nleaving a one-sided debate.\n  Let me be clear, I disagree with those who advocated for and enacted \nthe 1996 restrictions. However, in the spirit of compromise and \nbipartisanship, and with the intent to avoid a repeat of the \ncontentious debates of the 1990s, this legislation does not lift all of \nthe restrictions. Illustrative is the present restriction on LSC-funded \nattorneys pursuing class action suits. Such cases are often the most \nefficient and cost-effective lawsuits, not only for clients but for the \njudicial system. As Congress found in enacting the Class Action \nFairness Act in 2005, ``class action lawsuits are an important and \nvaluable part of the legal system when they permit the fair and \nefficient resolution of legitimate claims of numerous parties by \nallowing the claims to be aggregated into a single action against a \ndefendant that has allegedly caused harm.''\n  When the procedural requirements of State or Federal law are met, \nLSC-funded attorneys and their clients, like all others, should be able \nto utilize this essential litigation tool. That is why the bill lifts \nthe restriction on the ability of legal aid programs to bring such \nsuits. At the same time, again while I disagree, I acknowledge the \nconcern that led to the restriction--that prior to the restriction some \nfelt that LSC-funded attorneys were using class action suits to ``push \nthe envelope'' and have courts establish ``new law.'' To allay this \nconcern, the bill permits only class action suits that are grounded in \n``established'' law. This will enable, for example, LSC-funded \nattorneys to represent as a class multiple families who are victims of \npredatory lending, but will not permit LSC-funded attorneys to attempt \nto achieve a novel interpretation of the law that lacks statutory \nsupport or judicial precedent.\n  Moreover, again in the spirit of compromise, the bill maintains many \nof the limits on who LSC-funded programs can represent, including the \ncurrent exclusion of illegal immigrants, with limited exceptions, such \nas victims of domestic violence, prisoners challenging prison \nconditions, and people charged with illegal drug possession in public \nhousing eviction proceedings. Also, consistent with current law, the \nlegislation prohibits LSC-funded programs from participating in \nabortion-related cases.\n  Third, this legislation lifts all the restrictions, except those \nrelated to abortion litigation, on the use of state and local funds and \nprivate donations to Federal funded legal services programs that \nCongress also imposed in 1996. That year, Congress determined that for \nprograms that receive federal funds, the same restrictions applicable \nto federal funds apply to non-federal funds a program receives.\n  The result is that millions of dollars in non-federal funds are \nencumbered by the same restrictions that drastically limit the tools \navailable to legal aid attorneys, to the detriment of their clients. \nThrough direct state and local funding, money from state Interest on \nLawyers' Trust Accounts, IOLTA, and private sources, over $450 million \nin non-federal funds currently is provided for civil legal assistance. \nThe restrictions place unnecessary and costly hurdles on the use of \nthese non-federal funds. The only way a program and its donors can free \nthemselves from federal restrictions is by diverting non-federal funds \ninto a separate program--with separate staff members, offices and \nequipment. This is burdensome and wasteful.\n\n  Whatever one thinks of placing conditions on the receipt of federal \nfunds, states, cities and private donors should have the ability to \ndetermine for themselves how best to spend their money to ensure access \nto justice for their citizens. It is one thing to attach conditions on \nthe use of the federal funds, but to impose conditions on the use of \nnon-federal funds is wrong.\n  Fourth, in addition to providing further tools and support for LSC \ngrantees, better corporate governance--something that is critically \nneeded--is a central feature of this legislation. Last year, the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, reported on troubling management \npractices and lack of oversight by LSC. The reports found that there \nhad been questionable expenditures by LSC management and that LSC \nlacked a ``properly implemented governance and accountability \nstructure'' needed to prevent problems. GAO included in its report a \nseries of recommendations as to how LSC should address these \nshortcomings and prevent similar problems in the future.\n  No one was more upset about the GAO reports than I. That is why I \npersonally made it clear to LSC management, in no uncertain terms, that \nthey needed to act immediately to address the GAO recommendations, and \nwhy a central feature of this bill is provisions to ensure better \ncorporate governance. LSC acted quickly to address the issues GAO \nraised, and both LSC management and its Board of Directors have \npublicly accepted all of GAO's recommendations and have worked \ndiligently to implement them. Nevertheless, I believe it is important \nto lock the recommendations into statute.\n  Finally, the bill authorizes a grant program from the Department of \nEducation to expand law school clinics. A recent study found that \nstudents in law school clinics serve approximately 90,000 civil clients \nevery school year, excluding summer semesters, and provide over 1.8 \nmillion hours of legal service. These legal clinics are a significant \nresource for legal services. But they are much more. For many students, \nthese programs are stepping stones towards careers in legal service and \npublic interest law following graduation. Recent studies demonstrate \nthat law students who participate in law school clinics are more likely \nto work in public service jobs and do more pro bono than their peers \nwho do not.\n  We need to do all we can to encourage young lawyers to make legal aid \na career. One important way of doing this is by exposing them to the \nchallenges, and more importantly the rewards, of representing people \nwho otherwise would not have the legal assistance they deserve.\n  Our promise of ``equal justice under law'' rings hollow if those who \nare most vulnerable are denied access to representation. As former \nJustice Lewis Powell said, ``[e]qual justice under law is not merely a \ncaption on the facade of the Supreme Court building. It is perhaps the \nmost inspiring ideal of our society . . . it is fundamental that \njustice should be the same,\n\n[[Page S3918]]\n\nin substance and availability, without regard to economic status.'' \nLegal aid attorneys across the country protect the safety, security, \nand health of low-income citizens. When a senior citizen is the victim \nof a financial scam, when a family faces the loss of their home, or, \nall too often, when a woman seeks protection from abuse, legal aid can \nhelp--but only if it has the funds and the tools needed to do so.\n  As our former colleague Senator Domenici once declared: ``I do not \nknow what is wrong with the United States of America saying to the \nneedy people of this country that the judicial system is not only for \nthe rich. What is wrong with that? . . . That is what America is all \nabout.''\n  That is the aim of this bill. After years of grossly underfunding \nthis essential program, denying legal representation to millions of \nlow-income citizens, and denying legal aid lawyers the full panoply of \ntools they need to represent their clients effectively, this bill will \nfulfill the promise of our Constitution. ``Equal Justice Under Law'' \nwill be more than an ideal chiseled on a marble facade, it will be a \nconcrete reality for millions of our citizens, who, today, are denied \nit. I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  I am proud to join Senator Harkin, along with Senator Kennedy, \nSenator Kerry, Senator Mikulski, Senator Durbin, Senator Lautenberg, \nSenator McCaskill, and Senator Merkley on this important legislation to \nreauthorize the Legal Services Corporation, LSC. I thank Senator Harkin \nfor his hard work and dedication to this issue. Along with \nreauthorizing the funding for the LSC, the bill also removes several \nrestrictions that have encumbered the efforts of legal services \nproviders around the country.\n  The funding authorization in this legislation will help ensure that \nin future years, the Legal Services Corporation, and all of the state \nlegal aid organizations it assists, will continue the critical work \nthey do to help lower-income American citizens who need legal \nassistance. Similar to the Sixth Amendment's requirement that an \nindigent criminal defendant be provided counsel, the voice that legal \naid attorneys give to the less fortunate among us is an indispensable \ncomponent of a fair justice system. What Justice Hugo Black called the \n``noble ideal'' of a fair and impartial trial is extended through the \nwork of those around the country who serve their fellow citizens in our \ncourts. This reauthorization will continue the policy of the Federal \nGovernment to provide assistance to those who seek access to the courts \nin civil matters.\n  As part of this reauthorization, and in an effort to support the \nintegrity of the LSC, the bill codifies recommendations made by the \nGovernment Accountability Office, GAO, related to the LSC's corporate \ngovernance. The Senate Judiciary Committee held a hearing in May 2008 \nin part to shed light on these recommendations, and to give the LSC an \nopportunity to respond about plans to address the problems identified \nby the GAO. The LSC's leadership has been open and responsive to making \nimprovements, and including these recommendations in the bill will \nassist the LSC in strengthening its governance practices for the \nfuture.\n  This legislation also takes the long-overdue step of removing several \nof the restrictions that have hindered legal aid organizations for too \nlong. But I wish to make clear that the restrictions on both state and \nFederal funds prohibiting litigation involving reproductive rights \nremain in place. Several restrictions on Federal funds remain: the use \nof Federal funds for litigation concerning unlawful immigrants, prison \nconditions, and certain eviction cases involving the sale of illegal \ndrugs in public housing, will remain prohibited. But many of the \nrestrictions this bill finally lifts are the product of an ideology \nlong since rejected by the American people. It is time for Congress to \nreconsider the usefulness of these restrictions in providing the \nservices that so many Americans desperately need.\n  All Americans should understand the effects of these restrictions on \nthe provision of legal services for lower-income citizens. Chief among \nthem is the overarching requirement prohibiting the use of non-Federal \nfunds for enumerated purposes when legal aid organizations accept \nFederal funding from the LSC. Currently, non-federal funds received by \nlegal aid providers that also accept LSC funding are subject to the \nsame restrictions that Federal funds are. This has resulted in a waste \nof resources that providers can ill afford. For example, a legal aid \nprovider that wishes to use state, foundation, or other private funding \nas it sees fit must physically segregate its operations so that funds \nfrom the two sources are administered separately through duplicated \nprocesses. In this era of economic difficulty, the impact of every \nFederal and state dollar provided to help Americans must be maximized. \nThis requirement has resulted in little more than wasted resources. \nLegal aid providers are capable of honoring Federal restrictions \nwithout the necessity of such an onerous approach.\n  The legislation also removes restrictions that currently prohibit \nlegal aid attorneys from receiving attorney's fees, as authorized by \nlaw, in cases in which they prevail. Contrary to arguments that claim \nsuch a practice would cause legal aid attorneys to act unethically or \nout of an interest divergent from the legitimate needs of their \nclients, allowing these fees to be retained would help shift the cost \nof wrongdoing from the Federal Government to the wrongdoer. Moreover, \nallowing legal aid attorneys to retain these fees when merited would \nprovide increased assistance to the organizations for which they work. \nIn an effort to monitor the effect of removing this restriction, the \nlegislation requires all fees received to be reported to the LSC.\n  The bill removes restrictions on class action suits by legal aid \nproviders. Contrary to the popular rhetoric, in some cases class action \nsuits can maximize the benefits provided by legal aid organizations by \nallowing similarly situated plaintiffs to pursue their rights in a \nsingle case. The legislation does restrict class action suits to \nactions based on established law, and thus is intended to discourage \ntruly frivolous suits. Additionally, the legislation removes the \nrestriction prohibiting legal aid providers from lobbying their elected \nofficials. Allowing legal aid providers to advocate on behalf of those \nthey serve will advance civil justice issues and raise the awareness of \nlawmakers in matters affecting many Americans. And I would remind those \nwho would disparage this practice on the part of legal aid providers \nthat many of the financial institutions that the American taxpayers \nhave recently bailed out continue to lobby extensively in Washington. \nIf banks that have been bailed out with taxpayer money can freely \naccess their elected officials, so too should those who represent the \nleast politically powerful among us.\n  I hope all Senators will give serious consideration to reauthorizing \nthe Legal Services Corporation and ending many of the restrictions that \nhave burdened the provision of legal services to so many American \ncitizens. Lawyers across the U.S. have dedicated their lives to helping \nthe least fortunate among us gain access to the courts that serve us \nall. These lawyers play a critical role in ensuring that justice is \ncarried out in a manner consistent with the Constitution's promise, and \nwhen justice is served fairly, it benefits us all. I hope all Senators \nwill join us in support of this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. UDALL, of Colorado (for himself and Mr. Bennet):\n  S. 720. A bill to provide a source of funds to carry out restoration \nactivities on Federal land under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of \nthe Interior or the Secretary of Agriculture, and for other purposes; \nto the Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I am today introducing a bill \nto provide additional resources for use by the Federal land-managing \nagencies to restore lands damaged as a result of legal violations and \nto promote public education about the use of the Federal lands. This \nbill is similar to one I introduced in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives in the 110th Congress, H.R. 1463. I would like to thank \nSen. Bennet for joining me as a cosponsor.\n  The large majority of people who use and enjoy our national public \nlands respect those lands and facilities and do not deliberately damage \nthem. They abide by our laws and regulations that\n\n[[Page S3919]]\n\nare designed to preserve and protect these lands and facilities for \nfuture generations to enjoy and appreciate. Unfortunately, there are \nsome who violate those laws and regulations and in so doing damage the \nlands and facilities. Violators who are caught can face fines and \npenalties. This bill would direct the Federal public land agencies to \napply the funds collected as fines to help restore the lands and \nfacilities that may have been damaged due to the violations.\n  The purpose of this bill is to assist the land-managing agencies--the \nBureau of Land Management, National Park Service, and the Fish and \nWildlife Service in the Interior Department as well as the Forest \nService in the Agriculture Department--by allowing the money collected \nas fines to be used for repairing damage caused by the actions that \nlead to the fines or by similar actions instead of going to the U.S. \nTreasury. It would also allow them to use the money to increase public \nawareness of regulations and other requirements regarding use of \nFederal lands. It provides that any of the money not needed for those \npurposes would be credited to the Crime Victims Fund in the Treasury.\n  Allowing these funds to be used in this manner will not likely repair \nthe all of the damage caused by illegal activities in most instances, \nbut it will at least provide some assistance.\n  The genesis for this bill stemmed from a number of illegal activities \nthat created significant damage to Federal public lands and facilities. \nLet me highlight just a couple of these.\n  As many may remember, Colorado experienced one of its worst fires in \n2002, the Hayman Fire. This fire torched over 130,000 acres in the \nwatershed of the Denver metropolitan area. It also destroyed 133 homes \nand forced the evacuation of over 5,000 people. After the fire, which \nwas exceedingly hot and fast moving, a major thunderstorm pummeled the \nthen-barren ground and washed debris and sediment into the Strontia \nSprings Reservoir, a major drinking water supply for Denver, hampering \nits capacity. Tragically, one person died of a heart attack during this \nfire, five firefighters were killed in a car crash on the way to the \nfire, and two people were killed during the subsequent thunderstorm and \nflooding. It was later learned that the fire was caused by the illegal \nactions of a former Forest Service employee. That person was later \nfined and jailed. This bill would allow the Forest Service to apply \nthose fines collected to help restore the lands damaged by this fire.\n  Other examples involve off-road vehicles. Throughout the west, and \nespecially in Colorado, increased growth and development has resulted \nin an increase in recreational use of our public lands. These \nrecreational uses have, in some cases, stressed the capacity of the \npublic land agencies to adequately control and manage such use. As a \nresult, areas of our public lands are being damaged. These impacts can \ninclude: damage to wildlife habitat; increased run-off and sediment \npollution in rivers and streams,; damage to sensitive high-altitude \ntundra, desert soils, and wetlands; creation of ruts and other visual \nimpacts on the landscape; loss of quiet and secluded areas of the \npublic lands; and adverse effects on wildlife.\n\n  Recreational off-road vehicle use on our public lands should be \nallowed to continue, but it must be managed to minimize or avoid these \nproblems by appropriate restrictions and putting some sensitive areas \noff-limits to vehicle use. Again, most vehicle users are responsible--\nthey stay on designated roads and trails, they are respectful of the \nlandscape and they endeavor to tread lightly. However, there are a \nnumber of such users who do not obey the rules. Given the nature of \nthis use, large, powerful motorized vehicles that are able to penetrate \ndeeper and deeper into previously secluded areas, even a relatively few \nwho violate management requirements can create serious damage to public \nland resources.\n  For example, in the summer of 2000 two recreational off-road vehicle \nusers ignored closure signs while four-wheel driving on Bureau of Land \nManagement land high above Silverton, Colorado. As a result, they got \nstuck for five days on a 70 percent slope at 12,500 feet along the \nflanks of Houghton Mountain. At first, they abandoned their vehicles. \nThen, they returned with other vehicles to pull their vehicles out of \nthe mud and off the mountain. The result was significant damage to the \nhigh alpine tundra, a delicate ecosystem that may take thousands of \nyears to recover. As noted in a Denver Post story about this incident, \n``alpine plant life has evolved to withstand freezing temperatures, \nnearly year-round frost, drought, high winds and intense solar \nradiation, but it is helpless against big tires.'' The violators at \nthis incident were fined. Again, this bill would allow those fines to \nbe applied to address the specific damage that resulted.\n  These are but two examples. Regrettably, there have been many more \nsuch examples not only in Colorado but also throughout the west. These \nexamples underscore the nature of the problem that this bill would \naddress. This bill would give the Federal public land agencies the \nability to apply resources to recover damaged lands from illegal \nactivities.\n  This is a modest bill but an important one. I think it deserves the \nsupport of our colleagues and I will do all I can to achieve its \nenactment into law.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 720\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor permanent alternative minimum tax relief, middle class tax relief, \nand estate tax relief, and to permanently extend certain expiring \nprovisions, and for other purposes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BAUCUS. Mr. President, there is a storm brewing. This storm is \nnot an act of God. It is man-made. It is coming to a head next year.\n  The 2001 tax cut law gave much-needed tax relief to families with \nchildren. It gave much-needed tax relief to families with college \nstudents. It gave much-needed relief to family-owned businesses.\n  I worked on those tax cuts. I believed in them.\n  But the provisions in that bill expire on December 31, 2010.\n  Since the day that we passed that bill, we have passed others. These \nother bills expanded and enhanced some of the 2001 provisions that help \nAmerica's families.\n  Next year, all that we have done disappears. American families are \nleft in a state of uncertainty. This uncertainty undermines confidence \nin the Government and the future.\n  That is why, today, I am introducing the Taxpayer Certainty and \nRelief Act of 2009.\n  This bill would make permanent several expiring provisions that help \nfamilies.\n\n[[Page S3921]]\n\n  This bill would make permanent the tax cuts for the 10 percent, 15 \npercent, 25 percent, and 25 percent tax brackets. Without this change, \ntaxpayers would experience up to a $5,000 tax increase. This bill would \nmake permanent the lower capital gains rates for taxpayers in these \nbrackets.\n  This bill would makes permanent the marriage penalty relief enacted \nin 2001. This would guaranty that married couples would not be \npenalized when they take their wedding vows.\n  This bill would also make permanent the $1,000 child tax credit. It \nwould also make permanent the refundable child tax credit, with a \nthreshold of $3,000, that was recently passed as part of the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act.\n  This is important because prior to the 2001 bill, this credit was \n$500 and not refundable.\n  This bill would make permanent the expansion of the earned income tax \ncredit. As a result, married couples would get more relief and families \nwith three or more children would get a larger credit.\n  The bill would help working men and women by making permanent the \nchanges to the dependent and child care credit. This credit helps cover \nthe increased expenses of providing child care during a time when \neveryone is struggling to stay employed and weather this economic \ndownturn.\n  This bill would also make permanent the increased credit for \nadoption. Giving a child a home and love is expensive. Families that \nadopt children have a lot of expenses. This bill would continue to give \na $10,000 credit for adoption expenses.\n  These provisions recognize the increased cost of raising children. \nCongress values families and wants every family to succeed.\n  Another problem that Congress has to tackle every year is the \nAlternative Minimum Tax, or the AMT. This tax creeps up on millions of \ntaxpayers every year. Every year, Congress holds this monster at bay, \nmaking sure no new taxpayers pay this horrible tax.\n  As a result, the number of taxpayers paying the AMT remains at just \nover 4 million. Without Congress's action, 26 million people would have \nto pay this tax.\n  This bill would permanently fix the AMT. It sets the exemption at \n2009 levels and indexes it for future years. It also allows the AMT \nagainst the nonrefundable credits.\n  Finally, this bill would offer certainty on the estate tax. This is \nsomething that I have tried to get done over and over again. The \nFinance Committee held several hearings discussing this tax. This bill \nmakes permanent current law. This bill would set the exemption at $3.5 \nmillion, or $7 million for married couples. It would also set the tax \nrate at 45 percent.\n  We have also made some other needed fixes. This bill would unify the \ngift and estate taxes. This bill would also allow a decedent spouse to \ntransfer any unused exemption to the surviving spouse. This is known as \nportability.\n  I believe that this bill is just the beginning. I realize there are \nother tax cuts that need to be made permanent. For example, I hope to \naddress education issues later this year.\n  But today, let us begin to give working families some shelter from \nthe coming storm.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 722\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to prohibit the introduction or delivery for \nintroduction into interstate commerce of novelty lighters, and for \nother purposes; to the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation.\n  Mr. WYDEN. Mr. President, today, I am joining my colleagues from \nMaine, Connecticut, and Delaware, in introducing the Protect Children \nfrom Dangerous Lighters Act, a ban on novelty cigarette lighters.\n  Novelty lighters, also known as toy-like lighters, are cigarette \nlighters that look like small children's toys or regular household \nitems. In the hands of small children they can be very dangerous. \nBecause they are so well disguised as toys, a child could easily pick \none up to play with it without realizing that it could be very \nhazardous.\n  The result of this mistake can be deadly: In Oregon, two boys were \nplaying with a novelty lighter disguised as a toy dolphin and \naccidently started a serious fire, causing the death of one boy and the \npermanent brain damage of the other. Also in Oregon, a mother suffered \nthird degree burns on her foot when her child was playing with a \nnovelty lighter shaped like a small toy Christmas tree and set a bed on \nfire.\n  Incidents like these happen all over the country. In Maine, a young \nboy took a miniature baseball bat off a shelf at a convenience store, \naccidentally ignited a flame and seared his eyebrow. In North Carolina, \na boy sustained second degree burns after playing with a novelty \nlighter that looked like a toy cell phone. In one of the most tragic \nexamples, a 2-year-old and a 15-month-old from Arkansas were killed in \na fire they accidently started while playing with a novelty lighter \nshaped like a toy motorcycle.\n  These injuries and deaths cry out to us to take action and remove \nthese dangerous lighters from shelves everywhere.\n  A ban on novelty lighters would require the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission to treat novelty lighters as a banned hazardous substance. \nThat means novelty lighters will not be manufactured, imported, sold, \nor given away as promotional gifts anywhere in this country. This \nmeasure will keep novelty lighters out of the hands of children and \nprevent injuries like those that have already brought tragedy to too \nmany families.\n  A number of states and cities have taken it upon themselves to ban \nthese dangerous lighters. Oregon and four other States have already \nenacted such bans, and thirteen other states are currently considering \nsimilar measures. It is clear that this is an important safety issue, \nand it is time for the Federal Government to pass this bill so that \nchildren in all states will be protected.\n  A Federal ban on novelty lighters has widespread, nationwide support. \nAlong with the Oregon Fire Marshal, the National Association of Fire \nMarshals supports a federal ban on these lighters and has been active \nin promoting public awareness on this issue. I want to thank the \nCongressional Fire Services Institute for their leadership in building \nsupport for this bill. The cigarette lighter industry, represented by \nthe Lighter Association, is a partner in supporting a ban on novelty \nlighters. Finally, consumer groups, such as Safe Kids USA and others \nhave endorsed this approach.\n  Congress should act now to avoid the suffering caused by the \nsenseless deaths and serious injuries that result from novelty lighters \nbeing mistaken for toys. Dangerous tools containing flammable fuel \nshould not be dressed up in packages that are attractive to children; \nespecially when young children do not have the capacity to \ndifferentiate these lighters from common toys. Please join me in \nbanning dangerous novelty lighters by cosponsoring the Protect Children \nfrom Dangerous Lighters Act.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 723\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protect Children from \n     Dangerous Lighters Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Lighters are inherently dangerous products containing \n     flammable fuel.\n       (2) If lighters are used incorrectly or used by children, \n     dangerous and damaging consequences may result.\n       (3) Novelty lighters are easily mistaken by children and \n     adults as children's toys or as common household items.\n       (4) Novelty lighters have been the cause of many personal \n     injuries to children and adults and property damage \n     throughout the United States.\n\n     SEC. 3. NOVELTY LIGHTER DEFINED.\n\n       (a) In General.--In this Act, the term ``novelty lighter'' \n     means a device typically used for the igniting or lighting of \n     cigarettes, cigars, or pipes that has a toy-like appearance, \n     has entertaining audio or visual effects, or resembles in any \n     way in form or function an item that is commonly recognized \n     as appealing, attractive, or intended for use by children of \n     10 years of age or younger, including such a device that \n     takes toy-like physical forms, including toy animals, cartoon \n     characters, cars, boats, airplanes, common household items, \n     weapons, cell phones, batteries, food, beverages, musical \n     instruments, and watches.\n       (b) Exclusion.--Such term does not include standard \n     disposable and refillable lighters that are printed or \n     decorated with logos, labels, decals, artwork, or heat \n     shrinkable sleeves.\n\n     SEC. 4. BAN ON NOVELTY LIGHTERS.\n\n       (a) Banned Hazardous Substance.--A novelty lighter shall be \n     treated as a banned hazardous substance as defined in section \n     2 of the Federal Hazardous Substances Act (15 U.S.C. 1261) \n     and the prohibitions set out in section 4 of such Act (15 \n     U.S.C. 1263) shall apply to novelty lighters.\n       (b) Application.--Subsection (a) applies to a novelty \n     lighter--\n       (1) manufactured on or after January 1, 1980; and\n       (2) that is not considered by the Consumer Product Safety \n     Commission to be an antique or an item with significant \n     artistic value.\n\n  Ms. COLLINS. Mr. President, I rise to join Senator Wyden in \nintroducing a bill that will ban the sale of certain novelty lighters \nthat children can mistake for toys, often with tragic consequences for \nthemselves and their families.\n  In Arkansas in 2007, two boys, ages 15 months and 2 years, died when \nthe toddler accidentally started a fire with a lighter shaped like a \nmotorcycle. In Oregon, in 2000, a fire started with a dolphin-shaped \nlighter left one child dead and another brain-damaged. In North \nCarolina, a 6-year-old boy was badly burned by a lighter shaped like a \ncell phone.\n  Sadly, the U.S. Fire Administration has other stories of the hazards \npresented by novelty lighters. When you learn that one looks like a \nrubber duck toy, and actually quacks, you can imagine the potential for \nharm.\n  As a co-chair of the Congressional Fire Services Caucus, I am proud \nto note that last year, my home State of Maine became the first State \nto outlaw the sale of novelty lighters.\n  Maine's pioneering law stems from a tragic 2007 incident in a \nLivermore, Maine, grocery store. While his mother was buying \nsandwiches, 6-year-old Shane St. Pierre picked up what appeared to be a \ntoy flashlight in the form of a baseball bat. When he flicked the \nswitch, a flame shot out and burned his face. Shane's dad, Norm St. \nPierre, a fire chief in nearby West Paris, began advocating for the \nnovelty-lighter ban that became Maine law in March 2008.\n  The Maine State Fire Marshal's office supported that legislation, and \na\n\n[[Page S3925]]\n\nnational ban has the support of the Congressional Fire Services \nInstitute, the National State Fire Marshals Association, and the \nNational Volunteer Fire Council.\n  The bill is straightforward. It treats novelty lighters manufactured \nafter January 1, 1980, as banned hazardous substances unless the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission determines a particular lighter has \nantique or significant artistic value. Otherwise, sale of lighters with \ntoy-like appearance, special audio or visual features, or other \nattributes that would appeal to children under 10 would be banned.\n  The novelty lighters targeted in this legislation serve no functional \nneed. But they are liable to attract the notice and curiosity of \nchildren, whose play can too easily turn into a scene of horror and \ndeath. The sale of lighters that look like animals, cartoon characters, \nfood, toys, or other objects is simply irresponsible and an invitation \nto tragedy.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting this simple \nmeasure that can save children from disfigurement and death.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. BINGAMAN (for himself and Mr. Hatch):\n  S. 725. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to allow \nself-employed individuals to deduct health insurance costs in computing \nself-employment taxes; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Mr. BINGAMAN. Mr. President, I rise today along with Senator Hatch to \nreintroduce the Equity for Our Nation's Self-Employed Act of 2009. This \nimportant legislation corrects an inequity that currently exists in our \ntax code that forces the self-employed to pay payroll taxes on the \nfunds used to purchase their health insurance while larger businesses \ndo not. Because of this inequity, health insurance is more expensive \nfor the self-employed. At a time when the number of people uninsured is \ngrowing at an alarming rate, we need to find ways to reduce the cost of \nhealth insurance. This legislation is a first logical step.\n  Under current law, corporations and other business entities are able \nto deduct health insurance premiums as a business expense and to forego \npayroll taxes on these costs. However, sole-proprietors are not allowed \nthis same deduction and thus, are required to pay self-employment tax, \ntheir payroll tax, on health insurance premiums. The self-employed are \nthe only segment of the business population that is additionally taxed \non health insurance. The legislation we are introducing today would \nstop this inequitable tax treatment and allow sole proprietors to \ndeduct the amount they pay for health insurance from their calculation \nof payroll taxes, leveling the playing field for the over 20 million \nself-employed in our Nation.\n  This problem affects all self-employed who provide health insurance \nto their families. According to the IRS, there are almost 130,000 sole-\nproprietors in New Mexico. While we do not know how many of these \npeople in New Mexico have health insurance, we do know that roughly 3.8 \nmillion working families in the U.S. paid self-employment tax on their \nhealth insurance premiums. Estimates indicate that roughly 60 percent \nof our Nation's uninsured are either self-employed or work for a small \nbusiness. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, self-employed \nworkers spent upwards of $12,000 per year in 2006 to provide health \ninsurance for their families. Because they cannot deduct this as an \nordinary business expense, those that spend this amount will pay a 15.3 \npercent payroll tax on their premiums, resulting in over $1,800 of \ntaxes annually.\n  This problem was identified by the National Taxpayer Advocate in \nseveral of her annual reports to Congress and our legislation to \ncorrect it is supported by over 40 national and State organizations \nincluding the National Association for the Self-Employed, the National \nSmall Business Association, the National Federation of Independent \nBusiness, National Association of Realtors, the U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce, and the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. I look forward to \nworking with my colleagues to get this important legislation passed.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 725\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Equity for Our Nation's Self \n     Employed Act of 2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEDUCTION FOR HEALTH INSURANCE COSTS IN COMPUTING \n                   SELF-EMPLOYMENT TAXES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 162(l) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 (relating to special rules for health insurance \n     costs of self-employed individuals) is amended by striking \n     paragraph (4) and by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph \n     (4).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to taxable years beginning after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Ms. LANDRIEU (for herself, Mr. Ensign, Mr. Cardin, Mrs. Boxer, \n        Mr. Graham, Ms. Collins, Mr. McCain, Mr. Lautenberg, Mr. \n        Menendez, Mr. Levin, Mr. Carper, Mr. Lieberman, Mr. Byrd, Mr. \n        Kerry, and Mr. Leahy):\n  S. 727. A bill to amend title 18, United States Code, to prohibit \ncertain conduct relating to the use of horses for human consumption; to \nthe Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. LANDRIEU. I rise today to introduce a piece of legislation that \nthis body has seen before, and actually we have passed a version of it \nby an overwhelming majority. But we have had difficulty as this bill \nhas left this body and moved across the Capitol, and the efforts to \npass this bill have actually been thwarted--not so much on the floors \nof the Congress or the Senate, but in committee rooms and conference \ncommittees--sometimes out of full public view. It has become an issue \nthat must be dealt with on its substance, but also the way that \nsometimes bills find themselves coming to dead ends, in my view in \ninappropriate ways.\n  The record of this subject has been long discussed on the floor. But \nthe bill attempts to end the transport of horses for slaughter to \nCanada and to Mexico.\n  This Congress, both Democrats and Republicans, a majority, has gone \non record saying that the practice of inhumane slaughter of these \nmajestic and very noble animals has no place in America. We do not use \ntheir meat for human consumption. It is no longer used even in our pet \nfoods. This is not true in other parts of the world but it is true here \nin America. So we want to have a better system to handle the breeding, \nthe raising, and the disposal of horses that are old, infirm, and sick. \nBut taking a perfectly healthy animal and slitting its throat and then \ncutting it up with hatchets and saws and moving equipment while it is \nstill alive is not what people in America would like to believe is \ngoing on. In fact it is--or was until a few years ago, until some of us \ngot together with a great coalition and ended the practice of slaughter \nin the United States.\n  There were only three plants operating--two in Texas, one in \nIllinois. Those State legislators and the leaders in those States \nstepped up and closed down those plants. But the problem is now the \n100,000 or so horses out of 900,000 that die naturally every year. We \nhave about 9 million horses in America, 900,000 die, approximately, \nevery year. And the great part of this story is that 95 percent of all \nhorses die a natural and humane death because the owners are very good, \nthey are very responsible.\n  Most people do what is right. That is what happens in most places, on \nmost subjects. But there is always that small group that, for whatever \nreason, proceeds down a path that is wholly inappropriate, although \nright now legal--we hope to solve that problem--and inhumanely \nslaughters horses.\n  The USDA and our own investigation show that 98 percent of the horses \nthat are inhumanely transported over our borders now to places that \nare, of course, unregulated by our Government and very modestly \nregulated, if at all, by the Governments of Canada and Mexico, 94 \npercent of these animals--92, I am sorry, 92.3 percent of those horses \nbeing sent to slaughter are healthy. They are not sick and they are not \ninfirm and they are not old.\n  People say to me: Well, Senator, do you not think we have to find a \nway to\n\n[[Page S3926]]\n\nget rid of horses that are sick or too old? I say: Absolutely. There \nare humane ways to get rid of horses. But the myth and the lie and the \nshame of this slaughtering that is going on is that 92 percent of those \nanimals are healthy. Many of them are young. Many of them have a great \nfuture. But because there is a loophole in our law right now, they are \nbeing treated in this way.\n  So I am introducing this bill with my good friend and colleague John \nEnsign, Senator Ensign from Nevada, the leading cosponsor, also with \nSenators Cardin, Boxer, Graham, Collins, McCain, Lautenberg, Menendez, \nLevin, Carper, Lieberman, Byrd, Kerry, and Leahy as cosponsors, \noriginal cosponsors of this legislation, entitled the Prevention of \nEquine Cruelty Act.\n  The way this bill would be put into place, should it be passed and \nsigned by the President into law, is if a person is found in violation \nof this act, they are found to knowingly transport or sell or purchase \na horse with the intent to slaughter it for human consumption, they \nwill be fined, and there will be criminal penalties associated with \nthis practice. If a defendant is found guilty, he or she could be \nsentenced up to 1 year of prison if he or she has no prior convictions. \nIf he or she does have prior convictions, the penalty will be \nincreased.\n  As I have said, although U.S. slaughterhouses have been closed, \nthousands of horses are inhumanely, every day, 1,500 a week, \ntransported across our borders to this deplorable fate. Sometime horses \nare shipped as many as 600 miles with limited food and water. I could \nshow you dozens of pictures. I will spare those who are on the floor \nand those watching from the horror of some of these pictures. But if \nyou want to see them, there are ample pictures and evidence on the \nInternet available for what is a mindless and barbaric practice we want \nto stop.\n  When people say to me: Senator, how are farmers and ranchers going to \nafford it? It is expensive to put down a horse. It costs about $225 to \nhumanely euthanize a horse. It costs $225 to feed a horse for 1 month. \nSo if you can afford to purchase an animal, if you can afford to \nmaintain an animal, you most certainly can afford the price of putting \nit down humanely, for the work that is done on your behalf, for the \npleasure it has provided you or the transportation it has provided you.\n  Horses are used in our country for many different and very necessary \npurposes. I want to say this has been a long battle. It started many \nyears ago. But in September of 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals upheld \nthe Illinois statute that banned the slaughterhouse from continuing.\n  In April of that same year, the Senate Commerce Committee voted 15 to \n7 to ban slaughter. In 2007, in January, the U.S. Court of Appeals for \nthe Fifth Circuit declared the slaughter of horses for food illegal in \nTexas, upholding a law that dated back to 1949. And on September 7--you \nmight have still been there--the House passed H.R. 503, the American \nHorse Slaughter Prevention Act. Unfortunately, that Congress adjourned \nbefore the Senate could take it up, and the Senate did, in October, \ntake up this matter in the agriculture appropriations bill, only to \nhave it scuttled again.\n  So I submit to you that there is a broad base of bipartisan support \nfor this legislation. I submit to you that the practice is cruel and \ninhumane. I submit to you that I have every court, both at the district \nand appellate level, that has weighed in has weighed in on the side of \nour efforts here today. And it is my intention, working with Senator \nJohn Ensign from Nevada, to finally get this bill passed, so we will \nhave, once and for all, ended inhumane slaughter and created a way for \nhorses to be put down or to die naturally and to be disposed of \nproperly in this country, which we think will be a great testimony to \nthe rising awareness of animal care in this Nation.\n  Now, when people say: She has gone too far and we are going to do the \nsame thing for cows and goats and chickens--horses are not raised for \nthe same purpose as cows and goats and chickens.

A bill to amend title 38, United States Code, to enhance \nveterans' insurance benefits, and for other purposes; to the Committee \non Veterans' Affairs.\n  Mr. AKAKA. Mr. President, I am pleased to introduce the Veterans' \nInsurance and Benefits Enhancement Act of 2009. This comprehensive \nlegislation, much of which was considered and passed by the Senate in \nthe last Congress, would improve benefits and services for veterans \nboth young and old.\n  This legislation would make several important improvements in \ninsurance programs for disabled veterans. It would establish a new \nprogram of insurance for service-connected disabled veterans that would \nprovide up to a maximum of $50,000 in level premium term life insurance \ncoverage. This new program would be available to service-connected \ndisabled veterans who are less than 65 years of age at the time of \napplication. More importantly, unlike VA's Service-Disabled Veterans \nInsurance program, the premium rates for this program would be based on \nan updated mortality table, meaning that premiums under this program \nwould be fairer to veterans.\n  This legislation would also expand eligibility for retroactive \nbenefits from traumatic injury protection coverage under the \nServicemembers' Group Life Insurance program. This insurance program \nwent into effect on December 1, 2005. All insured servicemembers under \nSGLI from that point forward are covered by traumatic injury protection \nregardless of where their injuries occur. However, individuals \nsustaining traumatic injuries between October 7, 2001, and November 30, \n2005, that were not incurred as a direct result of Operations Enduring \nor Iraqi Freedom are not eligible for a retroactive payment under the \ntraumatic injury protection program. This legislation would expand \neligibility to these individuals.\n  This bill would also increase the maximum amount of Veterans' \nMortgage Life Insurance that a service-connected disabled veteran may \npurchase from the current maximum of $90,000 up to $200,000. In the \nevent of the veteran's death, the veteran's family is protected because \nVA will pay the balance of the mortgage owed up to the maximum amount \nof insurance purchased. The need for this increase is obvious in \ntoday's housing market.\n  In addition, this legislation would increase the amount of \nsupplemental life\n\n[[Page S3927]]\n\ninsurance available to totally disabled veterans from $20,000 to \n$30,000. Many totally disabled veterans find it difficult to obtain \ncommercial life insurance. This legislation would provide these \nveterans with a reasonable amount of life insurance coverage.\n  This bill would also increase certain benefits for veterans and their \nsurvivors that have not been updated for many years. The minimum \nbenefit rate for low-income parents of children who have died during \nmilitary service, or as the result of a service-connected disability, \nhas remained at only $5.00 per month since 1975. This is unacceptable. \nTherefore, this bill would increase the minimum Parent's DIC benefit to \n$100 per month, and also increase the basic benefit for a parent with \nno income to the same level as that provided to low-income spouses of \nwartime veterans. In addition, this bill would increase the amount of \npension paid to VA pensioners who receive Medicaid benefits from $90.00 \nper month, which was set in 1989, to $100 per month. In addition, all \nof these benefits and benefits for surviving spouses with children \nwould be adjusted by cost-of-living allowances so that these VA \nbenefits would never again become so outdated.\n  Another provision included in this bill would reaffirm Congress's \nintent with regard to who should be eligible for a special monthly \npension. Low income, nondisabled wartime veterans 65 and older qualify \nfor a VA service pension benefit. Those who are totally and permanently \ndisabled are eligible to receive a disability pension with additional \nmonies if they are housebound, blind, or need help in everyday living \nactivities. In a 2006 decision, the U.S. Court of Appeals for Veterans \nClaims ruled that an older veteran no longer had to have a disability \nrated permanent and total in order to receive housebound benefits. The \nlegislative history is clear that Congress intended that only those \nveterans with a permanent and total disability would qualify for \nhousebound benefits. This provision would require VA to provide this \nbenefit as Congress originally intended.\n  This is not a comprehensive recitation of all the provisions within \nthis important veterans' legislation. However, I hope that I have \nprovided an appropriate overview of the benefits this legislation would \nprovide for America's veterans and servicemembers. I urge our \ncolleagues to support the legislation.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nplaced in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 728\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. President, I am pleased to join Senator Durbin once \nagain to introduce the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien \nMinors Act, DREAM. This legislation has the potential to change the \nlives of many young people in an extraordinary and positive way and is \nan investment in America's future.\n  The Senate has attempted several times to pass the DREAM Act, but the \nbitter politics of immigration have stalled our best efforts in the \npast. I appreciate Senator Durbin's persistence, and I share his \ncommitment to the young people whose lives this bill would profoundly \nimprove. Those who came to the U.S. as minors under the care of their \nparents are not guilty of their parents' transgressions. For many, the \nU.S. is the only home they know. We will further the Federal policy \nthat supports educational opportunity and military service if we \nexercise the forbearance to defer rigid application of our laws upon \nthose who have the potential to be citizens that will move our country \nforward. We all recognize the value of higher education and service to \nour country. To serve these Federal policy interests by giving legal \nstability and opportunity to young people caught in the limbo of our \nlaws through no fault of their own is the right thing to do.\n  As Congress and the administration work through the immediate \nchallenges that lie ahead, and begin to restore the faith of Americans \nin our economy and our government, I hope Congress will not shy away \nfrom other important issues such as immigration reform. When our \nFederal Government confronts the issue of immigration, I hope we will \nsee not only the opportunity to correct what is wrong, but also to \nimprove and build upon what is good and just about the traditions of \nwelcoming and refuge that define our immigration system. The promise \nthis bill holds for so many young people will reinforce the spirit that \nunderlies the history of American immigration and the diversity that \nhas moved us so far.\n  I thank Senator Durbin and hope all Senators will join us in support \nof this legislation.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. AKAKA (for himself, Mr. Specter, Mr. Cardin, Mr. Schumer, \n        Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Brown, and Mr. Casey):\n  S. 732. A bill to amend the National Dam Safety Program Act to \nestablish a program to provide grant assistance to States for the \nrehabilitation and repair of deficient dams; to the Committee on \nEnvironment and Public Works.\n  Mr. SPECTER. Mr. President, I seek recognition to comment on my \ncosponsorship of the Dam Rehabilitation and Repair Act of 2009 and \nclarify my intent with respect to Davis-Bacon prevailing wage \nrequirements under this bill.\n  This bill would establish a grant program within the Federal \nEmergency Management Agency to provide assistance to states for the \nrehabilitation of publicly-owned dams that fail to meet minimum safety \nstandards. I am cosponsoring this bill because it is my understanding \nthat there are at least 3,040 deficient dams in the United States, \nincluding 369 in Pennsylvania. These dams pose an unacceptable level of \nrisk to the public and should be rehabilitated expeditiously.\n  I cosponsored similar legislation in the 110th Congress, however, I \nam advised that it was not considered by the Committee on Environment \nand Public Works due to concerns over language in the bill which would \nhave required that dam repair work funded under the act adhere to \nDavis-Bacon locally prevailing wage requirements. As a result, this \nyear's version of the bill, as introduced, does not contain Davis-Bacon \nprevailing wage requirements out of deference to the Ranking Member of \nthe Committee. However, I am a strong supporter of Davis-Bacon, having \nvoted in favor of preserving it 23 separate times on the Senate floor \nsince 1982. Accordingly, it is my intention to work to reinsert Davis-\nBacon requirements into the bill either in committee or on the Senate \nfloor.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/26/senate-section/article/S3932-1", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3932-S3933]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SUBMITTED RESOLUTIONS\n\n                                 ______\n                                 \n\n    SENATE RESOLUTION 86--DESIGNATING APIRL 18, 2009, AS ``NATIONAL \n                           AUCTIONEERS DAY''\n\n  Mr. BROWNBACK (for himself and Mr. Roberts) submitted the following \nresolution; which was referred to the Committee on the Judiciary:\n\n\n[[Page S3933]]\n\n\n\n                               S.

Mr. President, today I rise to recognize America's public \nservants, who provide the essential services upon which this nation \nrelies. As the chairman of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight of Government \nManagement, the Federal Workforce, and the District of Columbia, I am \nhonored to introduce a resolution paying tribute to these employees in \ncelebration of Public Service Recognition Week.\n  This is the 25th anniversary of Public Service Recognition Week, \nwhich always takes place the first full week of May. It is a time set \naside each year to honor the men and women who serve America as \nFederal, State, and local government employees, and commend their \ndedication to serving others.\n  The contributions of hardworking, talented government employees \nmaintain our quality of life. They protect our borders from drug and \nweapon trafficking; conduct research to prevent future epidemics; and \nbring hope to those who live in poverty. Public servants teach our \nchildren; protect our homes and communities; secure our public water \nsystems and critical infrastructure; preserve our natural resources; \nand defend the principles of liberty and freedom that we hold dear.\n  The men and women who serve in the armed forces, and the civilian \nemployees who support their missions, are prime examples of public \nservice. They embody the spirit of service, characterized by a \nwillingness to defend this nation. Despite the many hardships of \nserving through long conflicts, these men and women serve with bravery \nand unwavering devotion. They have sacrificed their lives so that we \nmight continue to be free.\n  President Obama has called for action to ``encourage a renewed spirit \nof national service for this and future generations.'' While Public \nService Recognition Week provides the opportunity to honor and \ncelebrate the works of federal employees, it also serves as an \nopportunity for all Americans to explore the various careers in public \nservice. Through job fairs, agency sponsored events, and special \nexhibits, Public Service Recognition Week allows the American public to \ngain a deeper appreciation of the challenging and rewarding work \navailable in the government. It is my hope that through these sponsored \nevents, many young professionals will decide to embrace a career as a \npublic servant.\n  I encourage my colleagues to recognize the hard work and the services \nprovided by government employees in their states and join in this \nannual celebration.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/26/senate-section/article/S3933-2", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3933-S3934]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   SENATE RESOLUTION 88--HONORING THE LIFE OF DR.

Philanthropy, charity, giving \n     voluntarily and freely . . . call it what you like, but it is \n     truly a jewel of an American tradition''.\n       (2) Americans gave more than $300,000,000,000 to charitable \n     causes in 2007, an amount equal to roughly 2 percent of the \n     gross domestic product.\n       (3) The vast majority of those donations, roughly 75 \n     percent or $229,000,000,000, came from individuals.\n       (4) Studies have shown that Americans give far more to \n     charity than the people of any other industrialized nation--\n     more than twice as much, measured as a share of gross \n     domestic product, than the citizens of Great Britain, and 10 \n     times more than the citizens of France.\n       (5) 7 out of 10 American households donate to charities to \n     support a wide range of religious, educational, cultural, \n     health care, and environmental goals.\n       (6) These charities provide innumerable valuable public \n     services to society's most vulnerable citizens during \n     difficult economic times.\n       (7) Congress has provided incentives through the Internal \n     Revenue Code of 1986 to encourage charitable giving by \n     allowing individuals to deduct contributions made to tax-\n     exempt charities.\n       (8) 41,000,000 American households, constituting 86 percent \n     of taxpayers who itemize deductions, took advantage of this \n     deduction to give to the charities of their choice.\n       (b) Sense of the Senate.--It is the sense of the Senate \n     that Congress should preserve the income tax deduction for \n     charitable contributions through the Internal Revenue Code of \n     1986 and look for additional ways to encourage charitable \n     giving.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n  SA 722.

Res. 37\n\n       Whereas Sean Goldman is the son of David Goldman and Bruna \n     Goldman, and is a United States citizen and a resident of \n     Tinton Falls, New Jersey;\n       Whereas Bruna Goldman took Sean Goldman to Brazil on June \n     16, 2004;\n       Whereas after Bruna and Sean Goldman arrived in Brazil, \n     Bruna Goldman informed David Goldman that she would remain \n     permanently in Brazil and would not return Sean Goldman to \n     David Goldman in New Jersey;\n       Whereas on August 26, 2004, the Superior Court of New \n     Jersey issued a ruling awarding David Goldman physical and \n     legal custody of Sean Goldman and ordering that Sean Goldman \n     be immediately returned to the United States;\n       Whereas David Goldman initiated judicial proceedings in the \n     Federal Court of Rio de Janeiro, under the Convention on the \n     Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, done at the \n     Hague October 25, 1980 (TIAS 11670) (the ``Convention''), to \n     which both the United States and Brazil are parties;\n       Whereas the Convention requires that a child who is a \n     habitual resident of a country that is a party to the \n     Convention, and who has been removed from or retained in a \n     country that is also a party to the Convention in violation \n     of the custodial rights of a parent of that child, be \n     returned to the country of habitual residence;\n       Whereas despite the petition filed in the Federal Court of \n     Rio de Janeiro by David Goldman for the return of his child, \n     less than one year after Sean Goldman was taken to Brazil, \n     David Goldman was prevented from exercising his legal custody \n     of Sean Goldman by rulings of the Federal Regional Court and \n     the 3rd Chamber of the Superior Court of Justice of Brazil;\n       Whereas Bruna Goldman passed away in August 2008, and her \n     new husband filed a petition to replace the name of David \n     Goldman with his own name on the birth certificate of Sean \n     Goldman;\n       Whereas the new husband of Bruna Goldman filed a petition \n     for custody of Sean Goldman with the 2nd Family Court of \n     Brazil on August 28, 2008;\n       Whereas the 2nd Family Court of Brazil granted temporary \n     custody to the new husband of Bruna Goldman, despite specific \n     provisions in the Convention that prohibit action by a family \n     court while a case brought under the Convention is pending;\n       Whereas Sean Goldman remains in the temporary custody of \n     the new husband of Bruna Goldman;\n       Whereas the Convention requires the Government of Brazil to \n     ``take all appropriate measures to secure within [its \n     territory] the implementation of the objects of the \n     Convention'' and ``to use the most expeditious procedures \n     available'';\n       Whereas the Goldman case has been pending in the courts of \n     Brazil since 2004;\n       Whereas the Department of State reported in the 2008 report \n     on compliance with the Convention, as required under section \n     2803 of the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of \n     1998 (42 U.S.C. 11611), that the judicial authorities of \n     Brazil ``continued to demonstrate patterns of noncompliance \n     with the Convention'';\n       Whereas the Special Secretariat for Human Rights of the \n     Presidency of the Republic of Brazil, the central authority \n     for carrying out the Convention in Brazil, wrote to the \n     Office of the Attorney General of Brazil to express concern \n     with the manner in which the 2d Family Court of Brazil \n     conducted the case of Sean Goldman and to state that the \n     issuance of temporary custody rights by the 2d Family Court \n     of Brazil was a violation of the Convention;\n       Whereas Sean Goldman is being deprived of his rightful \n     opportunity to live with and be raised by his biological \n     father, David Goldman; and\n       Whereas it is consistent with international law that Sean \n     Goldman be reunited with his father, David Goldman, in New \n     Jersey: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the Senate calls on Brazil--\n       (1) to fulfill its obligations under the Convention on the \n     Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction, done at the \n     Hague October 25, 1980 (TIAS 11670); and\n       (2) to assist in the safe return of Sean Goldman to his \n     father, David Goldman, in the United States.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/03/26/senate-section/article/S3938-3", "month": "03", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S3938-S3939]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        CONGRATULATING THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN COLLEGE BATTLIN' BEARS\n\n  Mr. REID.
