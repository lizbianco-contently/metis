Mr. President, from the very first days of the new \nadministration, Senate Republicans have pledged to work closely with \nour new President and his Cabinet to find solutions to the Nation's \nmany foreign and domestic challenges.\n  On the foreign policy front, we felt strongly about the need to work \nwith the new administration on a unified agenda that protects the \nAmerican people and furthers our interests abroad. So far, we have had \ntwo major points of convergence.\n  On the enormously important question of our strategies in both \nAfghanistan and Iraq, Republicans support the President's decision to \nfollow, in both cases, the best advice of his military commanders on \nthe ground.\n  We may part ways on a number of other foreign policy issues, some of \nwhich I outlined in greater detail earlier this week, but when it comes \nto the question of Iraq and Afghanistan, the President's strategy is \none that most everyone can support.\n  Here at home, there have admittedly been fewer opportunities for \nagreement.\n  An ongoing recession and the continuing reverberations of a financial \nshock that began in the housing industry led both parties to come up \nwith their own respective plans to jumpstart the economy in the short \nterm and strengthen its foundations in the long term.\n  The administration's plan revolved around a trillion dollar stimulus \nthat was neither timely, targeted, nor temporary--as well as a decision \nto press forward on several major, controversial legislative proposals. \nIf the President's budget is fully implemented, it would double the \nnational debt in just 5 years and nearly triple it in 10.\n  Republicans had a different approach. We worked closely with \nDemocrats last fall to pass a financial rescue plan aimed at \nstabilizing the overall economy. But we refused to support a second \nround of funds when the administration couldn't assure us it would only \nbe used to address the crisis at hand.\n  When it came to an economic stimulus, Republicans pointed out the \nglaring weaknesses in the Democrat plan and we offered a plan of our \nown that would have cost half as much and gone straight to the root of \nthe problem, which is housing.\n  We also suggested that instead of spending billions on wasteful \nprojects, we loan State and local governments money. This would have \nencouraged the careful use of taxpayer dollars since State and local \ngovernments would have known they would have to pay the money back when \nthe economy improved.\n  We also refused to support bailouts for the auto industry, since we \ndon't think the Government should be picking winners and losers. We \nsaid bailouts would only delay necessary reforms for long-term success. \nOur position was recently vindicated when the automakers came back for \neven more money, forcing the administration to talk seriously about \nbankruptcy as a means of achieving the necessary restructuring.\n  When it comes to protecting taxpayers and to a mounting debt that our \nchildren will inherit, the new administration has been remarkably \ncarefree. Most of this debt is being financed by China and countries in \nthe Middle East, which of course increases the economic leverage these \ncountries have over the United States.\n  Americans are worried about this and they should be. In a time of \neconomic hardship, we should not be borrowing money we will not be able \nto pay back.\n  The current administration seems to disagree. In just 1 week in \nFebruary, the administration's acts cost the American taxpayers more \nthan $1 trillion, or more than the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan and the \nrelief efforts for Hurricane Katrina combined.\n  Federal support for a single company in the financial sector now \namounts to almost $175 billion over the past year alone. That is more \nthan what we will spend this year on the deployment costs of our Armed \nForces fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  So far this year the most far-reaching legislation we have considered \nis the budget. In the middle of a recession, the same Democrats who \nwere outraged over a $455 billion deficit last year came to us this \nyear with a budget that would lead to trillion-dollar deficits and \nwhich saddles Americans with more debt than all the debt we had \naccumulated from George Washington to the present day, combined.\n  Hundreds of thousands of American workers are losing their jobs every \nmonth. They are concerned that all this spending and debt will not just \nslow the economic recovery but make it harder to keep or find jobs. \nThese Americans may like the President, but they do not understand how \na giant expansion of Government will help create or preserve jobs.\n  They do not think the administration has done enough to explain how \nborrowing money to create those programs will make America stronger, \nmore secure, and more economically sound.\n  Americans are also increasingly concerned about the administration's \napproach to a number of foreign policy issues that are related to our \nefforts in Afghanistan and Iraq. One of the most troubling of these \ndecisions relates to the terrorist detention facility at Guantanamo \nBay. Shortly after taking office, the new Attorney General was tasked \nwith closing Guantanamo by next January.\n  Yet 3 months later, the administration still has not provided the \nAmerican people with any further details about what will happen to \nthese inmates once the January deadline arrives. The American people do \nnot want terrorists back on the battlefield, and they certainly do not \nwant them released into their neighborhoods, as some in the \nadministration have shockingly proposed, according to news accounts.\n  The administration has not been clear about its reason for closing \nGuantanamo before it has a plan for these detainees. But its reason \ncannot be that the facility is poorly run, since Attorney General \nHolder has said himself that the facilities there are good ones. It \ncannot be that the administration has a better alternative. If it did, \nwe would have heard about it by now. The American people do not want \ntrained terrorists released into their neighborhoods. They want \nanswers. Unfortunately, the administration has only offered silence.\n  In the face of tremendous challenges at home and abroad, the new \nadministration offered a burst of activity and a veritable explosion of \ndebt. Meanwhile, Republicans have proposed responsible solutions that \nare meant to empower the American people and improve the quality of \ntheir daily lives.\n  On this front, Republicans will continue to offer sensible ideas on \nhealth care that address the concerns Americans have about the high \ncost of doctors visits, about finding good health coverage, and about \nkeeping the coverage they have.\n  The lesson of the failed health care proposal of the Clinton era is \nnot that Americans do not want reform, it is that any reform should \nreflect the needs of all Americans, not just a select few in \nWashington. Americans do not want a health care solution that puts \nbureaucrats in charge of medical decisions, delays appointments or \ndiminishes the quality of health care they already receive.\n  Health care is an area where Americans expect the President and \nCongress to work together. The divide-and-conquer approach did not work \nin 1993, it will not work in 2009.\n\n[[Page S4833]]\n\n  Energy is another area where Republicans have offered and will \ncontinue to offer commonsense solutions. Last year, even before gas \nprices hit the roof, we proposed a sensible approach of finding more \nand using less. Republicans are also proposing a dramatic expansion of \nnuclear power. This would match the high demand for energy in the \nworld's largest economy with a growing public desire for cleaner, more \nefficient energy sources.\n  Health care and energy are just two of the areas where Republicans \nwill continue to offer better ideas in the coming months. We hope our \nfriends on the other side are more supportive of these ideas than they \nhave been of our proposals on the economy.\n  On this point, it is interesting to know that just a few weeks ago, \nDemocrats showed strong support on the Senate floor for Republican \nproposals to protect small businesses and middle-class taxpayers, as \nwell as a proposal to keep the Nation's debt at a level we can manage. \nThey also expressed strong support for a Republican proposal that \nclimate change legislation not lead to higher gas and electricity \nbills.\n  Yet these Republican proposals which drew such broadspread support on \nthe Senate floor just a few weeks ago were, for some reason, taken out \nof the final product that came out of the closed conference.\n  Democrats cannot have it both ways. Americans are suffering. They are \nlosing homes, and they are losing jobs. Republicans have offered, and \nwill continue to offer, proposals that put the concern of these \nordinary Americans first: Democrats' overspending, taxes, and debt.\n  Massive spending and debt is not the answer to a recession. A one-\nparty solution with no checks and balances is not the answer for health \ncare. Opposing clean, nuclear power and expanded use of other domestic \nenergy sources is not an answer for our energy needs.\n  Voting for tax relief before voting against it is not the way to show \nthe American people you have their best economic interests in mind. \nRepublicans have not been hesitant to offer our strong public support \nfor the new administration, and, again, I commend the President on his \napproach to Afghanistan and Iraq. But we have not been hesitant to \nstate our differences clearly.\n  That has been the story of the first 100 days for Senate Republicans \nand will continue to be the story for Senate Republicans: Principled \nsupport, principled opposition, and pragmatic, creative solutions to \nmeet the challenges of the day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4833-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4833-S4834]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRIBUTE TO ROBLEY REX\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. Mr. President, I rise because my State and our country \nhave lost one of our last links to a bygone era. On Tuesday, April 28, \nRobley Rex passed away a few days shy of his 108th birthday. He will \nforever be remembered as Kentucky's last World War I-era veteran.\n  Ninety years ago, a teenaged Robley Rex landed in France, caring a \nrifle and wearing a U.S. Army uniform. He was a long way from Christian \nCounty, KY, where he was born in 1901 and raised.\n  Wanting to see the world and fight for his country, Robley enlisted \nin the Fifth, and later the 28th, Infantry Division and was deployed to \nEurope. After leaving the Army in 1922, he returned to Kentucky and \nsettled in Louisville, where he became a postal worker and ordained \nMethodist minister.\n  Robley was not only the Bluegrass State's preeminent veteran, he was \nalso its preeminent volunteer on behalf of veterans. Decades after his \nown active service ended, he continued to serve his fellow soldiers by \nvolunteering at the Louisville Veterans Affairs Medical Center, right \nup until the last years of his life.\n  The Veterans of Foreign Wars honored him for over 14,000 hours of \nservice in 22 years. I was proud to call Robley a friend of mine. Our \nlives intersected a number of times over the last 20 or 30 years. A few \nweeks ago when I was in Louisville, I had the pleasure to read a \nwonderful article about Robley in the Southeast Outlook. On a sad note, \nthe article mentioned how Robley was looking forward to his impending \nbirthday. I know a lot of the rest of us were too. His friends were \nplanning a special birthday celebration at the Louisville VA hospital \nnext month. Instead, it will be an opportunity to remember how much \nRobley meant to all of us.\n  As much as we will all miss him, I take comfort knowing that Robley \nis reunited with his beloved wife Gracie, who passed away in 1992, \nafter more than 60 years of marriage.\n  Because I wish to share with my colleagues this article on Robley \nRex's long and exciting life, I ask unanimous consent that the full \narticle be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n    [From the Louisville, Kentucky, Southeast Outlook, Apr. 2, 2009]\n\n                        107-Year-Old Robley Rex\n\n                            (By Ruth Schenk)\n\n       Eighteen-year-old Robley Rex weighed just 115 pounds when \n     he landed in France at the end of World War I carrying an 84-\n     pound pack.\n       Every soldier had a blanket, a quart of water, 160 rounds \n     of ammunition, a Springfield M6 Scout gun and a small khaki-\n     colored New Testament. His uniform was made of a drab olive \n     wool.\n       Rex signed up for the Army on May 21, 1918, a few weeks \n     after his 18th birthday. He convinced his mom to sign to \n     papers after recruiters told him it was the ``chance of a \n     lifetime'' and assured the teenager who grew up on a farm in \n     Christian County, Ky., that he'd ``see the world, and the \n     world would see a lot of him.''\n       Army pay back then was $36 a month.\n       At that time, everybody thought the war would end any day. \n     The Germans and the Allies signed the Armistice on Nov 11, \n     1918, but they hadn't yet signed the Treaty of Versailles.\n       Rex, now one of the last World War I-era vets living in the \n     United States, is a celebrity at Christopher East Nursing \n     Home in Louisville and an icon among veterans. In 107 years, \n     he has lived through 20 presidents, two world wars, the \n     Korean conflict, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf and the war in \n     Iraq.\n       He has seen a lot of world change in his lifetime.\n       Rex was a Private First Class when his ship landed in \n     northwestern France. Word of the armistice hadn't yet reached \n     the trenches, so bullets still were flying. His first job was \n     guarding German prisoners. Remnants of war were everywhere--\n     in the rubble of buildings, hundreds of acres of ``torn up'' \n     land and big puddles of green water that reminded Rex of \n     gangrene.\n       French soldiers told him they would have lost the war if it \n     weren't for the Americans.\n       Back then, military life meant absolute, complete \n     obedience. No one questioned authority.\n       ``If the corporal told us to pick up something on the \n     ground, we picked it up. There was no need to explain or \n     question why we were going to climb a mountain or go to a \n     town,'' Rex said. ``If the captain said you were going, you \n     were going--without any explanation.''\n       Most everyone attended religious services.\n       ``They weren't mandatory, but if everybody from Company B \n     was told to be at the 8 a.m. service, they were there,'' Rex \n     said. ``We went because we wanted to do the right thing.''\n       Rex believes that Army coffee must come from the bark of \n     trees, and that there are no atheists in foxholes.\n       The faith he'd learned at home carried him through scary \n     times. ``When I was walking down a road in Germany or in \n     France, and the fear would rise up in me, I would say, `I \n     have no fear for Thou are with me' from Psalm 23 or Isaiah \n     41:10, `So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be \n     dismayed, for I am your God. I will uphold you with my \n     righteous right hand.'''\n       There's not much Rex doesn't remember.\n       All the great military heroes of that day were in Europe: \n     Dwight Eisenhower, George Patton and John Pershing.\n       ``The soldier we wanted to see most was Douglas MacArthur. \n     At that time, he was considered the world's greatest \n     patriot,'' Rex said.\n       After 2\\1/2\\ months in France, Rex was sent to Germany with \n     the 3rd Army Intelligence Unit because he had finished two \n     years of high school.\n       He saw destruction--and need. Rex said he'll never forget \n     seeing German citizens wait for the food the American \n     soldiers threw away so they could take it to their own homes.\n       Rex spent three years in Europe. The recruiters were right: \n     He saw people and places he never would have seen if he had \n     stayed in Kentucky.\n       In 1921, Rex returned to the States, was discharged from \n     the Army and settled into civilian life with a job at \n     Marathon Tire in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio. By then, he was 22 \n     years old and ready to ``settle down.'' If the job was good, \n     meeting his wife, Gracie, in the Camp Taylor area of \n     Louisville was 100 times better.\n       It was close to love at first sight.\n       Rex doesn't remember where they went on dates, but he says \n     the secret to his long life is ``marrying the right woman.''\n       According to Rex, Gracie was the best cook and ``saver'' in \n     the world.\n       ``Grace could walk across the yard, cut off a handful of \n     grass, fry it and it would be\n\n[[Page S4834]]\n\n     good,'' he said. ``And she never let us spend more than we \n     brought home. If I earned $10,000, and she said we'd save \n     $2,000, we'd save $2,000. If I made $6,000 and she said we \n     should save $2,000, we'd save $2,000.''\n       The two only had each other, as they never had children.\n       For Rex, that was enough.\n       Rex began volunteering at the Louisville Veterans Medical \n     Center when he was in his 80s. His job was to get needed \n     medical records to the right place in the hospital before 8 \n     a.m. He continued volunteering until 2005, when he was 104 \n     and confined to a wheelchair. By then, he had put in 22 years \n     and more than 14,000 hours.\n       He always took time to talk with wounded veterans.\n       ``Each one has a great story to tell,'' Rex said. ``I've \n     heard soldiers tell how they lost legs and arms in battle, \n     how they were taken prisoner and managed to survive horrors \n     of combat.''\n       His advanced age has not diminished his sense of humor \n     either.\n       Ask Rex about his best birthday celebration and he says, \n     ``The one coming up.''\n       The hardest thing in Rex's life wasn't the war or the Great \n     Depression.\n       It was Aug. 24, 1992, the day Gracie died. He still tears \n     up when he talks about it, and he still wears his wedding \n     ring with tape wound around it to keep it on his finger.\n       Rex doesn't think he's anything special. Just an ordinary \n     boy from Kentucky who served his country.\n\n  Mr. McCONNELL. I know all my colleagues join me in honoring the \nmemory of this great patriot and soldier. Through his long lifetime of \nservice, Robley Rex proved his faith and devotion to his country. Now \nhis country will forever be faithful and devoted to him.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Arizona is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. KYL.

Mr. President, President Obama's first 100 days in office \nmake for compelling news stories, but what we should focus on is how \nthe first 100 days will affect our future. This will go down in history \nas the most expensive 100 days for the American people.\n  Since his inauguration, President Obama has signed into law $1.19 \ntrillion in new spending. That is $11.9 billion of spending for each \nday he has been in office. Those figures do not include the $3.7 \ntrillion budget for next year, a measure now awaiting final action on \nthe Senate floor.\n  The Congressional Budget Office estimates that if this budget is \npassed and signed into law, by 2019, the public debt will reach 82.4 \npercent of our gross domestic product. That means more new debt will be \ncreated under this one budget than all the combined debt created by all \nthe previous 43 Presidents, all the way back to President George \nWashington.\n  His own advisers acknowledge the budget will put us on an \nunsustainable course. It proposes a sweeping change of course for the \nU.S. economy that will shift the balance of power away from the private \nsector toward the Federal Government.\n  It is not just the uncharted levels of spending and debt; this budget \nlevies higher taxes on every household in the form of a national energy \ntax and puts taxpayers on the hook to pay for a larger and more \nintrusive Federal Government.\n  In other words, this budget spends too much, taxes too much, and \nborrows too much. On spending, President Obama has made his proposed \nnew spending sound more palatable by describing it as an ``investment'' \nthat will pay off by saving us money down the road.\n  Most of the new spending, however, is for services and programs whose \nlong-term value continues to be debated. Nor is there any intention of \ncutting spending in the future. This budget does not propose one-time \ninvestments followed by areas of reduced spending. Instead, billions in \nnew outlays will continue indefinitely, meaning the permanent \naccruement of power in Washington.\n  Rolling back the Federal Government's reach in the coming years could \nprove a Sisyphean challenge. Those of us in Washington need to keep in \nmind that families and small businesses, now more than ever, make \nsacrifices and tradeoffs in their own budgets. Should Washington not do \nthe same?\n  This budget continues business as usual, making no hard choices about \nhow to rein in out-of-control Government spending. In fact, the budget \nis so big that, according to the Heritage Foundation, a quarter of a \nmillion new Federal bureaucrats may be required to spend it all.\n  Federal Government employees represent the largest group of new jobs \ncreated under this bill. In response to concerns about the spending, \nPresident Obama has instructed his Cabinet to cut $100 million from the \nbudget in the next 90 days. Wow, $100 million. That represents just \n.003 percent of the budget. Let me put it in context. It is hard to \nimagine an Arizona family using the same math to trim its budget. A \ntypical Arizona family makes $47,215 per year. Say they would like a \nbudget similar to the President's. That means their budget would be \n$71,848 in the coming year. But they have to cut .003 percent. That is \n$2.05. So they still have a debt of $24,631 to put on the family credit \ncard. Unsustainable.\n  No family would decide to do this. It would not put them on a course \nfor future prosperity. We need to cut a lot more than that .003 for \nthis budget to be fiscally sustainable.\n  On the matter of taxes, the President has said he will cut taxes for \n95 percent of Americans. But his budget would raise taxes by $1.4 \ntrillion over the next 10 years. It would implement a new $646 billion \nenergy tax that will affect every American household regardless of \nincome and is estimated to increase energy costs for every family by as \nmuch as $3,168 annually.\n  It is described as a downpayment, meaning there is much more to come. \nThis tax is touted as a way to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But it \nwill unavoidably tax every economic activity, since almost every aspect \nof our daily lives requires energy from fossil fuels.\n  I recall President Obama telling the San Francisco Chronicle that: \n``Under my plan of a cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would \nnecessarily skyrocket.''\n  Mr. President, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator has used 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KYL. Economic historian John Steele Gordon draws a good analogy \nto an energy tax in the April issue of Commentary magazine:\n   ``If passed it will act on the economy as a whole exactly the way a \ngovernor acts on a steam engine, increasingly resisting any increase in \nrevolutions per minute,'' Gordon writes.\n  He continues:\n\n       With the supply of licenses to emit carbon dioxide fixed, \n     the price of the permits will inevitably rise as economic \n     activity picks up. That means that any increase in overall \n     demand will increase the price of energy. . . . That will \n     damp down demand. The more the economy tries to speed up the \n     more [this tax] will work to prevent it from doing so.\n\n  Does this sound like a good idea--especially in time of recession?\n  The budget also lets some of the existing low tax rates expire, thus \nraising taxes, which also hurts our economy.\n  We need to keep in mind that our economy is a complex and dynamic \nforce, made up of individuals and families deciding on how much they \nwant to save, spend and invest and whether to create new jobs or open \nnew businesses.\n  Usually, it resists policymakers' attempts to manipulate and control \nit. It is not a ball of clay that Washington can mold any way it wants \nto and expect never to encounter adverse results. There are negative \nconsequences to what we do.\n  We are obviously straying too far from the principle that the purpose \nof taxes is to pay for the costs of government in a way that does the \nleast damage to the economy. Now we are using tax policy to \nredistribute wealth. How many activities or services can we now think \nof that the Government does not tax or is not aiming to tax?\n  Finally, there is the matter of borrowing too much, the debt and the \ndeficit. In 5 years this budget will double the public debt; in 10 \nyears it will triple the public debt. That is why we can say that just \nthis one budget accumulates more debt than every President of the \nUnited States combined previous to now. The Congressional Budget Office \nprojects that the President's budget\n\n[[Page S4835]]\n\nwill accumulate $9.2 trillion in deficits. That would raise the debt \nheld by the public to an astonishing 82.4 percent of GDP in the year \n2019.\n  My colleague, Senator McCain, told us during the campaign that \nspending and deficits are two sides of the same coin; that President \nObama's spending promises would raise deficits to unsustainable levels \nand that huge tax hikes, and not just for the wealthy, would be \nrequired to pay for it all. Even the President's Office of Management \nand Budget Director Peter Orszag has confirmed what Senator McCain said \nall along: These levels of spending and deficits will not be \nsustainable.\n  Let me quote an editorial comment from the Washington Post recently:\n\n       President Obama's budget plan would have the government \n     spending more than 23 percent of gross domestic product \n     throughout the second half of this decade while collecting \n     less than 19 percent of revenue.\n\n  Is this the legacy we want to leave the next generation, \nunprecedented debt?\n  On this side of the aisle the answer to that question is no. That is \nwhy we are concerned about the effect of the past 100 days on our \ncountry's future.\n  And we can't forget the finance charges. By 2014, the interest on the \nnational debt will be the largest single expenditure in the budget, \nmore than we'll spend on education, on healthcare, on national \nsecurity.\n  This excessive borrowing also increases our dependence on creditors \nin countries such as China and Russia. Other countries now hold more \nthan half of America's total publicly held debt. As Senator Bayh \npointed out in a recent Wall Street Journal column, when other \ncountries hold a large amount of our debt they also have leverage to \ninfluence our currency, trade, and national security policies.\n  All of us share the goal of getting the economy back on track. We \nneed a budget that meets the test of fiscal responsibility. This budget \ndoes not. Moreover, it contradict's the President's campaign promises \nfor a net spending reduction and no tax increases for 95 percent of \nAmericans. The unprecedented amounts of spending, taxing, and borrowing \nare sure to hinder an economic recovery.\n  As President Reagan said: Facts are stubborn things. We have seen \nthroughout our country's history that increasing taxes and introducing \nnew regulation during a recession has never led to economic growth. Why \nwould this time be any different? Right now we should be working on \ngrowing our economy, not growing the Federal Government.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, in the early 1800s, a perceptive young \nFrenchman came to America, Alexis de Tocqueville. He marveled at our \nnew democracy. He wrote a classic book about it. He warned more than \nanything about something he called ``the tyranny of the majority.'' \nThat was his worry about the American democracy.\n  We now have finished 100 days for a popular new President. He has \npresented a blueprint for the country that is dramatically different \nfrom what we had before.\n  Yesterday, a member of our Republican side moved his desk to the \nother side potentially giving that side of the aisle 60 votes and \nraising the prospect that we would have no check and balance on one-\nparty rule, the genuine risk of what de Tocqueville called the tyranny \nof the majority. So the question arises, what is the blueprint for this \npopular new President, and is it the kind of change we really want?\n  All of us can point to something, as the Republican leader did, to \nAfghanistan and Iraq, of which we approve. I could point to the \nSecretary of Education, Arne Duncan and his focus on paying teachers \nmore for teaching well and encouraging charter schools, something I \ngreatly support. But both the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from \nKentucky have pointed out that the blueprint presented by our new \nPresident has too much spending, too much taxing, and too much debt.\n  Especially striking to me is the idea that we would have, in the 10th \nyear of the President's budget proposal, $800 billion in interest to \npay, which is more than we would be spending on defense that year, \neight times as much as the Federal Government would spend on education \nthat year, and eight times as much as it would spend on housing, $800 \nbillion of interest to pay just on the debt.\n  Yet there is another part of this blueprint that worries me, and that \nis too much government. We read that now our Government, through \ntaxpayers, owns half of our largest automobile companies.\n  In an interview I heard the Environmental Protection Agency \nAdministrator say automakers are waiting for the Government to tell \nthem what kind of car they ought to build. Already the President has \nfired the President of our largest auto company and our Government is \ntelling the company who should be on the boards. I suppose it will be \nsaying also what plants should be kept open or closed and what people \nshould be paid. That is quite a bit of government. Or banks, instead of \nasking the Congress at the beginning of January for a $1 trillion line \nof credit so we could get the toxic assets out of banks and get credit \nflowing again, so jobs would come back and housing prices would \nstabilize, this new administration spent $1 trillion, a breathtaking, \nunimaginable amount of money, adding it to the debt. What about the \nbanks? Well, we are going to own the banks or at least be the major \nshareholder in many of the biggest banks in the world. Again, that \nmeans politicians and regulators in Washington will be deciding who \nwill be the bank president, who will be on the boards, who will get the \nloans, perhaps, and for what purposes the loans could be used.\n  Isn't that the kind of thing that got us into trouble in the first \nplace, politicians in Washington telling banks to loan money to people \nwho could not afford to pay it back? This too much government in the \nfirst 100 days is not just the result of the recession in which we find \nourselves. This is not a crowd that believes if you can find it in the \nyellow pages, the Government should not be doing it. This is a \ndeliberate choice of more Government.\n  As in the case of student loans, the first proposal from the \nPresident was that we take the amount of Pell grants and add that to \nthe automatic spending in the budget, adding another $117 billion to \nthe automatic spending over 10 years. This is something that could \nbankrupt our country and it didn't fly. But there is another proposal, \nwhich is still out there. That would take the entire student loan \nprogram and cancel the choices that students have, create a big new \nbank, a half-trillion-dollar bank, and have the Department of Education \nmake all the loans. That is a massive takeover by the Government.\n  Twelve million students today choose to get their loans from private \nlenders. There are 2,000 of those loaning money to students who choose \nto attend Nashville Auto Diesel College or Harvard or Princeton, where \nthe Senator from Missouri was an outstanding student. There are 4,400 \ncampuses that offer this choice. The proposal would be to create a big, \nnew, half-trillion-dollar bank that would take all of that over, that \nwould make $75 billion of loans in a year. It would make the promising \nnew Education Secretary a candidate for banker of the year instead of \nSecretary of the year. It would cause Andrew Jackson, who fought \nagainst the national bank in his day, to roll over in his grave at what \nhis party is doing. It would be Congressmen playing a trick on students \nbecause the end result would be saying: We are going to borrow the \nmoney, the U.S. Department of Education, at one-quarter of 1 percent, \nand we are going to lend it to you at 6.8 percent. Then we will turn \naround and give aid to other people that you students are paying for, \nand we Congressmen will take the credit.\n  I don't think students will like that. It is all in the name of $94 \nbillion in savings, but that is exaggerated because the Government \nalready admits that it will cost $25 or $30 billion at least for the \nGovernment to manage the program, and I can't believe the Government is \na better manager of a bank making 15 million loans a year than banks \nthat are set up to do that.\n  If the subsidy is too high, lower it; don't cancel the program. That \nis the direction in which we are going. This is an administration with \na blueprint for a different kind of American future. But it is not the \nkind of American future that Abraham Lincoln saw for the\n\n[[Page S4836]]\n\nFederal Government. In the first years of President Lincoln's \nadministration, he not only was involved in the Civil War, but he and \nthe Congress passed the Homestead Act and the Land Grant Colleges Act \nand the Transcontinental Railroad Act. They conferred opportunities on \nAmericans everywhere, and then the Americans used their own elbow \ngrease to make things happen.\n  This administration, this 100 days, is a command-and-control type of \nadministration, with regulators and politicians running the banks, \nrunning the auto companies, and nationalizing student loans. It is an \nopportunity to have a new blueprint of a kind we haven't seen before, \nnot one that confers opportunities but a planned America with less \nfreedom, with fewer choices, fewer opportunities, a society planned and \nrun by Washington regulators and politicians that our children and \ngrandchildren cannot afford, not a society that confers opportunities \nand choices for the people.\n  In addition, there is the prospect of no check and balance on one-\nparty rule which risks what the perceptive young Frenchman, Alexis de \nTocqueville, said in the early 1800s was the greatest threat to the new \nAmerican democracy when he warned about the tyranny of the majority.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today marks day 100 on the job for the Obama \nadministration. Many in the media and commentators will be grading the \nPresident on his leadership and policy decisions. As vice chairman of \nthe Senate Intelligence Committee, I am most concerned about what is \nshaping up to be the President's failing strategy in national security \npolicy. Unfortunately, the Obama administration's national security \npolicy appears to be in disarray. While the administration is busy \ntrying to decide who from the previous administration, which kept us \nsafe from attacks since 9/11, they should prosecute for those efforts, \nthey don't understand that as far as the American people are concerned, \nthey are the ones on trial now. The President and his team have to \nanswer how they are going to protect the American people. What are they \nnot going to do? What will they do that will be successful?\n  Don't get me wrong. The President has some high points when it comes \nto national security, and I applaud him for those. On some very \nimportant issues, campaign rhetoric has met national security \nrealities. To date the President has shunned the advice of Code Pink \nand others and stayed the course in Iraq. As several of my colleagues \nhave said, his initial rollout steps of a new strategy for Afghanistan \nand Pakistan are in the right direction, and he has continued strikes \nagainst al-Qaida and other terrorists in the Afghanistan-Pakistan \nregion. President Obama took appropriate measures, I believe, to \nprepare for the North Korean missile launch.\n  Over the last few weeks the Obama administration has faltered. Now we \nare seeing some national security decisions made on what I fear is \npolitics, not on what is in the best interest of the American people.\n  Just look at the recent examples. The President has decided to close \nour terrorist detainee facility with no backup plan. He has decided to \nrelease CIA memos on highly classified terrorist detention programs. \nNow he plans to release photos of alleged detainee abuse.\n  First, let's talk about the President's decision to close our \nterrorist detainee facility with no backup plan. The facility at \nGuantanamo Bay, or Gitmo, doesn't house middle-of-the-road, white-\ncollar criminals. Instead this terrorist detention facility houses \ndeadly combatants who in the past, when released, have gone back on the \nbattlefield to kill Americans. Don't take my word for it. The \nDepartment of Defense has confirmed that at least 18 detainees who were \nreleased from Gitmo have gone back to the fight. The Pentagon suspects \nanother 43 of doing the same.\n  Despite confirmation that Gitmo detainees have gone back to the \nbattlefield to kill Americans, President Obama has decided to close \nGitmo with no plan on what to do with these terrorists.\n  The President also has no plan to deal with new terrorists who are \ncaptured on the battlefield. Where does he plan to detain them? Does he \nplan on telling our troops to release them so they can go on killing \nAmericans? This is one of the scariest of Obama's ``ready, fire, aim'' \nnational security strategy points.\n  I can tell you this: Missourians in my State, and I believe people in \nmost States, will not stand for importing terrorists such as 9/11 \nmastermind Khalid Shaikh Mohammed to their neighborhoods. They surely \ndo not want a bunch of them housed in secure facilities in their \ncommunity because al-Qaida has a nasty tendency to launch massive \nattacks on detention facilities to release their brethren.\n  Like me, Missourians and all Americans are still waiting for Obama to \nmake the case that his decision to release the detainees at Gitmo is in \nour country's national security interest.\n  The President has failed to make the case that the release of these \nterrorist detainees will make us safer. The President has failed to \nmake the case that the release of these terrorist detainees will not \npose a threat to Americans.\n  It is clear that without having a plan to deal with the current and \nnew terrorists currently at Gitmo, President Obama's decision was not \nin our Nation's best interest. Instead, this was a national security \npolicy decided for the purpose of appeasing the ACLU and many in the \nleftwing.\n  Another national security policy decided for the benefit of the \nACLU--and at their request even--was the President's decision to \nrelease memos on the CIA's terrorist interrogation program.\n  While the ACLU was in favor of releasing these memos, President \nObama's own CIA Director and the four previous CIA Directors all \nopposed this foolhardy decision. The decision is a serious blow to our \nterror fighters and, even worse, to their ability to obtain the \nintelligence we need to prevent another 9/11.\n  The release of these memos sends a chilling message to our \nintelligence community: The CIA better change their mission to ``CYA'' \nbecause their Government is not going to stand behind them.\n  No intelligence operator can feel safe that the legal guidance they \nare given or the orders they follow from superiors can be counted on to \nlast beyond a single administration. This means our intelligence \noperators will be worrying about protecting their hides, not their \nnational security mission.\n  Former CIA Director General Hayden and former Attorney General \nMichael Mukasey called President Obama's decision a step in the \nweakening of our intelligence gathering. Regretably, I could not agree \nmore. This politicization and weakening of our intelligence gathering \ncould result in a retreat to the pre-9/11 mentality that led to the \ntragic intelligence failures that ultimately cost the lives of more \nthan 3,000 innocent Americans.\n  In addition to weakening our intelligence gathering, the release of \nthe interrogation program limitations and their operating guidelines \nties the hands of our terror fighters. During his confirmation hearing, \nPresident Obama's own CIA Director purposefully left open the door to \nfuture use of interrogation techniques in an enhanced fashion for the \nhigh-value detainees who are believed to have vital information who \nwill not talk under normal questioning.\n  But now that President Obama has officially given al-Qaida the \nplaybook, he has made any future use of these techniques ineffective. \nHe has also told the terrorists that if they, in the course of trying \nto kill Americans, are captured, they have nothing to fear. They will \nnot be subjected to any more harsh or coercive tactics than we have \nsubjected hundreds of thousands of Americans who have volunteered to be \nmarines, SEALs or pilots.\n  It is hard to imagine that this administration could make this \nsituation even worse, but last week President Obama managed it. After \nhis decision to release the CIA memos, the President went to Langley \nand told employees:\n\n       Don't be discouraged that we have to admit that we've made \n     some mistakes and then move forward.\n\n\n[[Page S4837]]\n\n\n  In these few words, President Obama provided valuable propaganda to \nthe terrorists. He told our enemies that our intelligence operators \nwere wrong in what they did, an admission that will be seized upon by \nour enemies to fuel the hatred of Americans. Is it any surprise that \nthe morale at the CIA has been severely damaged? Our terror fighters \nneed to know whether the President has their back or will stab them in \nthe back.\n  Unfortunately, the President completely disregarded the damage his \ndecision would have on the CIA. He completely disregarded the damage \nhis decision would have on our ability to get the intelligence we need \nto stop terrorist attacks. He completely disregarded the ammo his \ndecision would give the terrorists bent on our destruction. Instead of \nthese critical national security concerns, the President's decision was \na political one aimed at appeasing the far leftwing.\n  The President even tried to claim that the ACLU's Freedom of \nInformation Act request made the release of these memos necessary. But \nthe first exemption under the law is for ``classified secret matters or \nnational defense or foreign policy.'' The memos on the CIA terrorist \ninterrogation program certainly meet those definitions. At the very \nleast, President Obama should have made that argument in court. \nInstead, he handed over a victory--not for national security but for \nthe ACLU.\n  While many in the media are getting mired in the details of each of \nthese bad decisions, the bigger question is this: What is this \nadministration's strategy for confronting the terrorist threat and \nkeeping America safe? The world did not suddenly become safer when \nPresident Obama was elected.\n  Instead of telling Americans the strategy to keep our Nation safe, \nthe latest Obama administration move has been staging costly glamour \nshots of Air Force One. I am not sure if everybody has heard about this \nstunt, but earlier this week the White House decided to update their \nphotos of Air Force One--only they chose to take the photos of the jet \nat the Statue of Liberty with a fighter jet escort.\n  Across downtown Manhattan--where the Twin Towers once stood--New \nYorkers were panicking. Thousands fled New York skyscrapers. You see, \nNew Yorkers were not told this glamour shot was going to happen. After \nliving through the horrors of the September 11 attacks, New Yorkers, of \ncourse, feared that another attack was happening. And 9/11 was fresh in \ntheir memories.\n  While the Obama administration tried to shrug off this incident, I \nthink it is telling. This stunt is a symbol of how far from their minds \nthe attacks of 9/11 are.\n  In addition to the administration's glamour shot stunt, President \nObama's advisers have been busy releasing classified information that \nonly tells the side of the story they want to share. I think everyone \nknows this, but let me lay out the details.\n  First, the Director of National Intelligence, Admiral Blair, in a \nletter to the intelligence community, said the interrogations provided \n``high value information'' and gave the U.S. Government a ``deeper \nunderstanding of the al Qaeda organization that was attacking this \ncountry.'' Blair also detailed how Congress was repeatedly briefed on \nthe program. But in the public statement which had to go through White \nHouse clearance, these details were left out.\n  Next: The White House releases the memos that describe in detail the \ninterrogation techniques that were used. But missing--in fact, I assume \npurposefully redacted--is the information on the lifesaving \nintelligence we received from these interrogations.\n  Also, President Obama--and many Democrats in Congress--supported the \nrelease of the CIA memos but are now opposing the release of \ninformation on what Members of Congress were briefed on the program.\n  Now, let me get this straight. So the facts about our interrogation \nprogram of terrorists--how we do it, and the strict limits on it to \navoid torture--are fair game for release, but who and what Congress was \ntold needs to remain secret?\n  I think the President's advisers got it wrong. You see, it is not \nsupposed to be cherry-picking time in Washington today. Unfortunately, \nthe Obama administration is not above politicizing intelligence.\n  Message to the administration: Get a new calendar. The election is \nover. With victory comes responsibility. It is now up to the Obama \nadministration to keep our Nation safe. You are in charge of protecting \nthe American people and stopping terror attacks--I pray with the same \nsuccess the previous administration did every day since 9/11.\n  While President Obama failed the national security test at the 100th \nday mark, the final grade is not in yet. It is up to the President to \nchoose our terror fighters over terrorists, to choose troops over ACLU \nlawyers, to choose national security over politics.\n  Protecting our families from terrorist attacks should not be a \npolitical issue, it is an American one.\n  Mr. President, I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore.

Mr. President, today we celebrate the first 100 days of \nour new President's administration. It has been somewhat less remarked \nupon, but this week also happens to mark my first 100 days in office.\n  Together, we have done important work in these 100 days. We have \ntaken decisive action to get our economy moving again. We have provided \nbetter access to health care for our children. We have made the \nworkplace fairer for women.\n  For me, these 100 days have provided a remarkable opportunity to \nlisten to Coloradans. In dozens of townhall meetings, in each and every \ncorner of the State, in cities and small towns, in good weather and \nbad, I have listened to thousands of Coloradans--young and old, \nRepublicans, Democrats, and Independents, teachers, nurses, farmers, \nworkers, ranchers, and small business owners, people from all walks of \nlife with every conceivable point of view.\n  I have been struck by how much--despite the trials we face at this \nmoment in our history and despite whatever disagreements we might \nhave--more than anything the people of Colorado long to build a better \nfuture for the next generation.\n  America has always embraced the promise of a better life for our \nchildren.\n  My family's story is no different. After their lives were shattered \nby World War II, my grandparents set their sights on Franklin \nRoosevelt's America as the one place they could rebuild their lives. \nAnd it was.\n  My mother had even more opportunities than my grandparents dreamed, \nand she and my father were able to create a better life for me, my \nbrother, and my sister. Since our founding, generation after \ngeneration, we have worked to form a more perfect union, always \nfulfilling the promise of a better life for those who come after us.\n  Yet now that promise is in question.\n  I am here today as the father of three young daughters of my own--\nCaroline, Halina, and Anne. I think of them and worry that we are at \nrisk of being the first generation of Americans to have less \nopportunity than we ourselves were given.\n  Our economy is in turmoil; 5.1 million Americans have lost their jobs \nsince the beginning of this crisis, and our unemployment rate is at 8.5 \npercent and rising. Between 2000 and 2007, median family income in this \ncountry actually declined by over $300. At the same time, the cost of \nhealth care rose by nearly 80 percent and the cost of higher education \nby roughly 60 percent.\n  The gulf between rich and poor has gotten wider. Americans are now \nless likely than people living in a number of other industrialized \ncountries to improve their economic status in their lifetime. As many \nas 100 million Americans now live in families earning less in real \nterms than their parents did at the same age.\n\n[[Page S4838]]\n\n  This crisis stemmed from much more than foreclosed houses and credit \nswaps. It is a symptom of this generation's lack of attention to the \nlegacy of our grandparents who built for the future. Now we must ask \nourselves who we will be as a country when we emerge from this crisis. \nWill we answer the call of this time or will we fall back on the same \ntired arguments of the past?\n  This time demands that we cast our eyes to the future, that we take a \n21st century approach to meet our 21st century challenges and seize our \n21st century opportunities. With President Obama's leadership and our \nresilient American spirit, we can emerge from this crisis stronger and \ntruer to our creed than when we entered it.\n  Each generation of Americans with hope for their children has \ncourageously shed old ways of thinking and, on their behalf, reached \nout to new ideas. We are no different. We, too, must be willing to \nabandon our commitments to the weary forms of the past and attend to \nthe future. That is our cause.\n  We have to address critical structural issues stifling our economy \nand threatening our children's opportunities. We need to pursue \ncomprehensive financial reform that will prevent the kind of \nrecklessness that got us into this mess. We have a rising deficit, and \nwe must bring discipline to our budgets, even as we invest in the \nfuture. We have a unique opportunity this year to drastically reform \nour health care system and control its skyrocketing costs, and we must \nseize it. It is time to invest in the new energy economy and break our \ndependence on foreign oil.\n\n  If we are going to emerge from this economic crisis and succeed in \nthe long run, we must fundamentally change public education in this \ncountry. Throughout our history, public schools have allowed America to \nmake good on her promise to the next generation. Our schools propelled \nour children toward their parents' aspirations and prepared them to \nrise to the challenges of their times.\n  If we are honest with ourselves, we see that our public schools too \noften become traps--traps that perpetuate a cycle of poverty and foster \nmediocrity. Our children--my girls and millions of others like them--\nare attending schools that were built to prepare their grandparents for \nan economy that no longer exists. Our public education system, as \ndesigned, does not work well enough for all children in this country, \nand for our poorest children barely works at all.\n  Across America, 1.2 million children drop out of high school each \nyear. Globally, we rank 20th among industrialized nations for high \nschool graduation rates. Forty years ago we were first. Seventy percent \nof our country's eighth graders can't read at grade level. On average, \na 9-year-old from a low-income family is already 3 years behind their \nhigh income peers, has a 1-in-2 chance of graduating from high school, \nand a 1-in-10 chance of finishing college. Despite many efforts to \nclose our stubborn achievement gap, a report released yesterday shows \nwe have made almost no progress. How can we as Americans accept this \nreality, especially when none of us here would accept these odds for \nour own children? These are our children too.\n  There are teachers throughout the country who have rejected the \ndefeatism that too many of us have accepted for our schools. They have \ncome in early and stayed late. They have visited their students' houses \nand bought school supplies out of their own pockets. They have expected \nmore from their students than their students knew to expect from \nthemselves. Yet too many of us have accepted the existing odds, \nconsidering them a natural consequence of poverty. At the same time, we \nhave entered into tiresome debates--debates that take ideology \nseriously and the fates of our children lightly.\n  Children's futures have been wasted while adults have endlessly \ndebated techniques for assessing failing schools instead of changing or \nclosing schools that are obviously failing on every dimension that can \nbe assessed. We have debated modest and incremental reforms instead of \ndoing the hard work of identifying successful school structures and \nhuman capital strategies and taking them to scale. We have been stuck \ndebating whether teachers should be paid more based on merit, while \nroughly half of our teachers quit in the first 5 years of their career. \nA narrow, small politics has allowed us to duck ever making real \nchoices about anything, and it has, failure after failure, shriveled \nour shared ambition for America's children. As long as we have these \nsame conversations, today's 9-year-olds will see their younger brothers \nand sisters enter fourth grade with the same low odds of graduating \nfrom college they have, just as they saw their older brothers and \nsisters face the same odds, generation after generation.\n  When I took over as the superintendent for Denver public schools, in \na school district of 75,000 children, only 33 African-American students \nand 61 Latino students--fewer than four classrooms worth of kids--\nscored proficient on the State's tenth grade math test, a test that \nmeasures a junior high school standard of proficiency in Europe. \nSpending time with our students and their families in Denver, I was \nstruck not by their fragility but by their resilience. Their parents--\nlike many before them--had made tremendous sacrifices to provide their \nchildren with greater opportunity. The students I knew were willing to \nwork harder and stay in school longer. We were selling them short.\n  I joined the Denver public schools with kind of an abstract \nunderstanding that what was happening in our schools was unfair. My \nexperience there left me with a profound sense of urgency to change \nwhat is unfair and fundamentally unjust.\n  We can do better, and we will do better. In Denver we have made \nprogress. From 2005 to 2008, Denver students scored higher in reading, \nmath, writing, and science. We did not get there by doing things the \nsame way as they had been done before. We closed failing schools and \nopened new ones. We implemented a groundbreaking teacher pay system \nthat rewards teachers who improve their students' performance and \nprovides incentives for teachers to go to the neediest schools. We \naccomplished this change by working with the union. It took a lot of \neffort. We had a lot of disagreements, but we made progress together \nbecause of a fundamental commitment by all of us to get the job done, \nnot just score political points.\n  With the leadership of our mayor and our city council, voters \nexpanded our early childhood education. As a result, this year there \nare 1,500 more 4-year-olds in full day programs, a 300-percent \nincrease. We increased full-day kindergarten by 25 percent, so that for \nthe first time more than 95 percent of our 5-year-olds have the benefit \nof a full day of school. Research tells us there is no smarter \ninvestment we can make.\n  In 2008, we launched a school performance framework that measures the \nprogress of actual students year over year throughout their career, \nrather than meaningless measurement of one year's class against the \nnext year's class.\n  We still have work to do in Denver. There is still a long way to go \nbefore these reforms materially change the odds for our students, but \nwe are moving in the right direction. In other districts we will see \nsimilar success if we support reform efforts that work.\n  Our job in the Senate should be to help the administration spur \ninnovation and identify and expand what works. I look forward to \nworking with our Education Secretary, Arne Duncan, my colleagues here--\nand I notice our former Education Secretary, the Senator from \nTennessee, is here today, and I am glad that he is here--my colleagues \nhere, as well as parents, teachers, students, and community members in \nColorado to support innovative solutions to the problems plaguing our \nschools.\n  Our commitment to our children and grandchildren requires that we \nhold ourselves to a higher standard than we have in the past. This is \nnot a time to spend new money on old programs or to timidly attempt \nchanges that have already failed too many of our children. Now is the \ntime to reimagine our schools as magnets for talent, centers for \ncommunities, and incubators of innovation. Only then can we ensure that \nour students are getting the 21st century skills that will equip them \nfor the new economy.\n  We must do the same for our teachers. As President Obama said \nyesterday:\n\n\n[[Page S4839]]\n\n\n       In a global economy where the greatest job qualification \n     isn't what you can do but what you know, our teachers are the \n     key to our Nation's success; to whether America will lead the \n     world in the discoveries and the innovations and economic \n     prosperity of this new century.\n\n  Study after study has shown that nothing makes a greater difference \nto student learning than great teaching. We need to support effective \nteachers and make sure they stay in the classroom. That means creating \nschool environments where teachers and students want to spend time, and \nit means restructuring our schools and our school calendar so that \nteachers have time to plan together and learn from each other. Also, we \nneed to pay teachers in ways that reward their success and provide \nincentives for them to stay in the profession. More fundamentally, we \nneed to recognize that our system of hiring, compensation, and training \ndesigned deep in the last century, is utterly inadequate for 21st \ncentury labor market realities. In 1960, a gallon of gas cost 30 cents. \nElvis and the Everly Brothers were at the top of the charts. A first-\nyear lawyer earned about the same as a first-year teacher, and women \nhad basically two professional choices: becoming a nurse or going into \nthe classroom. In 2009, as nation after nation moves past us in \neducational achievement, we are kidding ourselves if we think a teacher \nrecruitment and retention plan that came in when the Hula Hoop went \nout--and effectively subsidized our schools by limiting women's \nopportunities--is a serious response to America's needs.\n\n  We must invest in proven training that equips teachers with the \ncontent, knowledge, and classroom management skills to be successful in \nhelping their students, and we need to ensure that we provide ongoing, \nhigh-quality professional development that actually helps them do a \nbetter job in the classroom; otherwise, we risk losing our best \nteachers.\n  We need to expand alternative pipelines for teachers, to enhance the \ntraditional pathways we already have. President Obama has called on the \nNation to create a new army of teachers. We must recruit a diverse, \nexcellent, and committed group of Americans to teach our children. The \ntalent is all around us--in the veterans returning from Iraq and \nAfghanistan, the baby boomers who have spent their careers running \nsuccessful businesses or working in manufacturing or medicine or law, \nand the college graduates looking to find a rewarding vocation--all of \nwhom can inspire and challenge our students to become the engineers who \nwill build green cities, the doctors who will cure cancer, and the \nentrepreneurs who will start businesses we can't yet even imagine. As \nwe open the profession to allow talented and committed people to become \nteachers, we must have rigorous selection for every spot in front of a \nclass, and replicate effective training for new teachers.\n  As we work with States and districts to redesign our schools for the \n21st century, we should do so in conversation with business and labor \nto inform our efforts about what skills the market will require. \nCompetitive workers must be problem solvers, not just test takers. They \nmust be able to think critically and communicate effectively in \nmultiple mediums. Students won't need to write cursive; they will need \nto know how to use technology to solve tough problems. They don't need \nonly to memorize facts; they need to understand how to filter and use \nthe information at their fingertips.\n  We need updated standards that reflect these 21st century skills. We \nshould invite States to embrace voluntary national standards, \nbenchmarked against international norms that allow the public to see \nthe progress students are actually making from year to year. We need an \naccurate measuring system so that we know when reforms are working and \nwhen students are achieving. We need to ensure that the tests we give \nkids ask them to deploy the knowledge and skills they have, rather than \ndemonstrate their ability to take a test. And we must ensure that when \nwe do give students tests, teachers get the results in time to use them \nto drive their instruction.\n  But our tests shouldn't be the sole driver of our instruction. We \nshould look beyond the narrow window of standardized test scores, to \nparent and community engagement and student retention rates. We should \nexpand learning opportunities to start earlier, be broader in scope, \nand beckon everyone in the community.\n  Our schools should become centers where communities gather for skills \nand services. Schools are uniquely positioned to deliver health and \nsupport services. Research shows a statistical link between nutrition \nand achievement for all students. We need to look at nutrition in \nschools not as something extra but as central to student success.\n  Our schools should be on the cutting edge of using new technology for \nboth teaching and learning. Technology can connect students to \nresources and teachers to each other. Effective use of technology can \nallow a teacher in a rural area to get feedback from a mentor \nelsewhere. We should be using technology to disseminate effective \npractices and share great lesson plans. We can look to technology to \nhelp train teachers in new ways by simulating classroom experiences and \ndelivering real-time feedback on lesson plans.\n  There is something wrong when students who enter the schoolhouse find \nthey are moving backwards in time, leaving behind all the technology \nthat in the rest of their day expands and enriches their lives.\n  While we know we can't fix our schools by spending more money on the \nsame inadequate programs, we must commit to funding what works in our \nschools. We now have the largest investment in public education in \nhistory with which to do it. The stimulus package and the budget are \nworking in tandem to increase access to early childhood education. \nStates and districts are competing with one another to build on their \nefforts to revamp standards and turn around failing schools. There are \nadditional resources to reduce high school dropout rates and increase \ncollege graduation rates.\n  If we continue to spark this kind of innovation, if we can allow \nourselves to think big again about education, we can start to imagine \nschool buildings as prototypes for energy efficiency and classrooms as \njob training centers for the new energy economy--preparing parents and \nstudents alike. School-based health care can advance from one nurse \nstretched between multiple schools to clinics that are leaders in \nefficient health care. School lunches can progress from packaged \nfeedings in the cafeteria to live lessons on nutrition and wellness. In \nsum, our schools can become what they should be: the institutions that \nare preparing our children and their children to lead in the 21st \ncentury.\n  Our cause is clear. It is time for policies that serve not the \nideologies of adults but the needs of kids. I will be working in the \ncoming months to develop legislation that will outline ways in which \nthe Federal Government can better support our States and school \ndistricts in providing a public education that meets the challenges and \npossibilities of our times.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle, as well as with parents, teachers, students, and community \nleaders across Colorado to ensure that we do our part to increase \nopportunity for our children. We will know we have succeeded when we \nsee not only more students graduating high school but more of those \ngraduates going on to complete college as well. We will not only see \nthe achievement gap shrink, but we will see the United States once \nagain lead the world in academic achievement.\n  We are lucky. In our time, history is once again beginning to run in \nthe direction of change. We have the chance to honor our grandparents' \nexample and move forward together to create a better future for our \nchildren. If we do, those children and their children will say we rose \nto the moment, that we laid down our adult burdens and our differences \nto lift up our country and our children instead. Let them say that a \nspark flew in America in this new century that ignited a generation of \neducators, children, parents, and communities and gave them courage to \nabandon the status quo for a better future. Let our schools once again \nbe the cradle of the American dream and act to fulfill the solemn \npromise of one generation to the next.\n  Thank you, Mr. President.

Mr. President, I congratulate the Senator from \nColorado on what we call in the Senate his maiden address. I also had \nthe privilege of hearing Senator Udall's speech when he made his on \nrenewable energy. I was glad to hear these today.\n  The Senator from Colorado has focused on a subject he has worked on \nhard and which is central to every part of our ability to improve our \nschools. It is one recognized by our new Education Secretary who, I \nthink, is President Obama's best new appointee. It is the question of \nhow do we reward outstanding teaching.\n  Every time we deal with education, we are ultimately reminded that it \nboils down to the parent and the teacher. What the parent cannot do, \nthe teacher has to step in and finish. In so many cases, whether it is \na gifted child or a child who hasn't been read to at home or a child \nwith disabilities or a child who needs a music lesson, it takes a \ngifted teacher to do the best job to help the child reach his or her \npotential.\n  We are still, as the Senator said, 50 or 60 or 70 years behind in \nrecognizing that our country has changed and that women have many \nopportunities outside the home. We cannot trap them into teaching. We \nneed to attract them and keep them, as well as outstanding men.\n  Senator Bennet has been successful in his work in Denver and in \nfinding ways to initiate that. The Secretary wants to do that. I worked \non that in Tennessee. I have said to the Secretary of Education if he \nleaves after 4 or 8 years having left a legacy of many different ways \nof improving ways to reward outstanding teaching, he will have done \nmore than all of the other secretaries of education put together.\n  As Albert Shanker once said, ``If we can have master plumbers, we can \nhave master teachers.''\n  Again, I congratulate the Senator from Colorado for his focus on \neducation in his maiden address. I was happy and privileged to be on \nthe Senate floor to hear that.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Colorado is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. BENNET. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Tennessee, and I \nacknowledge his great work as Secretary of Education. This is one of \nthose issues on which I think Republicans and Democrats have a lot of \nwork they can do together. There isn't one solution. This is a time \nwhen we are long overdue, and we have been short on answers. I think \nthe Education Secretary is perfectly positioned to carry on the work \nthat needs to be done. I look forward to working with the Senator, and \nI appreciate him enduring my speech.\n  I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that \nthe order for the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. UDALL of New Mexico. Mr. President, I also had the opportunity to \nbe here presiding in the chair to hear the Senator from Colorado in his \nmaiden speech. I want to congratulate him and tell him he has done an \nexcellent job in the Senate, as I have observed him over the last 100 \ndays.\n  I think Senator Bennet has hit on an issue that is important to all \nof us. If we are going to move forward as a nation, we are going to \nhave to do it by focusing on education. It is heartening to see that we \nhave a President, President Barack Obama, who cares about education \nwith the same passion, I believe, the Senator from Colorado has.\n  One of the things the Senator from Colorado noted is that we have to \nfocus on teachers. He talked about a comprehensive approach, an \napproach to education that is going to move us forward in the 21st \ncentury. Teachers have to be a big part of it. Parents have to be a big \npart of it. As the Senator from Colorado noted, based on his work in \nDenver and in chairing the Denver education effort, if parents aren't \ninvolved, we are not going to be able to move forward.\n  In addition, one of the big things Senator Bennet knows is, this No \nChild Left Behind law needs to be revamped. It is not doing right by \nour children. We have to take a look at that piece of legislation with \nthe ideas that he mentioned and make sure we put into place a piece of \nlegislation and a reauthorization that is going to empower our teachers \nand our parents and move us forward on the education front.\n  Again, I just wanted to congratulate Senator Bennet. It was a great \nstart with that maiden speech. I thought the exchange the Senator had \nwith Senator Alexander was a good one. It shows that we can work \ntogether.\n  Senator Bennet from Colorado has shown a bipartisanship in his first \n100 days. I very much want to congratulate him and tell him I have \nenjoyed serving with him and look forward to serving with him for a \nvery long time.\n  I yield the floor and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD.

Under the previous order, the Senate will \nbegin debate on the conference report to accompany S. Res. 13.\n  The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I also want to recognize the excellent \nfirst speech that the Senator from Colorado just gave. I had a chance \nto hear part of it on the Senate floor and part of it in the cloakroom. \nWe welcome him. If his first speech is any measure, he is going to make \na significant contribution. So we are delighted to have somebody of his \nthoughtfulness and quality as part of this body.\n  Mr. President, the Senate now begins consideration of the conference \nagreement on the budget for 2010. I think we have to see this budget in \nits context. We have to understand what this administration has \ninherited from the previous administration. To be clear, it is a \ncolossal mess--the worst recession since the Great Depression, a \ndoubling of debt under the previous administration, and a more than \ntripling of foreign holdings of U.S. debt.\n  I try to suppress partisanship in my discussions on the Senate floor, \nbut it is impossible to overlook the record of the previous \nadministration. They have slammed this economy into the ditch. \nPresident Obama is put in the position of the cleanup crew. It is not \npretty or easy, and it is going to be a difficult challenge for this \ncountry to come out of a policy stew that is impossible to choke down.\n  Let me be clear in my own view of how we got here. I believe we had \nan overly loose monetary policy under the control of the Federal \nReserve ever since 9/11, an overly loose fiscal policy under the \ncontrol of the White House and the Congress, record deficits, a massive \nbuildup of debt--when the economy was relatively strong and right \nbefore the baby boom generation started to retire. That is remarkable.\n  If you look back into history, it is rare to have at the same time an \noverly loose monetary policy, low interest rates, Congress and the \nWhite House\n\n[[Page S4841]]\n\nrunning an overly loose fiscal policy with record deficits, even at a \ntime of relative economic strength; on top of that, a \ndysfunctional trade policy with record trade deficits, which meant we \nwere shipping hundreds of billions of dollars to other countries to buy \ntheir goods, over and above what we were producing, and a deregulatory \nenvironment administratively and in terms of the laws of this country \nthat allowed things like the AIG derivative fiasco to develop \ncompletely without oversight.\n\n  Those elements created the seedbed for bubbles to form. So we didn't \njust get a housing bubble, we got a commodity bubble--wheat prices went \nto nearly $20 a bushel; we got an energy bubble, with oil prices up to \n$145 a barrel. So if one looks at this historically, we see the \nformation of these bubbles, and bubbles ultimately burst and create \nenormous economic wreckage. That is what has occurred here.\n  All of this was under the direction, fundamentally, of the Bush \nadministration. This was their policy that was pursued for 8 years. Our \nfriends on the other side controlled the House and Senate for 6 of \nthose 8 years. They put into place the policies that have been the \nguiding principles of policy for this country for the last 8 years.\n  As a result, we saw a very dramatic deterioration in the budget \npicture under the Bush administration. They went from inheriting \nsurpluses to putting us into record deficits. For 2009, there is a \ndeficit of $1.7 trillion. In fairness to them, they are not responsible \nfor that whole amount because part of it is the stimulus package that \nwas enacted.\n  Clearly, they are responsible for at least $1.3 trillion of the $1.7 \ntrillion of deficit in 2009. This is the record on deficit and of debt \nby the previous administration. After their first year in office, the \ndebt was $5.8 trillion. We typically do not hold administrations \nresponsible for their first year because they are working off the plan \nof the previous administration. If you look at the 8 years they are \nresponsible for, the debt went from $5.8 trillion to over $12 trillion.\n  Mr. President, that is not the only part of this that is important to \nkeep in mind. It took 42 Presidents 224 years to build up $1 trillion \nof foreign debt held by foreign entities. The previous administration \ntripled that. They ran up another $2.5 trillion of U.S. debt held \nabroad. Some say it is a sign of strength that people are willing to \nlend us all this money. I personally don't think it is a sign of \nstrength. I think it is a sign of vulnerability that we are running \nrecord trade deficits, meaning record borrowing, much of that borrowing \ndone abroad.\n  Last year, of the debt we had to finance, 68 percent of it was \nfinanced by foreign entities.\n  Mr. President, this President walked into a truly astounding set of \ncircumstances. Here is what they are: Record deficits, doubling of the \nnational debt under the previous administration, the worst recession \nsince the Great Depression, and financial market and housing crises. \nEverywhere you look, this President inherited a crisis--in housing, in \nthe financial sector, and in the fiscal sector. Also, 3.7 million jobs \nhave been lost in the last 6 months, and we have ongoing wars in Iraq \nand Afghanistan.\n  So what do we do about it? The budget is a document that outlines the \nfundamental priorities of the country.\n  In this conference agreement, we have attempted to preserve the \nPresident's priorities of reducing our dependence on foreign energy--\ncritically important to our economic future--a focus on excellence in \neducation, and fundamental health care reform.\n  If we look ahead to the fiscal future of America, no single thing is \nmore important than reforming the health care system. Already, we are \nspending nearly 18 percent of our gross domestic product on health \ncare. That is $1 of every $6 in this economy going to health care. We \nare on a trajectory to have 37 percent of our gross domestic product \ngoing to health care. That would be more than $1 in every $3 in our \neconomy going to health care. Clearly, that is unsustainable. At the \ncurrent rate of nearly 18 percent of our GDP going to health care, we \nare spending twice as much as any other industrialized country.\n  We are on an unsustainable course, and the President says we have to \nalter that, we have to expand health care coverage so that everybody is \nincluded so we can then institute the kind of cost controls that will \nbe necessary. I know it is counterintuitive to think: How can it be \nthat we are going to reduce costs if we are expanding coverage? The \nthing we know in our current system is that people without coverage \nstill get health care, but they are getting it in the most expensive \nsetting: they are getting it in the emergency rooms of our hospitals \nall across the country. We would be much better off having them have \ncoverage and having them in a system that is a wellness system, one \nthat is designed to keep people from getting ill and, if they become \nill, managing their illness in a way that prevents the most costly of \noutcomes.\n  This conference report also provides $764 billion in tax cuts focused \non the middle class. I know there has been a lot of talk in the press \nabout some tax increases, and indeed there are. For those of us who are \nfortunate enough to make more than a quarter of a million dollars a \nyear, we will be expected to pay somewhat more--not a lot more but a \nlittle bit more. If we are going to get our fiscal house in order, \nthose of us who are most fortunate are going to have to pay a little \nbit more. But on a net basis, when you add in the tax increases asked \nfor from those who are the most fortunate, with all of the other tax \nchanges, the overall effect is to reduce taxes from current law by $764 \nbillion over the next 5 years, and those tax reductions are focused on \nthe middle class.\n  We also cut the deficit in half by 2012 and by two-thirds by 2014. We \nget it down to 3 percent of gross domestic product by 2014. Most of the \neconomists say that is the key metric because at 3 percent of GDP, \ngrowth of the debt relative to our national income is stabilized. We \nkeep the debt from growing the way it has been.\n  The discretionary spending level in this conference report is $10 \nbillion below the President's proposal. We have cut his spending plan \nby $10 billion. In addition, there are reconciliation instructions for \nhealth care and education. They require at least $2 billion in deficit \nreduction.\n  I personally believe reconciliation, which is a special process here, \na fast-track process, will not be used for health care because as \npeople get into it, I think they will find it is a very difficult way \nto write major, substantive legislation. My own prediction is that \nreconciliation will not be used for health care. The committees of \njurisdiction have until October 15 to report legislation in the regular \norder of business using the regular procedure. I have talked with the \nchairman of the committee that has most of the responsibility for \nhealth care, and, of course, that is the Finance Committee. Senator \nBaucus says it is his full intention to proceed under the regular \norder, not using the reconciliation instruction. But it is there as an \ninsurance policy.\n  We also have the alternative minimum tax fix for 3 years, so we will \nnot see a big increase in the number of people affected by the \nalternative minimum tax. There are some 3 million or 4 million people \nnow paying. If we did not take these steps, 24 million people would be \nexpected to pay the alternative minimum tax. Nobody wants to see that \nhappen. So we have a fix for the next 3 years.\n  We also have disaster relief for the next 2 years. We call it a \nplaceholder because it is an estimate of what disaster relief will cost \nfor the next 2 years based on looking back over the last 5 years and \ndoing an average.\n  This is a break from how we have typically dealt with disaster \nfunding. Typically, we have done it through emergency designations. The \nPresident thought: Look, we know we are going to have disasters. Why \ndon't we budget for them? It is a worthy experiment, and we will see \nhow it works.\n  Even though none of us can predict what disasters might occur, we \nknow the strong likelihood is that there will be disasters. Certainly, \nmy state has experienced them. We have had flooding all across the \nState of North Dakota from one end to the other. I have been home three \ntimes in the last several weeks going from town to town all across \nNorth Dakota, from the Red River Valley in the east, to the Souris \nValley in the central part of the state, the James, the Cheyenne--all \nof them,\n\n[[Page S4842]]\n\nare experiencing flooding that is unlike anything we have ever seen in \nrecorded history.\n  We know there are disasters. There are going to be costs. In my \nstate, hundreds of millions of dollars have already been experienced in \nterms of losses, roads, bridges devastated. We have even had dams \nsignificantly eroded by these weather events. We know there are costs \nassociated with it, and we have tried to anticipate them in this \nbudget.\n  Most important, this budget coming from the conference committee \nfocuses on three key priorities: reducing our dependence on foreign \nenergy, putting a focus on excellence in education, and fundamental \nhealth care reform.\n  First, with respect to energy, it reduces our dependence on foreign \nenergy, creates green jobs, helps protect the environment, and helps \nwith high home energy costs. It does that in three ways. One, it \ncreates a reserve fund to accommodate legislation to invest in clean \nenergy and address global climate change. Second, it provides $500 \nmillion above the President's level of discretionary funding for energy \nfor fiscal year 2010. Third, it builds on the economic recovery package \ninvestments in renewable energy, efficiency and conservation, low \ncarbon coal technology, and modernizing the electric grid.\n  By the way, modernizing the electric grid presents this country with \nan amazing opportunity to have a leap forward because we are really \ndealing almost in the horse-and-buggy era with the grid that we have \nthat is not permitting us to shift power from places we can produce \nit--clean, green power--to places that need it.\n  In addition, we have in this budget coming back from the conference a \nfocus on excellence in education. We generate economic growth and jobs. \nWe prepare the workforce to compete in this global economy. We make \ncollege more affordable. We attempt to improve student achievement, \nwhich is at the heart of what education is all about. We do it again in \nthree ways: by providing a higher education reserve fund to facilitate \nthe President's student aid increases; we provide for education tax \ncuts to make it more affordable for our young people to go to college \nand other institutions of higher learning; and we provide the \nPresident's requested level of $5,550 for Pell grants and fully fund \nhis education priorities, such as early childhood education.\n  The third key priority is fundamental health care reform, and that is \naccommodated in the conference report. We attempt to bend the health \ncare cost curve to get costs under control, to improve health care \noutcomes for our nation's people, to expand coverage because we have \nmore than 40 million people now without any health care insurance. We \nincrease research, especially devoted to those areas of highest \nopportunity to make meaningful progress, and we promote food and drug \nsafety. Again, we do that in three ways with a reserve fund to \naccommodate the President's initiative to reform the health care \nsystem; by funding for at least 2 years a reserve fund that further \naddresses Medicare physician payments; and continues investment in key \nhealth care programs, such as the NIH and the FDA.\n  I want to at this moment indicate that one of the key staff persons \non our Budget Committee is himself in the hospital. Joel Friedman, who \nis the deputy staff director for the Budget Committee, a remarkable \nperson, truly gifted, somebody who has the respect of people on both \nsides of the aisle, is in the hospital. Our thoughts and prayers are \nwith Joel and his family. I don't know if he is able to watch this. \nLast week, he was not able to because he did not have C-SPAN in his \nroom. But I want him and his family to know that the entire Budget \nCommittee family--and that goes for Republicans and Democrats--is \nthinking of him and hoping for his swift recovery.\n\n  While we have focused on these key priorities of the President--\nexcellence in education, reducing our dependence on foreign energy, \nhealth care reform--we are doing it all in the context of dramatically \nreducing the deficit. In fact, we cut the deficit by two-thirds by \n2014. As measured by the gross domestic product, which economists say \nis the best measure, we do even better than that, as measured by share \nof the gross domestic product, we are reducing the deficit by 75 \npercent, by three-quarters, from 12 percent of GDP in this year to 3 \npercent of GDP in 2014.\n  Again, that metric of 3 percent of GDP in 2014 is especially \nimportant because economists tell us that at that rate, we have about \nstabilized the growth of the debt. In other words, the debt will not \ncontinue to grow faster than our national income if we can continue \ndeficits of 3 percent of GDP. My own view is we should do even better \nthan that. Certainly, in the second 5 years, I think it is incredibly \nimportant that we do better than that given the fact the baby boom \ngeneration will be retiring.\n  In terms of the revenue changes in the budget resolution, I indicated \nearlier that if you look at total tax changes in the budget \nresolution--and this is CBO scoring, this is not my invention--the \ntaxes are cut by $764 billion over the 5 years, and here is where: \nmiddle-class tax relief, $512 billion. That includes the 10-percent \nbracket, the marriage penalty relief, the child tax credit, education \nincentives, and all of the other 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that affect \nthose earning less than $250,000 a year. All of those tax cuts are \nextended for the entire 5 years.\n  In addition, we have provided for alternative minimum tax relief for \n3 years at a cost of $214 billion. We have provided for estate tax \nreform at a cost of $72 billion that will permit couples to avoid any \nestate tax if they have estates of $7 million or less. Let me say that \nexcludes 99.8 percent of estates. Mr. President, 99.8 percent of \nestates will pay nothing--zero--under the budget proposal.\n  In addition, we provide $63 billion for the so-called tax extenders. \nTax extenders are items such as the research and development tax \ncredit. Those have to be extended every year or every other year, \ndepending on which one we are talking about, and we provide for those \nas well.\n  Those tax cuts that amount to $861 billion are offset by loophole \nclosers of $97 billion. And what we are focused on here is the offshore \ntax havens; the abusive tax shelters.\n\n  We now know, from the Permanent Committee on Investigations, that we \nare losing over $100 billion a year to these offshore tax havens; \nbillions of dollars more to abusive tax shelters. I have shown on the \nfloor of the Senate many times pictures of European sewer systems, and \npeople have asked me: What has that got to do with the budget of the \nUnited States? Well, it turns out it increasingly has something to do \nwith the budget of the United States because we have the spectacle of \nwealthy investors here and companies here buying European sewer \nsystems--not because they are in the sewer business but because they \nwant to depreciate those assets on their books for U.S. tax purposes--\nand they turn around and lease the sewer systems back to the European \ncities that built them in the first place.\n  I picked out sewer systems, because that is most graphic, but it \ndoesn't end there. We actually have companies buying city halls in \nEurope and depreciating on their books for U.S. tax purposes here \nleasing those city halls back to the European cities that built them in \nthe first place.\n  Some say if you go after that kind of scam, you are increasing \nsomebody's taxes. Well, I suppose in some sense you are. But you know \nwhat. Shame on the people who are doing it. The vast majority of us pay \nwhat we owe. But unfortunately, we have an increasing group of \ncompanies and individuals who are dodging what they legitimately owe \nhere and they are doing it in these offshore tax havens.\n  I have shown on many occasions a picture of this little five-story \nbuilding in the Cayman Islands that claims to be the home to 14,000 \ncompanies--14,000 companies. They say they are all doing business out \nof this little five-story building in the Cayman Islands. They are not \ndoing any business out of there. They are doing monkey business. And \nthe monkey business they are doing is to avoid their taxes in the \nUnited States. Shame on us if we don't close that down.\n  Some say: Well, this is a big spending budget--big spending. Really? \nThat can only be the statement of people who haven't read this budget, \nbecause this budget takes domestic discretionary spending as a \npercentage of our gross\n\n[[Page S4843]]\n\ndomestic product from 4.4 percent in 2010 to 3.4 percent in 2014. So as \na share of our national income, domestic discretionary spending is \ngoing down.\n  Facts are stubborn things. Over the life of this budget, non-defense \ndiscretionary spending in dollar terms--in dollar terms--is being \nincreased 2.9 percent a year. That is below the rate of growth of our \nnational income. That is why, as a share of our economy, domestic \ndiscretionary spending is going down, not up. So when you hear claims \nthis is a big spending budget, it is not this budget. They may be \ntalking about some other budget, but the budget before us is the budget \nreported by the conference committee, and that budget is tough on \nspending, it is tough on deficits, it is tough on getting our country \nback on a more sustainable course.\n  We have a series of budget enforcement tools in this budget \nresolution that I am particularly proud of: discretionary caps for 2009 \nand 2010. We maintain a strong pay-go rule. We have a point of order \nagainst long-term deficit increases; a point of order against short-\nterm deficit increases. We allow reconciliation for deficit reduction \nonly. And we provide a point of order against mandatory spending on an \nappropriations bill.\n  This last one I want to emphasize I think is especially important. \nBecause what we have found is our friends on the Appropriations \nCommittee have found a new way around the rules here and they have \nstarted to put mandatory spending on discretionary spending bills. Let \nme be clear. Mandatory spending is for things such as Medicare, for \nSocial Security. If you are eligible, if you qualify, you get your \nbenefits. So that is called mandatory spending, and that is most of the \nspending of the Federal Government. Most of the spending is now \nmandatory spending. Medicare and Social Security are the biggest ones. \nWe also have certain veterans benefits, which is mandatory spending for \nsome of it, much of it discretionary.\n  Discretionary means under the discretion of the appropriations \nprocess each year. That is why it is discretionary. And discretionary \nspending, as I have indicated, is going down under this budget as a \nshare of our gross domestic product. But we don't want mandatory \nspending to be increased in discretionary spending bills, and that \nstarted to happen a couple of years ago and we put this point of order \nin place to provide a barrier, a hurdle, against that bad practice.\n  We also have in this budget resolution provisions addressing our \nlong-term fiscal challenges. I think everybody understands that health \ncare is the 800-pound gorilla. Health care in our Federal accounts--\nMedicare, Federal share of Medicaid, and other aspects of health care \nspending--is where we see spending of the Federal Government soaring \nand continuing to grow out of control. So there is the health care \nreform reserve fund that I previously described that is critically \nimportant to getting our fiscal future back in line.\n  We also provide program integrity initiatives to crack down on waste, \nfraud, and abuse in Social Security and Medicare. This is especially \nprevalent in Medicare. The previous Secretary--Secretary Leavitt--whom \nI had high regard for, came to see me one day. He had with him \ninformation about scams that were being conducted across the country to \ndefraud Medicare, and he had pictures of phony operations in Florida \nthat were in shopping malls where they had individual storefronts set \nup that were supposedly providing Medicare services, each of them \nbilling $500,000 to $1 million a year in so-called services to \nMedicare-eligible patients.\n  When they pierced the veil, what they found was they weren't \nproviding any services, they were just doing the billing. They were \nbilling but they weren't providing any services. It was a complete \nscam. And there were dozens of them--dozens of these storefront \noperations. The Secretary himself went to some of them in the middle of \nthe day and they were closed. They were closed for the public, but they \nwere open for scam. We have provided funds to go after those kinds of \nfraudulent operations.\n  We have also provided a long-term deficit increase point of order to \ntry to prevent any action by the Congress to increase the long-term \ndeficit without facing a supermajority point of order hurdle.\n  Let me close on this quote by President Obama, because it is \nsomething I agree with very much. While I believe this budget has made \ngood progress at getting our fiscal house back in order for the next 5 \nyears, we have to do much more--much, much more. President Obama said \nthis at the Fiscal Responsibility Summit he hosted at the White House \nat the end of February:\n\n       Now, I want to be very clear. While we are making important \n     progress towards fiscal responsibility this year, in this \n     budget, this is just the beginning. In the coming years, \n     we'll be forced to make more tough choices, and do much more \n     to address our long-term challenges.\n\n  That is true. We have got much more work to be done, especially in \nthe second 5 years. This is a 5-year budget, because of the 34 budgets \nwritten by the Congress, 30 of the 34 have been 5-year budgets. The \nPresident sent us a 10-year budget. Some have asked why we didn't do a \n10-year budget. Very simply, because Congress almost always has done 5-\nyear budgets because we know that the projections for the second 5 \nyears are highly unreliable--highly unreliable. Frankly, a forecast for \n5 years is a bit of a crap-shoot.\n  I used to have the responsibility of forecasting the revenue for my \nState. I had to do it for 3 years. I know how difficult it was to do \nthat for 3 years. Five years is extraordinarily difficult, especially \nat a time like this of dramatic economic changes and a very steep \ndowndraft. The reality is that 10-year forecasts have very little \nreliability. So we have done a 5-year budget here. That, as I say, has \nbeen done 30 of the 34 times Congress has written a budget under the \nBudget Act. Thirty of the 34 times, it has been a 5-year budget.\n  I say to my colleagues, I believe this budget is part of economic \nrecovery. We are facing very tough winds. We are facing a very tough \neconomic environment--the steepest downturn since the Great \nDepression--and we are going to have to be aggressive in terms of \npreventing a deflationary spiral that could suck this economy down. We \nsaw it in the Great Depression--a failure of Government to act \neffectively until tremendous damage had been done: the unemployment \nrate rose to 25 percent, the stock market fell by nearly 90 percent. We \nhad a circumstance in which 25 percent of the people--more than 25 \npercent of the people--were unemployed, with staggering devastation to \nthe strength of America.\n  The Chairman of the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bernanke, has made it his \nlife's work to study how to avoid another Great Depression. In his \nanalysis, and others like it--as historians look back--the conclusion \nis there was a failure of the Government to act proactively. It waited \ntoo long. It believed the markets would correct themselves. It believed \nthat somehow everything would work out without intervention. That \nproved to be a fatal mistake.\n  All of the elements of the Federal response have taken a different \ndirection in this downturn, and it started with the previous \nadministration, to their credit. The Federal Reserve has done a great \ndeal to provide liquidity in this economy. Instead of pulling back, it \nhas extended credit. The Federal Government, instead of pulling back in \norder to balance our budget in the short term, has put forward hundreds \nof billions of dollars in a stimulus package to provide an increase in \naggregate demand to provide stimulation to the economy, to provide \nliquidity. Without it, I believe the collapse would be far steeper, far \nmore serious, and far more threatening. And remember, what we are faced \nwith is not just a national crisis, it is a global crisis, with global \neconomic activity falling very dramatically all around the world. The \nresponse of almost every industrialized country has been like ours, to \nprovide liquidity, to provide stimulus. China has a major stimulus \nprogram, Japan, and Europe; virtually all the countries of Europe. \nRussia has announced a major stimulus plan.\n  I believe those are the right policy responses, however imperfect--\nand imperfect they are, the specific packages that have been developed. \nI myself thought we could have done much better in our stimulus \npackage. I would have liked to have seen much more funding for \ninfrastructure. I wanted much more funding for infrastructure\n\n[[Page S4844]]\n\nbecause I personally believe that is a place where you get a two-fer: \nYou get a lift for the economy and you also get an investment that \nstrengthens our economic competitive position for the future. But look, \nthere was a substantial infrastructure component. I would have liked to \nhave seen it be far bigger and more robust, but nonetheless, we are \nmoving in the right direction.\n  This budget moves in the right direction. It is a contribution to \neconomic recovery. It does preserve the President's key priorities of \nreducing our dependence on foreign energy, which must be done. It \nfocuses on excellence in education, because if we are not the best \neducated, we are not going to be the strongest country in the world for \nvery long. And it provides for fundamental health care reform--because \nthat is the 800-pound gorilla that could swamp the fiscal boat of the \nUnited States, not to mention the boats of every American family and \nAmerican companies that absolutely need cost containment--at the same \ntime improving health care outcomes for the American people.\n  Finally, yes, dramatically reducing the deficit, reducing it by two-\nthirds in dollar terms, by three-quarters as a share of the gross \ndomestic product of the United States over the next 5 years.\n  This is not a perfect document. If I were able to write it just by \nmyself I think I could have improved it. I think every Member here \nbelieves that; that if they were able to write this document it would \nbe a better document.\n  That is not our option. We have a Senate, we have a House of \nRepresentatives, we have a President. This is the work of all three \nentities: The President of the United States, the Senate of the United \nStates, the House of Representatives. I believe we have produced an \nimportant step in economic recovery.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the conference report. I yield the \nfloor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Georgia is recognized.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. Mr. President, I thank the Budget chairman for a lot of \nthings. One is his openmindedness. But I particularly thank him for the \nclosing he presented because it relates directly to the subject I would \nlike to discuss, but I would like to yield to the chairman to ask him \ntwo questions to make sure I am accurate about the conference report. \nFirst, it is my understanding that there is a $634 billion account set \nup for health care; is that correct?\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, answering through the Chair, that was in \nthe President's budget. We did not provide for that in this conference \nreport. What we did provide for is a deficit-neutral reserve fund. We \ndid not specify an amount that would be necessary for health care \nbecause we do not know whether the right number is $200 billion, $400 \nbillion or $600 billion, as the Senator referenced. What we do say is \nwhatever that number is, it has to be dealt with in a deficit-neutral \nway. It has to be paid for.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank the chairman. Second, is it not true that the \namendment the Senate unanimously adopted that set forth a deficit-\nneutral account of $34.2 billion for a housing tax credit was deleted \nfrom the conference report?\n  Mr. CONRAD. The Senator is correct.\n  Mr. ISAKSON. I thank my distinguished chairman.\n  I wish to make my remarks not to the Senate. I commend the chairman \nand the Senate for adopting the amendment as we did on the floor 3 \nweeks ago. I wish to direct my remarks to the President of the United \nStates, to Dr. Summers, to Dr. Christina Romer, the head of the Council \nof Economic Advisers to the President, to Secretary Geithner, and my \nfriend, Rahm Emanuel. I wish to make a case for what the Senate did, \nwhich is deleted from this budget resolution, and I wish to start it \nlooking back 15 months ago.\n  Fifteen months ago, when we came in, in January of last year, we were \nbeginning to see foreclosures, beginning to see the housing market \ndecline, and I introduced at that time, along with other Members of the \nSenate, a housing tax credit for the purchase of foreclosed and vacant \nhouses. It was scored at a cost of $11.4 billion. The Finance Committee \nrejected that amendment in the Senate, saying it cost too much.\n  Ninety days later, the Senate passed a $150 billion economic stimulus \nbill recommended by President Bush that gave every American $300, or up \nto $1,200 per family, to stimulate the economy--and the economy \nspiraled down.\n  In July of last year, we dealt with a housing bill that created HOPE \nfor Homeowners and an FHA program expansion. I tried to amend that with \na housing tax credit and, to the credit of the House and Senate, the \nconferees ended up creating a $7,500 interest-free loan for first-time \nhome buyers. It did not work, but it was a sincere effort to try.\n  Then we came back this year and Senator Lieberman, myself, and others \nreintroduced the $15,000 tax credit for any family who buys and \noccupies their home, any single-family residence in America, for at \nleast 3 years. The tax credit of $15,000 is a substantial incentive. It \nis tied directly to exactly what happened in this country in 1975, when \nAmerica offered a $2,000 tax credit for anyone to buy any one of the 3 \nyears' worth of standing vacant inventory that was on the market in the \nUnited States. We passed it at that time and exited that recession \nwithin 12 months, restimulating the housing market which had led us \ninto that particular recession.\n  It is housing that led us into this recession and it is housing that \nis causing precisely what the chairman referred to and that is the \ndeflation that is going on in the United States of America. One in five \nhomes today is underwater, meaning they owe more on their home than it \nis worth. The equity lines of credit have been wiped out. Families' \nbasic major estate and their net worth has been wiped out and the \nhousing market continues to be a collection of short sales and \nforeclosures.\n  The current tax credit we have, which is now $8,000 to a family as \nlong as their income doesn't exceed $150,000 and as long as it is their \nfirst home purchase, is a fair effort to start, but our problem is not \nwith first-time home buyers. Our problem is with move-ups, with \ntransferees, people who have been playing by the rules, making their \npayments. If they are transferred, they are afraid to take the transfer \nbecause they are afraid they can't sell their house, and they are \nafraid there is no buyer incentive to help get them there. I urge the \nPresident, Dr. Summers, Secretary Geithner, Dr. Romer, and Rahm Emanuel \nto consider this: That $15,000 tax credit, if it were passed today in \nAmerica for 12 months, would cost, as scored by CBO, $34.2 billion. How \nmuch is $34.2 billion? It is 5.4 percent of the President's set-aside \nof $634 billion for health care. It is one one-hundredth of 1 percent \nof the $3.5 trillion budget--one one-hundredth of 1 percent of the \namount of the budget.\n  Don't you think we could provide an incentive that is that \ninexpensive to motivate a housing market to return, to begin to reflate \nvalues back and put equity in the pockets of the American people and \nreturn our economy?\n  Experts have estimated--and I am not saying I am an expert, this is \nexperts who have estimated--that if that tax credit had passed last \nyear it would have created 700,000 home sales and 587,000 jobs. Mr. \nPresident, 587,000 jobs is the number of jobs we have been losing a \nmonth. We need to find a way to create that kind of number.\n  More important, let me give you the intriguing fact about the 700,00 \nhouse sales. Current home sales in America are at 500,000. An average \nyear in this decade in this country was 1.2 million, a good year was \n1.5 million. If you add that estimated 700,000 produced by the credit \nto the existing 500,000, you would return the United States to a \nbalanced housing market. You would begin to appreciate the value of \nthose houses back to where they were. You would restore equity lines of \ncredit for the men and women of the United States of America. You will \nemploy people in the construction industry.\n  My last point is very important. This housing recession and the \ndifficulties in it now are in the developed lots that are standing, \ndeveloped and unsold, and the A, D, and C loans that have been made by \nthe major banks funded around the country to fund those developments. \nThose loans are beginning to come due. They are threatening the \nintegrity of the U.S. banking system, and there is only one thing that \nwill solve that and that is for those lots to begin to be absorbed. The \nonly way to\n\n[[Page S4845]]\n\ndo that is to get house buyers back in the market with an incentive to \ncome back in and buy.\n  If the tax credit passed, we do not have that much of a vacant \ninventory available in the country. It would immediately stimulate the \nemployment of construction workers to go into homebuilding.\n  My thanks to the Senate for its wisdom in adopting the $15,000 \ncredit. I express my deep disappointment in the conference committee \ndropping it, and I encourage our President and the leadership of our \ncountry to give a second thought to what this credit could do. It seems \nto me one one-hundredth of 1 percent of the budget is worth a gamble to \ncreate almost 600,000 jobs and 700,000 home sales, restore equity lines \nof credit to America's families and, most important of all, reenergize \nthe great engine that is the American economy. The greatest stimulus in \nthe world is not a gift of money, it is an incentive to invest and for \nAmerican families to return their confidence in this great economy we \nhave in this great country.\n  I urge the leadership of the country to consider that. I, again, \nthank the chairman of the Budget Committee and every Member of the \nSenate for their unanimous support of it, and I yield the floor in \nsincere hopes that when this speech goes to the White House they will \nread it, they will check the numbers, and they will ask the question: \nIs one one-hundredth of 1 percent of this budget worth the chance to \nrestore the economy of America?\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Gillibrand). The Senator from Maryland is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CARDIN. Madam President, last November the American people voted \nfor change. I think it is appropriate today, as we are considering the \nconference report on the budget, which is the blueprint for our Nation, \nand we also celebrate the 100th day of Barack Obama's Presidency and \nhis administration--I think it is time to reflect where we have been in \nthese last 100 days and the changes that have occurred. But first it is \nimportant to point out the mess President Obama inherited.\n  The United States is engaged in two wars. We have the worst economic \ncrisis since the Great Depression inherited by this administration. We \nhave record deficits inherited by this administration. The \ninternational reputation of the United States is badly damaged.\n  In 100 days, the Obama administration, working with us in Congress, \nhas an impressive record of accomplishments. I think it is important to \npoint out that the No. 1 priority, as all my constituents tell me on a \ndaily basis, is to fix our economy. Our economy is in deep trouble. The \nAmerican Recovery and Reinvestment Act put the recovery of our economy \nfirst by creating jobs. We need more jobs, to save jobs, create jobs. \nThe Obama administration put that as their top priority.\n  But they also invested in America's future in education, in health \ncare, and in energy; protecting our essential services for America's \nmost vulnerable people; and providing tax cuts to help restore consumer \nconfidence in our economy.\n  That was the first priority. That bill has passed and its impact is \nnow being felt in our country. But in the Congress, under the \nleadership of President Obama working with us, other things were \naccomplished in a very short period of time.\n  The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Equity Act was passed, guaranteeing we \nhave an enforceable right for equal pay.\n  We passed the Children's Health Insurance Program that now covers 4 \nmillion more children with health insurance. I am particularly pleased \nthat law includes dental care so children will be able to see a \ndentist.\n  We passed legislation protecting public lands and protecting our \nenvironment for future generations.\n  We passed the Edward M. Kennedy Serve America Act, for Americans to \nbe able to engage in volunteer service to their country throughout \ntheir lifetime.\n  The Obama administration, working with this Congress, has restored \nAmerica's international leadership. We have made it clear from the \nbeginning that this Nation will not permit the use of torture, focused \nour missions in both Iraq and Afghanistan of going after the \nterrorists--which is what we should do to make America safe--and \nprepared to join the international community in combating global \nclimate change.\n  We have done a lot during the first 100 days--quite a record. Today \nwe are on the verge of passing the budget conference report which will \nprovide a new blueprint for America's future. What are the priorities? \nThe priority first, is the economy. Again, we have to get out of this \nrecession. This budget allows us to invest in creating new jobs. It \nwill do it in a fiscally responsible way and will invest in health \ncare, energy, and education.\n  President Obama, as I pointed out earlier, inherited quite a fiscal \nmess. President Bush, during the 8 years of his Presidency, started \nwith a surplus. Let me remind you, 8 years ago we had a surplus, a $236 \nbillion surplus in 2000. The current year's deficit is $1.75 trillion. \nThis was the fiscal recklessness of the Bush administration that has \nbeen inherited by the Obama administration. It has cost us jobs. We are \nlosing half a million jobs each and every month. That is what was \nconfronting the President back when he took office.\n  We have a housing crisis, people losing their homes. They are still \nlosing their homes today. We have to pay attention to that. We have got \nto give confidence so that people can keep their homes. It is important \nfor individuals, it is important for our communities, it is important \nfor our economy.\n  Banks are not lending money. They still are not lending money. We \nhave got to get our financial system working the way it should so that \nAmerica can grow. We have got to help small business. That is the \ngrowth engine of America in order to create jobs and move forward with \ninnovation.\n  What we need to do is have a budget that puts our priorities on \nAmerica's future. Well, the budget President Obama has that we are \nabout ready to pass does that. It helps our economy but does it in a \nfiscally responsible way. It puts us on a glide path to reduce the \nFederal budget by two-thirds by the year 2014.\n  We are working on the economy, working on creating jobs, but we are \nalso working on fiscal responsibility to get out from this deficit. \nBecause we not only have a moral obligation to our children and \ngrandchildren to pay our bills, it is critically important for the \nfiscal strength of America that we get our budget back into balance. So \nas we come out of this recession, as we create the jobs that this \nbudget will allow us to do, we also put us on a glidepath toward fiscal \nresponsibility.\n  But the budget recognizes another essential point. We are not going \nto do things the way we have done them in the past. We have an \nadministration that is prepared to tackle the tough problems. It is one \nthing to get out of this recession and to try to balance the budget and \nget our budget balanced, but we have got to deal with the underlying \nproblems that America confronts. We have got to fix a broken health \ncare system, because it is too expensive and drains our economy.\n  We have got to become energy independent, because that drains our \neconomy and our budget. And we have got to invest in education. Our \nchildren are our future. We have got to put our resources with our \nchildren.\n  The budget recognizes that for America to be able to have a strong \nbudget in the future, we need to fix our health care system. We talked \nabout this for a long time. We have talked about fixing it. Well, we \nnow have a President who has said the only option that is not on the \ntable is the status quo. I agree with President Obama, we have got to \nfix the system. Why?\n  First, it is way too expensive. Not only is it a drain on Federal \ntaxpayers but to every person in this country. Our health care system \nis twice as expensive, per capita, than the next most expensive system \nin the world. And yet we have seen, during the Bush years, the 8 years \nof his Presidency, the number of uninsured grow from 40 million to 47 \nmillion. There are 47 million Americans who do not have health \ninsurance. And we do not have the health care results that would \nwarrant such a large expenditure of our Federal economy in health care. \nWe should have better results. We do not have those results, so we have \ngot to fix our health care system.\n  What does this budget resolution do, the conference report that is \nbefore us--that will shortly be before us for a\n\n[[Page S4846]]\n\nvote? What this budget resolution does is allows us to move boldly \ntoward universal health coverage, toward universal coverage. Why is \nthat so important? Well, you see, someone who has no health insurance \ntoday enters a health care system in a very expensive way. They use our \nemergency rooms for primary care, to the extent that they get primary \ncare. They do not have prevention. And they enter our system in a much \nmore costly way. Illnesses that could have been detected early are left \nuntreated. They enter our system in a very expensive way.\n  Many times people without health insurance do not pay their bills. \nBut they get paid. Guess who pays them. The taxpayers of this country. \nThose who have insurance pay more for their premiums and doctors and \nhospitals because of people who have no health insurance.\n  It is in our national interest to get everyone covered by insurance. \nThis budget conference report will allow our committee to bring in a \nbill to fix our health care system to provide universal coverage that \nwill provide better quality care and save us money.\n  This budget allows us to save money in the health care system by \ninvesting in preventive health care. If we get more people tested for \nearly detection of diseases, it will save us money. We invest in health \ninformation technology so we can eliminate a lot of the waste in our \nhealth care system, the administrative costs. Not only will it \neliminate costs, unnecessary costs, but you will have better management \nof care. Doctors and hospitals will be able to communicate with each \nother. They will understand the complexities of your own individual \nhealth history and be able to build health protocols to give you more \ncost-effective, quality care. That is using technology. This will help \nus.\n  We need to deal with the disparities in health care. We know there \nare gaps across racial and ethnic lines. We need to narrow that, pay \nattention to that. This budget allows us to move in that direction to \neliminate these disparities.\n  The budget allows us to reform our own Medicare system. Medicare is \nthe largest insurance program in our country. Our elderly and disabled \ndepend upon our Medicare system. But our Medicare system needs to be \nchanged and reformed. Ask any physician about the sustainable growth \nrate methodology for reforming, for paying their fees every year. We \nhave got to change that. We have got to eliminate this physical therapy \nand rehab cap. It makes no sense at all.\n  This budget resolution allows us to reform the Medicare system to \nmake it more cost effective, and the budget resolution provides for the \nbackup of budget reconciliation instructions.\n  What does that mean? I want to give you my interpretation. That \nallows us to use regular order to get this issue dealt with, to get \nhealth care dealt with. We have been talking about it for years. It is \ntime to act. It is time to fix our health care system. And this is not \na partisan issue. It is not a Democratic issue or a Republican issue. \nThis is an issue that affects our country. It is an American issue. We \nneed to work together on it. But it is not regular order to use a \nfilibuster to prevent this body from taking up these issues. And that \nis what the budget reform process was all about many years ago.\n  I hope every Member of this body will work together so we can fix \nthis health care system. That is what we need to do. Nobody has a \nmonopoly on the best ideas. President Obama has reached out and said: \nLook, I know what we need to accomplish. You know what we need to \naccomplish. Let's work together and get it done so we can make health \ncare more accessible, and people can get quality care in a much more \ncost-effective way, saving the taxpayers of this country money, helping \nour economy grow, making American companies more competitive \ninternationally. If we fix the health care system, all of that is \npossible if we get it done right.\n  I want to compliment--I see the Chairman of the Budget Committee is \non the floor, Senator Conrad. I want to thank him for his leadership on \nthese issues. You now have a budget that will allow us to deal with \nthese priorities. But the budget resolution also recognizes that for \nAmerica to be strong, we also need to become energy independent. And \nthe budget resolution allows us, our committees, to do that. We need to \nbecome energy independent for the sake of our economy.\n  We saw the impact on our economy when energy prices went up and down, \nand we had very little to do with it. But if we get the energy policy \nright, we are going to create green jobs, more jobs in America. This is \nabout our economy. This is about helping America grow. So smart energy, \nenergy independence, is the right thing to help our economy. By the \nway, it is also important for national security. We should not be \nchallenged to fight wars because we need imported oil. Let us become \nenergy independent for the sake of our national security, and, yes, let \nus become energy independent using good green technology, because it is \ngood for our environment and we can do something about global climate \nchange, working with the international community.\n  But the budget goes further and says, look, if we are going to be a \nstrong nation, if we are going to get our future budgets in balance, if \nwe are going to be competitive internationally, if our economy is going \nto grow, and the American standard of living is going to grow, we are \ngoing to invest in education. Education has got to be our top priority.\n\n  We can do a much better job at pre-K through 12 and quality \neducation. Every child should have access to a quality school. This \nbudget resolution allows our committees to move in that direction, and \nto bring down the cost of higher education for the typical family. Too \nmany families today are being denied the opportunity to send their \nchild to college because they simply cannot afford the cost of higher \neducation. We have increased Pell grants. It is another great record of \nthis Congress. We increased the Pell grants. This budget resolution \nallows us to go further to bring down the cost of higher education.\n  The budget resolution recognizes that we have to empower families to \nbe able to afford and to participate in our economy. So tax relief to \nmiddle-income families is extended and expanded in this budget \nresolution.\n  The budget resolution recognizes that small businesses are the \ndriving force behind job creation. Most of our jobs are going to be \ncreated by small businesses. Innovation comes from small companies. So \nthis budget resolution allows us to continue the incentive so that \nsmall companies can get the credit they need, can get the help they \nneed to be able to not only survive this economic downturn but to turn \nit around and create new jobs.\n  I particularly thank the conferees for continuing to include the \nincreases, the 2-percent increases, in the Small Business \nAdministration, an agency that was decimated under the prior \nadministration. I offered an amendment in the committee that was \nadopted that increased that appropriation to $880 million. We want the \nSBA to be the advocate for the small business community, to fight \nGovernment agencies to make sure they make contracts available to small \ncompanies, to help mentor small companies so they have a business plan \nthat can get a loan from a bank. That is what we want the SBA to do. \nAnd now with this budget support, the SBA should be able to build and \nhelp our small businesses in America.\n  Last November America voted for a change. We are delivering on that \nexpectation. This budget resolution that has come out of the conference \ncommittee allows our committees, working with President Obama, to \ntackle the challenges confronting our Nation. The conference committee \ngives us the blueprint we need by focusing on different areas for \nhelping in tax relief, for bringing our budget better into balance, \nhelping working families, and investing in universal health care and \neducational opportunities and energy independence.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the work that has been done by our \nconferees. Let's work together to refuel and revitalize our Nation.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I thank the Senator from Maryland, Mr. \nCardin, who is a very important member of the Budget Committee. We were \nvery lucky to have Senator Cardin join\n\n[[Page S4847]]\n\nthe Budget Committee when he became a Member of the Senate, having come \nfrom the House where he served on the Ways and Means Committee.\n  If you look at Senator Cardin's career, it is a career of leadership, \nbeing elected at a young age in Maryland, rising to the most powerful \nposition in the Maryland legislature, coming to the House of \nRepresentatives, and now to the Senate. We are very fortunate to have \nhis background, his knowledge, and his skills helping us form a budget \nresolution for the country. I am indebted to him and I appreciate very \nmuch his wise counsel.\n  I ask unanimous consent that all quorum calls be charged equally to \nboth sides for the duration of the debate on the conference report \naccompanying the concurrent resolution on the budget.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I want to indicate, for the purposes of our colleagues, \nthat we have a series of speakers. We do not have this firmly locked in \nin terms of an order, but we are expecting Senator Enzi momentarily; \nSenator Gregg--I see Senator Enzi now; Senator Bunning approximately at \n12:30; Senator Johanns at roughly 1 o'clock; Senator Lindsey Graham at \napproximately 1:30. I will answer, to the extent I determine necessary, \nas we go through these speeches. But I want to indicate that that is \nroughly the order of where we are: Senator Enzi, Senator Gregg, Senator \nBunning, Senator Johanns, Senator Graham, and Senator Murray after \nthat.\n  We have other Senators also in the train. But if other Senators wish \nto join this debate and discussion, they are certainly welcome. It will \nbe important for them to call the cloakroom so they can get in the \nqueue so that they do not have to waste their time waiting here on the \nfloor as others speak.\n  With that, I see Senator Enzi has come to the floor. I will give him \na few minutes to get ready, because he is, as is so often the case with \nSenator Enzi, not only on time but ahead of his scheduled time, and we \nappreciate that very much.\n  We are delighted to have Senator Enzi here. He is also an important \nmember of the Senate Budget Committee. While we have differences--no \ndoubt he will have a different view of this budget resolution than \nperhaps do I--nonetheless, we have great respect for the contributions \nhe makes.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Wyoming is recognized.\n  Mr. ENZI. Madam President, I thank the chairman for his kind remarks \nand for the great job he does on very difficult issues.\n  Anytime you talk about money, whether it is at home, at work, or here \nin the Senate, it raises a lot of concern and difficulty.\n  I know this has been a difficult process to work through. Of course, \nI have a major disagreement with the budget that I want to concentrate \non because I am not only on the Budget Committee, I am also on the HELP \nCommittee, which is a big bite of the apple, especially since the \nPresident has placed so much emphasis on health care reform and \neducation reform this year. I also happen to be on the Finance \nCommittee. So the three committees have to interact on those issues, \nparticularly the health care issue. I have never been involved in an \nissue with as many moving parts or as difficult as health care reform, \nprobably because it involves 100 percent of the American people. Seldom \ndo we have a bill that involves that. This also involves every single \nbusiness and every single health care provider. All of them are nervous \nand probably ought to be as long as we are in session. I will speak in \nopposition because of a particular part of the budget resolution \nconference agreement that I am disappointed in.\n  As I review the agreement before the Senate, it once again reminds me \nof the old adage that I have referred to before: You can pay me now or \nyou can pay me later. This budget conference agreement leaves the bills \nfor later. It taxes too much, it spends too much, and it borrows too \nmuch. I ask my colleagues if this is the legacy we want to leave our \nchildren and grandchildren. Actually, we are going to be paying for it \nwithin our lifetimes; it will not be just the next generation. We ought \nto know better.\n  Yesterday, we were having a hearing in the HELP Committee where we \nwere talking to several States that have done something significant in \nthe area of health care. I like the roundtable approach. That is where \nwe bring in people who have done something, and they explain how they \ndid it, why, what the results were, what they would do differently. It \nis not like a regular hearing where one side invites in some of the \nwitnesses, the other side invites one of the witnesses, and then \neverybody shows up to beat up on the witnesses. This is to get \ninformation. It was fascinating because we had Massachusetts, \nCalifornia, Vermont, and Utah--four States that have tried or done \nsomething in the area of health care.\n  Yesterday, California explained their health care reform and had to \nmention that it failed. I asked why. They said it was primarily because \nthey had a $14 billion deficit they were trying to figure out how to \ncover, and health care costs money. I did have to point out that our \ndeficit is significantly bigger each and every year. Even \nproportionately, it is significantly bigger. So that will raise some \ndifficulties. This budget resolution conference agreement doesn't get \nnear to solving that problem, not even in the long run. So we are not \nconsidering a conference report that will confront any of the tough \nfinancial priority choices that face our country.\n  As I have said repeatedly, we cannot sustain the current level of \nspending without inflicting grave danger on the fiscal health of the \ncountry. Recently, I noticed that England tried to sell some bonds. \nThey had difficulty selling them. They didn't sell them. Everyone will \nrecall that China has been asking what additional guarantees we would \ngive on our bonds. What does that say? That says that we have maxed out \nour credit cards. Every individual in America who has ever had a maxed-\nout credit card knows what that means. It means you can't get more \ncredit. We run on credit, particularly if we run deficits.\n  One of the most offensive and dangerous parts of this conference \nagreement is the use of budget reconciliation. It is a procedural tool, \nand it is a backdoor method to bypass the full and fair legislative \nprocess. The Senate was designed to include minority views, and there \naren't issues where it is more important to do this on than with health \ncare reform and education reform. I am hoping that on either of those, \nin order for the American people to have confidence in what we are \ndoing, we will put together a bill that will have 75 or 80 votes. We \nneed to have that kind of agreement in order to have a plan that will \nwork. And Lord help the party that designs one that does not work or \nthat stops the process of getting one to work. Both sides have a \ntremendous responsibility in the health care and education debates. \nEither one can end their party with either of those bills. \nReconciliation's intended use is for meaningful deficit reduction on \nbudgetary issues. If you attack those problems purely from a budgetary \nissue, you cannot get to the core of the problem and you cannot resolve \nit.\n  I just came from a Senate Finance Committee meeting where we are \ntalking about the Senate Finance Committee piece of health care. That \nis separate from the HELP Committee portion of health care. Both have \nto work together, along with the Budget Committee, in order to come up \nwith a plan. Today, we were going through roughly one-third of the \nproblem. We were going to go through the delivery system part, how do \nwe deliver health care. We have a little eight-page document. The first \npage is just a cover page. The second page is just a summary. The third \npage is where we spent the last 2 hours. There are five more pages to \ngo. The other five pages are more difficult than the first page. After \nwe finish all of this and reach some resolution, which we are hoping to \ndo before the middle of May, then we have to look at coverage, what \nkind of coverage people will be given if they are under health care, \nand we want to get everyone under health care. The final piece we have \nto do is how to pay for it. So you can see it is a very complicated \nprocess.\n  Reconciliation is intended for the use of meaningful deficit \nreduction on\n\n[[Page S4848]]\n\nbudgetary issues. The budget resolution that passed this Chamber in \nMarch, the Senate version, was silent on reconciliation. Reconciliation \nis included in the House budget resolution and was, therefore, an item \nwe resolved during the conference process.\n  The conference agreement provides reconciliation instructions to the \nFinance Committee and the HELP Committee on both health care reform and \nhigher education. I serve on both committees, and as the ranking \nRepublican on the HELP Committee, I do have expertise on the issues at \nthe heart of the debate.\n  I also have a track record of legislative accomplishments and getting \nbills across the finish line. It doesn't do any good to just debate \nthem. If they don't get finished, it never helps anybody. I work on \ngetting them across the finish line. The way to do that is to focus on \nthe 80-percent rule. That means focusing on the issues where there is \ngeneral agreement 80 percent of the time rather than the 20 percent of \nthe issues where consensus is not likely. On that 80 percent, you have \nto pick out the 80 percent of the issue that everybody can agree on and \nfind another way, a new way of doing that other 20 percent. Then you \ncan reach the goal. If you are divided at the beginning, you won't get \nthe 80 percent, let alone the other 20. It takes time to keep everybody \ncalm and focused and listening. It takes time to reach solutions, \nparticularly on the 20 percent where you are trying to come up with a \nnew way, where neither side loses face, and get a result.\n  What we have is a situation where the House of Representatives is \ndictating the Senate process. How did reconciliation instructions make \nit into the conference report after so many powerful Senate Democrats--\nthe Budget Committee chairman, the Finance Committee chairman, the HELP \nCommittee chairman, all of the committees involved in this--opposed \nusing reconciliation and said they would fight to keep it out of the \nbudget? How did that many important people get rolled on this thing? \nHow did that happen? They said they opposed it, but it winds up in \nthere.\n  The House Rules Committee can allow large, comprehensive bills to be \ncleared in a single afternoon. They don't need it. They can do it \nirrespective of whether the bill is designated as reconciliation \nlegislation. However, in the Senate, without privileged designation, it \ncould take a week or more to consider the same legislation. It does \ntake longer over here. That is because we want to get it right. Using \nthe reconciliation process does not allow for a full and open debate in \nthe Senate. It does not allow a thorough vetting and amendment process. \nIts fast-track nature shuts out Members, particularly from the minority \nparty. It also shuts out centrist Democrats. So it is a declaration \nthat Republican ideas and centrist Democratic ideas are going to be \nleft out of the mix. It is counter to the successful way legislation is \ntypically considered in the HELP Committee. We often work in a \nbipartisan way that results in much of our legislation being worked out \nto achieve strong support from both sides of the aisle. Laws such as \nthe Pension Protection Act and the Head Start reauthorization were \nhundreds of pages in length, and they passed the Senate with little \ndebate and by huge margins.\n\n  I am deeply disappointed that the final budget resolution paves the \nway for a partisan process, particularly on these issues that are \nimportant on education and health. I have to say that the most radical \non both sides will favor this. The far-left Democrats see this as a way \nto do it their way. The far-right Republicans see it as a way to delay \nit so it doesn't get done because they will be able to cause confusion \nwith the amount of time that is involved. That will be bad for both \nsides. It won't work for the American people. That is why it won't work \nfor either side. That is why we have to be centrist on this and pull \ntogether 75 or 80 people who can agree on these issues. That will take \ntime in committee. If we do the proper amount in committee, it will \ntake less time on the floor. We have proven that with past legislation. \nTo just throw out this little bomb that says we are going to do this in \na very short period of time really affects the ability to work closely \ntogether.\n  One truly difficult challenge this Congress has to address is how to \nget control of America's exploding health care costs. Simply throwing \nmore money at the problem is not a solution. Real health care reform \nhas to be bipartisan. It has to have a full and open debate. If we \nenact the wrong health care fix, we will worsen our budget crisis. \nEnacting reforms without reducing costs represents an unsustainable \npromise that the American people will long regret.\n  It is taking us time to do these roundtables and hearings. Yesterday, \nMassachusetts, Vermont, California, and Utah talked about their \nexperiences. We learned a lot. Both sides learned a lot. They have \nlearned a lot. The States are really laboratories for the Federal \nGovernment. What works at the State level might have some \ntransformation to the Federal level. On the other hand, if we take it \nall at the Federal level and we do one-size-fits-all, we can damage \nefforts that can be done at the local level. The local level is where \npeople live.\n  Health care reform is too big an issue to advance with procedural \nshortcuts. There never has been a bill with as many moving parts that \naffects as many people as health care reform will. To get a workable \nsolution, it will require the effort of everybody in the Senate. We can \nbring them together and do that. If we can't come up with a plan that \nwill garner the support of at least 75 or 80 Senators, this institution \nwill not gain the confidence of the American people. Without that \nconfidence, the plan will fail. We will never overcome the objections \nthat will be raised.\n  Misusing the reconciliation process to get a health care bill or \nhigher education reforms is not the right approach. It conflicts with \nthe new bipartisan spirit the President has promised. This is a \ndisappointing day in the Senate. Moving a health care reform bill \nthrough reconciliation rehashes what we have been suffering from--the \nPelosi war cry: We won the election, we get to write the bills. That is \nnot right. This kind of partisanship disenfranchises millions of \nAmericans--not just Senators, millions of Americans--and it is wrong. \nThey are looking for commonsense solutions, not party messages.\n  The American people deserve a good bipartisan bill that will work. \nUsing reconciliation will make that impossible. While I expect that \nChairman Conrad has the votes to adopt this conference agreement, I am \ngoing to urge my colleagues to oppose the resolution and on the basis \nof needing to have good health care reform done the right way with \neverybody working on it. That is exactly how it has to be. It cannot be \njust one side. Anybody who opposes health care reform--unless it is \nbecause it was rushed through with just one party listening--will \nsuffer too. If we get everybody together, we can come up with a plan \nthat will work. I regret that ever made it into the budget. I still \ncannot believe that could be a part of it--the House, that does not \nneed it, imposing it on a Senate that knows better.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor and reserve the remainder of our \ntime.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, very briefly because I see Senator Gregg \nis in the Chamber, and I know he is on a very tight timeframe.\n  I very briefly say to the Senator from Wyoming, I do not favor \nreconciliation for writing health care. I, personally, do not believe \nit will be used to write health care reform. It is here as an insurance \npolicy. I think virtually everybody who has been engaged in the debate \npublicly and privately has now concluded it is not the preferred \nalternative for writing health care.\n  One of the things we did do is push back the date to October 15 for \nthe committees to act to give them more time to work under the regular \norder. Chairman Baucus has made an absolute commitment to try to do \nthis in the regular order. I have done the same. The majority leader \nhas done the same.\n  I sincerely believe health care can and should be written without \nusing the fast-track process of reconciliation. It is true it is here \nas an insurance policy, as a backstop. I would have strongly preferred \nit not even be that. But let me say, when it is the President of the \nUnited States, the Speaker, the majority leader here, it\n\n[[Page S4849]]\n\ngets fairly lonely as a conferee. But I do wish to say to the Senator, \nI agreed with so much of what he said. He is going to be a major player \nin health care reform. He already has been--certainly in the CHIP \nlegislation.\n  I believe there is going to be a full opportunity to write it the way \nit should be written, which is in the committees of jurisdiction, with \nboth sides fully participating. That is the best way and the right way \nto do it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GREGG. Madam President, picking up on the comments made by the \nchairman--and I fully accept his sincerity and his belief and his \ndesire not to use reconciliation, but that is not, as he said, the \nposition of the President, the Speaker of the House, and the majority \nleader. I think we can assume if those three folks want reconciliation \nto be used, it is going to be used.\n  The practical implications of reconciliation are to devastate the \nconstitutional prerogative of the Senate. The purpose of the Senate is \nto debate, discuss, and then amend items of major--major--policy.\n  The point is, reconciliation was put into this document, which we \njust received, for the purposes of muzzling the minority and making the \nSenate into having the same status, from a parliamentary procedure \nstandpoint, as the House, where amendments are not allowed, where \ndiscussion is limited, and where an up-or-down vote is the only option \ngiven to the membership.\n  It is not only a terrible idea from the standpoint of the impact it \nhas on the constitutional role of the Senate--which has been explained \nvery effectively by people such as Senator Byrd as being a place where \nwe are supposed to give the minority the capacity to make points and \ndiscuss matters of high policy and complex issues in an open forum with \nthe ability to amend--but it is also a very difficult way to proceed on \nan issue of such complexity as health care reform or the climate change \nissue. The practical effect of using reconciliation will be that a bill \nwill pass in this Congress, especially in this Senate, which the \nAmerican people will know is not fair. They will know it is not fair \nbecause there will have been no ability for the minority or for people \nwho disagree with the way the bill was written down at the White House \nto object to it or to amend it.\n  That type of legislation--major health care legislation, which \naffects every American--in order for it to be effective and in order \nfor it to be accepted by the American people, needs to be perceived as, \nand really be, a fair document, reached through compromise, with the \npurposes of having all the different stakeholders at the table in order \nto discuss the issue. Regrettably, that is not going to happen under \nthe reconciliation instruction.\n  I would note that even though the chairman has said--and I am sure he \nsays this in all sincerity; I know he says it in all sincerity--he \nbelieves reconciliation will not be used in health care, it can be used \nand will be used on health care if the President and the majority \nleader and the Speaker of the House want it to be because that is why \nthey put it in.\n  In addition, the idea it will not be used to raise the national sales \ntax on energy or a light switch tax, which is what is being proposed \nrelative to the carbon tax, that also probably does not apply because \nthe language of the bill is not binding. It simply says it is assumed. \n``Assumed'' is a pretty weak--in fact, I cannot think of many words \nthat are any weaker than the term ``assumed.'' It is assumed \nreconciliation will not be used in the area of climate change \nlegislation, which means it can be used in the area of climate change \nlegislation and probably will be if there is a determination by those \nfolks who want to push that issue to do so.\n  It is ironic this bill--for which we have had two major votes in this \nSenate that said: Do not use reconciliation for the purposes of climate \nchange--has in it such weak language on that issue, basically opening \nthe door to using reconciliation for the purposes of climate change.\n  But the reconciliation issue, as serious as it is--and it is a \nserious issue because it goes to the purposes and the role of the \nSenate, in my opinion; and it also, in my opinion, will undermine the \nquality of the product produced in the area of health care or climate \nchange--is not the core problem with this budget. The core problem with \nthis budget is it spends too much money, it raises and creates too much \ndebt, especially on our children's backs, and it raises and spends too \nmuch in the way of taxes. It is going to have a dramatic impact on the \nquality of life in this Nation as it plays out, as it is creating an \nunsustainable government, a government which neither our generation nor \nour children's generation, nor our children's children's generation are \ngoing to be able to pay for because it is going to increase in size so \nmuch and create so much in the way of deficit and debt, which will have \nto be paid for by our children and our grandchildren.\n  To try to put this in perspective, the budget basically raises \ndiscretionary spending by $1.5 trillion. We are going to hear some \narguments from the other side of the aisle that: No, it does not do \nthat. I will get to that in a second. They are essentially doing the \nObama budget, the President's budget. The Director of OMB says there is \nvirtually no difference between the two. They are 98 percent the same.\n  Essentially, they are raising discretionary spending by $1.4 \ntrillion, mandatory spending by $1.1 trillion, and raising taxes by \n$1.5 trillion. In fact, it may be a lot more. They are making \nabsolutely no savings in the area of spending accounts, which are \ncritical to getting this deficit down and under control.\n  As we have mentioned on numerous occasions, but which is accurate and \nneeds to be repeated, they double the size of the debt in 5 years, they \ntriple it in 10 years, and they leave our children with a debt which is \n80 percent of GDP--a public debt which is 80 percent of GDP.\n  The practical effect of having a debt that is 80 percent of GDP is \nthat basically you have a nation which cannot sustain its obligations \nof debt. Today, our public debt to GDP is about 40 percent. If you wish \nto get into the European Union, your public debt can only be 60 percent \nof GDP. Under this budget, we are going to 80 percent of GDP. Latvia \ncould get into the European Union, but we could not under this budget. \nThat is what is going to happen. It is not a question of some sort of \ntheoretical event. Under the spending program of this budget--and \nbecause the Congress is now totally controlled by the liberal side of \nthe aisle and because the President is of that party--this is going to \nhappen. It is not like it is not going to happen. It is going to \nhappen.\n  What is driving these massive deficits? Primarily, it is massive \nspending increases. It is not too tricky an issue. Under President \nObama's budget, and under the budget that is brought here by our \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle--although they tried to \nobfuscate the spending; at least the President is forthright about his \nspending--the spending of the Federal Government goes up dramatically.\n  This chart I have in the Chamber shows, historically, Federal \nspending has been about 20 percent of GDP. That is about what we can \nafford, historically, because our revenues are a little bit below \nthat--19 percent of GDP. Under this proposal, the spending goes up \nradically in the next year, year and a half, and then it comes down as \na result of the end of the recession and then it starts going up again. \nBut it never comes down that much. It is 23 percent, 24 percent, 25 \npercent of GDP.\n  The problem is spending. The President is very forthright about this. \nHe says he believes strongly--and his party, obviously, agrees with \nhim--that you should significantly increase the size of the Federal \nGovernment, that you should significantly increase spending because if \nyou increase the size of the Government, if you move the Government to \nthe left, if you increase its spending, you create prosperity. He \nbelieves governments create prosperity.\n  Well, we do not agree with that. We think the way you create \nprosperity is having a government you can afford. That does not mean \nyou eliminate Government. It means you have one you can afford. The \nproposal here is not for a government you can afford. It is just the \nopposite: a government we cannot afford, a government that is not \nsustainable. The way to create prosperity is by having a government you \ncan afford and giving individuals the ability\n\n[[Page S4850]]\n\nto go out, make investments, takes risks, and create jobs. That is how \nyou create prosperity--not by radically increasing the size of \nGovernment, radically moving it to the left, which is exactly what is \nproposed in this budget.\n  All this new spending leads to a massive increase in debt. In fact, \none of the more interesting statistics--because I noticed the chart of \nmy colleague from the other side relative to George Bush--this \nPresident dwarfs--dwarfs--what President George W. Bush did in the area \nof adding debt to our children's backs. It dwarfs that. If you take all \nthe debt created in this country since George Washington through George \nW. Bush, President Obama's budget--and the budget which is being \nbrought here by the other side of the aisle, if it were honestly scored \nand correctly accounted for, which would be essentially the same as \nPresident Obama's budget--doubles the amount of debt that has been put \non our books by all the Presidents in all the history of this Nation. \nThat is a tragic event for us, but it is an even more tragic event for \nthe next generation.\n  I hear the other side constantly talking about what President Obama \ninherited. Yes, he inherited tough times. But the issue is not what he \ninherited. The issue is what he is going to bequeath, what he is going \nto leave the next generation. What he is leaving the next generation is \nan unsustainable Government. You do not have to listen to me to believe \nthat. The chairmen of the Budget Committees on both sides of Congress--\non the House side and the Senate side--have said the budget, as \npresently proposed, is unsustainable in the outyears. Their budget is \nunsustainable in the outyears. Of course, they eliminate the outyears. \nThey only did a 5-year budget. The President did 10 years. They took \noff the last 5 years so they would not have to talk about it. But it is \nnot going away at the end of 5 years--still growing, still out of \ncontrol. And it is unsustainable in their own terms.\n  Why is it unsustainable?\n  This chart shows the bottom line of why it is unsustainable. It is \ncalled the debt. To quote one of the sages and oracles around here: \n``The debt is the threat,'' and the debt is just going up and up and \nup. It is an unsustainable situation.\n  What does ``unsustainable'' mean? That is some sort of term we throw \nout and people don't really catch on. What does it mean? It means the \naverage American family at the end of the President's budget will have \n$130,000 of new debt--every family in America--that they will have to \npay for as part of the Federal debt. It means the average American \nfamily will have $6,000 a year of interest payments on that debt for \nwhich they will be responsible. It means our children will inherit a \ngovernment which will cost them so much that basically one of two \nthings will happen to them: The economy will have to be inflated \nradically to pay off this debt, thus reducing the value of the dollar, \neliminating savings of most Americans and creating an economic tax of \ninordinate proportions through massive inflation; or taxes on all \nAmericans will have to be significantly increased at a rate that we \nhave never seen in our history--other than in World War II--a rate \nwhich will essentially mean Americans would not be able to go out and \nbuy a home. They would not be able to go out and send their kids to \ncollege. They would not be able to buy that car or live that lifestyle \nour generation had.\n  With the debt at 80 percent of GDP, it will mean for the first time \nin the history of our country, one generation will have passed on to \nanother generation less of a nation--less prosperous, less strong, less \nopportunity. Totally unfair, but that is exactly what will happen. \nThere is no way around this. Their budget locks us into this path. They \nthemselves admit it is not sustainable, but that hasn't caused them to \nhesitate in going forward, and going forward in an aggressive way to \nexpand the size of government and not pay for it and leave our kids \nwith these massive debts.\n  I think it is appropriate at this time to also talk a little bit \nabout the specific budget before us, which is the compromise between \nthe House and the Senate budget because there is so much misdirection \nand disingenuousness about this budget that it is staggering. I give \nthe President of the United States and his people credit, including \nDirector Orszag and OMB. They attempted to send an honest and \nstraightforward budget where they actually told us what was going to \nhappen and what the costs were going to be. They put in one big gaming \nmechanism in the area of defense where they assumed $1.6 billion of \nspending, which everybody knew wasn't going to occur because they \ncounted on the war costs going on for 10 years at their present \nlevels--and we all know that is not going to happen--and then they \nclaimed savings when those war costs were reduced. That was a fairly \nbig item. But outside of that item, for the most part they gave us a \nbudget that had integrity to it in the area of what it really was and \nwhat it was really going to cost.\n  This budget which was just sent to us is just the opposite. It is \nfilled with gamesmanship, with stuffing spending under the rug so we \ndon't notice it, with tools that avoid enforcement mechanisms, and with \nthings such as the reconciliation instructions, which are a total \nadulteration of the congressional process when it is used relative to a \npublic policy issue as big as the question of health care.\n  Let's note a few of the things they have left out of their budget to \nget to their alleged number. Remember, their alleged number is around \n$500 billion of deficit in the fourth and fifth years, and they pound \ntheir chest in great praise of themselves: Oh, we reduced the deficit \nto $500 billion. We have reduced it by half or three-fourths or \nwhatever they want to claim. That is a little hard to sell to anyone \nwith any common sense. When the deficit is run up to $1.8 trillion or \n$2 trillion and then brought down to $500 billion, that is not moving \nforward, folks; that is taking six steps back and one step forward and \nclaiming that we are moving forward. We are still going backwards.\n  This budget goes backwards at an atrocious rate. It goes backwards at \nan atrocious rate, and it doesn't even tell us how much it goes \nbackwards because they hide so much of their spending and their costs \nunderneath the rug.\n  In the area, for example, of the doctor fix--we all know around here \nwhat the doctor fix is. The doctors in this country get reimbursed \nunder Medicare, but we have this stupid, arcane rule around here which \nevery year cuts the doctors' reimbursements by some amount, and now it \nis up to 20 percent. So every year we have to fix that. It is an \nexpensive fix, but we do it every year, so we know we are going to \nspend that money to fix that arcane rule that ends up cutting doctors' \nreimbursements arbitrarily and unfairly.\n  The President's budget accounted for that. They accounted for that \nfix. Does this budget account for that fix? A very small part of that \nfix--a very small part of that fix. They leave out about $50 billion of \nthat fix.\n  In the area of the alternative minimum tax, we know the alternative \nminimum tax wasn't supposed to apply to 20 million Americans; it was \nonly supposed to apply to a small number of Americans who make a huge \namount of money who could avoid paying taxes because they used tax \navoidance mechanisms. But because of the failure to index that system, \nwe now have 20 million Americans who will be subject to the alternative \nminimum tax if we don't fix it every year.\n  So what do we do? Every year we eliminate the application of that tax \nto those 20 million Americans because it was never supposed to be there \nto begin with. But what does this budget do? The President had the \nintegrity to say he was going to do that throughout his budget. They \nwere not going to assume the revenues from the alternative minimum tax \nbecause they knew for a surety that they were not going to get those \nrevenues because every year we repeal that tax that applies to those \nfolks. So what do they do in their budget?\n  Unlike the President, they don't account for all the alternative \nminimum tax. They score some of that revenue to themselves, taking \nadvantage of that revenue. So instead of having the full cost of the \nalternative minimum tax in their bill, they have a small percentage of \nit--not a small percentage of it; about half of the cost accounted for \nin the bill. So they leave out a big number relative to the alternative \nminimum tax--about $70 billion--or about $80 billion, actually.\n\n[[Page S4851]]\n\n  Then the TARP, the President asked for more TARP money. It certainly \nlooks as though, when you listen to all of these things coming out of \nthe White House, that they are going to need more TARP money. They put \nthat TARP money in his budget; they leave it out. No, no TARP money. \nWell, maybe arguably they will not step up when the President asks them \nto and finance the issue of how we maintain our financial stability as \na country relative to our financial system, but I suspect if the \nPresident asks for TARP, it will be allocated, and they should have \nscored it. At least the President did that.\n  Budgeting for disasters: We know we have disasters. The President \nknows we are going to have disasters. It appears the House Democrats \nand the Senate Democrats don't know we have disasters, or if they do, \nthey decided not to budget for them because they left those numbers out \nin order to get to a better number on their deficit figure.\n  Health care reform: We know we are going to get health care reform. \nWe are going to get it through reconciliation probably. They are going \nto ram it down the throats of this Congress. It is going to be their \nbill, and we know their bill scores at $1.2 trillion over 10 years. \nThat is how it scores. The President had the integrity to say he would \nput half of that in here. He put in $650 billion of that cost into his \nbudget. Does it appear anywhere? No, it doesn't. The Democrats in the \nHouse and in the Senate, they are not going to pay for health care at \nall. They put in this euphemism of a reserve fund that claims they are \ngoing to pay for it, when we know that is about as likely as their use \nof pay-go to enforce any spending around here.\n  The Make Work Pay tax credit, one of the premier items of the \nPresident, remember; we hear so much about how there is not going to be \na tax increase on working Americans. Well, let's point out the fact \nthat working Americans are going to get hammered pretty hard under this \nbill in the area of tax increases. First, they are going to get hit \nwith a carbon tax, and a carbon tax is essentially a national sales tax \non the production of electricity and the use of electricity. So if \nsomeone uses electricity in their home and turns on their light switch, \nthey are going to get hit with a carbon tax.\n\n  The estimates of that tax are huge--huge. MIT did a study and said it \nis $300 billion a year, massive numbers. It is $3,000 per household if \nwe take that study and just divide the number of households into the \ncost of the study. But independent of that tax, which doesn't appear \nanywhere in this budget, by the way, other than the fact that we know \nit is coming through some reserve fund, alleged reserve fund--they wipe \nout the President's Make Work Pay tax credit which he asked to be \nextended. They assume it would not be extended. Why? They know it is \ngoing to be extended because if the President tells them to extend it, \nthey are going to extend it.\n  Why do they not put it in here? They don't put it in because they \nwant to make their bottom line look better--look better. Then they \nactually skim down the middle-class tax relief. They have already \nscored the fact that they are going to tax wealthy Americans--alleged \nwealthy Americans--people making more than $250,000. They have already \nscored that and taken in that money.\n  Remember, most of those people, the vast majority of those people, \nare basically running a small business, and when we raise their taxes, \nwhat can't they do? They can't expand their small business. They can't \nadd jobs. They are the engine of jobs in this country, by the way. So \nthey are going to tax them, take their money away from them, put it \ninto the Government, expand the size of the Government on the \nallegation that the Government can create prosperity, not small \nbusiness.\n  Small business doesn't create prosperity as far as our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle are concerned. No, no, they tax them. No, \nit is the Government that creates prosperity, so let's take more money \nfrom small business, move it over here and give it to the Government, \nand we will create prosperity for Americans.\n  Well, tell that to the person who is running the restaurant or \nrunning the garage or has a little software company who would like to \nuse his money or her money in order to reinvest it so they can actually \nhire some more people and actually produce some value in this society, \nversus expanding the Government and creating more consultants and more \npeople who are out there spending money in a very inefficient way, for \nthe most part. But that is their policy. They won the election. Fine. \nBut in winning the election, they also said they weren't going to tax \nmiddle Americans.\n  Well, look at the document. There is $180 billion of taxes on middle-\nincome Americans which they do not define from where it comes. They \nsimply say it is there. It is in there somewhere. Well, somebody is \ngoing to have to pay it. I think it is pretty safe to say it is going \nto be working Americans who are going to have to pay that $180 billion.\n  Why did they raise those taxes on working Americans? Why did they go \nback on their campaign promises, both in the Make Work Pay area and in \nthe taxing working Americans? Well, they did it so they could make \ntheir bottom line number look better than the President's. At least the \nPresident had integrity. He had honesty. He came to us and said: I am \ngoing to extend Make Work Pay. I am going to have a middle-class tax \ncut. The other side of the aisle, the Democrats in the House and the \nSenate don't play by those rules. They play by the old rules of let's \nobfuscate, hide, sequester money and make it look as if we are saving \nmoney when we absolutely know for sure the spending is misrepresented \nin the bill and the taxes are misrepresented in the bill.\n  Then they have the temerity to use the phony 920 number. We all know \n920 is a phony number. This is an account we set up, and when we claim \nsavings, we put things into 920. In other words, I am going to increase \nspending on the XYZ program because I like XYZ. Well, where do I get \nthe money for that if I am going to try to stay revenue neutral? I am \ngoing to get it out of account 920. I am going to spend $40 billion on \nthe XYZ program and the offset is going to be account 920. Account 920 \nis an account that for all intents and purposes leads to a cut around \nhere. It never leads to anything. It is not specific. It should come \nout of all accounts. It never happens, but they were a little off in \nthe numbers they wanted to get to, so they did a 920 account in their \nbudget to the tune of, I think, $40 billion or more--$48 billion.\n  All of that added up, and their real number, their real deficit \nnumbers--the numbers that the President actually had, ironically--come \nout pretty close to the same. If we put back in all the stuff they have \nhidden under the rug, all the stuff they claimed they are not going to \ndo, which we know they are going to do, we come back to deficit numbers \nwhich are almost exactly what the President's deficit numbers are.\n  There is no $500 billion deficit in the fifth year; it is $924 \nbillion--if you put back in what they have hidden, claimed, obfuscated, \nmanipulated, and generally tried to play games with around here.\n  So the President's numbers were accurate. He deserves credit for \nthat. But this budget is a fraud on its baseline numbers. The reason \nthis is important, besides the fact that there is actually $400 billion \nof spending almost every year that is not accounted for in this budget, \nis that the deficit, at these numbers, is around 5 percent of GDP. A \ndeficit of around 5 percent of GDP and a public debt of around 80 \npercent of GDP leads you to being a country that is essentially \nunsustainable in its fiscal policy. It leads to a nation where the \ndollar loses its value, where our debt cannot be sold, where inflation \nis rampant, tax policy is basically so heavy that productivity is \nsignificantly stifled. They want to hide that number. At least the \nPresident had the integrity to admit that. The House and Senate \nDemocrats have tried to hide that.\n  There is one other point that needs to be made here, because of the \nfoolishness of the statements about how they are going to reinstitute a \nreal pay-go. You know, I understand that the Blue Dog Democrats on the \nHouse side come from districts where their people expect them to be \nfiscally responsible. They have gotten on this banner of pay-go. They \nsay we are going to assert pay-go. That will be the rules that guide \nus, and we will make sure all the\n\n[[Page S4852]]\n\nspending is paid for and the tax cuts are paid for. That is called pay-\ngo. They say that as a mantra, to the point where it has become a term \nof art that implies you are fiscally responsible.\n  Look at this budget. My colleagues on the House side, who are Blue \nDogs, claim to wrap themselves in the banner of pay-go, but they have \nno banner on their pole. There is no pay-go in this bill that will have \na significant impact. In fact, the budget passed by the House and \nSenate put in place policies that would obfuscate pay-go to the tune of \napproximately $2.4 trillion. So on the face of this, they have ignored \npay-go in their own budget. The ultimate insult is that the most \nsignificant public policy event we are going to do, probably in the \nterm of anybody in this Congress, going back to the beginning of Robert \nC. Byrd's term, forward to the end of probably the youngest Member of \nthe Congress who is serving today's term, which is the issue of \nrewriting the health care system of this country--17 percent of our \nGDP--the single most significant public policy event we will ever \nundertake--affecting every American everywhere, at all different \nlevels, they formally, by law, waive pay-go in this bill for that \nexercise.\n  The Blue Dog Democrats in the House say we have the pay-go \nprotection. Nobody who is being forthright with their constituents \nshould go out and claim that pay-go is going to be a disciplining \nevent. It isn't, hasn't been, and will not be--especially on the most \nsignificant issue we confront, which is the question of health care \nreform.\n  We have already talked, of course, about reconciliation and the \naffront that is to the Senate procedures and the constitutional role of \nthe Senate. But it should be noted that using reconciliation also \ncreates the situation where you can run through a massive tax increase, \nsuch as the carbon tax, and use it to pay for health care reform. Don't \nthink that that is not being considered around here. Assuming that \nreconciliation won't be used in that area is an optimistic projection, \nbecause the majority leader has already said publicly that--and I am \nparaphrasing--isn't it interesting that the revenues from the carbon \ntax, or the national sales tax, light switch tax, pretty much is what \nwe need in order to do the first few years of the health care bill as \nwe see it.\n  So offsetting those two has obviously been an idea that has presented \nitself to the majority leader, and he wields significant authority \nhere. He was able to keep reconciliation in over the objections of our \nchairman, allegedly, so I know he is powerful, because the chairman is \nextraordinarily powerful. When two powerful forces meet, if one of them \nsurvives, we know that one is really powerful. We know the majority \nleader is really powerful because he was more powerful than the \nchairman on the issue of reconciliation. So that is serious. We could \nuse the carbon tax to pay for the health care, which is possible. I am \nnot saying it is going to happen, but it is possible while using \nreconciliation.\n  That brings me back to my closing point, which I want to reiterate. \nIt is about debt. It is about the fact that when this is all said and \ndone, when all the smoke has risen, there will still be burning a \nmassive explosion of Federal debt, an explosion so large, increases so \ndramatic, that I don't see any way out from under it with this budget. \nI am so concerned about where this takes our opportunities as a Nation. \nWhen you pass on--and it is not that far away because we are talking \n2013, 2014, when we start getting big numbers. When you pass on a \ndeficit of 4 to 5 percent of GDP, a debt of 60 to 80 percent GDP, where \ndo we go as a Nation? Let's think about that for a minute. How does a \nnation get out from underneath that? Doesn't the world start to look at \nus and say, my God, has America lost its way? Is it no longer capable \nof disciplining itself and living in a responsible manner? When they \nsay that about us, where does our Nation end up? Where do we leave our \nchildren?\n  It is a serious issue. Yet it is right here, and this budget is the \npoint. If we pass this budget in its present form, with the outyear \nspending and outyear debt, I don't know how we get out from behind it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mrs. Hagan). The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Madam President, I found the presentation of my \ncolleague, for whom I have great respect--but on this presentation I \nfound it highly entertaining, and it bears almost no relationship to \nthe document that is at the desk.\n  It is very interesting, if you read the charts that the Senator \npresented, they all relate to the President's budget. You notice they \ndon't relate to the budget that is before us. The fact is that we made \nsignificant changes in the President's budget, because after the \nPresident presented his budget, we learned in the Congressional Budget \nforecast that we were losing $2 trillion of revenue because of the \neconomic slowdown over the next 10 years. So we made a series of very \nsignificant adjustments to respond to that reality.\n  In fact, over 5 years alone, we changed the Obama budget by $555 \nbillion. Not one dime of that was reflected in the Senator's charts. \nThey say if you are a lawyer and if you have the facts, argue the \nfacts; if you have the law, argue the law; if you have neither, attack \nyour opponent. That is what we have heard. They don't have the facts, \nthey don't have the law, and they certainly are not talking about the \nlegislation before us; so they launched an ad hominem attack.\n  Let me go back to the facts, because they are stubborn things. On \nspending, let's be clear. This budget takes domestic discretionary \nspending, as a percentage of GDP, from 4.4 percent in 2010 to 3.4 \npercent in 2014. That is not a big spending budget; that is a tough \nbudget that reduces the share of our national economy going to Federal \ndomestic discretionary spending. On nondefense discretionary spending, \nin dollar terms, over the 5 years of the budget, the spending is \nincreased, on average, by 2.9 percent a year. That is less than the \ngrowth in national income. That is why the share of domestic \ndiscretionary spending as a part of our economy is going down under \nthis budget.\n  The Senator said that somehow there is a $180 billion tax increase in \nthis budget. Where? I mean, he made this same assertion last year. He \nsaid the budget last year was going to increase taxes. What happened \nwith last year's budget? Did it increase taxes? No. It cut taxes by \nhundreds of billions of dollars. That is what this budget does. This \nbudget cuts taxes, on balance, over 5 years by $764 billion. That is a \nfact. That is not made up for the convenience of a political debate. \nThat is a fact. Taxes are cut under this budget $764 billion.\n  On reconciliation, I must say the speech by the Senator is beyond the \npale. He acts as though reconciliation is against the Constitution of \nthe United States. Well, it is interesting what he had to say when the \nshoe was on the other foot. When the shoe was on the other foot in \n2001, and he wanted to use reconciliation, what did the Senator say \nthen? Unfortunately for the credibility of his speech here, we have the \nRecord. We know what he said then. Here is what he said then:\n\n       Reconciliation is a rule of the Senate, set up under the \n     Budget Act. It has been used before for purposes exactly like \n     this on numerous occasions. The fact is, all this rule of the \n     Senate does is allow a majority of the Senate to take a \n     position and pass a piece of legislation, support that \n     position. Is there something wrong with majority rules? I \n     don't think so.\n\n  So when they wanted to use reconciliation, it was a rule of the \nSenate, and it simply allowed the majority to work their will, and \nthere was nothing wrong with it. Now when we have a reconciliation \ninstruction as a backup, as an insurance policy, now it is somehow \nagainst the Constitution. Please. That is not going to stand up against \nthe Senator's own record. The fact is that reconciliation has been used \n19 times--13 by the party on the opposite side. I didn't hear and see \ncrocodile tears from them about how it threatened the Constitution. In \nfact, the Senator described it then as a simple Senate rule that \nallowed the majority to rule.\n  I take great offense to the suggestion that this budget is made up. \nThis budget is not made up. It is scored by the CBO, which is \nnonpartisan. This budget does precisely what I have presented it as \ndoing. It reduces the deficit by two-thirds over 5 years. As a share of \nGDP, it cuts the deficit by three quarters. The Senator says, you have \nhidden the doc fix, which is this. We know doctors\n\n[[Page S4853]]\n\nwho treat Medicare patients are scheduled to take major reductions. We \nhave not hidden a thing. We have said that, after 2 years, fixing the \ndownward spiral on doctors' reimbursement for those who treat Medicare \npatients will have to be paid for. That is not hidden; that is very \nclear, direct, and it is what we should be doing here--paying for \nthings.\n  When we found we were in a circumstance in which we had $2 trillion \nless than the President had to write a budget, we had to make changes, \nand we did. We made responsible changes. One of the changes we made was \nto say that, no, doctors should not be cut. We will provide the money \nin this budget for the next 2 years so they are not cut. But after \nthat, additional fixes would have to be paid for. That is what we have \nto start doing around here--paying for things.\n  And there is the alternative minimum tax. We have said in this \nresolution that the alternative minimum tax should not be imposed on \nanybody, and for the next 3 years it can be done without offsets, \nwithout paying for it, because we don't want to raise taxes during a \ntime of economic downturn. But after the 3 years, further moves to \nprevent the AMT from being imposed have to be paid for.\n  The same is true on TARP funding. The Senator said we excluded TARP \nfunding. Yes, we did because we could not pass $250 billion of TARP \nfunding after the way TARP has been handled in the first round. It \nwould not pass. The President said put it in as an insurance policy. He \ndoes not have a specific proposal before us, in any event. But we did \nnot include it here because it could not pass this body.\n  On health care, the Senator suggests this is going to add $1 trillion \nto the debt. Not under this budget. Again, he failed to read the \ndocument. It makes very clear, if we are going to have health care \nreform, it has to be paid for. The reserve fund he kind of glossed over \nis very specific. I can only change the allocations to committees if \nthe issue is paid for. I have no authority to change the allocation to \ncommittees unless health care reform is paid for.\n  On Make Work Pay, the President's middle-class tax cut, in addition \nto all the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts that are all included in this budget, \nover $500 billion of tax cuts for the middle class that are in this \nbudget, the President's middle-class tax cuts that are over and above \nthose that were included in 2001 and 2003, the so-called ``make work \npay'' provisions, they are already provided for in the stimulus \npackage. That is already the law for the next 2 years. If it is to be \nextended, this budget says we have to pay for it. That is exactly what \nwe are going to have to do to bring the deficit down. We are going to \nhave to start paying for things.\n  There are so many things that were said that are in error about this \nbudget, it is breathtaking.\n  I wish to conclude on this note. If this budget is so bad, why didn't \nthe Senator offer an alternative? In 2001, when I thought the Bush \nbudget was fatally flawed, I offered an alternative on the floor of \nthis body. This year, the Senator has offered no alternative. All he \noffers is complaints and misrepresentations and a rewriting of history.\n  The debt is on an unsustainable course. Why? Because the previous \nadministration doubled the debt, tripled foreign holdings of U.S. debt, \nand put us on a course in which we face the worst recession since the \nGreat Depression. That is why the debt is burgeoning. It is not as a \nresult of this budget document. This budget document moves the deficit \ndown, reduces it by two-thirds over the next 5 years.\n  We inherited a colossal mess--colossal. To suggest this President is \nresponsible for this colossal mess after he has been in office 100 days \ndoes not stand the test of truth and will not stand any scrutiny. We \nall know how we got to where we are. The previous administration \ndoubled the debt of the country at a time when the economy was \nrelatively good. Unfortunately, when they left office, the economy was \nin the worst shape in 60 years. History will not treat the previous \nadministration and their supporters on the Hill gently or kindly \nbecause they put us in this ditch. The President is seeking to lift us \nout of it.\n  I thank the Chair and yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair lays before the Senate the following \nmessage from the House of Representatives, which the clerk will report.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read as follows:\n\n       The committee of conference on the disagreeing votes of the \n     two Houses on the amendment of the House to the concurrent \n     resolution (S. Con. Res. 13), setting forth the congressional \n     budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2010, \n     revising the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal year \n     2009, and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for \n     fiscal years 2011 through 2014, having met, after full and \n     free conference, have agreed to recommend and do recommend to \n     their respective Houses this report, signed by a majority of \n     conferees.\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senate will proceed to the consideration \nof the conference report.\n  (The conference report is printed in today's Record in the \nproceedings of the House.)\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Kentucky.\n  Mr. BUNNING. Madam President, I rise to discuss the conference report \non the fiscal year 2010 budget. Unfortunately, I will not be able to \nsupport this legislation. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee \nsince I have been in the Senate, I spoke on this budget during the \ncommittee consideration, and I also spoke on it while it was on the \nSenate floor. I was unable to support it those two times, and I am \ndisappointed to say I will not be able to support it here either.\n  Today marks the 100th day of the Obama administration. It is still \ntoo early to see most of the effects the different pieces of \nlegislation the President has signed into law will have on America. \nHowever, we do know one thing: It sure has cost a lot.\n  The price tag for the so-called stimulus bill was over $1 trillion, \nif you include the interest. The cost of the Omnibus appropriations \nbill was about $410 billion. What does this mean? It means that over \nthese first 100 days, President Obama has spent an average of $12 \nbillion a day. That is a staggering rate of spending. We cannot \ncontinue to manage our Nation's finances like this.\n  The budget proposed by the Obama administration several weeks ago is \nno more responsible than these other bills. It spends too much, it \ntaxes too much, and it borrows much too much.\n  I have mentioned these numbers before, but they are worth repeating. \nThe President's proposal will double the publicly held national debt to \nmore than $15 trillion. Annual spending would leap from $24,000 per \nhousehold to $32,000. This plan would also raise taxes by $1.4 trillion \nover 10 years.\n  Those are not my numbers. I didn't make them up. The people hired by \nthe Democrats, the Congressional Budget Office, picked by Senator Reid, \nSpeaker Pelosi and one member of the Finance Committee and one member \nof the Ways and Means Committee, Senator Baucus and Congressman \nRangel--those are the people who picked CBO's Director, and those are \nhis numbers.\n  The increase in debt is also staggering. The President's proposal \nwould double the debt held by the public in 5 years and nearly triple \nit over 10. In fact, the proposal would create more debt under every \nprevious President from George Washington to include George W. Bush.\n  I know today we are not voting on the Obama proposal. However, I \nstill think it is completely reasonable to discuss it. This proposal \ngives us a great insight into how President Obama views Government. We \nsee he wants to greatly expand it. He also no longer is a member of the \nlegislative branch. However, he is the leader of the party that \ncontrols the legislative branch. We know he will have influence on how \nlegislation is written.\n  One of the most troubling aspects of the document before us is the \ninclusion of reconciliation instructions for health care and education \nlegislation. I don't want to talk about arcane Senate procedure today. \nHowever, this is an abuse of the process. Reconciliation is supposed to \nbe used to return money to the taxpayers and the Treasury. It makes \nlegislation that accomplishes this much easier to pass. These \ninstructions require a total savings of $2 billion. This is absurd \nbecause we know health care reform and education legislation will cost \nmuch more than $2 billion. In fact, as we know from the numbers I \nmentioned above, the administration has spent $2 billion every 4\n\n[[Page S4854]]\n\nhours or so. This will not be any kind of significant deficit \nreduction.\n  Another worrying feature of this budget is the assault on small \nbusinesses. President Obama admits that 70 percent of job growth will \ncome from small businesses. So why does this budget tax them out of \nexistence?\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle claim they are only \nraising taxes on a handful of small businesses, but they ignore the \nfact that they are hurting the businesses that are responsible for two-\nthirds of small business jobs. Small business jobs are key to our \neconomic recovery. But look at what the failed policies of this \nCongress have done for small businesses.\n  The so-called stimulus bill that added over $1 trillion to our \nnational debt spends less than one-half of 1 percent--one-half of 1 \npercent--on small businesses. Also, after mortgaging our future on the \nTARP bailout, 70 percent of the large banks have actually decreased \ntheir small business lending. Now these small businesses that have been \ndevastated by the economy and cannot get a loan to make payroll are \ngoing to be hit with a massive tax increase. How are these small \nbusiness owners going to be able to hire even one more worker? This \nbudget is an assault on small businesses. It taxes too much, and it \nshould be defeated.\n  I would like to mention energy policy before I conclude my remarks. \nThroughout this year's budget debate, we have talked a lot about \nenergy, particularly a proposed cap-and-trade tax proposal. At a time \nwhen our Nation's energy needs are continuing to grow, we should turn \nour focus on how best to meet those needs while creating jobs instead \nof taxing American families. If we act too rapidly by imposing carbon \ntaxes, all Americans will pay the cost through dramatic increases in \nutility prices. If enacted, a cap-and-trade revenue program would \ninstitute one of the largest tax increases in American history. Every \nAmerican will pay a sales tax whenever they turn the light switch on or \nstart their car. This tax will be untargeted and regressive. Even our \npoorest citizens will be hit by this tax. This is a dangerous policy, \nand I am startled by how much support it has received from this current \nadministration.\n  So much for the President's promise not to tax anyone making less \nthan $250,000 per year. Maybe that is because he knows he needs more \nmoney than he can raise by taxing just the rich to pay for all of his \nplans to make Government even a bigger part of ordinary Americans' \nlives.\n  As I have outlined above, this budget has some problems. It spends \ntoo much, it taxes too much, and it borrows too much. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in support of fiscal responsibility by voting \nagainst this piece of legislation.\n\n  Madam President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Nebraska.\n  Mr. JOHANNS. Madam President, I rise today to express my extreme \ndisappointment in the outcome of the conference report, specifically \nthe blatant disregard of the will of a bipartisan majority of this \nSenate. Madam President, 67 Members--67 of us--spoke with one voice in \nopposition to allowing cap-and-trade legislation to be slipped into the \nlaw in a way that stifles amendments and debate.\n  Almost 70 of us spoke, again in a very bipartisan voice, to instruct \nthe budget conferees to include our amendment in their report to ensure \nthat the bright light of transparency shines on cap-and-trade \nlegislation. Yet that very amendment, supported by 67 Senators, is \nnowhere to be found in the conference report. So the door has been \nreopened to pass sweeping cap-and-trade legislation with a simple \nmajority.\n  The Budget Committee leadership did include report language about \nclimate change, but it really has no meaning. The sentence in the \nconference report states:\n\n       It is assumed that reconciliation will not be used for \n     changes in legislation related to global climate change.\n\n  In reality, this statement is not worth the paper on which it is \nwritten. This assumption is made by people who don't have any control \nover the process. Frankly, the Budget Committee can assume whatever it \nwants, but the truth is that the majority leadership can roll them at \nany time.\n  And then what is our recourse? Well, there is none. This Budget \nCommittee assumption has no teeth whatsoever. It is simply a nice \nplatitude to try to lull us to sleep.\n  Certainly you can understand my skepticism. Sixty-seven Senators \nsupported an amendment that had real enforcement teeth to shield the \nAmerican people from being railroaded in the dead of night. It would \nhave ensured open debate and the opportunity to offer amendments on the \nSenate floor. Yet when the conference agreement returned, the amendment \nhad been stripped from the budget resolution to ensure it appears \nnowhere--nowhere in black and white.\n  So today we must be on our guard again. Some might suggest we relax \nbecause there are no reconciliation instructions entitled ``cap and \ntrade.'' In fact, some will argue that because there are no \ninstructions from the Senate for the Committee on Environment and \nPublic Works at all, so there is no need to worry; case closed.\n  Don't fall for it. Remember, the House Energy and Commerce Committee \nhas reconciliation instructions in the final resolution. So the House \ncould easily use these instructions to enact cap and trade. They could \ngenerate over $1 trillion for nationalized health care or really for \nany other initiative. They could go to the conference, and then, \npresto, cap and trade emerges from the conference with not a single \nSenate amendment offered and only 10 hours of debate on the Senate \nfloor.\n  Consider this: A hard-working American on the night shift could \nliterally go to bed after a long night's work and wake up to find cap \nand trade is the law of the land. What a rude awakening that would be: \nhis family facing a new $3,000 tax and his job in jeopardy of moving \noverseas where no carbon tax exists. And let's not be fooled. There \nwill be tremendous pressure on the committee to follow this exact path.\n  Many will want to avoid such inconveniences as consultation with the \nAmerican people. After all, these discussions would be very \nuncomfortable. Who would want the very unpleasant job of explaining to \nthe American people that they are going to be taxed every time they \nturn on a light switch or start the washing machine or throw clothes \ninto the dryer? I can see why some think it would be easier just to \nslip the legislation through with no transparency.\n  It is not just cap and trade that could become the law of the land \nwithout a robust debate. Budget reconciliation could be used to pass \nuniversal health care. Some describe this as an insurance policy. \nInsurance policy for what? Don't the American people, through their \nelected representatives, have a right to use Senate procedure to \nexamine this very important change?\n  My point is this: Many have risen over the years to speak against \nreconciliation to pass complex legislation. Budget reconciliation is \nsimply ill-suited to pass difficult, comprehensive legislation such as \ncap and trade or health care.\n  Well, what has happened is this: By mixing complex policy questions \nwith budget reconciliation instructions and the Byrd rule, you get a \nwitch's brew. The result is a bizarre set of rules. You could literally \nhave a situation where a high bar would be set--a 60-vote requirement--\nto pass very noncontroversial, budget-neutral health care provisions, \nand yet--listen to this odd result--major overhaul provisions which \ncost hundreds of billions of dollars would need just a simple majority. \nWe have reduced the Senate to not the deliberative body but a body \nwhere literally we get around the rules.\n  And that is where we will be. Some simple sections of the health care \nbill will require 60 votes, while the tax increases and the extravagant \nspending provisions within the same bill will require a simple \nmajority. I challenge any Member to come to the floor and explain to me \nwhy that makes any sense. How unfortunate. It certainly is no way to \nlegislate. It is not what I planned on when I came to the Senate. This \nsituation will make a mockery of the work we do on this floor.\n  Allowing only 20 hours of debate on this extremely complex issue will \nresult in very piecemeal policies with glaring weaknesses. Eventually, \nthe American people will catch up with this and say: What were you \nthinking?\n  I am not interested in a band-aid solution. I am not interested in \nplaying politics with such an important issue. It is a game changer. I \nam interested in\n\n[[Page S4855]]\n\nbeing thoughtful and careful about our approach to such important \npolicy--legislation that will affect the lives of virtually every \nsingle American.\n  The budget rules were never intended to expand Government programs or \nto be the catalyst for major policy implementation. The American people \ndeserve better than the course this budget resolution is charting.\n  I will also say that I don't believe I was elected to come here and \nassign blame. Let's just follow our rules, starting today, and bring \ntransparency to these complex issues. Debate them, amend them, then \ncast our vote.\n  I urge all Americans to pay close attention because I think we are on \na dangerous course. There is troubling potential for health care reform \nand climate legislation to constitute the largest tax increase ever \nwitnessed in the history of this country. I ask the American people \ntoday, therefore, in view of where we seem to be headed, to be \nvigilant. They have to demand honesty. They must demand transparency. \nAnd demand that those in Washington remember the principles of \ndemocracy and remember why we were sent here--to have great debates, to \nfollow our rules, to amend where we can, and then to cast our vote. \nUnfortunately, this budget resolution takes us on a different course.\n  Madam President, I yield the floor, and because I don't see anyone \nelse queued up, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, I ask unanimous consent that the order \nfor the quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. Madam President, could you inform me when 10 minutes has \nexpired?\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Chair will do so.\n  Mr. GRAHAM. I thank the Chair.\n  I rise today to speak about the budget and the debate we are having \nin the Senate about the budget. Quite frankly, if you asked me to give \na scenario that would best explain what a politician thinks about life \nand politics, I would say: Let them write a budget. When you give a \npolitical leader the opportunity to sit down and spend money coming \nfrom the taxpayer, it tells you a lot about their priorities, it tells \nyou a lot about how they view the role of Government. And I am here to \nsay that this budget is not good news for the American taxpayer.\n  Today marks the anniversary of the President's first 100 days, and I \nthink the biggest accomplishment in the first 100 is a budget that is \ntransformational in terms of how it transforms the country in a way \nthat I don't think is healthy.\n  The one thing we have had going for us as Americans, from one \ngeneration to the next, is the hope and belief that the ones to \nfollow--our kids and grandkids--would have a chance to do better; that \nwe would do what is right and what is necessary on our watch so they \nwould have a chance to do better. If this budget passes, you are going \nto have a hard time looking the next generation of Americans in the eye \nand saying: You are going to have a chance to do better than people \nalive here today.\n  What this budget does is it doubles the national debt. President \nObama's proposal, a 10-year budget--I will give him credit for making \nit a 10-year window--triples the national debt. This budget creates \nmore debt for America in the first 100 days of the Obama administration \nthan every President since George Washington combined. We have spent, \nin the first 100 days, $12 billion a day. We are running up the deficit \nand the debt at an alarming rate, and we are growing the size of the \nGovernment in a way that future generations are going to have to pay \nfor.\n  The question for the country, if this budget passes, is this: Are we \ncreating a government that is sustainable by the next generation? Can \nthe next generation, with this budget in place, have a chance of doing \nbetter than we have? I don't think so. I really don't. And I never \nthought I would hear myself say that.\n  As we look down the road, we see how the budget explodes the national \ndebt and the deficit--67 percent of the debt held by the public as a \npercentage of GDP. That is what happens under the Obama budget in 2014. \nThis is a 5-year budget, and we have ignored some of the things we know \nwe are going to do to make the numbers look better because the \nPresident's budget was so large and so unnerving in terms of long-term \nindebtedness.\n  The worst that Bush did--and we did not do a good job on our watch as \nRepublicans--was to have a $500 billion deficit.\n  The best this budget does, 10 years from now, is about $600 billion, \nand we sustain trillion-dollar deficits for several years. But the \npercentage of publicly held debt relative to GDP, gross domestic \nproduct, is going to be 67 percent down the road. That is Third World \nnation status.\n  The budget is a 5-year budget. The numbers look better, but we have \nnot done anything to fix the doctor reimbursement problem, the last 2 \nyears of the AMT fix are not included, and we are expanding the Make \nWork Pay tax credit. What we have done is mask the real cost of what we \nknow is going to be there after 5 years.\n  The budget that was proposed by the President triples the national \ndebt and increases taxes by $1 trillion on people who make over \n$250,000 a year. That may sound good because I don't make $250,00 a \nyear. Maybe 2 or 3 years of my entire life I have. I am the first \nperson in my family to go to college. My dad and mom owned a liquor \nstore. We had a middle-class lifestyle at best, but we were happy. I \nnever looked across the street at the person who owned the big business \nin town and had the nice house as my enemy. They are not.\n  In a recession and a global economy that is on its knees, if we start \nraising taxes on American business people, they are going to look to \ntake their business somewhere else. To go from 35 percent to 39.5 \npercent on people who earn over $250,000 is in theory more money for \nthe Government, but it is less money for the people who have taken a \nhuge risk to create a business. The day we start punishing people and \nrewarding the Government for the risks they take is the day America \ngets off track.\n  Raising the capital gains rates, as this budget does, from 15 to 20 \npercent, will make it less likely that people will engage in \nentrepreneurial activity. But one thing John Kennedy understood is, low \ntax rates generate business activities that actually generate more \nmoney for the Government. So what we are doing is raising taxes, and we \nare playing class warfare.\n  The defense spending in President Obama's budget over a 10-year \nperiod went to 3 percent of gross domestic product. It is about 4.5 or \n4.6 percent now. That would put us on the low end, in the Nation's \nhistory, for defense spending. So liberals raise taxes, and they cut \ndefense at a time when I think we can't afford to do either.\n  The world, to me, in the next 10 years is not going to be safer \nunless we act. Iran and North Korea are pursuing nuclear programs that \ncould jeopardize our lives as we know it. The one thing I can tell you \nabout Iraq and Afghanistan, we made plenty of mistakes, but we have the \nbest trained, best equipped military in the world, and that really does \nmatter. We are going to win in Iraq if we continue the course we are \non, and we are going to turn Afghanistan around, but it is going to \ntake blood and treasure.\n  The one thing I am not looking for from an American perspective is a \nfair fight. When we go to war--and sometimes that is required to \nprotect the national interest--we need to go to win, and we need to \noverwhelm the enemy. We need to have technology they do not. We need to \nhave more troops than they do. We need to have equipment that can \ndestroy their equipment without destroying our people. That requires \ninvestment. The whole world is reducing their defense budgets.\n  Our NATO allies spend less on defense combined than we do. Like it or \nnot, we are the arsenal of democracy, and now is not the time to reduce \nthe arsenal and to be cheap on defense and grow the domestic side of \nGovernment. We need butter and we need guns, but let me tell you right \nnow we need a lot of guns in the world we are about to inherit in the \nnext 10 years.\n  Finally, the increase in domestic spending puts the country on an\n\n[[Page S4856]]\n\nunsustainable path, and the next generation is going to have to pay for \nthis big government. To pay for it we are going to have to raise their \ntaxes. To make it all work we are cutting defense.\n  There is a better way. Let's keep taxes competitive and as low as \npossible, realizing we have a government to run. Let's spend wisely. \nLet's reform health care so the Government doesn't become the one group \nin the country that decides what doctor we can see and what the doctor \nmakes and what kind of treatment we get.\n  This climate change issue is real, in my opinion. I think manmade \nemissions, CO2 emissions, are heating up the planet. In the \nPresident's budget he was going to put a $646 billion cap-and-trade tax \non industry and American consumers--$3,100 per family--at a time when \nwe could ill afford it. That was taken out of the budget. That is good \nnews. But what I am trying to say to my Democratic colleagues is, this \nis your Government now. You run this place. The problems in the past, \nthe mistakes made by Republicans are real. You don't fix those mistakes \nby spending more money than we did. You don't fix the problems that \nAmerica faces for the next generation by growing the Government at a \npace and a level you can't pay for down the road unless you have to \ngive up some of your hopes and dreams.\n  There is a role for Government. There is a role for us in health \ncare. There is a role for us to play in the economy of our times: to \nhelp business and to be a safety net for those who have lost their \njobs. But we are about to pass a budget that will increase the national \ndebt, double what we have today. There will be a day in 2014 when we \nwill spend more money paying the interest on the national debt than the \nentire Defense Department budget. That is not healthy for this country.\n  We have done nothing to reform Medicare or Social Security. We are \ntalking about $1 trillion more in spending on health care when we spend \nmore than any nation in the world.\n  We are going to pass this budget. It is my hope the American people \nwill weigh in. The stimulus package was $787 billion of spending--a lot \nof growth in Government and very few jobs created. You need to speak \nout. You need to get involved. You need to tell us all, Republicans and \nDemocrats: I expect you to collect taxes from me. I expect you to offer \nservices to me and my family. But I do not expect you to make it so \nthat my children and my grandchildren cannot have the life I have had. \nI expect you to do what I am doing, tighten your belt and set \npriorities.\n  This is your Government at the end of the day. It is fashionable and \nappropriate to criticize political leadership. But in a democracy, when \nyou look in the mirror, that is ``we the people.'' So for America to \nchange it is going to require Americans to demand it from both of us, \nRepublicans and Democrats. I believe in you. Your Government is \ndysfunctional. It will be made better if you want it to be. There are \npeople here listening. Speak out before it is too late.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from South Dakota.\n  Mr. THUNE. Madam President, I would like to pick up where my \ncolleague from South Carolina left off and talk a little bit about the \nneed to have a budget agreement that reflects the will of the American \npeople, to have Republicans and Democrats both engaged, involved in \nthat, not only in Washington in the Senate but Republicans and \nDemocrats around the country. What we saw in this budget was a certain \nnumber of amendments that were accepted on the floor of the Senate, \nRepublican amendments, all of which were stripped out in the conference \ncommittee with the House--which many of us predicted. But there were \nlots of good amendments that addressed key, core issues.\n  We had amendments that addressed the issue of climate change, which \nthe door is left open to in this budget. We had amendments that \naddressed issues such as the deduction for charitable giving, which was \nan amendment I offered on the Senate floor. It was adopted by a vote of \n94 to 3. That was struck in the conference.\n  We had amendments that were offered that were designed to protect \nthose with incomes less than $250,000 a year from having tax increases \nin the budget. That was an Ensign amendment. That was stripped out. So \nany Republican input or involvement in this budget process was \nnullified by the work of the conference committee, the Democrats who \nled the conference between the House and the Senate. So we are left \nwith a budget that has been sanitized of any of those protections \nagainst higher costs for energy, against higher taxes, and a whole \nrange of other things--protection against losing the deduction that is \navailable to people, the tax benefit available to people for charitable \ngiving, that being stripped away and used to pay for other things.\n\n  The budget essentially now is a Democratic budget. My colleague from \nNorth Dakota was here earlier talking about how these problems were all \ninherited; that the spending all occurred on the past administration's \nwatch and now they are just trying to clean up the mess.\n  I have to point out to my colleagues in the Senate and to the \nAmerican people that there are certain givens I think we all would \nsubscribe to, one being the fact that we did have a $5.8 trillion debt \nat the end of the last administration. Many of us have acknowledged \nthat Republicans didn't do a good enough job when we were in charge of \nkeeping Federal spending under control. But that does not negate the \nfact that in the next 5 years that $5.8 trillion debt is going to \ndouble. In 10 years it is going to triple. In fact, if we go back in \nthe annals of American history, go back starting at the time of the \nRevolutionary War through the last Presidency, that of President George \nBush, from George Washington to George Bush, the accumulated debt over \nthat entire time period will be equaled by the public debt that America \nwill pile up in the next 5 years. It will be tripled in the next 10 \nyears. That is a staggering number.\n  When you start looking at doubling of the public debt in a 5-year \ntimeframe, tripling in 10 years, when at the end of the 10 years we \nhave $7 trillion in debt or 82 percent of our gross domestic product \nthat is composed of publicly held debt, we have not seen that kind of \nnumber since the end of World War II, since 1948.\n  I would daresay, with all due respect to my colleague from North \nDakota who made the point that these are all problems that were passed \non by the previous administration, that it was not the Bush \nadministration that put on the table and passed a trillion-dollar \nstimulus bill. I think it is fair to ask the question, is this trillion \ndollars in stimulus spending going to be carried on and extended and \nconsidered part of the baseline so it will create obligations and \nliabilities for our Government in the future?\n  We talked about $1 trillion on the floor of the Senate that actually, \naccording to the CBO, when asked the question, if the spending in this \nbill is extended and not terminated, how much would it cost, the answer \nwas $3 trillion--with interest, over $3 trillion. That was not a Bush \nadministration policy, nor is the fact that the Omnibus appropriations \nbill that was passed earlier this year, which had an 8.3-percent \nincrease in spending in it, which was more than double the rate of \ninflation in this country, nor does this more recently passed budget--\nis the Bush administration responsible for that? This is the budget \nthat was put forward by the new administration, that was passed in the \nSenate without a Republican vote. It went to conference where any \namendments that were adopted on the floor of the Senate that had been \noffered by Republicans were subsequently stripped out.\n  This budget is a statement of priorities and reflects the spending \nchoices that are made by the new administration and by this Congress. \nSo we cannot blame the past administration for the trillion-dollar \nstimulus which, if those programs are extended in the future, end up \nbeing not $1 trillion but $3 trillion. We cannot blame the past \nadministration for the more than double rate of inflation increase in \nspending in the annual appropriations bills we passed earlier this \nyear, and we cannot blame the past administration for a budget, a $3.6 \ntrillion budget, that increases nondefense discretionary spending by \n8.9 percent this year and piles mountains of debt on future \ngenerations.\n\n[[Page S4857]]\n\n  If we look at the deficits--just the 5-year, which we are limited \nto--earlier, I used some 10-year numbers. But the 5-year numbers on the \ndeficits we are going to accumulate--2009, the current fiscal year, \nalmost $1.7 trillion; 2010, $1.2 trillion; 2013, $916 billion.\n  Incidentally, this year, 2009, as a percentage of GDP, that deficit \nis 12 percent--12 percent of our GDP. The benchmark for getting into \nthe European Union is you cannot have a deficit, as a percentage of \nGDP, that exceeds 3 percent. Some of our European brothers, I assume, \nwith the bad economy, are in excess of that now too, but the point is \nwe are going to have a 12-percent deficit to GDP ratio which is four \ntimes the benchmark for entering the European Union.\n  The debt as a percentage of our GDP, the debt held by the public, \nstarts at 55 percent this year, goes to 61 next year, 64 the year \nafter, 66 the year after that, 67 the year after that--in 2014, 67 \npercent of public debt as a percentage of GDP, and if you extend it out \nfor 10 years, which we saw in the original budget blueprint, we are \ntalking about a debt that is 82 percent of our gross domestic product. \nThat is not something for which the past administration is responsible. \nThese are decisions that have been made by the present administration \nand this Congress when it comes to spending the American taxpayers' \ndollars.\n  So you have a stimulus bill which is a trillion dollars, and then \nagain, as I said earlier, if those programs are extended in the future, \nit ends up being in excess of $3 trillion; you have an Omnibus \nappropriations bill that passed earlier this year that increased at \nmore than twice the rate of inflation and a budget which increases \nnondefense discretionary spending in front of us today by 8.9 percent \nand adds, over the next 5 years, about $5 trillion, $5.5 trillion to \nthe Federal debt. Those are decisions that are being made real-time.\n  A lot of my colleagues on the other side have a sort of Bush \nadministration phobia. They want to talk about everything that has \nhappened before. Well, there comes a point at which you own these \ndecisions. Decisions have consequences, and there are consequences of \nthe decisions that are being made here.\n  A lot of people believe that if we continue this rate of spending and \ntaxing and borrowing, in the future, if we continue to pile up the \ninterest on the debt--again, incidentally, at the end of the 10th year, \nwe will spend more on interest on the debt than we actually spend on \nnational defense, about $4 trillion over the course of the next 10 \nyears in interest on the debt, or $52,000 for every household in \nAmerica. That is just the interest on the debt.\n  A lot of people think the level of borrowing is going to lead \ninevitably to higher inflation down the road and therefore higher \ninterest rates and all kinds of other bad economic outcomes that will \nput this Nation's economy in peril and make it more difficult for us to \nrecover.\n  So if we are going to have a debate here in the Senate about this \nbudget resolution and the conference report that came out, it should be \nabout what is in front of us, not what has happened in the 8 years \nprevious, because this budget is a budget that was presented and \nsubmitted by this administration, adopted by this Congress, adopted \nhere in the Senate without a single Republican vote, then went into \nconference with the House of Representatives where any Republican \namendments which were agreed to on the floor of the Senate, many of \nwhich got big votes: Well, just let them go ahead, vote for this stuff. \nWe do not want to put out bad votes against these good amendments; we \nwill strip them in the conference with the House. So those amendments, \nall of them, were stripped out. So we now have in front of us a budget \nthat includes or makes possible the prospect of a climate change or the \ncarbon tax proposal being done through reconciliation.\n  The Senator from North Dakota put out a statement that says: Assume \nthat reconciliation will not be used for changes in legislation related \nto global climate change. Well, that is really nice, but it is a \nstatement. The amendment that was offered by the Senator from Nebraska, \nMr. Johanns, which was adopted here on the floor of the Senate, which \ngot 67 votes, was binding, basically said that reconciliation would not \nbe used for climate change legislation. It got an overwhelming vote \nhere in the Senate. A lot of Democrats voted for it. It got stripped in \nthe conference committee, which opens the door to a cap-and-tax \nproposal that, by some estimates, could cost the average family in this \ncountry over $3,000 a year in higher electricity costs. That is not a \nprevious administration issue. This is a real-time budget. This is a \nreal-time issue. These are decisions that are being made by the current \nadministration and the current Congress, make no mistake about it.\n  The final point I wish to make is that in the context of this--and \nthey have been coming down and saying: There is really no tax increase \nin this. Well, there is. Taxes are going to go up on a lot of people. \nWell, they may say it is high-income people, but there are a lot of \nsmall businesses that are going to be captured under that net. This is \nnot just going to hit the high-income people because a lot of small \nbusinesses that are organized as LLCs or subchapter S's or in some way \nthat allows the income they derive from their small business to flow \nthrough to their individual tax return are going to pay higher income \ntax rates. Instead of paying at 33 and 35 percent, they are going to \npay at 40 and 42 percent. Taxes are going to go up on capital gains. \nTaxes are going to go up on dividends. There are tax increases in \nthere, there is no question about that, and the American people are \ngoing to find that out very soon.\n  The other thing that did not happen in this budget, in this whole \nsort of pursuit of new Government spending--and there are \nreconciliation instructions in here for health care reform which can be \nvery costly to the economy and which there is no way of paying for in \nthe budget. It is just assumed at that point that they will come up \nwith the revenue source for that. But you have a health care \nreconciliation instruction, a climate tax reconciliation instruction, \nall of which could cost the economy enormous amounts of money, and yet \nnothing was done in the budget to deal with the fundamental issue that \nis driving these deficits and this debt for years and years into the \nfuture, and that is entitlement programs: Social Security, Medicare, \nMedicaid. All of these programs on the mandatory side of the budget \nthat continue to drive Government spending, to drive deficits and drive \ndebts well into the future, there is nothing that is done to reduce the \noverall cost of these mandatory spending programs, these entitlement \nprograms, or to reform them.\n  The President said we need to reform these and look at all of these \nentitlement programs. Well, this budget does nothing of the sort. All \nit does is increase spending, increase taxes, and add mountains and \nmountains to the public debt--a debt that we hand off to future \ngenerations.\n  So I hope my colleagues will reject and vote down this conference \nreport. It would have been better, it would have been a much improved \nproduct had some of the amendments my colleagues on the Republican side \nhad adopted when it was debated here in the Senate been retained in the \nconference committee. But they weren't. They have been struck, all of \nthem struck, many of which passed by large margins. As I said, I had a \ncouple of amendments on the floor, one with 89 votes and another was 94 \nvotes. You would think, when the Senate makes that kind of statement in \nsupport of a particular amendment or policy, you might want to think \nabout retaining that in the conference. Those were struck. The \namendment by my colleague from Nebraska, Senator Johanns, which got 67 \nvotes, which directed the conferees not to use reconciliation for \nclimate change legislation, was struck from the conference report.\n  That is unfortunate. This could have been a better budget. It \nwouldn't have been a good budget because it still spends too much, \ntaxes too much, and borrows too much, but it certainly would have been \nimproved had some of those amendments been retained.\n  So I urge my colleagues to vote against this, and I hope, now that \nthis budget is going to pass here and we start doing appropriations \nbills, that this Congress will get serious about controlling Federal \nspending, about\n\n[[Page S4858]]\n\ndoing the serious work that is necessary to get our fiscal house in \norder. We cannot afford to continue to pass on these mountains and \nmountains of debt to future generations. It is not fair to them, and it \nis not fair to the American taxpayer. It is high time we started \nfocusing on this issue and did something about it.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Washington.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Thank you, Madam President.\n  Let me start by commending Chairman Conrad for his leadership of our \nBudget Committee and especially for the hundreds of hours he and his \nstaff have dedicated to getting this budget done and accommodating both \nthe priorities and concerns of so many of us in this body. Putting \ntogether a budget is never an easy process, but I believe our chairman \nhas achieved a very good balance that will set us on a course both to \nreduce our deficits and invest in the areas we know will make us \nstronger in the future: energy, health care, and education. A budget is \na statement of priorities, and ours are very clearly in this budget. We \nput the middle class first, and we get our country back on track by \ninvesting in our future.\n  There is no doubt that we have inherited great challenges at this \ntime. We now face the worst economic crisis in generations. Since \nDecember 2007, we have lost 5.1 million jobs, including 3.3 million of \nthose in just the past 5 months. So before we consider where we are \ngoing, I believe it is important today to talk a little bit about where \nwe have been.\n  Our colleagues on the other side of the aisle have been bemoaning \ndeficits and debt with not a moment of consideration for their own \nrecord on this issue. Back in 2001, Republicans controlled the full \npower of our entire Government. Under the leadership of President Bush \nand Republicans in Congress, record surpluses that were created under \nPresident Clinton became record deficits. Those Republican deficits \ngrew and grew, and now today they add up to trillions of dollars in new \ndebt that is going to be shouldered by future generations of Americans.\n  So it was with this perspective, which I hope our Republican friends \nwill start to acknowledge and own up to, that we know at this point in \ntime we have two choices: Choice 1 is to continue down the Republican \ndeficit path--no investments in the future, a widening gap between the \nrich and the middle class, and more massive deficits. Choice 2 is \nrepresented by the budget we present today. It improves the economy by \ninvesting in energy and education and health care reform so that we are \nstronger in the future, cutting taxes to the middle class, and \naddressing deficits so that our children do not continue to bear the \nburden of bad decisions well into the future.\n  After 8 years of the Bush administration's very shortsighted budget \nand misplaced priorities, we are now working with President Obama to \ninvest in our Nation's needs and chart a new course for America. We \nhave chosen a new path with this budget. The American people deserve an \neconomic plan that works for everyone in this country. Our budget makes \nresponsible choices that will help get our economy moving again. I want \nto talk about a few of them. Let me start with education.\n  We all know that education and training are the keys to our future \nstrengths. In this new global economy, a good education is no longer \njust a pathway to opportunity, it is a requirement for success. We will \nnot rebuild our economy and be competitive long term unless we can both \ncreate jobs and ensure that our American workers have the education and \nskills needed to fill those jobs.\n  This budget before us invests strongly in education and in training. \nWe also place a priority on making sure American students do not fall \nbehind as they make their way into the global marketplace. Our budget \nhelps to retrain American workers for careers in those new high-growth \nand emergent green industries, such as health care or renewable energy \nand energy-efficient construction, so that those workers stay in the \nmiddle class.\n  This budget makes strong investments in early childhood education and \nhome visiting programs to make sure that our young students are healthy \nand that they are ready for school. It also, importantly, invests in \nmaking sure college is affordable and accessible for more of our \nstudents. We want all of our students to achieve a postsecondary \ncredential, whether it is through a registered apprenticeship, through \na community college, or through a university. This budget helps point \nus in that direction.\n  As a nation, we have to change the way we think about preparing our \nyoung people for careers, starting with making sure education works \nbetter.\n  This current economic crisis has cost us dearly. Every weekend I go \nhome to my home State of Washington, and I hear about another business \nthat has closed or another family who cannot pay the bills. But we know \nthat if we make changes and we make smart investments, we can move our \ncountry forward. Investing in education and investing in training is \none of those smart investments.\n  That brings me to our next investment. As we are all aware today, \nenergy issues are some of the most pressing facing our Nation today. \nOur dependence on foreign oil has left us beholden to other nations, as \nmiddle-class families pay the price at the pump. By making renewable \nenergy a priority, we can reduce our dependence on foreign sources of \nenergy in the future and help create green jobs here at home and leave \na cleaner environment for future generations. This budget does that.\n  On an issue that everyone knows is near and dear to my heart, I \ncommend both the committee and President Obama for making veterans a \npriority in this budget process. Our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies have served and sacrificed for our Nation. After years of \nunderfunded budgets and being overshadowed by other priorities, this \nbudget finally does right by them. I commend my Budget chairman and our \nPresident and all of us for making sure that happens in this budget.\n  This budget is honest with the American people about the cost of war, \nnot just by paying for our veterans care but by paying for the wars in \nIraq and Afghanistan on budget for the first time since they started \nover 6 years ago.\n  I also note that this budget meets our commitment to nuclear waste \ncleanup in my State and across the country. Workers at Hanford nuclear \nreservation and people of that community sacrificed to help our Nation \nwin World War II. Hanford and other sites are now still home to \nmillions of gallons of waste, and our Government needs to live up to \nour promise to clean them up. This budget does that.\n  As is the case in many States across America, farming and ranching \nand agricultural production is my home State's largest industry. \nProtecting our agricultural sector is critical to the economy, the \nenvironment, and to our quality of life. We have to make sure our rural \ncommunities are strong. We worked to make sure we have a bright future \nfor our farm families. Production agriculture, such as Washington \nState's wheat farming, is a very volatile business. A workable safety \nnet such as in the farm bill is vital to the security of our family \nfarms. I have also long supported the Market Access Program which \nprovides funds for our producers to promote their products overseas and \nexpand into those important international markets. Especially in these \ndifficult economic times, when our foreign competitors are trying to \nlimit our market access with tariffs, the last thing we should be doing \nis cutting programs such as MAP that will help growers in a competitive \nmarketplace.\n  I want my colleagues to know I will continue to work with everyone to \nmake sure we find ways to support one of the staples of our economy, \nour agricultural community.\n  We all know our health care system is broken. It needs real reform. \nToday we have an historic opportunity to finally tackle this challenge. \nThese investments are not luxuries. They are essential to this \ncountry's future strength. That is why we have to prioritize the health \nprofessions workforce and access to quality care in rural areas. We \nhave to work to ensure that preventive measures are given priority so \nAmerican families are not left with giant bills for expensive care down \nthe road.\n\n[[Page S4859]]\n\n  Some critics of this budget are saying now is not the time to tackle \nhealth care reform. I believe that is pretty shortsighted reasoning. \nThere is a direct connection between our Nation's long-term prosperity \nand developing health care policies that stem the chronic bleeding in \nbusiness and in State and national budgets. A recent editorial in the \nEverett Herald newspaper in my home State made this point very well. \nThey said:\n\n       Yes, the economy is the most urgent challenge. But our \n     broken health care system and addiction to oil threaten to \n     become our long-term undoing.\n       They're all intertwined: Failing to find solutions to our \n     long-term problems will likely stunt future economic \n     expansions, creating longer and deeper downturns.\n\n  Health care is an important priority in this budget before us.\n  There has been a lot of talk over the past few weeks about the \ninclusion of reconciliation in this budget. Some following this debate \nare probably very surprised that our Republican colleagues, who were so \nadamant about using this procedural motion when it came to passing huge \ntax cuts for a very few while paying for it on the backs of many, would \nnow be arguing against its inclusion in this budget. As I said earlier, \nthere is a direct connection between America's long-term prosperity and \nimproving our health care system. Today nearly 46 million Americans do \nnot have health insurance. One in five working adults does not have \ngood coverage today. There was a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation \nthis month that found 6 in 10 American families put off care because of \ncost, and 42 percent of those people said they relied on home remedies \ninstead of going to see a doctor.\n  Of course, just this week the covers of newspapers across the country \nare filled with photos of people wearing surgical masks. TV screens are \nfilled with commentators talking about the possibility of a new strain \nof flu crippling the country and our economy. I can't think of a better \ntime to be talking about the need to insure all Americans, to focus on \nprevention, and to make absolutely certain that when there is the \npossibility of a public health crisis, no one puts off medical care \nbecause they don't have the means to pay for it. But in order to do all \nthat, we have to work together.\n  Democrats would strongly prefer to address health care in a \nbipartisan manner and by going through the regular legislative process. \nIt is our full intent to do just that. Democrats believe all Americans \ndeserve high quality health care that reduces our costs, makes care \nmore affordable, and creates jobs in the health care sector. We believe \nin protecting existing coverage when it is good, improving it when it \nis not, and guaranteeing health care for the millions of Americans who \nhave none. We know the only way for our economy to fully recover is by \nmaking this critical investment in health care today. We are committed \nto working with Republicans to do that. But they have to demonstrate a \nsincere interest in legislating, because the stakes are too high and \nthe cost of inaction is too great for us not to move forward. As long \nas Republicans want to be at the table, they have a seat. We welcome \nthem. This is simply too important an issue not to have their voices. \nBut it is also too important an issue to stall using partisan tactics. \nWe have to address this crisis. We intend to move forward this year.\n  I urge all colleagues to stop debating the process and, instead, join \nthe conversation about how we move forward on this issue that is so \ncritical to America's families today and to our Nation's future \neconomic strength.\n  America has paid dearly for the Bush administration's failure to \ninvest in our Nation. We all know that. We don't have to tell the \nAmerican people. They wake up to it every day: rising health care \ncosts, pink slips, crumbling infrastructure, bills and mortgages they \ncan't afford to pay. We tried it the other way for 8 years. It is time \nto invest in America again. It is time to give the middle class a \nbreak. It is time for honesty, and it is time to make bold decisions. \nThis budget invests in our future and begins to get us back on track.\n  I thank our chairman who is now in the Chamber and tell him I \nappreciate the tremendous work he and his staff and so many people did \nto make sure we now have a budget before us that begins to get America \nback on track.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I want to especially thank Senator Murray. \nShe is next in line on the Budget Committee. When I really want to \nthreaten her, I tell her I am going to leave as chairman of the \ncommittee and she can take over.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Every day I pray for the health and welfare of the \nchairman of our committee.\n  Mr. CONRAD. We could not have a stronger or better ally than the \nSenator from Washington. Senator Murray is exceptional. I have so \nenjoyed getting to know her over the years and working with her. When \nthere is something you need to get done, you need an assignment that \ncan actually get done, you want Senator Murray on the case. She is \nsomebody who is a performer. She gets results. I have such respect for \nher and the contribution she makes to this committee and to this \nChamber. We are fortunate to have Senator Murray in the Senate.\n  I tell my colleagues, they have seen her in vote-arama go around this \nfloor, convincing colleagues that perhaps this is not the time to offer \nan amendment, perhaps they could wait. They have seen how effective she \ncan be in personal interactions to get results. It goes way beyond the \nprocedural. It goes to the question of policy and getting a good result \nfor the country. I am so blessed to have Senator Murray as the top \nDemocrat on the committee. I thank her personally for everything she \nhas done as a conferee to bring us to this point, to have a successful \nresolution and a budget that is responsible, that does help get America \nback on track.\n  I have heard from the other side: We have tax increases here. Let's \nget to the facts. The fact is, on balance, we have a very substantial \ntax cut in this budget proposal aimed at the middle class. They are the \nones who deserve and need it. We have also heard that this leaves open \nthe possibility of global climate change being used in reconciliation. \nNonsense. There is an absolute commitment from everyone who is a party \nto this discussion. It is in the wording of the resolution that climate \nchange will not come to this body or to the other body through \nreconciliation. It is not going to happen. It has the absolute \ncommitment of the majority leader, of the Speaker, and of the President \nhimself. He has said it to me directly. So let's not be chasing straw \ndogs here. Climate change is not going to be done through \nreconciliation, period.\n  Again, I thank Senator Murray for her constructive work on this \nbudget.\n  Mrs. MURRAY. Mr. President, if I may respond to the chairman of our \ncommittee, I appreciate his thanks and praise. But our colleagues \nshould know, no one has spent more time and energy, not just for a few \nmonths but for a very long time, to make sure we have a responsible \nbudget we can all be proud of to vote on today. I again thank him and \nhis staff for their tremendous leadership, in calls late at night, when \nI am out on the west coast, and I know it is even later for him. I \nappreciate the tremendous amount of work he does, both policywise and \nmaking sure we keep the right fiscal balance. There is no one who is \nstronger in our caucus talking about how important it is to make sure \nwe look at not just what we do today in terms of this budget but how we \nto do it in the future. Keeping that balance between spending and \ndeficit is at the forefront of his mind. We would not be here today \nwithout him. I thank him.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I thank the Senator for her kindness. Next we have \nSenator Hutchison. How much time would the Senator require?\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. May I have 15 minutes?\n  Mr. CONRAD. You certainly may.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Texas is \nrecognized.\n  Mrs. HUTCHISON. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee. I want to say about the chairman that I do believe he \nmade very credible changes in the original budget proposal by saying he \nwould not sign on to many of the even bigger spending items that went \nover the 10-\n\n[[Page S4860]]\n\nyear period. This budget has some redeeming value, and I appreciate his \nleadership. Because it is very difficult when you have the President of \nyour party and Congress also with leaders from your party trying to \nsay: You have to do this. It is hard sometimes to reconcile all of \nthat. I appreciate that effort.\n  I am speaking against the budget resolution today because the \noverwhelming parts of the budget that are unacceptable outweigh the few \ngood things that were done. Reconciliation was the subject of \nconversation. Reconciliation, of course, is the procedure that is used \nto completely wipe out the minority's opportunities for input. Maybe we \nwill have input, but no Republican amendments will pass. On \nreconciliation, you do not have the ability to filibuster at all. While \nreconciliation is not completely allowed on the climate change bill, \nthe report says:\n\n       It is assumed that reconciliation will not be used for \n     changes in legislation related to global climate change.\n\n  I am going to take the chairman at his word saying that global \nclimate change will not be subject to reconciliation because it is very \nimportant we have amendments. One of the amendments I had on this \nbudget resolution, which was taken out by the conference, relates to \nthe energy portion of the bill. So not having reconciliation and taking \naway the ability to filibuster in the climate change bills that will \ncome later is a positive.\n  However, reconciliation is in the health care part of this budget, \nwhich means health care reform and the single-payer system that has \nbeen proposed by the President and the leaders in Congress is in \nreconciliation, which means there will be no opportunity to filibuster \nor possibly have input--certainly no leverage by the minority. That is \nin the health care section of the resolution, which may be the most \nimportant one that affects people's lives.\n  We know our system of health care in America is the best in the \nworld. There may be a few other countries that have equal access to \nprivate choices and doctor choices and the ability to choose what \nhospital and the type of care you are going to get and the kind of \ninsurance coverage you get. But I think it is best in America. I know \nthe countries that have gone to the single-payer system--which takes \nthe private sector largely out of health care, takes the choice out of \nhealth care--end up with a system that allows people to die while they \nare waiting to have the procedures they need that they would have in \nthe United States of America within a week.\n  So we have that in this budget in reconciliation, which means it is a \n51-vote bill. That in itself is enough for us to vote against this \nbudget. But there are other reasons as well.\n  We know our Nation is in the middle of an economic crisis the likes \nof which none of us have ever seen. Yet we are looking at a $3.5 \ntrillion budget resolution that says basically to the American people: \nWe know you are struggling. We know you are trying to make ends meet. \nWe know you cannot get loans from the bank. We know your small \nbusinesses are struggling to stay open. But not the American \nGovernment. The American Government is growing. It is getting bigger. \nIt is going to be a burden that is going to be beyond what we will be \nable to bring back or contract if we can get through this economic \ncrisis.\n  So while the American people are proving their resilience in the face \nof hardship, we are seeing the American Government grow as if we had \nall the money in the world to spend, which we do not. We are now \nlooking at an unprecedented growth in Government in this country with a \n$3.5 trillion budget, on top of a $1 trillion stimulus bill, on top of \na $410 billion Omnibus appropriations bill--all of which have been \npassed in the last 100 days.\n  The American people know this increase in Government spending is not \nfree and it is not sustainable. The American people will be forced to \npay for it. It is a short-term gain for a very long-term cost. It will \ndouble the public debt in 5 years. In 10 years, this budget will triple \nthe American debt.\n  The distinguished chairman, Senator Conrad, would not allow this \nbudget to go forward for 10 years because he saw that debt and he had \nthe integrity to say no. So it is 5 years. Hopefully, when this budget \nresolution is adopted--because it is going to despite our objections--\nhopefully, in the next 2 years, if we can see the economy coming back, \nthe people with integrity in the majority will say it is time to start \nreversing some of the debt that has been created, get these deficits \ndown, and give our country a chance to recover for the long term and \nnot hand our children this debt. Because if we go on with this budget \nas it is today, which will presumably be adopted by Congress today--\nbecause the House has already adopted it--it will create more debt than \nevery President from George Washington to George W. Bush combined--more \ndebt than all the Presidents of our country combined.\n  In 10 years, this budget will spend nearly four times more on \ninterest payments than on education, energy, and transportation \ncombined. That is staggering. I would urge my colleagues to think twice \nbefore they vote for this resolution because reversing it will be very \ndifficult.\n  There are some good parts of this budget. One is I want to commend \nthe majority leader, Harry Reid, because he did take the lead in making \npermanent the State and local sales tax deduction. It is something I \nhave worked on with him and with others in this body, who represent the \neight States that do not have a personal income tax, just to get \nequity. Senator Cantwell, Senator Murray, myself, and the Senators from \nTennessee have all worked tirelessly, along with Senator Reid and \nSenator Ensign, to rectify the inequity that has plagued the eight \nStates that do not have the State income tax. But they do have sales \ntaxes.\n  What the majority leader has led the fight to do is to allow those \neight States, on a permanent basis, to deduct our sales taxes on our \nFederal income taxes, just like all the other 42 States in our country \nare able to deduct their State income taxes on their Federal income \ntaxes.\n  This all started in 1986, when the sales tax deduction was \neliminated, but the income tax deduction was kept. Since 1986, until \n2004, we had that inequity. But we corrected it in 2004 with the \nefforts of many of us. Thank goodness we have had extensions. Now we \nwill make it permanent. That is a fundamental issue of fairness, and I \ncommend Senator Reid for his leadership.\n  However, my amendment to permanently eliminate the marriage penalty, \nwhich was adopted by the Senate, was taken out in conference. I think \nit is the most egregious antifamily tax we have in this country today.\n  We, in the plan that is before us, did not make that tax relief \npermanent. We have had it since the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003. I hoped \nto make it permanent. But we were not able to do that. What is going to \nhappen after 2010 is the marriage penalty is going to come back in full \nforce for those who make over $200,000--many of which are subchapter S \ncorporations. They are the small businesses that create jobs.\n  We have a common goal: President Obama and the Democrats in Congress \nand the Republicans in Congress all want to create jobs. The problem \nis, the policies that are put forward in President Obama's budget and \nin the one that is getting ready to be adopted will hit, with tax \nincreases, the people who will create jobs, by increasing their tax \nbrackets, by increasing the marriage penalty on them. We should follow \nour goals with policies that will achieve them. But instead, \nunfortunately, we are going in the opposite direction.\n  Here is another example: the Outer Continental Shelf. President Obama \nsaid in the campaign, and he has said since: We have a goal of energy \nindependence for America. Sixty percent of our energy needs are \nimported from foreign countries--countries that do not want us to \nsucceed, countries such as Venezuela, countries in the Middle East. We \nare importing our energy needs from countries that would like to shut \nus down.\n  We have a goal. It is a common goal, once again--Democrats and \nRepublicans--energy independence for America. But we are taxing the \nonly energy source in this country that actually produces enough energy \nto make us independent.\n  Drilling on the Outer Continental Shelf would open exploration and \ngive every State that allows that exploration a part of the royalties. \nWe would\n\n[[Page S4861]]\n\nencourage environmentally safe drilling off our shores, using our \nnatural resources for our common goal of energy independence for our \ncountry.\n  But, no, the amendment the Senate adopted was taken out of the \nconference report that would have encouraged the expansion of oil and \ngas production in the Outer Continental Shelf. It has been shown by the \ndrilling in the Gulf of Mexico, which is today our largest source of \noil off our own shores--because we know how to drill in an \nenvironmentally safely way, just like we could do in ANWR, where the \npeople of Alaska want to be able to drill in a very small frozen tundra \nin Alaska, where we would have an even bigger resource than the Gulf of \nMexico, and yet that, too, has been shut out.\n  We have a unique position in the world; that is, we are the only \ncountry in the world with abundant natural resources that could reduce \nour energy dependence in an environmentally safe way. Yet we refuse to \nuse those natural resources. Other countries in the world fight for \nnatural resources that we have in abundance but are unable to use \nbecause we have shut those down.\n  Every one of us in this body believes that wind energy is great, that \nsolar energy is great, that we need to do more research in technology, \nso that solar and wind energy will be more available on a 24-hour, \neveryday basis. We want more technology to learn how batteries can \nincrease their capacity so we can have electric cars that could run for \na long time. We want those things but not at the expense of \nenvironmentally safely using the resources we have--such as nuclear \nenergy, for instance, which is the cheapest source of electricity in \nthis country. There are no carbon emissions from nuclear energy. We \nhave not built a new nuclear powerplant in this country in over 30 \nyears. We must encourage these energy sources that would make us energy \nindependent in an environmentally safe way.\n\n  There are so many parts of this budget that are wrong, and I hope \nthat we will say no to it--if only for the reason of having \nreconciliation in health care and adding an unprecedented amount of \nmoney to our debt, giving us deficits that are unable to be stopped as \nfar as the eye can see. Go back to the drawing board and bring us a \nbudget that tells the American people: We get it. We know a big \nincrease in Government is not in a family's best interest, a family \nthat is struggling to make ends meet and stay in their home and either \nkeep their job or produce jobs for others. This budget will not do \nthat. I hope the majority will listen to what we are saying: Defeat \nthis budget and then, in a bipartisan way, we can come up with a plan \nthat will be good for America and that will give Americans confidence \nthat they are going to have an economy once again that will create jobs \nand good incomes for their families.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Delaware.\n  Mr. CARPER. Mr. President, I will talk, as my colleague has, about \nthe Federal budget, the budget resolution that has been prepared for \nour consideration as a result of the conference that has occurred \nbetween the House and Senate. I express my thanks particularly to the \nchairman of the committee, Senator Conrad, for the work he and his \nstaff and other members of the committee have done, Democrat and \nRepublican, including Senator Gregg.\n  I wish to respond a bit to what my colleague from Texas said. This \nadministration didn't inherit a day at the beach. They have inherited a \ntough situation. We as a country have been around sort of officially \nsince 1787, and if you go from 1787 to 2001, I think that is about 214 \nyears. We ran up in that period of time roughly $5 trillion worth of \ndebt. We essentially doubled that over the last 8 years. We doubled it \nin only 8 years. We ran up as much new debt in the last 8 years as we \ndid in 214 years as a nation. I didn't hear nearly the kind of \nbemoaning and railing about the growth in the deficit and the national \ndebt during those 8 years as we hear today from our friends on the \nother side of the aisle.\n  I think my colleagues know I am not a real partisan guy, but I think \nit is important to say this is the hand we have been dealt. The \nquestion is what do we do about it. We have a couple of wars we are \nfighting. We have an economy that is the worst since the Great \nDepression and we have to do something about it. One of the first \nthings we have decided to do about it is to try to jolt the economy \nback to life. I remember those old Frankenstein movies where Dr. \nFrankenstein is in the lab trying to put the electrodes to the monster \nand jolt that monster back to life. We are trying to jolt not a monster \nback to life but an economy back to life. Economists on all sides--\nliberal, conservative, and everything in between--have said, you have \nto spend a lot of money and hopefully it will be used to produce jobs \nand add to the value that will be for a good purpose in our country.\n  That is what we have done with the stimulus package. As we go through \nthis year, and probably the next year or so, the deficit is going to be \na whole lot bigger than I am comfortable with. I was elected to the \nHouse and served there for 10 years before I became Governor. I was a \ndeficit hawk and in my heart I still am. I wish to talk about some \nthings we can do, ought to do, and in some cases are doing, to bring \nthe deficit down further.\n  I am encouraged when I hear our new President say the deficit is \nlarge this year, but over the next 4 years we will reduce the deficit \nin half. I think that is fine. The important thing is we don't just \nstop there, and if we have the same administration or a new one, it is \nimportant that we continue to make progress and drive the deficit back \nto zero. I am one of those people who thinks it is appropriate to spend \nwhen we are in a time of economic calamity, when we are in a time of \nwar, and as it turns out right now we are in both. Hopefully, 4 years \nfrom now--hopefully sooner than that--we won't be in both and we can \nturn back our spending. When the economy is sound, when we are not in a \nnational disaster, in war in places around the world, I think it is \nappropriate to balance our budget. In fact, one of the things I was \nproudest of as Governor is we not only balanced our budget for 7 years \nin a row, we reduced taxes and paid down our debt a little bit, and \nthat made me proud, and the legislature too. Hopefully, we will be in a \nposition in the years to come, as we were in 1999 and 2000, when we \npaid down the debt.\n  I have suggested to the administration some things we can do, and I \nhave talked about them here on the floor, to reduce the deficit. I wish \nto talk about one of them and mention one of the others as well. In \norder to better match revenues and expenditures going forward, we \nobviously cannot avoid the question of taxes. As far as I am concerned, \nbefore we start raising a lot of taxes, the first thing--maybe the \nbetter thing--for us to do is to collect the taxes that are owed. Every \nyear we hear about the tax gap. The last one was actually officially \ndone, I think, about 8 or 9 years ago by the IRS and they figured that \nat the time we had a tax gap--monies owed to the Treasury, not being \ncollected by the Treasury--of about $300 billion a year. By most \nestimates I hear today, it is almost $400 billion a year. If we can \nonly recover half of it or a third of it, we are talking about real \nmoney that would make a real dent in our deficit.\n  We make a lot of improper payments in this Government of ours. I \nchair a subcommittee that has jurisdiction over that sort of thing. We \nknow our improper payments that we made into the Federal Government \nlast year were right around $72 billion, mostly overpayments, some \nunderpayments. We need to do a better job. At least we know now for the \nmost part where the improper payments are going, or at least the \ndepartments that are making them, but we are not doing a very good job \nof actually going back, after we have made an overpayment, especially, \nand recovering the money, recapturing that money. We call it postaudit \ncost recoveries. We are just beginning to scratch the surface in one of \nour big entitlement programs, Medicare. Starting about 3 years ago we \nhired some private firms and said, For monies we have overpaid to \nproviders or medical suppliers, corporate suppliers, let's go back and \nget the money we have overpaid. We said we were going to do it in three \nStates--California, Texas, and Florida. The first year of this effort \nwe recovered almost nothing. The second year we recovered a little bit. \nLast year we recovered about\n\n[[Page S4862]]\n\n$700 million. That is real money. The idea is not to just do it in 3 \nStates but to do it in all 50 States, and I am encouraged that we are \ngoing to do that. If we can recover that kind of money for overpayments \nin Medicare, my guess is we could recover some money in Medicaid. If we \nhave two of our three big entitlement programs that are sucking up a \nlot of money, one of the first issues we should face there is reducing \nthe overpayments and going after the money and recovering that money we \nhave overspent or, in some cases, misspent.\n  The third area we need to focus on is the area of major weapons \nsystems. We have spent a lot of money. Going back to I think it was \n2000, we were overspending on major weapons systems cost overruns by \nabout $50 billion in 2000. In 2005 we were up to $200 billion. Last \nyear we were close to $300 billion in major weapons systems cost \noverruns. Clearly that is an area where we can do better and have to do \nbetter. Secretary Gates has come forth with a number of proposals and \nreforms that deserve our support, and I hope they will enjoy our \nsupport as we go forward, to try to better align our weapons systems \nwith buying for the kinds of wars we are likely to fight. We could do a \nmuch better job in terms of controlling our costs for those weapons \nsystems as well.\n  The Federal Government owns a lot of property, not just land, not \njust military bases, not just buildings, but all of the above, and in \nsome cases we don't use them. We pay security for those properties, we \nmay pay utilities for those properties, but we don't use them. We don't \ndo a very good job of disposing of properties that are not being used. \nWe need to dispose of those properties. Those are only a couple of \nthings we can do and ought to be doing. I hope in the years to come we \nwill do more of each of those.\n  One other thing I would mention is most Governors have what we call \nline item veto power--the ability to go and line out a single line item \nin a budget. They have it by virtue of the Constitution so they can \nveto bills, they can go through the lines of their bills and veto lines \nand different pieces of a spending package that they have signed into \nlaw. We have something like that in the Federal Government. It is \ncalled rescission power. The President can sign an appropriations bill \ninto law, submit that to the Congress, and the Congress can vote it up \nor down. But if we don't do anything, then it kind of goes away. The \nPresident sends rescission messages to us from time to time and we \ndon't do anything, and the rescission of the proposal sort of goes \naway.\n  If we go back to 1995, 1996, there was a proposal in the Clinton \nadministration that changed that. The idea was to make the President's \nrescission powers look more like line item veto powers. I thought it \nwas a flawed effort. I think line item veto powers are oversold in \nterms of their value of reducing the deficit, but there is some virtue \nthere. They are a good tool to have in the toolbox. But in 1995, 1996, \nwhat they came up with, it passed here in the House and Senate and it \nwas signed into law. The President proposes a rescission, the Congress \nhas to vote on it, and unless they vote it down with a two-thirds vote \nin the House and in the Senate, that proposed rescission is going to \nbecome law. Think about that. We are not talking about a bill. We are \nsaying a line or a couple of lines in a bill, the President could \npropose to rescind those and his recommendations on rescinding spending \nin an appropriations bill or a tax bill or an entitlement bill, or all \nof the above, would actually become law unless two-thirds of the House \nand the Senate said no, we are going to override that. That is a huge \nshift of power from the legislative branch to the executive branch. I \ndidn't think it was a good idea then. The Supreme Court didn't think it \nwas a good idea either. If not the Supreme Court, one of the top \ncircuit courts of appeal said they didn't think it was a good idea. \nThey threw it out for being unconstitutional.\n\n  Having said that, I think the idea of at least compelling us to give \na Presidential rescission a day in court, a day on the floor, is a good \nidea. What a number of us, 21 of us have done, is we have cosponsored \nlegislation that we introduced this week, Democrats and Republicans. \nThe idea behind the legislation is when the President signs a spending \nbill--not a tax bill, not a revenue bill, not an entitlement measure, \nbut when he or she signs an appropriations bill into law, he or she \nwould have the right to send us a rescission message to propose to \nreduce or rescind spending in that spending bill. We would constrain \nhow much the President could rescind. He couldn't rescind more than 25 \npercent. If they are unauthorized, there is no limit. The long and \nshort of it is, though, the President would send a rescission message \nand we would have to vote on it. We could vote it down with a simple \nmajority; in the Senate, 51 votes, or in the House with 218--not a two-\nthirds override, not both Houses, just a simple majority in either the \nHouse or the Senate. We limit the time for this to occur. In fact, we \nlimit the amount of years that this could be law to 4 years--4 years. I \ncall it a 4-year test drive with enhanced rescission powers for a \nPresident. If the President abuses it, if the President should say to \nthe Presiding Officer from New Mexico: Unless you vote for my top \npriorities, I am going to go after your top priorities, to try to \nintimidate a Member of the Senate or House--that could happen. As a \nresult, we provide for this 4-year sunset. After that, the law goes \naway. If Presidents, current or future, continue to abuse this, they \nwill not continue to enjoy this particular balance.\n  Do I think this will balance the budget? No, I don't. Do I think it \nmight be of some help? Yes, I do.\n  I will close with a comment on earmarks. Some people think earmarks \nare the devil's work. The earmarks that we submit in my State--Senator \nKaufman and myself, Governor Castle before he became Governor--were \nearmarks that we are proud of. We have three budgets in Delaware State \ngovernment, and one of the major budgets is the operating budget which \nbasically runs the State. The second is the capital budget--bricks and \nmortar, schools, roads, prisons, and that sort of thing. The third \npiece of our budget, the third budget, if you will, is something called \na grant and aid budget. The Governor proposes the operating budget. The \nGovernor proposes the capital budget in my State. The Governor doesn't \npropose the grant and aid budget in my State. That comes from the \nlegislature. We found in the 1990s that the grant and aid budget was \ngrowing like Topsy, kind of crowding out spending in the operating \nbudget and the capital budget. What we decided to do was put a \nconstraint on the growth of the grant and aid budget, no more than 2 \npercent; no more than 2 percent of revenues. That put a halt to the \ngrowth and kind of put things back on the right keel.\n  With respect to earmarks, among the things we have done here--there \nis nothing inherently wrong with earmarks, directed spending, but when \nthey are growing like Topsy, as they were for a while, that is not a \ngood thing. We have now decided to limit earmarks to 1 percent of \nrevenue which I think is appropriate.\n  The second thing we didn't know for the longest time is where the \nearmarks were coming from and who was asking for them. We didn't know \nnecessarily who was going to benefit from the earmark. We have \naddressed that so we know both.\n  The other thing I believe we have addressed is called air drops, \nwhere you have a conference committee with the House and Senate on \nappropriations bills, you don't have an earmark in either one, yet out \nof the conference committee emerges an earmark from somebody and we \ndon't know where it came from and it wasn't in either bill. That \nshouldn't be allowed.\n  The last thing I would mention is at the end of the day, you have the \nability for the President to look through a bill, whether with earmarks \nor other forms of spending, and say maybe this is a bad idea. This is \nan egregious form of spending. It should be addressed, and basically \nsay to us in the Senate or the House: I have signed this bill into law, \nbut I wanted to come back and vote on a couple specific items. If I \ncannot get 50 colleagues to vote for an earmark that I have made on \nbehalf of Delaware, I should probably not be asking for that earmark in \nthe first place. That is the long and short of it.\n\n  There are a lot of things we can do to continue to make progress. We \nare getting down to 3 percent of GDP in the next 4 years, and I applaud \nthat. There\n\n[[Page S4863]]\n\nare other things we want to do. I look forward to working with the \nchairman. Those are just a few of the ways we can make additional \nprogress.\n  I applaud the chairman, and I thank him for all his work. I cannot \nimagine what it is like to bear the burden of this or any budget, but \nhe has done it well and in good humor for a long time.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from North Dakota is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Delaware, who has \nbeen so constructive on many critical issues since he joined the \nSenate. He is somebody whose career I followed closely when he was in \nthe House of Representatives and as Governor of his State. He is one of \nthe real clear thinkers on fiscal issues before this body. I thank him \nfor all of the contributions he has made.\n  Next, we have Senator Whitehouse, a very valued member of the Budget \nCommittee. He is one of the people who put a great deal of effort and \nenergy into producing the budget resolution that came from the Senate \nwhich really served as the model of what we have before us in terms of \nthe conference report. This is a conference report, as I have said \nrepeatedly, that captures the President's key priorities of reducing \nour dependence on foreign energy, focusing on excellence in education, \nand providing for health care reform, which is a special passion of the \nSenator from Rhode Island. It also contains substantial middle-class \ntax cuts--in fact, over $750 billion in middle-class tax cuts--all the \nwhile reducing the deficit by two-thirds over the next 4 years.\n  As measured against a share of GDP, it is even better. We reduce the \neconomy on that metric--and the economists say that is the best \nmetric--by three quarters. No member of the committee has made a \ngreater contribution on health care issues than the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Whitehouse.\n  The ACTING PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Senator from Rhode Island is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. WHITEHOUSE. Mr. President, I thank the distinguished chairman of \nthe committee for his kind words. I congratulate him on having brought \nthis budget successfully to the floor for a vote at this point. The \nprocedures the budget must go through are very complex. The \nconsequences for this body, if the budget should fail, are dire, and \nthe economic catastrophe the country and our new President have been \npresented with have made this a particularly challenging budget \nsubstantively to work with. Through all that, the distinguished \nchairman has persevered and succeeded with his customary diligence, \ngrace, and good will; and it is customary on our part to rely on his \nexpertise. He made a remarkable contribution. It would not be right to \nnot acknowledge what a spectacular achievement, under the \ncircumstances, this has been.\n  What is particularly useful about this budget is the emphasis on the \npressing priorities that our country faces--particularly clean energy \ntechnology and energy efficiencies, the education of our young people, \nand I think most important, as the distinguished chairman has \nsuggested, it lays the groundwork for a vitally necessary, far-reaching \nreform of our health care system in the coming months and years.\n  This reform cannot come soon enough. Our health care system is a \nmess. The number of uninsured Americans continues to climb and will \nsoon hit 50 million. The annual cost of the system is over $2 trillion \na year, and that will shortly double. We spend 16 percent of our \nNation's gross domestic product on health care--more than any other \nindustrialized country in the world, and double the average of our \nEuropean Union economic competitors. There is more health care than \nsteel in the cost of Ford cars. There is more health care than coffee \nbeans in the cost of Starbucks coffee. Unless we act quickly, the \nrecession we are living through now will seem like nothing compared to \nwhat will happen when $35 trillion in unfunded Medicare liability--\nagainst which we have set not one nickel--comes due.\n  Even more important, however, is the extraordinary price that \nhardworking Americans pay every day for this dysfunctional system. In \nAmerica, we have the best doctors, the best nurses, the best \nprocedures, the best hospitals, and the best equipment in the world. \nYet our broken health care system grinds that up and produces mediocre \nresults.\n  More than 100,000 Americans are killed every year by unnecessary and \navoidable medical errors. Many more are faced with longer health care \nstays and higher costs. Life expectancy, obesity rates, and child \nmortality are much worse than they should be in a country such as ours. \nMore families in America experience bankruptcy because of medical \nexpenses for that family than any other cause.\n  Fundamentally, the system itself doesn't work. Hospitals are going \nbroke, doctors are furious, and paperwork chokes the system. Quarrels \nbetween providers and payers drive up the cost, while potential savings \nin billions of dollars for improved quality and prevention lie there on \nthe table. It is a system in crisis, and it threatens our Nation's \nfiscal security. It must be repaired, and we have to see this as an \nurgent task.\n  Mr. President, a few months ago, I added a new feature to my Web \nsite, which is a Health Care Storyboard, to give Rhode Islanders a \nchance to share personal experiences in the health care system and \ntheir ideas for how to fix it. Since we launched the Storyboard, more \nthan 300 people, from 45 different communities, have sent me their \nstories. While I was in Rhode Island over the recess, I had the chance \nto meet with some of the people who sent in stories, so I could talk to \nthem firsthand.\n  Joyce from Warwick told me she is supposed to take two medications \nevery day, but her insurance will pay for only one. There is no generic \nfor the one she must pay for out of pocket. She would love to retire, \nbut she simply cannot because her medical coverage would cost too much. \nShe is trapped at work by health care.\n  Judith and Scott from Cranston have been struggling ever since he \nneeded a liver transplant in 2006. Their family incurred $60,000 in \nmedical bills that weren't covered by insurance as a result. Scott has \nbeen unable to work since 2004 due to his illness, which meant the \nfamily was relying on Judith's insurance. But 18 months ago, Judith \nlost her job, which meant her family had to go on COBRA. To make \nmatters worse, their COBRA is about to run out, and Judith still cannot \nfind a job.\n  Like hundreds of thousands of American families, Judith and Scott had \nto file chapter 7 bankruptcy on February 12, 2008, because of the \nmedical costs of Scott's illness.\n  Claudia from Providence is self-employed and pays for her own health \ninsurance. She recently did a few precautionary tests at her annual \ndoctor visit when the doctor suggested they were a good idea. However, \nshe found out her health coverage only covers 80 percent of her visit, \nand she had to pay an extra $176. At the time, she didn't realize how \nmuch these tests would cost her. She told me she might have skipped \nthem had she known it was not included in her premium.\n  She, like so many Americans, would have bypassed necessary health \ncare in order to save money. Claudia told me calling what we have a \n``health care system'' is too kind. It is more like a trap that people \nfall into.\n  Marie from Wakefield told me she had been healthy her entire life \nuntil extreme pelvic pain sent her to the emergency room twice in 2006. \nShe was eventually diagnosed with endometrial cancer, which was treated \nwith a hysterectomy and six sessions of chemotherapy. Fortunately, \nMarie had excellent coverage and paid very little for the countless \ndoctor visits, blood work, hospitalizations, scans, and specialists. \nBut now her employer will be changing her coverage dramatically. She \nmay not have post-retirement health care options, and her copay may \nrise considerably. She has no idea what her future health care needs \nwill be. All she knows is she was once promised one thing, when her \ncareer began, and now as she looks toward retirement, she is faced with \nvery different options.\n  Finally Barbara from Exeter, a registered nurse since 1983 and works \nin hospice care. She told me about her experience ``watching our health \ncare system fall apart at the seams, while insurance giants have gotten \nout of control.'' Barbara said she had witnessed providers who no \nlonger determine what the best care is for patients based on clinical \nexcellence, but rather\n\n[[Page S4864]]\n\non what the insurance company demands and will pay for. She has seen \npatients forgoing needed medical care because of costs, and ultimately \nspending more because when they finally seek treatment, their illnesses \nhave become more severe. ``The whole concept of insurance is not what \npeople expect it to be,'' she said.\n  These are just stories of six Rhode Islanders. In them we see a loss \nof dignity, a loss of security, a loss of confidence and comfort, a \nloss that is shared by millions of Americans. Their stories remind us \nthat health care reform isn't just an abstract Washington problem--that \nunderneath the awful numbers we see coming out of our health care \nsystem are even more awful human tragedies.\n  As we work to reform our health care system, two goals loom large: \nOne, ensuring that health care is available for all, and that it is \naffordable. But the stories I have heard from these and hundreds of \nRhode Islanders remind us it is not just enough to solve the problem of \ncoverage. When the boat is sinking, it is not enough to get everybody \nout of the water and into the boat. Instead, we must also reform the \nhealth care system itself, making it more intelligent, more sensible, \nmore helpful, more efficient, better supported by information \ntechnology, and better grounded in quality and prevention. We need an \ninformation technology infrastructure so every American can count on \nhis or her own secure electronic health record. We need improvements in \nthe quality of health care so care is both cheaper and more effective. \nWe need to reform our misaligned payment and reimbursement system so \nthe health care we want is the health care we are paying for.\n  This budget begins the process of making that possible, and I am \nproud to support it. These delivery system reforms in health care \ncannot be just flipped on like a light switch. They will require \ncomplex workforce, regulatory, and infrastructure changes, and then \nthose changes will have to be implemented and administered. It will \ntake time. It could take years. It is all the more reason we need to \nstart now. This budget launches us on that journey.\n  We made good progress yesterday by confirming Secretary Kathleen \nSebelius, an experienced and determined leader who will be an enormous \nasset in this fight. I am encouraged by her confirmation, and I look \nforward to her leadership at the helm of this effort. Reforming our \nhealth care system will be more than a financial problem, more than a \npolicy puzzle, and more than a political fight. This is a landscape of \nhuman tragedy, and families all across this country are struggling \nevery single day that we fail to act.\n  This budget does that. It is a good thing. Before I leave the floor, \nI have to add this because I have been listening across the internal \ntelevision network to the speeches of my colleagues--in particular, \nRepublican colleagues. From their speeches, you would never know that \nduring the Bush administration the difference between the budget that \nPresident Bush inherited and the budget projections he was given the \nday he took office and the actual budget outcomes that the Bush \nadministration produced, the difference was nearly $9 trillion--$9 \ntrillion of debt. During that time, there was not a peep from our \nRepublican friends about this carnival of debt, this orgy of fair \nweather debt in which George Bush and the Republican party engaged.\n  Now something has changed. We have a different President, and \nsuddenly we are hearing a whole different message from the Republicans. \nNow that we have a serious recession, the one time when families are \ncontracting their budgets, businesses are contracting their budgets, \nand State and local governments are contracting their budgets, and the \nFederal Government has an economic obligation to spend counter \ncyclically to keep the budget from melting down, now at this time we \nhear the most intense caterwauling about debt and deficit.\n  I ask my colleagues, where were you when the Bush administration was \nrunning up nearly $9 trillion, putting a war in Iraq on the credit \ncard, and giving tax relief to America's billionaires? Where was the \neconomic urgency of putting those things on the American debt tab? This \nis the one time when it makes sense to countercyclically spend, to \ndeficit spend through a recession. Yet we hear these complaints.\n\n  I am a lawyer, as is the Presiding Officer, formerly a distinguished \nattorney general of New Mexico. We both know that when you are arguing \nin a court of law, if you intend to make a point, it is usually helpful \nif the point you are making is consistent with what you have done in \nthe past. It is called the clean hands doctrine. You cannot come into \ncourt and argue for a position when you have acted counter to it in the \npast. You don't have clean hands, and the court will take that into \naccount.\n  I submit that our friends on the other side, the party of no, is now \nthe party of no consistency and the party of no clean hands on this \nsubject. It is impossible to ignore the Bush debt of nearly $9 trillion \nand come to the floor and claim that this President, in this emergency \nhe inherited from the previous administration, should not do the one \nthing economists say makes sense in this timeframe, which is in a \nrecession to have the Government spend countercyclically. It makes no \nsense. I think we need to do what President Obama does: Look to the \nfuture, look to the pressing priorities of our time, look to the urgent \ndemands, such as health care, and support this budget.\n  I will conclude, again, with my very great appreciation for the \nextraordinary work my chairman on the Budget Committee has done to \nbring us to this day. I think we can look forward to this budget \npassing, although there will be a certain amount of back and forth \nuntil we get there. I think we are doing the American people a service \nby passing this budget and it is thanks to the chairman's leadership.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Merkley). The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I, again, thank the Senator from Rhode \nIsland, Mr. Whitehouse, who is such a valuable member of the Senate \nBudget Committee, as is the occupant of the Chair, who has newly joined \nus and is already making good contributions to our work. We are \ndelighted to have Senator Merkley, the occupant of the Chair and a \nMember of the Senate Budget Committee, with us and appreciate so much \nthe efforts of Senator Whitehouse and Senator Merkley in developing a \nbudget resolution that, by the way, our outline was largely followed in \nthe conference committee. It is very close to what passed the Senate \nearlier. I think the reasons for that success are, No. 1, we did \ncapture the President's priorities of reducing dependence on foreign \nenergy, a focus on excellence in education, providing for major health \ncare reform that is absolutely critical to the country's future and, at \nthe same time, cutting the deficit by two-thirds over the next 5 years, \nby three-quarters as measured by the gross domestic product, and also \nproviding very substantial middle-class tax relief, hundreds of \nbillions of dollars--in fact, over $700 billion--of middle-class tax \nrelief that is in this budget. I think we can be proud of that.\n  We have already seen the budget earlier today pass in the House of \nRepresentatives by a very wide margin. I anticipate, when we have our \nvote, it will also pass with a healthy margin.\n  I, again, especially thank Senator Whitehouse and Senator Merkley, \nwho are key members of the Budget Committee who did so much to help us \nfashion a document that can command the respect of our colleagues.\n  For one moment, I would like to, as we are waiting for Senator \nGrassley to arrive, indicate that earlier there were a number of \ncomments made to which I wish to respond. First, that reconciliation \ncould still be used for global climate change legislation. Technically, \nthat is true, but it is not going to happen. We have the absolute \nassurance of all those who are in leadership positions in the House and \nthe Senate, the President of the United States--in fact, the President \nhas assured me directly--directly--that he would not allow that. Let's \ntake that off the table.\n  Second, we have heard concern from our Republican colleagues about \nthe use of reconciliation. I share those concerns. I have opposed the \nuse of reconciliation for these purposes. But my own belief is health \ncare will not use the reconciliation process. I believe health care \nwill move in the regular\n\n[[Page S4865]]\n\norder. The committees of jurisdiction have until October 15 to do so.\n  I see now that Senator Durbin, who is a member of our leadership, is \nhere. If he is ready to go--how much time does the Senator request? I \nyield 15 minutes to the Senator from Illinois, Mr. Durbin.\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Senate Budget \nCommittee, Senator Conrad of North Dakota, not only for yielding but \nalso for his leadership in the preparation of this important document.\n  The budget resolution is a blueprint. We pass it and then we go to \nwork with the individual parts of it in the appropriations bills. But \nwe have to get this done first because the budget resolution tells us \nhow much we can spend in total. Once we have that guidance, it is \nturned over to the Appropriations Committee on which I serve. We then \nparcel it out among the different appropriations subcommittees and go \nto work looking at the individual budgets. I have one of those \nsubcommittees for which I am responsible. We cannot start working until \nthis budget resolution is agreed to.\n  It is not an easy political task. First, it is a highly technical \ndocument which few Members understand in detail, the chairman and \nranking member being notable exceptions. Second, it is highly political \nbecause when you start describing what your budget is going to look \nlike, not only next year but several years down the road, you are doing \nmore than putting figures on paper, you are spelling out your values, \nwhat do you want to do.\n  The budget submitted to us by President Obama is significantly \ndifferent than the budgets we have seen in years gone by. His \npriorities differ from previous administrations, particularly of \nPresident George Bush. We have to realize that in the last 8 years, \nthere has been a significant change in Government spending. In the \nentire history of the United States of America, through all the \nPresidents, including President Clinton, we had accumulated about $5 \ntrillion in debt. That is all the debt of America. That was our \nmortgage when President George W. Bush took office. When he left \noffice--let me go back.\n  When he assumed office, he assumed a surplus. In other words, the \nlast budget left to him generated more money than we were spending. \nWhat did we do with the surplus? We reduced the debt of the Social \nSecurity trust fund, which meant that Social Security could last a few \nyears longer.\n  President Bush inherited a surplus in the budget and a $5 trillion \nmortgage that all the Presidents had accumulated.\n  When he left office, what did he leave behind? Eight years after he \nwas elected President, he left a national mortgage of over $10 \ntrillion. It had doubled in an 8-year period of time, and he left to \nthe new President, President Obama, the largest deficit in the history \nof the United States. I believe it was in the range of $1.3 trillion--a \nhuge amount of money that we were in red ink facing.\n  President Obama faced a tough task dealing with an economy that was \nflat on its back in a recession and how to revive it, how to make sure \nwe create and save jobs, how to get businesses back on their feet, how \nto give some tax incentives and help particularly to working families, \nhow to fund the things in Government which are essential because, as we \nknow, when we get into a recession, people need more things.\n  I went to a plant in Chicago with Vice President Biden on Monday, a \nplant which last December laid off 240 employees and now was reopening. \nWe, of course, couldn't be happier that was occurring. I asked one of \nthe workers coming back: How did you get by for the last 4 or 5 \nmonths? Senator, unemployment, that is how I got by.\n\n  Unemployment compensation is one of the things Government pays out in \nthe midst of recession. With more and more Americans out of work, we \nhave been paying out more for unemployment insurance, for food stamps, \nthe basic things people need to survive until the economy turns around \nand their lives turn around.\n  Faced with that, this Budget Committee had to sit down and try to \nwrite a budget that moved us toward reducing the deficit in America and \nalso revitalizing the economy. That is a tough job. If your goal is \njust to reduce spending, that is pretty obvious. We know how to do \nthat. But if your goal is to still spend enough to get the economy \nmoving and yet create a trend that moves us at least closer to a \nbalanced budget, then you have a tough assignment.\n  Now add in two other elements that make this even more complicated. \nPresident Obama said if we are going to spend money in this economy, we \nneed to invest it in what has meaning, long-term investments in \nAmerica. There is this caricature of WPA, under Franklin Roosevelt, of \npeople leaning on shovels, folks sitting at desks where phones never \nring. I am not sure that is any more than caricature.\n  Today President Obama said: Let's create jobs that we will use to \ninvest in our future. Let's build things that will have value to us in \nthe outyears. He looked at two or three areas in specific terms. One is \nhealth care, and the President is right. If you look at the curve line \non the increase in costs of health care in America, it continues to \nrise. It will continue to rise unabated to the point where there is no \nhope for us to balance this budget. We will start spending more and \nmore on health care for the elderly, for the poor, for those who are \ndisabled to the point where we cannot even consider any kind of \nbalanced budget. The President said: As part of this next budget, let \nus move toward the day when we have a new health care system in \nAmerica, one that serves everyone and is reasonably priced. That is a \ntough assignment, no doubt about it. But in this budget, we address \nthat issue.\n  Senator Conrad has talked about reconciliation. That is a term which \nbeyond divorce court most people do not know what you are talking \nabout. For most Americans, it is a term of mystery. For us, it is a \nprocedure on the Senate floor that changes the vote necessary to pass a \nbill. This is, after all, the Senate, and a majority does not get the \njob done on a given day. In the Senate, you need 60 votes out of 100 to \ndo anything that is controversial or important. Reconciliation says: On \nany given issue under reconciliation, a majority is sufficient. But \nthere are strict rules on what you can put in there, strict rules on \nwhat you can consider.\n  Senator Conrad had to deal with this whole question: What procedure \nwould we use to move toward health care. I think he came up with a \nreasonable conclusion, and it is one I support. If by October 15 we \nhave not made progress toward health care reform, we can consider it \nunder the reconciliation rules.\n  My friends on the other side of the aisle, the Republican side of the \naisle, have protested this saying it is fundamentally unfair, \nunconstitutional, and ungodly. But the fact is, it has been used \nrepeatedly, 18 or 19 times in the last few years, and it has been used \nas frequently, if not more so, on the Republican side of the aisle as \nthe Democratic side. I don't think there is anything inherently evil in \nit unless you are in the minority and it diminishes your power in the \nSenate.\n  Senator Conrad struck the right balance. He gives us a chance to deal \nwith it in a bipartisan fashion but says, if at the end of the day, \nOctober 15, we are not going to have anything to show for our efforts, \nwe can at least consider reconciliation. I think that is a reasonable \napproach.\n  This budget resolution also offers a promising vision when it comes \nto education. The budget will dramatically expand access to quality \nearly childhood education, including Head Start. The budget invests in \nteachers and innovative programs. This budget will help us build the \neducation system we need to compete in the global economy.\n  It is almost a cliche in politics for us to talk about education. \nEvery politician, every candidate does. But the American people know \nintuitively this was their ladder to success. Unless you were born on \nsome crystal staircase, you were lucky enough to get a good education \nand make your way in life. We want to make sure more kids are reached \nearlier in their school years, their learning years, and given that \nchance. This budget does it.\n  It also takes into account the fact that tuition costs are increasing \ndramatically. I left a hearing in the other building of a person who is \nseeking a Federal circuit court judgeship. That is a pretty high-level \nappointment. I\n\n[[Page S4866]]\n\nnoted this man, who is roughly 51 years old and has been a lawyer and a \njudge, at the age of 51 still has over $40,000 in student loans to pay \noff--51 years old, $40,000 left.\n  It is no surprise, if you are putting a child through college and \nthey are fortunate enough to be accepted at a great school, they could \nend up with a great debt. We want to make sure, particularly for those \nin lower income groups, that there is more Federal money available to \nhelp them.\n  Since 2000, the average cost of tuition at a 4-year college has \nincreased by 29 percent, and financial aid has not kept up. This bill \nmoves us toward more financial aid for students.\n\n  Energy is another element the President focused on because if we \ndon't find ourselves more independent when it comes to energy sources, \nwe are not only going to be at the mercy of other countries with these \nenergy resources, our economy cannot thrive the way we want it to. If \nwe are not sensitive to the fact that responsible use of energy would \nmake certain we don't increase global warming and climate change and \njeopardize future generations, we will pay an even heavier price.\n  This budget lays the groundwork for cutting back on energy sources \nthat generate greenhouses gases. The budget proposes we spend less \nmoney burning conventional fuels and more money on cleaner energy \nsources, and it helps us create good-paying jobs in energy pursuit. \nSome of the most exciting areas of our economy--I think the areas that \nwill grow us out of this recession--relate to new visions on energy.\n  I tell the story about the Sears Tower--now called the Willis Tower--\nin Chicago. This magnificent building, built 35 years ago, has 16,000 \nsingle-pane windows--totally energy disastrous. They are going to be \nreplaced, hopefully with energy-efficient windows. And I hope they will \nbe made in Chicago. We have a new plant there that can do it.\n  The point is, at the end of the day, in 3 years, Willis Tower--once \nSears Tower--can recapture the cost of those windows in energy cost \nsavings. In the meantime, we can produce this new window, creating jobs \nfor people to make 16,000 windows. It fits together nicely and it \nreduces the carbon footprint of this building. Buildings are one of the \nmajor sources of pollution in America.\n  Finally, let me say that this conference report provides tax relief \nfor American families when they need it the most, and I hope we can \ncontinue on that.\n  It is sad and disappointing to me that the budget offered in the \nHouse of Representatives, the one we will vote on later, didn't receive \na single Republican vote, not one, not a single vote. The stimulus bill \nthe President brought forward to try to turn the recession around--the \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act--didn't receive a single Republican vote \nin the House of Representatives. Fortunately, three Republican Senators \nstepped up and said they would join us in passing it over here; \notherwise, it wouldn't have happened.\n  Well, in comes the President's budget--an effort to reduce the \ndeficit by half over 4 or 5 years, an effort to make the right \ninvestments--and not a single Republican in the House of \nRepresentatives would support it. They have become the party of ``no'' \nwhen it comes to this Obama administration. He continues to open the \ndoor and invite them in, and too many of them say: No, we are not \ninterested.\n  Well, the American people are interested. The American people voted \nfor change. They voted for new direction and new leadership. And I \ncommend the Senator from North Dakota for bringing this to the floor, \nand I hope we pass it with a convincing vote.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the whip, Senator Durbin, for all \nof the leadership he has provided that has helped us get to this point. \nWe had some pretty direct meetings with some of our colleagues. \nSometimes voices were raised, and there was a lot of energy in the \nroom, but it is that kind of dialog which is essential to getting \nagreement. I think we have done that, and we have achieved it in a way \nthat is responsible and fair, and I thank him very much for his \nleadership and his friendship.\n  Mr. President, Senator Grassley is next, and I would yield--how much \ntime?\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thought they reserved 15 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 15 minutes off Senator Gregg's time to Senator \nGrassley, who is, by the way, let me just say, a very valuable member \nof the Senate Budget Committee, the ranking member of the Finance \nCommittee, and somebody who is extremely constructive. We don't always \nagree. That is the beauty of democracy. But when Senator Grassley \nspeaks, people listen because he has earned their respect.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, the Senator from Iowa is \nrecognized.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. I thank the Chair, and I thank the distinguished \nchairman of the committee for those kind remarks, and I hold him in \nhigh esteem as well.\n  First of all, the budget we are voting on had bipartisan opposition \nin the House of Representatives. Seventeen Democrats voted against this \nbudget. Most of those are what you call conservative Democrats, or \nwhatever title they want. That is what I will call them--fiscally \nconservative Democrats. They think this budget leaves too much of a \nlegacy to our children and grandchildren in the way of debt. So \nbipartisan opposition ought to tell this White House and this majority \nsomething, and I hope in time that will become very clear.\n  Today, the Senate begins its debate on the congressional budget \nresolution, and it will pass shortly, I am sure. The budget process \nstarted, of course, with the President's budget coming to the Hill on \nFebruary 26. That was about 2 months ago. During the committee \nprocess--and I participated in that process, and I participated in the \nfloor process--we faced one key question, and that was: Should we apply \nmore or less budget discipline to the record debts and deficits of my \nPresident, President Obama, on what he inherited January 20, 2009?\n  Over the past few weeks, we have heard a lot about revisionist fiscal \nhistory or it might best be described as heavy editing of recent budget \nhistory. I was pleased to see the distinguished Budget Committee \nchairman make the record clear: President Obama inherited a $1.3 \ntrillion deficit. I agree with that. I don't take exception to that. \nThose are quantifiable facts. Republicans don't disagree that President \nObama inherited a large deficit.\n  One point of clarification, though, needs to be made. The deficit and \nthe debt were bequeathed on a bipartisan basis. That was due to the \nmakeup of the Presidency last time and the Congress over the last 2 \nyears. The Democratic leadership obviously controlled the House and \nSenate during the years those budgets were drawn up--2007 and 2008. The \nDemocratic leadership wrote the tax and spending bills President Bush \nsigned in the last Congress. So congressional Democrats negotiated the \nbailout bill with the Bush administration. Those fiscal policy \ndecisions, though at times very combative, in the end were jointly made \non the one hand by a Congress, controlled by the Democrats, and by the \nadministration, controlled by a Republican President. So it was \nbipartisan.\n  The antirecessionary spending, together with the lower tax receipts \nand the TARP activities, set a fiscal table of a debt of $1.3 trillion. \nThat, in fact, was on the President's desk when he took over the Oval \nOffice on January 20 this year. That is the highest deficit as a \npercentage of the economy in post-World War II history. Not a very \npretty picture, Mr. President.\n  I have a chart here that shows that part of the story, and that part \nof the story is the gray there, as you can see.\n  As predicted a couple of months ago, that picture got a lot uglier \nwith the stimulus bill. So for the folks who saw that bill as an \nopportunity to ``recover'' America, with Government taking a larger \nshare of the economy over the long term, well, they can say: Mission \naccomplished. For those who voted for the stimulus bill--and I didn't--\nyou put us on a path to a bigger role for the Government. Over $1 \ntrillion of new deficit spending was hidden in that bill. It caused \nsome of the extra red ink in this chart.\n\n  So I point to what is called the inherited aspect of the debt, and \nthose are\n\n[[Page S4867]]\n\nthe red bars on top of the gray bars--what was inherited.\n  I think supporters of that bill need to own up to the fiscal course \nthey charted. Again, that is the red line, if you want averages, and it \nis the red bars for what has been done since this President has come to \noffice.\n  To be sure, after the other side pushed through the stimulus bill and \nthe second $350 billion of the TARP bill, CBO reestimated the baseline. \nA portion of this new red ink up front is due to that reestimate. The \nbottom line, however, is that reestimate occurred several weeks--\nseveral weeks--after the President and a more robust Democratic \nmajority took over in January of this year. Decisions were made. And do \nyou know what happens here? Decisions have consequences. So fiscal \nconsequences followed.\n  The budget before us, for the most part, follows the fiscal trail \nblazed by President Obama. As the administration's top budget official \nsaid: This budget is 98 percent like the President's budget. I want to \ncongratulate the chairman on keeping some of the tax priorities of the \nSenate, however. One deals with the alternative minimum tax patch. \nAlthough shorter than I proposed, it is dealt with over 3 years. The \nchairman also kept part of the Senate's middle-income tax relief.\n  But on both the tax and the spending side, we need to take a hard \nlook at what is going on at the end of this budget term--2014. The \nbudget resolution conference report claims to reduce the deficit from \n$1.7 trillion this year to about $520 billion in 2014. However, the \nfinal year of the budget fails to include the revenue loss from the \nalternative minimum tax patch for that year. It fails to include the \nrevenue loss for fully extending the 2001 and 2003 middle-class tax \nrelief, the President's Making Work Pay tax credit, the Medicare \nphysician fix, and natural disasters, but it does include illusory, \nunspecified future discretionary spending cuts. When you add it all up, \nthe thing it fails to do--or claims to do but doesn't--the conference \nreport falls hundreds of billions of dollars short of its claimed \ndeficit reduction.\n  So let's return, then, to the basic question I asked at the very \nbeginning and also asked when we started the budget process several \nweeks ago. The question, once again, is this: Should we apply more or \nless budget discipline to record debts and deficits which my President, \nPresident Obama, inherited on January 20, 2009? This budget does answer \nthat basic question. It makes the fiscal situation even worse. \nInherited debt doesn't stay at its unacceptably high level; it doubles \nto 82 percent of gross national product.\n  So we have another chart here, with the red line going up toward the \ntop in the 10-year outlook that the Congressional Budget Office shows \nto be over 80 percent. Abnormal deficit levels become normal deficit \nlevels. Again, you see here what is normal and what isn't normal. \nLevels once considered a fiscal vice by most people--at, say, the peak \nduring the Bush years--of 3 to 4 percentage points--here in the years \n2007 and 2008, as you can see from the chart--are very dramatically \ndwarfed during the outyears of the President's budget. Fiscal vices \nbecome what? Fiscal habits, under this budget. I would ask anyone \nwhether they define that plan as fiscal discipline.\n  Everyone in this body wants to help get our economy back on track. If \nthe economy gets back on track, everybody wins. From a fiscal \nsituation, there is no better policy development than growing the \neconomy. More economy to be divided over an increasing population, so \nmore economy for more people to have more. If we do not grow the \neconomy, we have less for more people.\n  I think everyone in this body would agree that we ought to grow the \neconomy. Likewise, we know small businesses are an extremely important \npart of our U.S. economy. I like to say that small business is the \nengine that drives the U.S. economy. President Obama agrees that small \nbusinesses have generated 70 percent of the net new jobs over the past \ndecade, and most economists agree with that.\n  One month ago we debated the budget resolution on the Senate floor. \nDuring that debate, the Senate spoke on this point. Senator Cornyn's \nsmall business tax relief amendment passed by an overwhelming 82 to 16; \nin other words, 82 of the people in this body agreed with President \nObama.\n  Senator Snowe had a similar amendment that was accepted by the \nmanagers of the floor bill. Last week the Senate spoke again. This time \nthe question was phrased on a motion to instruct the budget resolution \nconferees on the importance of keeping taxes on small business low. The \nvote grew even more: 84 in favor of it, 9 against it. Unfortunately, \nthe conferees did not adopt the Senate budget resolution protecting \nsmall businesses from tax increases.\n  America's small businesses have been suffering during this recession. \nWe will hear it in our events back home--I do. A very good source of \nanswers on the environment for small businesses is found in the monthly \nsurvey of small businesses, the survey by the National Federation of \nIndependent Business, NFIB, a spokes-organization for small business. \nThey are well known around here. They have been conducting this survey \nfor 35 years.\n  The NFIB membership includes hundreds of thousands of small \nbusinesses all across America. I encourage every Member to check out \nthis important survey and particularly this month's survey.\n  This survey shows some extremely disturbing trends. On credit \navailability, small businesses are getting squeezed very hard. We have \na chart that shows this trend. Particularly, look out here at the year \n2009 on the right side of this chart. It is way down as far as the \npercentage change compared to before. This credit crunch and other \nfactors have contributed to a near record low in the NFIB's index of \nsmall business optimism.\n  I have a chart that puts this data in perspective. We have here, over \na long period of time, the optimism of small business. What you see is \nthe attitude of decisionmakers in small business America. Those are the \ndecisionmakers for businesses that President Obama and Congress agree \nare the businesses most likely to grow or contract jobs. The pessimism \nis at its second lowest point in those 35 years of surveying. The data \nshould concern every policymaker in this town.\n  As bad as the two sets of data are, it gets even worse. This chart \nshows the net increase or decrease in small business hiring plans. The \nsurvey asks the business owner whether he or she planned to expand or \ncontract employment over the next 3 months. As you can see right here, \nit is very negative. This chart shows small business activity \ncontracting tremendously. Small business hiring plans are at their most \nnegative level in the 35-year history of this survey.\n  With this pessimistic environment, we should not be surprised, then, \nthat small businesses are hemorrhaging jobs. The President's recent \nefforts to increase lending to the small business sector are \ncommendable. The centerpiece of the President's small business plan \nwill allow the Federal Government to spend up to $25 billion to \npurchase the small business loans that are now hindering small banks \nand lenders. Unfortunately, very well intentioned as it is, that is a \ndrop in a very empty bucket. Remember, small business accounts for \nabout half of the private sector.\n  Moreover, the positives that will come to small business from this \nrelatively small package of loans which will ultimately have to be paid \nback will be heavily outweighed by the negative impact of the \nPresident's proposed tax increases on those very same small businesses, \nthe business sector. Helping small businesses get loans just to take \nthe money back in the form of tax hikes is not wise. It would be wise \nto make those loans possible, but these tax policies that the President \nis thinking about doing are going to hinder small business.\n  Don't take my word for it. Just today the National Federation of \nIndependent Business wrote to all of us, all the Members of the Senate, \non this point. NFIB's hundreds of thousands of small business owners \noppose this conference report. I ask unanimous consent that a copy of \nthat letter be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n                                            National Federation of\n\n\n                                         Independent Business,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2009.\n       Dear Senator, On behalf of the National Federation of \n     Independent Business (NFIB),\n\n[[Page S4868]]\n\n     the nation's largest small business advocacy organization, I \n     am writing in opposition to S. Con. Res. 13, the fiscal year \n     2010 budget conference report.\n       NFIB is discouraged that the conference report does not \n     contain more relief for small businesses, but instead places \n     more burdens on them. The March small business optimism index \n     hit the second lowest reading in the 35-year history of the \n     NFIB Small Business Economic Trends (SBET) survey, with plans \n     to hire and make capital expenditures at or near an all-time \n     low. Small business is the source of job creation, but \n     economic growth will be stalled if Congress continues \n     unchecked spending while increasing taxes and placing new \n     mandates on America's job creators.\n       Specifically, NFIB is concerned the conference report \n     assumes the top individual tax rates will expire, which would \n     mean a tax increase for some small business owners. \n     Increasing audits and the tax filing burden as a way to close \n     the tax gap would be a direct hit on small businesses. In \n     addition, despite bipartisan support in the Senate for \n     additional relief from the estate tax, this help for small \n     business was removed in the conference.\n       We are also concerned that considering healthcare \n     legislation under the reconciliation process will lead to a \n     bill that does not generate bipartisan support. Essential to \n     the long-term economic stability of our nation's small \n     businesses is the need to address the unsustainable, ever-\n     increasing costs of healthcare. However, reforming the \n     healthcare system is a large undertaking impacting all \n     Americans and--as we have stated repeatedly--must be a \n     bipartisan effort.\n       The budget conference report does not contain the right \n     policy direction for our nation's small businesses, and I \n     encourage you to vote against it.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Susan Eckerly,\n                             Senior Vice President, Public Policy.\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Here is what the NFIB says in that letter:\n\n       NFIB is concerned the conference report assumes the top \n     individual tax rates will expire, which would mean a tax \n     increase from some small business owners.\n\n  Do we really want to raise taxes on these small businesses that \ncreate new jobs and employ two-thirds of all small business workers? \nWith these small businesses already suffering from the credit crunch \nbefore the entire country, do we really think it is wise to hit small \nbusiness again with this double-whammy of a 20 percent increase in \nmarginal tax rates?\n  As we move forward from the budget process, the President and the \ncongressional Democratic leadership have an opportunity to change \ncourse. From my 33 town meetings in Iowa during spring break, they want \nto change that course. There is a lot of concern about the legacy of \ndebt that we are leaving to children and grandchildren. Both budgets \nwould perpetuate the double whammy of constricted credit and high taxes \ndirected at America's job engine, small business.\n  So as I close, in the coming months we Republicans will try to \npersuade our Democratic friends who have all the controls of fiscal \npolicy to change course. One way they can change course is to focus \nlike a laser beam on jump-starting the Nation's job engine--the small \nbusinesses of America. We need to reverse the direction of the sharply \ndownward-sloping arrow that you have seen on some of these charts. That \nis where the President and the Congress agree that we need to get more \njob growth.\n  I quoted the President: 70 percent of the new jobs--small business. \nWe in this party agree with that. As we move on from the budget, let's \nrecognize the reality and the importance of small business.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, let me take a moment to review what is in \nthe resolution before us with respect to taxes because I think it is \nimportant to go over it. The actual tax changes on a net basis in this \npackage are a reduction from current law of $764 billion. We have $512 \nbillion of middle-class tax relief. All of the 2001 and 2003 provisions \nthat provide individuals tax relief to the middle class are provided \nfor for the next 5 years in this budget resolution. The 10 percent \nbracket, marriage penalty relief, all the other 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, \nincluding the child tax credit and the education incentives, all of \nthem are in this budget.\n  We also have alternative minimum tax reform for 3 years, as the \nSenator indicated. We have estate tax reform going to $7 million a \ncouple excluded from any estate tax. That means 99.8 percent of estates \nwould pay nothing, zero.\n  The tax extenders for business are all included for a subtotal of tax \nrelief of $861 billion.\n  On the other side we have $97 billion of tax raises. That $97 billion \nis loophole closers aimed primarily at offshore tax havens and abusive \ntax shelters. Let me just indicate, only 2 percent of taxpayers with \nbusiness income are affected by the changes in the top rate because, \nagain, all the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are extended for those earning \nless than $250,000 a year. Only 2 percent of taxpayers with small \nbusiness income are affected by the top rate changes. That means 98 \npercent are not.\n  Under the definition being used by our colleagues across the aisle, \nformer Vice President Cheney would qualify as a small businessman \nbecause what they are describing as small business people is ``anybody \nwho has on their income tax returns small business income.'' There are \na lot of people who are very big business people, have big businesses, \nwho show small business income on their returns.\n  Vice President Cheney, under the definition used by our colleagues on \nother side of the aisle, like any taxpayer with any small business \nincome, qualifies as a small businessman. Vice President Cheney in 2007 \nhad income of $3 million. He had $180,000 of small business income, \nsmall businesses in which he apparently has an interest. Under their \ndefinition, he is a small businessman.\n  I would say that is a tortured definition. There are people with much \ngreater wealth--under their definition, Bill Gates is a small \nbusinessman. The richest or second richest man in the world is a small \nbusinessman. Under their definition, Warren Buffett is a small \nbusinessman. I don't think so.\n  In the Bush tax cut in 2007, people averaging over $1 million a year \nin income got on average a tax reduction of almost $120,000 a year. The \nvast majority of people got next to nothing, as this chart shows. But \nthose with average incomes of more than $1 million got tax reductions \naveraging $120,000. That is one of the reasons we are in the deep hole \nwe are in.\n  My assertion is, on the loophole closers we have, we can go after \nmoney that is owed that is not now being collected. The tax gap in the \nmost recent year for which there is a calculation, 2006, amounted to \n$345 billion a year, money that is owed that is not being collected. \nThat is the first place we ought to focus before we talk about a tax \nincrease for anyone.\n  The second place we ought to look is these offshore tax havens. These \noffshore tax havens are running amok. Here is the conclusion from our \nown Homeland Security and Government Affairs Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations. This is from their work in 2007:\n\n       Experts have estimated that total loss to the Treasury from \n     offshore tax evasion alone approaches $100 billion per year--\n\n  It is $100 billion a year in these offshore tax haven scams--\n\n     including $40 to $70 billion from individuals and another $30 \n     billion from corporations engaging in offshore tax evasion. \n     Abusive tax shelters add tens of billions of dollars more.\n\n  We do not have to wonder if our own Permanent Subcommittee on \nInvestigations knows what they are talking about. We can just go to the \nnewspaper. Here is February 20 of this year, the New York Times:\n\n       The UBS memo was blunt: The ``Swiss solution'' could help \n     affluent Americans.\n       That message, sent to the bank's executives in July 2004, \n     referred to a UBS plan to help rich customers evade taxes by \n     hiding money in offshore havens like the Bahamas.\n       The memo, along with dozens of e-mail messages like it, \n     were disclosed on Thursday in a blistering court document \n     filed by the Justice Department, which sought to compel UBS, \n     based in Switzerland, to divulge the identities of 52,000 \n     Americans whom the authorities suspect of using secret \n     offshore accounts at the bank to dodge taxes.\n\n  We do not have to use our imaginations very much to figure out what \nis going on. Here is a little five-story building in the Cayman islands \ncalled Ugland House. It claims to be the home of 14,000 companies. Can \nyou see them there in this little five-story building? Do you see them \ndoing their business out of this building, 14,000 companies, supposedly \ndoing business out of this little building down in the Cayman Islands?\n  They are not doing any business out of that building. They are \nengaged in\n\n[[Page S4869]]\n\nmonkey business. What they are doing is an elaborate tax scam, much of \nit revealed in the UBS court documents; much more revealed in the \ncollapse of Stanford Financial, which has shown that there are loads of \ncompanies, loads of individuals, who are engaged in dodging what they \nlegitimately owe the United States by establishing these offshore tax \nhaven locations, where they claim they do business, and all they are \ndoing is dodging taxes.\n  Let me say, most of the largest U.S. corporations have subsidiaries \nin tax havens. Eighty-three of the one hundred largest publicly traded \nU.S. corporations have subsidiaries in tax havens, and 42 of these \ncompanies have subsidiaries in 10 or more tax havens--10 or more.\n  Sixty-three of the one hundred largest U.S. Federal contractors have \nsubsidiaries in tax havens, and 33 of these companies have subsidiaries \nin 10 or more tax havens. Look, anybody who does not see what is going \non is blind.\n  Here is the picture I hope people will pay attention to. This is a \nsewer system in Europe. A sewer system in Europe. What has that got to \ndo with the budget of the United States? Well, it turns out to \nincreasingly have a lot to do with the budget here, because this is a \nsewer system that was bought by a U.S. company that is not in the sewer \nbusiness. They bought this sewer system in Europe to depreciate it on \ntheir books in the United States to suppress taxes they legitimately \nowe here. Do you know what they did. After they bought it so they could \ndepreciate it, they leased it back to the European city they bought it \nfrom and paid for it in the first place.\n  If we do not cut down and stop this kind of scam, shame on us. Shame \non us. And some of our friends over here say that is a tax increase. \nWell, sign me up if that is a tax increase to shut down this kind of \nscam. The vast majority of us pay what we owe, but a few get by with \nestablishing these accounts in these offshore tax havens and engaging \nin these unbelievably abusive tax shelters.\n  So we need tax reform. We have got a tax system that is out of date \nand hurting U.S. competitiveness. We are hemorrhaging revenue. Right \nnow we are only collecting about 75 percent of what is actually due \nunder the current code. So without any tax increases, we can completely \nclose the structural gap between spending and revenue in this country \nif we collect what the current system says is owed.\n  The fact is, the vast majority of us on tax day pay what we owe. But \nincreasingly we have got big companies, wealthy individuals, who are \nnot. Let's end it. Let's end it.\n  The AMT is another problem threatening millions of middle-class \ntaxpayers that we have addressed in this proposal. Additionally, we \nhave a long-term imbalance that must be addressed between spending and \nrevenue. Finally, we need simplification and reform to keep rates low \nfor the vast majority of us who are honest.\n  I have heard the argument on the other side that we have got the \nhighest corporate rate in the world. Well, what is true is we do have \none of the highest nominal tax rates, stated tax rates. But our \neffective tax rate on corporations is among the lowest in the world. \nThat is because, while the statutory rate is 35 percent, the effective \nrate, what companies actually pay, is only 13 percent. When you take \nthat into account, here is where we stack up. Here are the major \nindustrialized countries in the world. Here is the average. Here is \nwhere the United States is. The only countries that have a lower \neffective corporate tax rate than the United States are Slovakia, \nPoland, Austria, and Germany. Everybody else has a higher effective \ncorporate tax rate than do we. I make this review for the purposes of \nestablishing this in the Record.\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to briefly respond to my \nfriend from North Dakota, the chairman of the Budget Committee. The \nchairman was responding to my remarks on small business and the effects \nof proposed 20 percent higher marginal rates on small business owners.\n  The budget brought before us raises taxes on small business owners. \nThere can be no question about it. Here is how it works.\n  The President's budget proposes to raise the top two marginal rates \nfrom 33 percent and 35 percent to 40 percent and 41 percent \nrespectively, when PEP and Pease are fully reinstated. President \nObama's marginal rate increase would mean an approximately 20 percent \nmarginal tax rate increase on small business owners in the top two \nbrackets.\n  Many of my friends on the other side will say that while they agree \nthat successful small businesses are vital to the success of the U.S. \neconomy, the marginal tax increases for the top two brackets will not \nhave a significant negative impact on small businesses. The chairman \nappears to fall into this camp.\n  Proponents of these tax increases, like the distinguished chairman, \nthe senior Senator from North Dakota, seek to minimize their impact by \nreferring to Tax Policy Center data that indicate about 2 percent of \nsmall business filers pay taxes in the top two brackets. In testimony \nbefore the Senate Finance Committee, Dr. Bob Greenstein, director of \nthe liberal think tank, Center on Budget Policy and Priorities, also \nused that figure. Moreover, Secretary Geithner has testified that this \nTreasury Department agrees with that figure. They argue that a minimal \namount of small business activity is affected.\n  However, there are two faulty assumptions to this small business \nfiler argument.\n  The first faulty assumption is that the percentage of small business \nfilers is static. In fact, small businesses move in and out of gain and \nloss status depending on the nature of the business and business cycle. \nThe nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation has indicated that, for \n2011, approximately 3 percent of small business filers will be hit by \nthese proposed higher rates. These statistics compare to a 2007 \ntreasury which showed 7 percent of flow-through business owners paying \nthe top rate. In the latest analysis, when the impact of the \nalternative minimum tax--AMT--is fully included, that percentage may \ndrop some.\n  Small Business Administration--SBA--data provide evidence of the \ndynamic nature of small business. You can find that data on the SBA Web \nsite in its frequently asked questions discussion. The website is \nwww.sba.gov/advo. According to SBA, 67 percent of small businesses \nsurvive for 2 years; 44 percent of small businesses survive at least 4 \nyears; and 31 percent of small businesses survive at least 7 years.\n  The second faulty assumption is that the level of small business \nactivity, including employment, is proportionate to the filer \npercentage.\n  According to NFIB survey data, 50 percent of owners of small \nbusinesses that employ 20-249 workers would fall in the top two \nbrackets. You can see it right here on this chart.\n  According to the SBA, about two-thirds of the Nation's small business \nworkers are employed by small businesses with 20-500 employees.\n  Newly developed data from the Joint Committee on Taxation \ndemonstrates that 55 percent of the tax from the higher rates will be \nborne by small business owners with income over $250,000. This is a \nconservative number, because it doesn't include flow-through business \nowners making between $200,000 and $250,000 that will also be hit with \nthe budget's proposed tax hikes.\n  Now, as is frequently the case in debate, the proponent of an idea \nseeks to change the nature of the debate by changing the question. We \nwitnessed a bit of that this afternoon.\n  Notice the distinguished chairman did not dispute the basic thrust of \nthe points I raised. Instead, he said, we, on this side, used an unfair \nor inappropriate definition of small business. He cited examples of \nformer Vice President Cheney and Microsoft founder Bill Gates, Jr. The \npoint seems to be that the 750,000 flow-through small business owners, \nagain those most likely to expand or contract their workforces, who \nwill be in the bulls-eye of the 20 percent higher marginal rates, \nshould be ignored. We should focus instead on one or two examples. The \npoint seems to be that it is fine to target the large group of small \nbusiness owners if you can find a Cheney or Gates example.\n  On this point, I direct the distinguished chairman and the full \nSenate to the Treasury Conference on Business Taxation and Global \nCompetitiveness Background Paper. It was put out on\n\n[[Page S4870]]\n\nJuly 26, 2007. The current Treasury is spending some time updating this \ndata and will be incorporating the full effect of the alternative \nminimum tax--AMT--for 2011. If colleagues examine the study at page 20, \ntable 3.3, they will find an insightful analysis. The study sorted \nTreasury data for flow-through entities. The analysis sorted the data \nto isolate active manager/owners from the broader pool of all flow-\nthrough filers. When so sorted, Treasury found that the lion's share of \nincome and tax was still born by those manager/owners. I ask consent to \nhave printed in the Record a copy of the Treasury table.\n  Even the Tax Policy Center, an institution in accord with President \nObama and the congressional Democratic leadership's goal of raising the \ntop rates on small business, shows a large slug of active small \nbusiness income in taxpayers in the top two brackets. I will ask \nconsent to include a TPC chart printed in the Record.\n  The proponents of a tax increase of up to 20 percent in the marginal \nrates of small business owners should bear the burden to disprove the \nconcerns those on our side have raised. Perhaps they could work with \nSenator Snowe, Senator Cornyn and others to craft an exception that \nshields the small businesses that employ two-thirds of all small \nbusiness workers from the tax increase. Pointing to an extreme example, \nlike a Vice-President Cheney or a Bill Gates, Jr., may make great sound \nbites for politics.\n  It, however, will not amuse the small business owners who have worked \nhard to build a business. It won't amuse the workers they need to \nlayoff. It won't amuse the suppliers they have to curtail purchases \nfrom. The bottom line is the budget contains a tax increase that is \naimed at small businesses most likely to expand or contract. That tax \nincrease is significant and real to those small business owners. They, \nnot the politicians voting in the tax increase, will have to deal with \nthe added tax burden.\n  Last week, a strong bipartisan group of 84 Senators agreed there is a \nproblem here. We are raising taxes on Small Business America. We ought \nto be careful.\n  Throwing out a red herring involving Vice-President Cheney or Bill \nGates, Jr. doesn't deal with the problem we have raised.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have the materials to which \nI referred printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n

I note my colleague Senator Sanders, who is an important \nmember of the Budget Committee, is here. I ask the Senator how much \ntime does he seek?\n  Mr. SANDERS. I need 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I would be happy to yield 5 minutes. If the Senator would \nlike more at the end of that time, he only needs to ask.\n  Mr. SANDERS. I thank the chairman for yielding. I want to \ncongratulate him and his staff for the excellent work they have done on \nthis budget, which I certainly will be voting for.\n  What I wanted to do is to take a brief moment to highlight a \nprovision in the budget resolution that I introduced, along with \nSenators Feingold, Webb, and Bunning. That deals with the outrage that \nexists in our country at what happened last year and this year on Wall \nStreet. I think, as most Americans know, as a result of the greed, the \nrecklessness, the illegal behavior we have seen within some of our \nlargest financial institutions, our country and, in fact, much of the \nworld, has been plunged into a very deep recession which has cost \nmillions of Americans their jobs, their homes, their savings, and their \nability to get a higher education.\n  A lot of people are suffering because of the greed and recklessness \nof Wall Street. In my view, the regulatory efforts of the last several \ndecades, which I strongly opposed as a member of the House Financial \nServices Committee, have proven to be a grotesque failure.\n  The bottom line is, when you deregulate Wall Street, they do what we \nwould expect that they do; that is, they do anything and everything \nthey can to make as much profit as they can in as short a period of \ntime as they can, no matter how recklessly they behave in the process.\n  They create a bubble. When that bubble bursts, as it surely would, \nthe American people are left holding the bag in the midst of a very \ndeep recession. In my view it goes without saying that we must restore \nregulations on Wall Street.\n\n[[Page S4871]]\n\n  One part of that process is to bring about substantially increased \ntransparency. It is beyond comprehensive, it is absurd, that trillions \nof dollars in credit default swaps and other exotic and complicated \nfinancial instruments are traded every single day with no public \nunderstanding about who owns these instruments or the impact these \ntrades are having on the world's financial system.\n  I am happy to note that as one small step forward in terms of \ntransparency, this budget resolution incorporates provisions that \npassed the Senate by a 59-to-39 strongly bipartisan vote. What that \namendment does is quite simple: It adds the reality that in the midst \nof this financial crisis, the Federal Reserve has lent out over $2 \ntrillion to financial institutions. If you were to ask the American \npeople, if you were to ask any Member of this Senate, any Member of the \nHouse, who received that money, which financial institutions got it, \nand what the terms are that they received it are, nobody would be able \nto tell you. No one in this country understands it, because that has \nbeen kept secret.\n  What the provision that I introduced into the budget resolution does \nis simply say: We have got to make that public. The American people \nhave a right to know who is getting those loans and what the terms are.\n  I am delighted that that provision is in the budget resolution. In my \nview, this is a small step forward in fighting for transparency within \nthe Fed. It is a smaller step forward, overall, in beginning the reform \nmeasures that we need to create a new Wall Street, so that never again \nwill we be placed in the position that we have been over the last few \nmonths.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, again I thank Senator Sanders for his kind \nremarks and for his contributions to the work of the Budget Committee. \nHe has been a very energetic and important member. He has done an \noutstanding job of questioning witnesses before the committee, and he \nhas also been someone who has worked very hard on community clinics, \nwhich I think are going to make a great difference across the country. \nThere is a very significant increase for those clinics in this \nresolution, and the person responsible and the person who deserves \ncredit is the Senator from Vermont, Mr. Sanders. We thank him for that \ncontribution.\n  We are now approaching the 4 o'clock hour. We have Senator Coburn who \nwishes to come and speak at roughly 4:30; Senator McCain, whom I \nunderstand wishes to speak at roughly 4:45; I understand that Senator \nUdall from Colorado wishes speak as in morning business. I want to \nalert his staff, if they are listening, this would be a good time for \nhim to come and speak, because we have some time between now and when \nwe expect Senator Coburn.\n  I hope we are able to move to a vote soon after Senator McCain \nconcludes his remarks. But we have yet to hear definitively that that \nwill be the case.\n  I want to very briefly go over what I think is important about this \nbudget. First, it preserves the President's key priorities of reducing \nour dependence on foreign energy, which is critically important to our \nnational security and our economic security; a focus on excellence in \neducation, because if we are not the best educated, we are not going to \nbe the most powerful country for very long; and, third, fundamental \nhealth care reform.\n  We are on a course that is completely unsustainable in health care. \nWe are spending nearly 18 percent of our gross domestic product on \nhealth care. That is $1 of every $6 in this country. But we are on a \ntrend line to spend 37 percent of our gross domestic product on health \ncare. That is more than $1 in every $3. That can not be the outcome. \nThat will put us at a huge disadvantage both in terms of \ncompetitiveness in this global economy, and it would have devastating \nconsequences on American patients, American consumers, American \nfamilies, American business.\n  We know we need fundamental health care reform. The President has put \nthat front and center before the Congress of the United States, and it \nis accommodated in this budget resolution. No. 4, we have the extension \nof middle-class tax cuts, over $700 billion in tax cuts included in \nthis bill, most of it directed at the middle class.\n  In addition, this budget reduces the deficit by two-thirds over 5 \nyears. Relative to GDP, we are reducing the deficit by more than that, \nby three-quarters between now and 2014, from 12 percent of GDP in 2010, \nto 3 percent of GDP in 2014. Those are the fundamentals of this budget.\n  Is it perfect? There is no document that is prepared by the hand of \nmen and women that is perfect. So we understand this is not a perfect \ndocument. This is the product of compromise between 435 Members of the \nHouse of Representatives and 100 Members of the Senate. This is purely \na congressional document. It does not become law. It is not signed by \nthe President of the United States. It is a document to guide the \nspending and the revenues of the United States for the next 5 years.\n  Obviously, since we do another budget next year, the most important \nthing is what this budget does over the next year.\n  Remember that this President inherited an extremely difficult \nsituation--massive deficits, an economy that was in the worst shape \nsince the Great Depression, a circumstance in which the United States \nis having two wars. This President inherited a very tough situation.\n  We also know we are starting to see the signs of a turn in terms of \nconsumer spending, in terms of housing sales, in terms of automobile \nsales. For the first time, we are seeing an improvement. Last week we \nhad before us in our caucus Mr. Bernanke, Chairman of the Federal \nReserve, who said he sees the economy turning, that the precipitous \ndownturn seems to have stopped or ebbed at least, and he sees the \nprospect of the beginning of recovery later this year. We all hope that \nis the case.\n  This budget is an important part of an overall economic recovery \nstrategy. While we have not adopted precisely the budget the President \nsent us, there is good reason for that. Because from the time the \nPresident's people made their estimates of the revenue available over \nthe next 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office, some months later, \ndid a new estimate which is the basis for our budget. The President's \nbudget had $2 trillion more available to him when he wrote his budget \nthan we have had available to us in writing our budget. That \nnecessitated changes in order to achieve the deficit reduction he had \ncalled for and the deficit reduction most economists say is \nfundamentally necessary.\n  We wrote a 5-year budget, not a 10-year budget. Of the 34 budgets \nthat have been written under the Congressional Budget Act, 30 of the 34 \nhave been 5-year budgets. Why is that? Because forecasts for 10 years \nare notoriously unreliable. That is why Congress, 30 of the 34 times it \nhas done a budget, has done 5-year budgets because the forecasts, even \nthen, for the outyears were highly suspect. When we are talking about a \n10-year forecast, that is just throwing a dart.\n  That is where we are. We have worked in a credible way to fashion a \nbudget document that meets the needs of the American people, that puts \nus in a better position for the future. I freely acknowledge we must do \nmuch more, especially in the second 5 years. It is absolutely \nimperative we do more to get our long-term financial house in order. \nThat is going to require entitlement reform--Medicare, Social Security. \nThat is going to require tax reform because we have a tax system that \nis only collecting about 75 percent of the money due and owed under the \ncurrent tax rates. We wouldn't need any tax increase of any kind to \nbalance the books if we would just collect what is due and owed under \nthe current system. Unfortunately, while the vast majority of us pay \nwhat we owe, we have an increasing number of people and companies that \ndon't. That has to stop.\n  With that, I thank the Chair and suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  We are expecting Senator Coburn at roughly 4:30, Senator McCain at \nroughly 4:45, and Senator Udall of Colorado. If he is available and his \npeople are within earshot, this would be a good time for him to come \nand use the time he has requested.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n\n[[Page S4872]]\n\n  Mr. CONRAD. I ask unanimous consent that the order for the quorum \ncall be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Bennet). Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I have received information now that Senator Udall will \nbe with us at roughly 4:15. Senator Udall at 4:15 for 10 minutes and \nthen Senator Coburn at 4:30 for 10 or 15 minutes and then Senator \nMcCain at 4:45 for roughly 15 minutes. I am not asking unanimous \nconsent because we don't want to be locked in if one of them comes \nbefore another. We don't want to be wasting time. I may need time to \nrespond to what other Senators might offer. We are hopeful that if \nthere are any others who wish to speak, they will let their respective \ncloakrooms know.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, it is my understanding Senator Udall of \nColorado would like to speak as in morning business.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Correct.\n  Mr. CONRAD. How much time would the Senator like?\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Ten minutes maximum.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I yield 10 minutes to the Senator from \nColorado as in morning business.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Colorado.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North \nDakota and thank him for his great work on behalf of this important \nbudget we are going to adopt in short order.\n\n\n                             Line-Item Veto\n\n  Mr. President, I rise in support of the Budget Enforcement \nLegislative Tool Act my colleague from Delaware, Senator Carper, is \nintroducing today.\n  I am also pleased to be a cosponsor of the Congressional and Line-\nItem Veto Act, introduced recently by Senator Feingold.\n  Both bills have my support and the support of other Democrats and \nRepublicans who typically fall on opposite sides of the ideological \ndivide. But while we may disagree with each other on many issues, we \nagree that a constitutionally sound version of the line-item veto will \nhelp increase both fiscal responsibility and congressional \naccountability--both of which have been in short supply in recent \nyears.\n  Establishing a line-item veto has long been a goal of mine. Three \nyears ago, I introduced legislation in the House--the SLICE Act--to \nestablish a legislative line-item veto, and I worked with \nRepresentative Paul Ryan from Wisconsin, a Republican, in the House to \npass similar legislation in June 2006. We reintroduced that legislation \nin the House again in the last Congress.\n  As we worked to advance this bill in the House, Senator Feingold and \nSenator Carper were each working on similar bills in the Senate, and \nthey have again introduced their bills in the 111th Congress. While \ntheir bills differ in the details, they are both intended to employ the \nlegislative line-item veto as a tool to help rein in unnecessary \nspending and begin the difficult work of reducing budget deficits.\n  These goals have a greater urgency than ever before. Why? Over the \nlast decade, we have seen a dramatic change in the Federal budget--a \nchange for the worse. We have gone from Federal budget surpluses to \nenormous deficits and from reducing the national debt to increasing the \n``debt tax'' on our children.\n  We know how this has happened: tax cuts that did not grow the \neconomy, wars that have been financed by borrowing, reckless earmark \nspending, and a deep recession. We know today's economic crisis has \nrequired that we stimulate job creation with public sector spending to \nprevent another Great Depression.\n  Our challenge is daunting. In the short term, we must spur the \neconomy back to life, even at the risk of incurring historic deficits, \nand yet still lay the foundation for dramatic deficit reduction in the \nlong term.\n  We have heard some say deficits do not matter. But this cannot go on \nforever. The President's own Budget Director agrees that if recent CBO \nprojections are accurate, we could see a deficit exceeding 5 percent of \ngross domestic product--clearly, a dangerously high level that many \neconomists across the spectrum believe is not sustainable.\n  No one wants our country, no one wants America, to suffer from the \ncrippling hyperinflation that plagued Germany after the First World War \nor the combination of economic decline and inflation--which we called \nstagnation--some of us remember from the 1970s. Again, this means \nlaying a foundation for entitlement reform and deficit reduction. This \nmeans using every tool in our toolbox and creating new ones, if \nnecessary, to attack this problem.\n  I am a strong supporter of the economic recovery package we passed in \nFebruary. I say to the Presiding Officer, it will be important for our \nhome State of Colorado. But I am also mindful that we are borrowing \nfrom our children and grandchildren to save the economy from collapse. \nThat makes it all the more important that the spending we engage in \ntoday is wise and necessary.\n  A legislative line-item veto will give Congress and the President a \ntool to keep our spending decisions both wise and necessary.\n  I say to the Presiding Officer, many Presidents from both parties \nhave asked for the kind of line-item veto that can be used by Governors \nin our home State of Colorado and several other States. In 1996, \nCongress actually passed a law intended to give President Clinton that \nkind of authority. However, in 1998, the Supreme Court ruled that the \nlegislation was unconstitutional--and I think the Court got it right.\n  By trying to allow the President, in effect, to repeal a part of the \nlaw he has already signed and saying it takes a two-thirds vote in both \nHouses of Congress to restore that part--the Congress of 1996 went too \nfar. I think that kind of line-item veto would undermine the checks and \nbalances between the executive and legislative branches of the \nGovernment.\n  But the SLICE Act I introduced in 2006 and the bills Senator Carper \nand Senator Feingold have introduced in this Congress are different. \nThey are practical, effective, and, best of all, constitutional \nversions of a line-item veto.\n  Current law says the President can ask Congress to rescind; that is, \ncancel, spending items. But the Congress can ignore those requests and \noften has done so. These bills will change that. Under the Carper and \nFeingold bills, the President could identify specific spending items he \nthinks should be cut, and Congress would have to vote up or down on \nwhether to cut each of them.\n  This legislation--don't get me wrong--would give the President a \npowerful tool, but it would also retain the balance between the \nexecutive and legislative branches.\n  Presidents are elected to lead, and only they represent the entire \nNation. These bills recognize that by giving the President the \nleadership role of identifying specific spending items he thinks should \nbe cut.\n  But under the Constitution, it is the Congress that is primarily \naccountable to the American people for how their tax dollars will be \nspent. The legislation respects and emphasizes that congressional role \nby requiring a vote on each spending cut proposed by the President.\n  Of course, without knowing--and I think the Presiding Officer would \njoin me in this sentiment--what the President might propose to rescind, \nI do not know, in a speculative fashion, if I could support those \nproposals. But I do know people in Colorado and across the country \nbelieve there must be greater transparency in our decisions on taxing \nand spending. I know they are also demanding we take responsibility for \nthose decisions. That is the purpose of the Carper and Feingold bills.\n  If there was ever a time in our history when we needed to reassure \nthe American people that Congress understands the need for reform and \nintegrity in the process of spending taxpayer dollars, it is now. Along \nwith reform of the earmark process and other reform measures, I believe \nthe legislative line-item veto is an essential tool in restoring public \nconfidence and trust in the legislative process.\n\n[[Page S4873]]\n\n  The American people expect Federal spending will reflect critical \nnational priorities and broader public purpose. Most of all, they \nexpect Congress to pass funding bills in ways that ensure wise use of \ntaxpayer dollars. These are the purposes of this legislation. We must \nreassure the American people that their dollars--and the debt future \ngenerations incur as a result of our spending--will be debated in the \nsunshine of public scrutiny.\n  Mr. President, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from Colorado. He has \nbeen such a bright addition to this Chamber, and we are delighted he is \nhere. He comes very well respected from the House of Representatives. \nWe count ourselves fortunate to have him participating in this budget \ndiscussion, and I look forward to working with him in the future.\n  Mr. UDALL of Colorado. Mr. President, I thank the Senator from North \nDakota for those sentiments. I look forward to working with him on the \nvery important work to balance the needs of this country when it comes \nto spending but also to make sure we do not pass on unsustainable debt \nto our children. He has been a leader in this effort, and I look \nforward to working at his side in the future days and months and years \nto come.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank the Senator.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, I will support this conference report, \nbut I do so with great reluctance. Given the irresponsible and even \nreckless budget policies of the previous administration, our highest \nbudget priority must be to get back onto a fiscally responsible budget \npath. This budget resolution does that. It may not go as far as I would \nlike with respect to reducing annual budget deficits, but it is a \nsignificant improvement over what we have experienced during the past 8 \nyears.\n  Moreover, the budget resolution sets this path under the most \nchallenging of conditions. The Bush administration's legacy is one not \nonly of fiscal recklessness, but also of economic recession, crisis in \nthe financial markets, and a housing market in collapse. Even without \nthe cost of cleaning up a set of international security policies that \nundermined our national security and cost trillions of dollars, this \nbudget has been the most demanding a President has had to write since \nthe Great Depression. And by and large it addresses our national \npriorities in a responsible manner.\n  However, there are some features of this resolution with which I take \nexception, most notably the use of reconciliation as a tool to expedite \nhealth care reform. The arguments over the use of reconciliation are \nfamiliar to this body. Sadly, a tool intended to streamline the painful \nprocess of deficit reduction has been used to clear a path for major \npolicy changes that have, at best, only a passing relationship to \nreducing the budget deficit. This is not the first budget resolution to \nabuse the special budget procedures to ease the enactment of \nsignificant and potentially controversial policy changes. Perhaps the \ngrossest misuse of reconciliation was to pass sweeping changes to the \nTax Code in 2001 and 2003 that far from reducing the deficit actually \nexploded annual budget deficits and government debt. Indeed, we are \nstill living with the downstream effects of those fiscally reckless \nmeasures that have left us less able to meet either the current \neconomic crisis or our long-term fiscal challenges.\n  I had hoped that with a new President in the White House and \nDemocrats in control of both Chambers we could restore a respect for \nthe proper use of budget procedures. But while the budget we pass today \nis a huge improvement over those submitted by the previous \nadministration, both with respect to honest budgeting and the fiscal \npath it embraces, its misuse of reconciliation to advance policy \npriorities is regrettable.\n  I opposed using reconciliation when it was abused by the other party \nto enact fiscally reckless tax cuts and when it was attempted to be \nused to open up the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil drilling. I \nopposed it earlier in this debate as a way to expedite climate change \nlegislation, and I oppose it now as a vehicle to fast-track health care \nreform.\n  Congressional leadership indicate they may not need to use \nreconciliation to enact health care reform, that it will be used only \nas a last option to ensure Congress acts on that vitally important \nissue. That may be, and I certainly hope this body will pass a health \ncare reform measure under regular procedures. Health care reform is \nlong overdue, and I look forward to the Senate finally acting on an \nissue that is so important to my constituents. But let's not kid \nourselves. It is no more appropriate to use reconciliation as a hammer \nto push through health care reform under regular procedures than it is \nto use it directly to enact those reforms. Both are abuses. Both \nundermine its original intent. Both invite even greater abuses in the \nfuture.\n  Mr. BYRD. Mr. President, I like this budget. I support many of the \npolicies that the President's budget embraces including middle-class \ntax relief, and badly needed investments in our Nation's infrastructure \nbut I cannot, and I will not, vote to authorize the use of the \nreconciliation process to expedite passage of health care reform \nlegislation or any other legislative proposal that ought to be debated \nat length by this body.\n  Using reconciliation to ram through complicated, far-reaching \nlegislation is an abuse of the budget process. The writers of the \nBudget Act, and I am one, never intended for its reconciliation's \nexpedited procedures to be used this way. These procedures were \nnarrowly tailored for deficit reduction. They were never intended to be \nused to pass tax cuts or to create new Federal regimes. Additionally, \nreconciliation measures must comply with section 313 of the Budget Act, \nknown as the Byrd Rule, which means that whatever health legislation is \nreported from the Finance Committee or legislation from any other \ncommittee that is shoe-horned into reconciliation will sunset after 5 \nyears. Additionally, numerous other nonbudgetary provisions of any such \nlegislation will have to be omitted under reconciliation. This is a \nvery messy way to achieve a goal like health care reform, and one that \nwill make crafting the legislation more difficult.\n  Whatever abuses of the budget reconciliation process which have \noccurred in the past, or however many times the process has been \ntwisted to achieve partisan ends does not justify the egregious \nviolation done to the Senate's constitutional purpose. The Senate has a \nunique institutional role.\n  It is the one place in all of government where the rights of the \nnumerical minority are protected. As long as the Senate preserves the \nright to debate and the right to amend we hold true to our role as the \nFramers envisioned. We were to be the cooling off place where proposals \ncould be examined carefully and debated extensively, so that flaws \nmight be discovered and changes might be made. Remember, Democrats will \nnot always control this Chamber, the House of Representatives or the \nWhite House. The worm will turn. Some day the other party will again be \nin the majority, and we will want minority rights to be shielded from \nthe beartrap of the reconciliation process.\n  Under reconciliation's gag rule there are 20 hours of debate or less \nif time is yielded back, and little or no opportunity to amend. Those \nrestrictions mean that whatever is nailed into reconciliation by the \nmajority will likely emerge as the final product. With critical matters \nsuch as a massive revamping of our health care system which will impact \nthe lives of every citizen of our great land, the Senate has a duty to \ndebate and amend and explain in the full light of day, however long \nthat may take, what it is we propose, and why we propose it. The \ncitizens who sent us here deserve that explanation and they should \ndemand it. We must not run roughshod over minority views. A minority \ncan be right. An amendment can vastly improve legislation. Debate can \nexpose serious flaws. Ramrodding and railroading have no place when it \ncomes to such matters as our people's healthcare. The President came to \nthe White House promising a bipartisan government because he knew how \nsick and tired the American public is of scorched earth politics. I \ndaresay President Obama should not be in favor of the destruction of \nthe institutional purpose of this Senate in which he served any more \nthan he would bless a rigged psuedo-debate on\n\n[[Page S4874]]\n\nhealthcare, completely absent minority input.\n  While I support the admirable budget priorities outlined in this \nresolution, I cannot and will not condone legislation that puts \npolitical expediency ahead of the time-honored purpose of this \ninstitution.\n Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. President, I am firmly opposed to this \nproposed budget conference report. It is, I sadly conclude, the most \nirresponsible budget in the history of the Republic. This budget will \nincrease nondefense discretionary spending in 2010 9.7 percent over \nthis year's levels.\n  As a result of this reckless spending, the budget proposal doubles \nthe national debt to $11.5 trillion in only 5 years, and will nearly \ntriple it in 10. The amount of money we spend each year to pay the \ninterest on this debt will also soar because of the conference report. \nThis year alone we will spend $170 billion to service the national \ndebt. In 5 years we are projected to spend $428 billion on interest \npayments in that year alone, and we will likely spend over $800 billion \nin 2019 to pay the interest on our national debt alone. By comparison, \nthe Federal Government spends less than $100 billion a year on \neducation, and about $40 billion a year on highways. In 10 years, this \nbudget will spend more on interest payments on our national debt than \nit spends on education and highway funding combined.\n  I am also disappointed that the conference report includes \nreconciliation instructions to expedite sweeping changes to our \nNation's health care laws under special rules that limit debate and \nrequire only a simple majority for final passage. The purpose of \nreconciliation is to maintain fiscal control over the Government, not \nto fundamentally change the government's policies. The American people \ndeserve a robust and full debate on the merits of health care reform. \nUsing the reconciliation process to move health care legislation would \npreclude the reasoned and informed debate necessary to ensure that the \nbest possible policy is enacted. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to \noppose this dangerous budget.\n  Mr. DURBIN Mr. President, today the Senate will vote on final passage \nof the budget resolution conference report for fiscal year 2010.\n  We will be voting on fundamental decisions about the shape of our \neconomy and the prosperity of our country.\n  We need to face the facts--we have inherited the worst economic \ncrisis in generations.\n  We took an important first step in returning our Nation to prosperity \nearlier this year by passing the economic recovery package.\n  The Obama administration continues to work hard to repair our \nfinancial system so that businesses can make payroll and families can \nborrow for college.\n  But there is much more to do to put our economy back on track, and \nthe budget resolution conference report we are considering follows the \nprinciples President Obama laid out in his budget proposal.\n  This budget resolution sets a path to regain the balance our country \nonce enjoyed--careful investments in our future, while creating \nopportunity for working families who have lost ground over the last \ndecade.\n  It provides the flexibility the authorizing committees need to tackle \nour toughest challenges.\n  And it begins to repair years of neglect by making critical \ninvestments to recover economically--particularly in health care, \neducation, and energy.\n  We need to reform our health care system fundamentally, and we need \nto do it this year. This budget gives the Congress the flexibility we \nneed to get this job done.\n  The budget resolution includes a deficit-neutral reserve fund that \nwill allow the Finance and HELP Committees to take on the challenge of \nfundamental health care reform this year.\n  We hope to work on a bipartisan basis to reform the system in a way \nthat benefits all Americans--patients, providers, insurers, and the \ntaxpayers.\n  But if the Republicans decide to try to obstruct these reforms, the \nreconciliation instructions included in this budget give us the tools \nwe need to pass meaningful reform.\n  Those instructions don't take effect until October 15, and so we have \nseveral months to work together before reconciliation is even an \noption.\n  I very much hope that we don't need to use this approach. But reform \ncan no longer wait.\n  The budget resolution conference report also offers a promising \nvision for education. First, the budget will dramatically expand access \nto quality early childhood education programs, including Head Start. \nAnd the budget invests in teachers and innovative programs so that all \nchildren can succeed in the classroom.\n  This budget will help us build the education system we need to \ncompete in the global economy, not just today, but in the next \ngeneration.\n  This budget would also help families afford the high cost of tuition \nby raising the maximum Pell grant award and streamlining student loan \nprograms.\n  The cost of college is higher than ever before. Since 2000, the \naverage cost of tuition at public 4-year college has increased 29 \npercent, far outpacing inflation and increases in household income.\n  Financial aid hasn't kept up these costs. Thirty years ago, a Pell \ngrant could cover 77 percent of public college costs. Now it covers \njust 35 percent.\n  The budget would increase Pell grants to $5,550, which will help the \n7 million students who rely on these grants pay for college.\n  We can't transform our education system overnight. But we can start \nto provide the investments and the programs that will help to get us \nthere soon. This budget would do just that.\n  This budget also starts the process of reducing our dependence on \nforeign energy by funding the President's request for energy funding in \n2010.\n  This budget also lays the groundwork for cutting back on energy \nsources that generate greenhouse gases.\n  The budget proposes we spend less money burning conventional fuels \nand more money developing cleaner energy sources.\n  This budget helps us create good jobs, dramatically improve energy \nefficiencies, and protect the environment before climate change \ninflicts permanent damage.\n  Finally, the conference report provides for tax relief to American \nfamilies at a time when that relief is much needed.\n  The budget provides $764 billion in tax cuts, mostly to the middle \nclass.\n  The conference report provides $512 billion to extend middle-class \ntax cuts such as the child tax credit, marriage penalty relief, and \neducation incentives.\n  It includes $214 billion for 3 years of alternative minimum tax \nreform.\n  The budget matches the President's estate tax proposal, which would \npermanently extend the 2009 exemption of $7 million for couples and \nindex that for inflation.\n  And the resolution provides $63 billion for 2 years of ``tax \nextenders'' for businesses and individuals.\n  Preparing a budget is about making choices.\n  It is a moral document, one that describes what you believe in.\n  The conference report prepared by the Budget Committee would make \ncritical investments in our Nation's highest priorities, at a time when \nAmerica needs them most.\n  This budget would provide a little bit of help to hard-working \nfamilies that desperately need it.\n  This budget would bring true, long-lasting change to America that is \nsmart, fair, and responsible.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The bill clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. COBURN. Mr. President, I wish to spend a few minutes talking \nabout the budget that is before us and make some simple notes.\n  In 73 pages, this budget spends $3.5 trillion in 1 year. That is an \nastounding amount of money. It spends $17.9 trillion, at a minimum, \nover the next 5 years.\n  This budget is more than a document full of numbers. It is a \nstatement of priorities. My feeling is it does not address some of the \nkey fundamental challenges we face as a nation. In fact, it is going to \nmake some of the challenges we have worse because we are\n\n[[Page S4875]]\n\ngoing to be spending money we don't have on things we don't need. Every \nfamily in this country today, as we know by decreased consumer \nspending, is making hard choices. They are making priorities. Their \npriorities are: How do we do the absolute minimum necessary, as well as \nhow do we say we are going to have the largest savings rate we have had \nin 40, 50 years in this country so we can save for tomorrow? Most of \nthe time, those families are not just thinking about the adult members \nof those families; most of the time those families are making those \ndecisions because they are thinking into the future about their \nchildren.\n\n  We are not doing that with this budget. As a matter of fact, the only \nthing we are thinking about in this budget for our children is how much \nwe are going to put on their backs because we refuse to face the \nrealities of living within our means as every family is trying to do \nout there today. We are going to transfer a doubling of the publicly \nheld debt. Over the next 5 years, it is going to double, and over the \nnext 10 years it is going to triple.\n  That is going to have a serious impact on us as a nation, but it is \ngoing to have a personal impact on every young child out there today. \nLet me tell my colleagues what the impact is going to be. We are going \nto steal opportunity from them because we refused to make the hard \nchoices today. The impact is going to be that a large portion of them \naren't going to be able to afford to go to college. We know education \nis one of the areas that advance our society, that create opportunities \nfor American exceptionalism, that create opportunities for advancement \nof all through education. Yet the things we are doing today, by \nstealing the money from them in the future and burdening them with an \ninterest obligation that most of them won't earn the amount we are \ngoing to have to pay every year, seem to me to be penny wise and pound \nfoolish.\n  The other thing this document does is it has go-pay. It doesn't have \npay-go in it; it has go and pay. What it says is: We are not going to \nbe responsible, so you--meaning the next two generations--you go and \npay for it. We claim pay-go, but, as seen in all of the documents, \nthere is no pay-go application to the biggest expenditures in this \nbill. We just take it off line and we allow us to create all of these \nnew programs and new items. Yet we don't have to be responsible to make \nthe hard choices about what is important, what is a priority, and what \nis not a priority.\n  Last year, families across this country saw less than a 2-percent \nincrease in their incomes. After a 9-percent across-the-board--not \ncounting the stimulus, just the omnibus bill--we are going to then bump \nup another 7.2 percent. So we are going to grow the Government 4 times \nfaster than the income increase was last year, and now we are going to \ngrow it 3\\1/2\\ times more, faster, than what personal income has risen \nand 70 times greater than what the net inflation is going to be. That \nis called real spending, real growing the Federal Government, not \nmaking the hard choices. What it results in, in spite of what we call \nit--whether it is my favorite pet program or somebody else's--what it \nresults in is less liberty, less freedom for the generations that will \nfollow. You tell me a country where you can have real freedom when you \nhave no economic freedom. There isn't freedom when there is no economic \nfreedom. What we are doing with this budget is slashing into the \neconomic liberties of the children and grandchildren who follow us.\n  During the Senate consideration, I offered numerous amendments that \nwere designed to make us make hard choices, including allowing penalty-\nfree withdrawals from retirement accounts to make some of the mortgage \npayments people are having trouble with today, to allow us to help. It \nwas accepted unanimously. Not one person voted against it. It is not in \nthis final document.\n  Ending bogus performance bonuses by Government contractors and \nexecutives--not one person expressed an objection to that--it is not in \nthe final budget.\n  Reviewing the budget line by line for waste, fraud, \ninappropriateness, and metrics was agreed to. As a matter of fact, the \nchairman said right before we voted on the final bill that this is one \nwe will try to protect in the conference. It comes out of conference, \nnothing is there. That is one of President Obama's promises. We won't \neven help him do the things he said he wanted to do.\n  To set performance standards to identify failing Government programs, \nnot one person objected on the Senate floor. It was unanimous. Yet when \nit comes out of the conference, none of it is there.\n  Ending no-bid contracts--something every American knows this Congress \nhas a problem with because we let the favorite one get no-bid \ncontracts, the well-connected, the well-heeled; requiring competitive \nbidding on anything above $25,000 outside of national security issues, \nnobody objected to that. It actually had a vote prior where we had a \n97-to-nothing vote. When it comes out of the conference, it is not in \nthere.\n  Protecting patients and health care providers from health care \ncoercion, it is not in there.\n  So we are going to pass a budget and say: You go pay, and all the \nthings we really need to do to make the programs we have today \nefficient and to measure the programs we have today and control some of \nthe waste, fraud, and abuse that is over $300 billion a year--all of \nthe things that needed to be in this budget to make sure that happens \ngot rejected in the conference. What should the American people think \nabout that? They are certainly not going to go out and have their \nplumbing redone in their bathroom without getting some quotes on it. \nThey are going to make people competitively bid. If they buy a car, \nthey are not just going to go to an automobile showroom and pay the \nfirst place they go; they are going to price that because it is a \nnecessity to get good value today. Yet we reject that as a body. The \nHouse rejected it. The Senate rejected it in conference. What should \nthe American people think about us? We won't do any of the commonsense \nthings they are having to do right now so we can get rid of some of the \n$300 billion of waste that we don't want to charge to our children. We \nwon't do it. Why is that? Why is it we won't do that? Is there some \nother reason? Can somebody explain to me why we would not want to go \nthrough the budget in a time when we are going to run close to a $2 \ntrillion budget deficit that is all charged to our kids, that we \nwouldn't want to go through it and find the waste, fraud, and abuse in \nthe programs that don't work? This conference report rejects doing \nthat. Are we just lazy? Maybe we don't care. Which is it? It certainly \ncan't be that there is a logical reason we wouldn't do that. Yet we \ndidn't do it. Why would we not get rid of some of the waste? We have \n$80 billion worth of fraud a year in Medicare and Medicaid. Nothing is \nbeing done about it.\n  We are going to have a reconciliation process that is going to \ntotally change the history of the Senate forever in terms of the 1974 \nBudget Act. We are going to hand to us a redo of all of the health \ncare, and the health care we run today, which accounts for 61 percent \nif you count everything that the Federal Government is into, is the \nmost wasteful, fraudulent, lame system in the world. Yet we won't \naddress it.\n  I don't want a legacy of stealing opportunity from my grandchildren \nor anybody else's. If you vote for this budget without this kind of \nhard work that we should be required to do, of accountability to the \nAmerican people to get rid of some of the waste, and do what any other \nprudent person would do in terms of competitively bidding projects, you \nare saying that is OK, it is OK to steal. There is no other word for \nit. It is theft of opportunity from our children and our grandchildren \nbecause we don't have the backbone to stand up and do the hard work.\n  President Obama has asked for this. He has asked for us to go line by \nline. We have an opportunity with a bill moving through the Senate to \ndo that. What do we do? We say, no, it is our way or the highway, Mr. \nPresident. You can do it over there. But we are the ones who control \nall of these programs. And we have done a terrible job. As a matter of \nfact, if you look at the oversight hearings that occurred in the Senate \nand measure them compared to all of the other hearings, they count for \nabout 2 percent of the hearings we had. What do we do when a new \nproblem comes up? We don't look to see how the present program is \nworking\n\n[[Page S4876]]\n\nand what we can do to fix it; we just create another one and charge \nthat to our grandkids rather than say: Where are the metrics to measure \nwhat this program is doing? Is it accomplishing what we want? Is it \nefficient? Could we do it a different way? We just ignore it and we \ncreate a brandnew program. This budget is full of that.\n\n  So I will finish my remarks by again saying that if you vote for this \nbudget, there is a real question in my mind whether you actually can \nrepresent to your constituencies that you feel their children are worth \nthe hard work of this body. There is also the question of whether what \nPresident Obama ran on in terms of doing a line-by-line, of getting rid \nof the waste, of actually measuring the effectiveness of programs, \nwhether we are going to help him do that. This document says we are \nnot.\n  So all the commonsense reforms that would put some burden on us we \nhave taken out, and then in this budget we have said: Children, we are \ngoing to be at $17.3 trillion of publicly held debt in 10 years, and \nyou go pay for it. You go pay for it because we don't have the courage \nand we don't care for you enough to make the hard work and hard \ndecisions now to lessen that burden on you.\n  That is what this budget is about. It is about growing the Federal \nGovernment at a size and a pace that we have never seen before in this \ncountry--have never seen--and growing the debt to a level that is going \nto cripple productivity and opportunity in the future.\n  There are the votes to pass this budget, but the American people need \nto know what this budget really is. What it is is an escape from \nresponsibility, an expansion of the Government knowing best, and an \nelimination of opportunity of generations to come.\n  With that, I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Arizona.\n  Mr. McCAIN. Mr. President, I wish to thank my colleague from Oklahoma \nfor his strong statement and his eloquent description of the \nconsequences of the budget resolution we are about to pass. This is a \n$3.5 trillion budget resolution. Frankly, it amounts to little more \nthan generational theft. It represents a massive growth in Government \nspending and sets our Nation solidly on a course to bankruptcy. The \nresolution assumes a deficit of almost $1.7 trillion in fiscal year \n2009, which is then supposed to fall to $523 billion in fiscal year \n2014. It is only a 5-year budget, not a 10 year; it doesn't show the \nmassive deficit increases that will kick in after 5 years under the \nPresident's plan.\n  I have seen games played with budget resolutions over the years, but \nI think it is really remarkable that this budget, by being only 5 \nyears, doesn't show that the debt held by the public will rise from \n$7.7 trillion in fiscal year 2009 to $11.5 trillion in 2014. This \nrepresents an increase in the debt as a percentage of gross domestic \nproduct from the current 55 percent to 66.7 percent in 2014.\n  After trillions of dollars for bailouts and huge amounts of spending \ndisguised as stimulus, this budget makes no hard choices and doesn't do \nanything more to ensure the future fiscal viability of our Nation. It \nis irresponsible. It is an irresponsible act of generational theft \nwhich will mortgage our children's futures and our grandchildren's \nfutures. We cannot have this level of spending because it is totally \nunsustainable.\n  Mr. President, we didn't have to do this. We could have made tough \nchoices here. We could have adopted a resolution that required us to \nembark on a path to a balanced budget.\n  The conference report contains reconciliation instructions that would \nallow for a massive overhaul of America's health care system with \nlittle or no input from the minority--just as this conference report \nhad little or no input from the minority.\n  I don't have to tell the American people and my colleagues that the \nAmerican health care system is too expensive, it is broken, and we have \nto fix it. We want to be part of that solution. And to include it in a \nbudget resolution, obviously, does a great disservice to the American \npeople who expect a full and complete ventilation of the issues \nsurrounding our health care system in America.\n  I realize that elections have consequences. However, it doesn't \njustify the misuse of a process intended to help reduce Federal \ndeficits--and, I might add, the Democratic proposals floating around \nrecently would have the opposite effect.\n  So, again, we are not changing the climate in Washington; we are \ncontinuing it. I want to make it clear that I understand that \nRepublicans have, in the past, used the reconciliation process to \nfurther their party's agenda. I wish it had not been done. I hope it \nwill not be done now. But the groundwork was laid, and I think this \nwould be a grave mistake. Apparently, it is also possible that climate \nchange could be addressed in the budget reconciliation process.\n  I noted during the consideration of the Senate's budget resolution \nthat, unlike the budget submitted by the President, this one only \nbudgets for 5 years. Budgeting for a 5-year period hides the cost of \nthe expansion of Government that is sure to take place after 2014. In a \nrecent Washington Post op ed, entitled ``Hiding a Mountain of Debt,'' \nprobably the most respected columnist in America, David Broder, wrote:\n\n       The Democratic Congress is about to perform a coverup on \n     the most serious threat to America's economic future.\n       The Congressional Budget Office sketched the dimensions of \n     the problem on March 20, and Congress reacted with shock. The \n     CBO said that over the next 10 years, current policies would \n     add a staggering $9.3 trillion to the national debt--one-\n     third more than President Obama had estimated by using much \n     more optimistic assumptions about future economic growth.\n       The ever-growing national debt will require ever-larger \n     annual interest payments, with much of that money going \n     overseas to China, Japan and other countries that have been \n     buying our bonds.\n       Reacting to this scary prospect, the House and Senate \n     budget committees took the paring knife to some of the \n     spending proposals and tax cuts last week. But many of the \n     proposed savings look more like bookkeeping gimmicks than \n     realistic cutbacks.\n       But the main device the Democratic budgeteers employed was \n     simply to shrink the budget ``window'' from 10 years to 5. \n     Instantly, $5 trillion in debt disappeared from view, along \n     with the worry that long after the recession is past, the \n     structural deficit would continue to blight the future of \n     young working families.\n\n  Here are some cold, hard facts. Our current national debt is $11.2 \ntrillion. The projected deficit for 2009 is $1.7 trillion. The total \ncost of the recently enacted ``stimulus'' bill is over $1.1 trillion. \nWe gave the TARP, Troubled Asset Relief Program, $700 billion--with \nevery expectation being that the administration will request hundreds \nof billions of dollars more. President Obama recently signed an Omnibus \nappropriations bill totaling $410 billion. The Federal Reserve pumped \nanother $1.2 trillion into our markets, and we now have before us a \nbudget resolution totaling nearly $3.6 trillion. We bailed out the \nbanks, insurance giants, and automakers--and the list goes on and on.\n  We are seeing the largest transfer of authority from the private \nsector to the Government that we have ever seen in the history of our \ncountry.\n  I see the chairman of the Budget Committee on the floor, whom I \nadmire and respect. I asked him on the floor, during the consideration \nof the budget, whether health care would be considered in the \nreconciliation. The Senator's response was that he was against it. I \nnote that he voted for it.\n  We are in the midst of a severe recession. The economy shrank at a \nrate of 6.1 percent in the first quarter of this year. Times are tough; \nI don't have to tell any of my colleagues or any fellow Americans.\n  What we are doing is committing an act of generational theft. We are \nlaying a debt on future generations of Americans that is not \nsustainable. The chairman of the Budget Committee has been involved in \nrecent years in attempts to reform Social Security. I will--and I hope \nmy colleagues will--join him in that effort. Unless we reform Social \nSecurity and Medicare, we will have an unsustainable debt.\n  In the recent campaign, the President campaigned on a theme of \nchanging the climate in Washington. The climate hasn't changed. Bills \nhave been passed with Democratic majorities voting almost completely \nfor them--whether it be the stimulus, the omnibus, and other major \npieces of legislation, and also on this budget--on a totally partisan \nbasis. I understand that. I understand that elections have \nconsequences. But to say you are going to ``change the climate'' in \nWashington\n\n[[Page S4877]]\n\nand then not sit down in serious negotiations, whether it be on a \nstimulus package or on a budget, is not changing the climate.\n  Let me tell you what serious negotiations are. I have been involved \nin them over the last 20-some years. I have sat down across the table \nin negotiations. What they are is compromise. They are compromise, \nwhere you say, OK, I give this and you give that. It is not visits and \nconversations, and it is not phone calls. It is face-to-face, hard-\nnosed negotiations based on compromise. That is how we got the gang of \n14 and averted a crisis in this Senate that would have required only 51 \nvotes for the confirmation of judges. That is how we got numerous \npieces of legislation done on a bipartisan basis.\n  That is not happening now in the Senate. I understand that. I \nunderstand that elections have consequences and the votes are there on \nthe other side of the aisle. But I also say to my colleagues that I \nhave been here quite a while. I have seen the Democrats in the majority \nand I have seen the Republicans in the majority. I saw abuses over on \nthis side of the aisle. I am now seeing those same abuses repeated, \nreinforced, and done in a more egregious fashion than I have ever seen \nit in the years I have been a Member of the Senate.\n  I believe our economy will recover. I am confident, because, as I \nsaid during the recent campaign, I believe with the foundations of our \neconomy--entrepreneurship, productivity, the finest workers in the \nworld, and best technology--we will come out of this malaise and crisis \nwe are in, and our economy will be restored. But I can also tell you \nthat we will have to debase the currency and experience inflation if we \npass this kind of budget and we continue on this spending spree.\n  What was the administration's reaction? It was that we will get \ntogether and cut $100 million in spending--after spending trillions and \ntrillions of dollars in the most irresponsible fashion, in my view.\n  Now we are the owners of the automobile industry and of banks. What \nis the Government going to own in America as we continue on this \nincredible takeover of the free enterprise system? The automobile \nmanufacturers should have gone into structured bankruptcy a long time \nago, and they could have come out and been viable. Instead, we are \nspending billions and billions of dollars of American taxpayer dollars \nto prop up an industry that needed to go into prestructured \nbankruptcy--which they probably will do after we have spent billions of \ndollars propping them up.\n  I vigorously, strongly condemn and will vote against and oppose this \nbudget resolution. It is laying the path to a crisis in America that \nmay be as severe as this one if we experience the hyperinflation and \ndebasement of the currency that can only be the result of deficits as \nfar as the eye can see.\n  With great respect for the chairman of the Budget Committee and those \nwho worked hard on this issue, this is a product that the American \npeople will pay a very heavy price for in the years to come.\n  I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota is recognized.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, there are a couple of things I wish to \nrespond to. I have respect for the Senator from Arizona, Senator \nMcCain. We came to this Chamber at the same time. First, he said, on \nreconciliation I told him I was against it. In fact, I did not include \nit in the budget resolution out of the Senate. He said in conference \ncommittee I voted for it. I say this. I voted for the final agreement. \nI did not vote specifically for reconciliation. I opposed it every step \nof the way publicly and privately. I think it is a mistake. I have said \nso publicly and privately. I believe reconciliation will not be used \nfor health care, even though it is authorized under the conference \nreport. I believe that as people examine what would actually happen \nusing reconciliation, they will be convinced it is not the appropriate \nway to do health care. I believe that, at the end of the day, the \nreconciliation approach will not be used for health care reform.\n  With that said, I want to make very clear--and you can ask any of the \nparticipants--I argued strenuously against reconciliation every step of \nthe way. It was not included in the resolution here, over which I had \ndirect control. It is included in the final conference agreement \nbecause the President wanted it as an insurance policy, the majority \nleader wanted it as an insurance policy, and the Speaker of the House \nwanted it as an insurance policy. And, frankly, although I have some \ninfluence, I don't have the ability to overcome the President, the \nmajority leader, and the Speaker of the House.\n  The Senator also questioned a 10-year budget versus 5-year budget. \nLet me repeat what I said before. We have had 34 budgets under the \nBudget Act; 30 of the 34 have been 5-year budgets. The basic reason for \nthat is not hiding things, as was asserted here; it is because \nforecasts beyond 5 years are notoriously unreliable. That is why \nCongress in 30 of the 34 times has written the budget on a 5-year \nbasis. Frankly, the outyears of a 5-year forecast are not very \ncredible, but years 6 through 10 are throwing a dart. I used to \nforecast revenue for my State. I know something about forecasting \nrevenue and expenses. When you get beyond 5 years, you are in kind of a \nworld that doesn't exist. That is total guesswork.\n  Beyond that, I didn't accept the trajectory the country was on in the \n10-year budget that the President proposed. I believe we have to do far \nbetter. That is why the ranking Republican and I have proposed a task \nforce of Democrats and Republicans, with the responsibility to come up \nwith a plan, and if 12 of the 16 members of the task force could agree, \nthat plan would come to Congress for a vote--not another study to sit \non a dusty shelf somewhere, but a vote.\n  The Senator made a number of other assertions with respect to this \nbudget. He termed it ``generational theft.'' Let me say that the \ntrajectory we are on has nothing to do with this budget but has \neverything to do with the reality of the fiscal circumstance of this \ncountry. Our spending is above our revenue. There is a structural gap; \nand the Senator is absolutely right, if we allow that to play out \nuninterrupted, it will constitute generational theft. But this budget \nmakes the first steps toward turning that around. It reduces the \ndeficit by two-thirds, in dollar terms, over the next 5 years, and, in \nterms of a share of GDP, which the economists say is the better \nmeasure, it reduces the deficit by three-quarters, 75 percent, from 12 \npercent of GDP to 3 percent. Additionally, at 3 percent of GDP you \nbasically stabilize the growth of the debt relative to our national \nincome.\n  Why are we in this circumstance? It is because the previous \nadministration doubled the debt, put this economy in the worst \nrecession since the Great Depression, and now we have to dig out. The \nfirst thing we have to do is give lift to the economy. The stimulus was \npassed to provide liquidity to the American economy, because the only \nplace it could come from was the Government. We have learned in past \neconomic downturns that if the Government fails to acts, you could have \na deflationary spiral that would suck the economy down as we saw in the \nGreat Depression.\n  In the short term, I make no apologies. I am known as a deficit hawk, \nsomebody who believes in balanced budgets, somebody who has fought for \nthem my whole career. But when you have a severe economic downturn, \nthat is not the time to turn away from the Government being the last \nresort, the Government providing the liquidity to the system to prevent \na collapse.\n\n  This budget is responsible. As I have said at every step: in the \nsecond 5 years, we must do much more. The President has said that. The \nPresident is committed to it. So am I. If our colleagues are serious \nabout entering into a long-term negotiation about entitlement reform \nand tax reform, count me in. Count me in. It has to be done. It is in \nthe interest of the country. That is where we agree.\n  Mr. President, I see Senator Alexander is here, a very valued member \nof the Budget Committee, someone for whom I have high regard. We may \nnot agree on every detail, but I certainly have great respect for the \ncontribution he has made to the Budget Committee.\n  How much time does the Senator desire?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, not more than 10 minutes.\n  Mr. CONRAD. I yield 10 minutes off Senator Gregg's time and say to \nthe\n\n[[Page S4878]]\n\nSenator, if he requests more, we will absolutely be happy to extend it.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER (Mr. Burris). The Senator from Tennessee.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee. I am here to speak on a personal matter more than the \nbudget. I made my comments on the budget this morning. I was listening, \nthough, to the Senator from Arizona and the Senator from North Dakota. \nI have heard the Senator from North Dakota say he is opposed to using \nreconciliation to run the health care bill through the Senate with 51 \nvotes. I have heard him say that. I agree with him. I know he stood up \nagainst some in his party for doing that.\n  But if I am not mistaken, there were three Senate conferees, and if \nthe Senator from North Dakota voted no, we would not have \nreconciliation instructions included in this conference report. I think \nI am correct about that.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Will the Senator yield?\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Of course.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Let me say, if I had not agreed, I probably would not \nhave been a conferee. There are certain things such as higher powers \naround here.\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. That is a very honest response, and I accept that. But \nthe point is there are three conferees from the Senate, including \nSenator Gregg who was opposed to including reconciliation. So if the \nSenator from North Dakota had said no, maybe he would not have been a \nconferee, but there would not be reconciliation in this Budget \nResolution.\n  Let me move to something more bipartisan than that.\n\n\n                         Tribute to Tom Ingram\n\n  Mr. President, on May 1, Tom Ingram is leaving his post as chief of \nstaff for the Alexander office and as staff director of the Senate \nRepublican Conference. I know what it is to be a staff member of the \nSenate, having come here in 1967 as Senator Howard Baker's legislative \nassistant. That is back when each Senator only had one. I know that \nstaff members are the lifeblood of this institution, that they \nregularly come and go, and that we Senators are grateful for their \nservice.\n  But Tom Ingram's service for the Senate and for me personally is a \ngood deal more than the usual coming and going. Tom and I first met in \n1966 when I was a young volunteer on Howard Baker's Senate campaign and \nTom was an even younger reporter for the Nashville Tennessean. The \nTennessean was then such a Democratic newspaper that it was said that \nTom was the first reporter ever assigned by that newspaper to cover a \nRepublican candidate on a regular basis. In fairness to the Tennessean, \nthere had not been much to cover. Senator Baker in 1966 became the \nfirst Republican Senator in Tennessee history. We had not elected a \nRepublican Governor since the Harding sweep in 1920.\n  In 1974, Tom served as press secretary for what could only be \ndescribed as my upstart campaign for Governor of Tennessee. We did \npretty well for some young guys, winning the primary over more \nestablished figures, but losing the general election. That was the \nWatergate year. There were only 12 Republican Governors left in America \nafter that debacle, and I figured my political career was over at a \nvery young age.\n  But in 1978, as things tend to do in politics, times changed, and I \nwas elected Governor, walking a thousand miles across Tennessee in a \nred and black plaid shirt. Tom this time was my successful campaign \nmanager. He then managed my transition into the Governor's office, \nserved as chief of staff and deputy to the Governor for 5 years. Then \nhe left to form a very successful business in Nashville.\n  During his business career, he found time to help establish my office \nwhen I became president of the University of Tennessee. He did the same \nwhen I became the first President Bush's Education Secretary.\n  The long and short of it is, when Tom Ingram has been around, I have \ndone my best work, and perhaps so has he. We know each other so well \nthat we operate independently toward the same goal and get twice as \nmuch done than either of us could do working alone.\n  One of Tom's gifts is team building. An Ingram-led staff is fun to be \na part of, and it is a purposeful group. He has made sure that each of \nus, Senator included, remember who hired us. For example, the entire \nWashington staff and State staff spent 3 days in Memphis a couple of \nweeks ago making sure that we understand as much as we can about the \npeople and the needs of our State's biggest city and biggest county. As \nTom leaves to reenter the private sector, he has taken time to make \nsure that the new staff is well led and well organized, and for that I \nam especially grateful.\n  Tom's greater contribution may have been to the Senate as a whole. He \nhas helped our Republican conference develop a clearer message. And \nworking with Bob Russell, Senator Mark Pryor's chief of staff, he \ncreated a bipartisan chiefs of staff group that has been more \nsuccessful at working across party lines than their bosses have been. \nThe Senator from Illinois and I are part of a group of Senators from \nboth parties that meets on Tuesday mornings. There are 8, 10, 15, 20 of \nus sometimes. But more than half the chiefs of staff get together on a \nregular basis as part of this bipartisan alliance, which is a \nremarkable number in this already over-organized and busy place.\n  Tom Ingram came to the Senate expecting to stay a few months. He is \nleaving after 6 years. I am grateful to him for that, and the Senate is \na better place.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent to have printed in the Record \nan article about the bipartisan chiefs of staff organization from Roll \nCall which appeared on March 10, 2009, and an article about Tom's work \nthat appeared in the Knoxville News Sentinel last year.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n           [From the Knoxville News Sentinel, Apr. 20, 2008]\n\n         Side by side: Ingram-Alexander Partnership Perseveres\n\n                          (By Michael Collins)\n\n       Washington--Tom Ingram used to have the same jaded view of \n     the nation's capital as many other Americans.\n       But working as U.S. Sen. Lamar Alexander's chief of staff \n     has opened his eyes in ways he didn't expect.\n       ``I've become less cynical and more optimistic as I get to \n     know the city and the people and what we're all about,'' \n     Ingram said.\n       Is Washington perfect? Of course not. Are there things that \n     should be done differently? Absolutely, Ingram said.\n       But, ``this is still the greatest country in the world, and \n     this is the capital of the greatest country in the world,'' \n     he said. ``I believe most people are here because they want \n     to be part of that in a positive, constructive way.''\n       Call it a revelation or an epiphany or whatever noun you \n     choose. But you can't call it a political novice's naivete.\n       Ingram has been active in politics--Tennessee politics, in \n     particular--for more than three decades. He has been at \n     Alexander's side as a political strategist, trusted aide and \n     personal confidante during campaigns for governor, president \n     and the Senate. Theirs is one of the most powerful political \n     partnerships in the state.\n       Now, their influence is growing in Washington.\n       Alexander moved into the upper echelon of power last \n     December when his GOP colleagues chose him as chairman of the \n     Senate Republican Conference. The position makes him the \n     Senate's third-highest-ranking Republican.\n       Ingram's stock has risen, too. He now holds dual roles as \n     Alexander's chief of staff and as staff director for the \n     Republican conference, a job that allows him to help craft \n     the GOP's message in the Senate.\n       His clout hasn't gone unnoticed.\n       Two Washington publications that closely follow politics \n     recently named Ingram one of the top movers and shakers on \n     Capitol Hill. Roll Call lauded his knack for ``spin, know-how \n     and access.'' The Politico called him ``an old hand in a new \n     job'' and noted, ``Now he's gotten to the inner circle of the \n     Republican leadership.''\n       Ingram, who lives in Knoxville, has spent most of his \n     career working behind the scenes. He seems uncomfortable and \n     even a little embarrassed by all the adulation.\n       ``I don't get too juiced up about these lists,'' he said \n     recently, seated behind a table in Alexander's suite of \n     offices near the Capitol. ``If you look at the names on those \n     lists, most people are associated with (Congress) members who \n     have done well. There are very few of us who make those lists \n     without our members going ahead of us.''\n       Alexander, however, said Ingram's skill and instincts are \n     invaluable.\n       ``I do my best work when I'm working with Tom,'' the \n     senator said. ``It's because we're complementary. . . . He \n     fits what I'm doing like a glove.''\n\n\n                       On the rise, side by side\n\n       The two first met on the campaign trail in 1966. Ingram was \n     a skinny young newspaper reporter working his way through \n     college, and Alexander was fresh out of law school and a \n     volunteer in Howard Baker Jr.'s Senate campaign.\n       They clicked immediately. Alexander hired Ingram to be his \n     press secretary when he ran\n\n[[Page S4879]]\n\n     for governor in 1974. They lost that race. But four years \n     later, with Ingram as his campaign manager, Alexander ran \n     again. This time they won. Ingram would go on to work as \n     Alexander's chief of staff and deputy during his first term \n     in the governor's office.\n       Later, when Alexander ran for president, Ingram helped put \n     together his statewide organization in Iowa. When Alexander \n     ran for U.S. Senate in 2002, he again called on Ingram to \n     help with the campaign and, after he won, asked Ingram to \n     help set up his Senate staff.\n       Ingram arrived in Washington for what he thought would be a \n     six- or eight-week assignment. He never left\n       ``I have great respect for Lamar,'' Ingram said. ``I think \n     he embodies what we want in a public servant. He's here for \n     all of the right reasons. And we're buddies. We have a good \n     time working together.''\n       Alexander said Ingram is a good manager who hires talented \n     people, assigns them to jobs that fit and then creates an \n     environment in which they like to work. ``That leaves me free \n     to focus on being a good governor or senator,'' he said.\n       Ingram has never tried to act like he's the one who was \n     elected, Alexander said, but ``we work side by side. I don't \n     consider him in a subordinate role. And I think people who \n     work with us understand that, and it makes us much more \n     effective in what we do.''\n\n\n                             Tennessee ties\n\n       When not working for Alexander, Ingram has held a number of \n     jobs in the private sector, including a sometimes-\n     controversial stint as president and chief executive officer \n     of the Knoxville Area Chamber Partnership.\n       Several business and civic groups had formed the \n     partnership to unify economic development efforts and to \n     increase their influence.\n       Yet under Ingram's leadership, the partnership often took \n     positions at odds with the city. Some organizations resented \n     being under the partnership's umbrella and at times continued \n     to work independently. Ingram also was criticized for making \n     personnel changes and for continuing to work as a political \n     consultant to Alexander.\n       ``That was a tough job,'' Ingram said. ``Knoxville is a \n     great city with so many assets. The partnership was a bold \n     venture, and there was a lot of resistance at the time. But I \n     think some of the suggestions we had about working together \n     as a region and stimulating local government and focusing on \n     downtown redevelopment, I hope some of those ideas are still \n     perking and contributing to some of the success that we are \n     seeing in Knoxville now.''\n       Alexander isn't the only politician who has benefited from \n     Ingram's expertise over the years.\n       Fred Thompson sought his advice when he was considering a \n     run for the U.S. Senate in 1994. U.S. Sen. Bob Corker of \n     Chattanooga credits Ingram with helping turn around his \n     campaign in 2006.\n       Before Ingram came on board, ``there were many things I \n     personally was involved in that were a distraction to me as \n     candidate,'' Corker said. ``Tom really allowed me to focus on \n     being a candidate. . . . It was just a really hand-in-glove \n     fit at a time when we really needed it''\n\n\n              Washington weekdays, East Tennessee weekends\n\n       Ingram figures he was probably in the first or second grade \n     when he saw his first living, breathing politician. Some of \n     the details have been erased by the passing of time, but he \n     remembers stopping with his grandfather alongside a road--at \n     a gas station, perhaps--when they came across Big Jim Folsom, \n     the colorful, populist Alabama governor who liked to dress in \n     cream suits and a matching western hat.\n       ``He was just this huge, bigger-than-life guy who kind of \n     moved into this small group of people and took over,'' Ingram \n     said. ``It was very impressive to a small young person at the \n     time.''\n       Ironically, Ingram's family wasn't all that interested in \n     politics. He was born in Ozark, Ala. His father was a Church \n     of Christ preacher. His paternal grandmother thought it was \n     wrong to vote. The family moved frequently and lived in \n     Alabama, Florida and Georgia before eventually settling in \n     Nashville.\n       Politics may be Ingram's lifeblood now. But when he was \n     younger, newspaper ink was in his veins.\n       When he was in the fifth grade, Ingram started his own \n     newspaper with a buddy. They would write about events like \n     the circus coming to town, and his friend's mother would type \n     up their articles and run off copies. Then, they'd circulate \n     the paper in the neighborhood and sell it to relatives.\n       Later, he spent years as a reporter and editor in Nashville \n     before making the move into politics. To this day, he \n     genuinely likes reporters, he said, but he's not a fan of the \n     24/7 news cycle, which he dismisses as ``mostly 24/7 \n     entertainment.''\n       In Washington, Ingram works around the clock Monday through \n     Thursday and catches the last flight out Thursday night so he \n     can be with his family back in Knoxville on the weekends. He \n     and the senator have an agreement that he'll stay in the job \n     as long as it's fun and he can make it work at home, he said.\n       ``If you get up every day and think maybe I can make a \n     little difference in something, that's a pretty good \n     feeling,'' Ingram said. ``And I feel like over the years, \n     working with Lamar and others, that I've taken part in things \n     that do make a difference.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From the Roll Call, Mar. 10, 2009]\n\n                       Chiefs Eschew Partisanship\n\n                         (By David M. Drucker)\n\n       In an institution that has seen the rise of many a \n     bipartisan ``gang'' in recent years, the monthly meeting of \n     Senate chiefs of staff now in its seventh year might be the \n     best-kept secret on Capitol Hill.\n       Launched almost by accident in 2002 by Sen. Lamar \n     Alexander's (R-Tenn.) chief of staff, Tom Ingram, and Sen. \n     Mark Pryor's (D-Ark.) chief of staff, Bob Russell, the group \n     of top Senate aides has grown from a family of two to about \n     60 regulars. Known informally as the bipartisan chiefs of \n     staff group, the bloc has no leadership structure, just a 12-\n     member advisory board of six Democrats and six Republicans.\n       In addition to their monthly breakfasts at Capitol Hill's \n     Monocle restaurant, the chiefs meet in the evening bimonthly \n     usually welcoming a special guest. They span the political \n     spectrum, with aides to Sens. Tom Coburn (R-Okla.) and \n     Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) participating.\n       ``We started doing breakfast in the Senate dining room once \n     a month,'' Russell said of the group's early gatherings. \n     Ingram interrupted, ``And we ended up taking up about four to \n     six tables and being a little rowdy. And so the Senators--\n     some of the Senators--suggested that maybe we should . . .''\n       ``They ran us out of the Senate dining room,'' said \n     Russell, jumping back into the conversation to finish \n     Ingram's sentence.\n       In a joint interview with Roll Call, Ingram and Russell \n     discussed how the group blossomed amid what many longtime \n     Senate observers believe were some of the chamber's most \n     partisan years. The two aides arrived on Capitol Hill \n     following the 2002 elections. Alexander won an open seat; \n     Pryor was the only Democrat to defeat a GOP incumbent that \n     year.\n       Neither newly minted chief of staff was a Washington, D.C., \n     veteran. But they had much in common. Both were close \n     personal friends with their bosses; both worked for Senators \n     with an interest in working across the aisle; both had an \n     extensive private-sector background; and neither intended to \n     stay in town very long. Ingram was in private business in \n     Tennessee, and Russell was an attorney in Little Rock, Ark.\n       What began as a way for Ingram and Russell to discuss the \n     nonpolitical, managerial aspects of their new jobs and reach \n     across the aisle for some political and policy insight \n     quickly mushroomed. The pair initially invited some of their \n     fellow GOP and Democratic chiefs to join them at their \n     breakfasts, but as word of the gatherings spread, more top \n     Senate aides wanted in.\n       ``Tom and Bob are natural leaders, and they understand the \n     best way to get things done in this town is by keeping the \n     lines of communication open,'' said Susan McCue, a charter \n     member of the group and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid's \n     (D-Nev.) former chief of staff.\n       ```During some of the most divisive [President George W.] \n     Bush years, we kept those lines of communication open,'' \n     continued McCue, who now runs the firm Message Global. ``The \n     group might have been the only functioning and productive \n     group of bipartisan operatives working throughout those \n     years.''\n       Indeed, the bipartisan chiefs flourished during some of the \n     Senate's most partisan hours. And while they won't claim any \n     involvement, they watched closely as a bipartisan group of \n     Senators came together in 2005 to form the ``Gang of 14.'' \n     That Senate gang, the first of several, helped cut a deal \n     and avert a showdown over Bush's then-stalled judicial \n     nominees.\n       The upcoming Senate battle over President Barack Obama's \n     fiscal 2010 budget proposal is not likely to be resolved via \n     the bipartisan chiefs. Nor are the Democratic and Republican \n     chiefs likely to forge a bipartisan deal on health care \n     anytime soon.\n       Resolving political differences between their Senate bosses \n     is not the group's goal, nor has it ever functioned that way. \n     In fact, Ingram and Russell describe the meetings as a haven \n     from politics that has maintained its character even as the \n     Senate became more Republican in 2004, flipped to Democratic \n     control in 2006 and became further Democratic last November.\n       The gatherings offer a forum for top Senate aides to \n     develop bipartisan relationships--the kinds that would be \n     difficult to come by otherwise. The group also provides a \n     vehicle for chiefs to discuss the more mundane but still very \n     important aspects of their jobs such as personnel and office \n     managers.\n       The group recently concluded its inaugural retreat, a \n     weekend in Philadelphia featuring a lecture by historian \n     David McCullough.\n       The evening events have been held at locations such as the \n     Newseum, George Washington's historic home at Mount Vernon \n     and the National Archives, with noted special guests over the \n     years such as Supreme Court Justices Stephen Breyer and \n     Antonin Scalia, ex-White House officials Mike McCurry and \n     Karl Rove, and ex-Senate Majority Leaders Howard Baker (R-\n     Tenn.) and Tom Daschle (D-S.D.).\n       ``The real purpose of it all is building relationships. So \n     a large part of it is getting to know each other and getting \n     comfortable with each other,'' Ingram said.\n       ``I now know most of the chiefs of staff and am very \n     familiar with them,'' Russell said. ``So no matter what the \n     issue is, whether its coming from the staff or coming to me \n     from\n\n[[Page S4880]]\n\n     the Senator, I can pick up the phone and call a chief of \n     staff. . . . Before, without knowing who was on the other \n     side, you just didn't know how anybody might respond or even \n     where to start.''\n       The chiefs' primary purpose has always been relationship \n     building, but the organization has also spawned splinter \n     groups with more specific goals.\n       One such group is a policy study roundtable on issues \n     relating to China. Another deals with conflict resolution and \n     how to address the various problems faced by chiefs of staff \n     on a daily basis.\n       The group has served as a unique forum for the chiefs to \n     share with each other their thoughts and stories that would \n     be difficult for others to understand, such as when Shawn \n     Whitman, then chief of staff to Sen. Craig Thomas (R-Wyo.), \n     recounted for his colleagues what it felt like when his boss \n     died. Thomas lost his battle with cancer in June 2007; \n     Whitman is now chief of staff for Thomas's successor, Sen. \n     John Barrasso (R).\n       Jackie Cottrell, chief of staff to Sen. Pat Roberts (R-\n     Kan.), recalled the aftermath of the tornado that wiped out \n     Greensburg, Kan. and the help and support her office received \n     from several of her counterparts. Cottrell said there were \n     offers to provide extra staff, including to handle the \n     phones, which were ringing off the hook, as well as words of \n     support.\n       Cottrell credited the bipartisan chiefs group almost solely \n     for the help Roberts' office received as it dealt with the \n     tragedy and worked to help Kansas and the residents of \n     Greensburg recover. Additionally, Cottrell said the group has \n     improved the ability to communicate with other Senate offices \n     on policy matters, which she said has had a direct benefit \n     not only on the Senate, but on Kansas.\n       ``I think it's probably one of the best stories on the Hill \n     for bipartisanship that no one knows about,'' Cottrell said. \n     ``There are 100 offices up here, and we all have the same \n     challenges, no matter what our boss's party affiliation is.''\n  Mr. ALEXANDER. Mr. President, I thank the chairman of the Budget \nCommittee for the time. I yield the floor.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from North Dakota.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I thank Senator Alexander. I am serious \nwhen I say he is a very valuable member of the Budget Committee. He has \nmade a real contribution there, and we thank him for it.\n  We now have exhausted all of the speakers who have given us notice on \nboth sides. We are awaiting word on whether we can go to a vote. I am \nhopeful we can go to a vote soon, but we will need to hear from the \nleadership on both sides as to when that might be possible.\n  We have had a spirited, healthy debate today on the question of the \nbudget. I feel strongly that this is a responsible approach. Adopting \nthe President's clear priorities of reducing our dependence on foreign \nenergy, focusing on excellence in education, providing for major health \ncare reform, all the while providing more than $750 billion of \nadditional tax relief to the American people, focused on middle-class \ntaxpayers, and reducing the deficit dramatically, reducing it by more \nthan two-thirds in dollar terms, by more than three-quarters as a \npercentage of the gross domestic product, getting to a deficit level \nwhich will stabilize growth of the debt.\n  Again, I am swift to say much more needs to be done in terms of long-\nterm deficit and debt reduction. I believe deeply we ought to have a \nspecial process for entitlement and tax reform. As I have noted \nthroughout this debate, for the long term, we are on an unsustainable \ncourse in this country. That is a situation that is not the creation of \nPresident Obama. That is a situation that was the creation of the \nprevious administration that inherited massive surpluses and turned \nthem into massive debts. That is a fact, and there is no way to change \nthat fact.\n  The previous administration left this country in the deepest \nrecession since the Great Depression. Of course, the deficit has \nskyrocketed as a result. That is not the fault of the President who has \nbeen in office for 100 days. He inherited this mess. He is expected to \nclean it up, and he has taken aggressive, vigorous action to move us in \nthe right direction, and the American people are responding. The latest \npolls show that now there has been a tripling of the percentage of \npeople in this country who believe we are now on the right track--a \ntripling in the 100 days of this Presidency.\n  I was the second Senator to endorse Senator Obama. The first Senator \nto endorse him was his colleague from Illinois, Senator Durbin. I was \nthe second Senator to endorse him. I had never endorsed in a \nPresidential primary before. I did it because I saw something \nexceptional in Senator Obama. I saw in him somebody who is not only \nvery smart, but extraordinarily calm, somebody who has the right \ntemperament to deal with the crises that any President confronts.\n  I must say, I have been so proud to have been an early supporter of \nthis President because I believe he is keeping the promise that he made \nto the American people to turn us in a new and better direction. He \nadopted the motto of ``Yes We Can.'' That is the motto I had when I \nfirst ran for the Senate in 1986. When he found out, he said maybe he \nowes me royalties. I said: No, you don't owe me a thing.\n  I am so pleased that he is the President of the United States at this \nmoment in time. He has the right background, the right temperament, the \nright intelligence, the right character to be our leader at this \nextraordinary time of challenge.\n  While our budget is quite different than his because we had $2 \ntrillion less in revenue to write the budget because of the changing \nforecast, because of the nature of the economic downturn, nonetheless \nwe were able to preserve his key priorities, and I am proud of it.\n  Mr. President, I see the ranking member, Senator Gregg, is here. \nPerhaps he can enlighten us as to whether there are additional speakers \nor when we might be prepared to vote.\n  I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask the Senator, would he like \nadditional time for debate or should we call the vote for 5:30 p.m. and \nyield back all time?\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, I would like a few minutes. First, I know \nthat one of the senior staff members on the chairman's side, Joel \nFriedman, is going through some very difficult health situations. I \nknow he wanted to talk a little bit about that. We wish him the best. I \nknow my staff, who works closely with him, feels great concern. The \nconcern goes out to him and his family. We certainly wish him the best \nduring this very difficult period dealing with this very difficult \nhealth issue.\n  Mr. CONRAD. First, I thank Senator Gregg for that sentiment. Let me \nsay that Joel Friedman of my staff, who is a very senior member of the \nBudget Committee staff, one of my deputy staff directors, is in the \nhospital, has been there for about a week. We are very concerned about \nhis recovery. I care deeply about Joel, his wife Debbie, his family, \nhis children. He is someone who has labored extraordinarily hard in the \nmonths leading up to consideration of the budget. I know he is \nfrustrated not to be able to be here, and I want him and his family to \nknow we are thinking of them, we love them, we miss him very much, and \nwe are praying for his swift recovery.\n\n  We have a circumstance in which we have intense debates, as we have \nhad today, but on both sides there is a respect for the professionalism \nof the other side, and we certainly appreciate Senator Gregg's \nprofessional staff. They are outstanding. Their word is good, they are \npeople of character, and they wish nothing but the best for this \ncountry. Senator Gregg is an outstanding leader; someone whom I \nactually share many views with about our long-term budget circumstance. \nSometimes that is not altogether clear as we have this debate about \nshort-term budget situations, but I believe he is absolutely right \nabout our long-term budget condition and the need to do much more.\n  I appreciate very much the way he approaches his job. He takes on his \nposition with knowledge, he does it in good faith, and I appreciate \nvery much the way he conducts our Members on the other side and the \nwork of the committee. We have a very smooth-functioning committee \nbecause of the good professional relationship we enjoy.\n  Again, I wish to applaud his staff, certainly my staff as well, \nespecially Mary Naylor, my staff director, my\n\n[[Page S4881]]\n\nother professional staff, John Righter, Steve Bailey, Sarah Egge Kuehl, \nJim Esquea, Josh Evenson, Michael Feldman, Brodi Fontenot, Joel \nFriedman, John Fuher, Joe Gaeta, Robyn Hiestand, Cliff Isenberg, Mike \nJones, Jackie Keaveny, Matt Mohning, Jamie Morin, Stu Nagurka, Kobye \nNoel, Anne Page, Steve Posner, Purva Rawal, Josh Ryan, Matt Salomon, \nand Ben Soskin. Let me say they have worked weekends for months and \nmonths and months, late into the night for months and months and \nmonths, as has Senator Gregg's staff, and we all owe them a great debt \nof gratitude.\n  Mr. GREGG. Mr. President, let me, again, express the concern of my \nstaff and myself for Joel and his family and wish him the best in this \nvery difficult time and wish his family the best. We certainly hope he \nreturns to good health soon.\n  Let me second the words of the chairman. This committee has \ncontention. Even when the chairman produces a bill which is utterly \nincorrect and takes us totally in the wrong direction, I totally \nrespect his efforts. I say that with some humor. The strength of this \ncommittee, besides the fact that it is a very influential committee in \nthe Senate, is that we approach the issues in a forthright, \nprofessional manner. There is, on both sides of the aisle, a genuine \nand sincere and very successful effort to make sure the committee does \nits business in an orderly, professional, and cooperative way, which we \nhope brings credit to the Senate and the way the Senate should \nfunction. I believe it does.\n  It is, in large part, because the chairman sets that tone, as does \nhis staff--Mary Naylor and the excellent people she has working for \nher; and on my side, Cheri Reidy, Jim Hearn, Allison Parent, and all \nthe other folks who spend hundreds of hours, especially during this \nvery intense period as we run up to the final passage of this extremely \nimportant piece of legislation. Their commitment, their professionalism \nis what allows this Congress to function well, and we very much \nappreciate it.\n  I could go on at some length on the issue of the budget, but I think \npeople have probably heard enough of myself on this issue--although I \nwouldn't want to say that--and I know I would love to hear the chairman \nfurther discuss this, and he would love to hear myself further discuss \nit, but it is probably time to move it along and allow the chips to \nfall where they may. I would suggest we yield back all time and we vote \nat 5:30.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, we would be agreeable on our side. Again, \nI wish to thank the ranking member for his graciousness throughout this \nprocess and for organizing the work of the committee and the work on \nthe floor in a way that I think does reflect well on this body and \ncertainly well on the committee. This is the way the Senate should \nfunction. We debate vigorously, but at the end of the day, we get the \njob done in a way that assures that the American people can feel both \nsides have been represented with vigor. That has certainly been the \ncase today.\n  I thank the Chair, I yield the floor, and I suggest the absence of a \nquorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. CONRAD. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that at 5:30 p.m. \ntoday, the Senate proceed to a vote on adoption of the conference \nreport to accompany S. Con. Res. 13, the concurrent budget resolution, \nwith all statutory time yielded back.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, it is in order to ask for the yeas, I \nunderstand. I do ask for the yeas and nays.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Is there a sufficient second? There is a \nsufficient second.\n  Under the previous order, the question is on the adoption of the \nconference report to accompany S. Con. Res. 13.\n  The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk called the roll.\n  Mr. DURBIN. I announce that the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKennedy) and the Senator from West Virginia (Mr. Rockefeller) are \nnecessarily absent.\n  I further announce that, if present and voting, the Senator from West \nVirginia (Mr. Rockefeller) would vote ``yea.''\n  Mr. KYL. The following Senator is necessarily absent: the Senator \nfrom Alabama (Mr. Sessions).\n  Further, if present and voting, the Senator from Alabama (Mr. \nSessions) would have voted: ``nay.''\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, tomorrow we will consider a measure that \nwill change the Bankruptcy Code. Currently, the Bankruptcy Code says if \nsomeone is facing foreclosure on their home and they go into the \nbankruptcy court, the bankruptcy court cannot rewrite their mortgage \nunder section 13 of the Bankruptcy Code. The problem is, if someone \nhappens to own a piece of property that is a vacation home, such as a \ncondo in Florida, or if they own a ranch or a farm, the bankruptcy \njudge seeing this foreclosure can rewrite the mortgage, but not for \ntheir home.\n  What difference does it make? It means that the millions of people \nwho\n\n[[Page S4882]]\n\nare facing foreclosure today do not have the protection of a bankruptcy \ncourt that can ultimately give them a chance to stay in their homes.\n  This is not the first time the Senate will consider this measure. A \nyear ago I offered virtually the same amendment, with some changes to \nit, and it was rejected by the Senate. It was opposed by the banking \nindustry. They argued that it was unnecessary. They said at the time \nthat we were likely to only see about 2 million homes facing \nforeclosure. That was a year ago. I said at the time I hoped they were \nright, but some people thought it could get worse.\n  Today it is projected by Moody's that 8.1 million homes in America \nwill go into foreclosure. Put that in perspective. One out of every six \nhome mortgages in America will go into foreclosure. That means on your \nblock, on your street, it is likely somebody's home will go into \nforeclosure.\n  What does it mean to you? A foreclosed home on your street diminishes \nthe value of your home. Even if you have made every mortgage payment, \nthat is what happens. And if you happen to be in a neighborhood where \nother bad things occur, that foreclosed home can deteriorate quickly, \ncan be an eyesore, could even be a criminal haven where drug gangs can \nhang out. If you think I am exaggerating, I can take you to \nneighborhoods in Chicago where that has occurred. The boarded-up home \nhas become the hangout for the gangs. What was otherwise a very nice \nfamily neighborhood is being threatened because of a foreclosed home.\n  Mr. President, 99 percent of the homes that go into foreclosure go \nback to the banks. Do the banks turn around and sell them or rent them? \nUsually not. They sit vacant waiting for the market to turn around. I \nam afraid it is going to be a long wait because, sadly, too many of \nthese homes are headed toward foreclosure and the banks that hold the \nmortgages are not sitting down with people to work out the differences.\n  I have met people who are facing this situation. Some of them go to \nwork every day with good jobs--people who bought their homes in good \nfaith and then saw a mortgage reset or a set of circumstances where the \nvalue of their home started to plummet and become lower and the value \nbecame lower than the principal owed on the mortgage. They say they are \nunderwater. It destroys their credit just because the home has less \nvalue than the principal they owe on the mortgage.\n  So they cannot refinance the home. They are stuck with an interest \nrate that is too high. They cannot take advantage of the lower interest \nrate because the bank says: You have bad credit. And they say: My bad \ncredit is my home. If you will refinance it, I can stay there. No. They \nwill not do it. So people end up facing default, delinquency, and \nforeclosure.\n  We have sat down with the banks for months to try to work out some \nagreement with them, some compromise, and we have come up with an \napproach which I think is reasonable. What we say is, the homeowner \nfacing foreclosure has to go to the bank at least 45 days before they \ngo into bankruptcy court and present all their legal documents to prove \ntheir income and their net worth--everything you would have to present \nto ask for a mortgage. Then, if the bank offers them a mortgage--a \nmortgage for which the homeowner would pay at least 31 percent of their \ngross income in mortgage payments--if the bank offers them a mortgage, \nand they do not take it, then they cannot go to bankruptcy court and \nask the judge to rewrite the mortgage. The bank has, in good faith, \noffered them a renegotiation of their mortgage, and if they turn it \ndown, then the bank has met its obligation.\n  I do not think that is unreasonable. We put a limit so you could not \nhave mansions and multimillion-dollar homes affected by it. The maximum \nvalue of any home under this amendment is $729,000. It only applies to \nmortgage loans that were originated before January 1 of this year, and \nonly loans that are at least 60 days delinquent are eligible for \nbankruptcy modification. What we are trying to do is to create a \ncircumstance where people can go in and renegotiate a mortgage before \nthey lose their home.\n  I think this is reasonable. It puts a burden on the bank to do \nsomething positive, puts a burden on the borrower to go back into the \nbank and sit down at the desk and see if they can work it out, and, \nfrankly, says if it cannot be worked out--if the offer is made and the \nmortgage cannot go through--that is the end of the story and it is \ngoing to be a bad outcome. The person is going to face ultimate \nforeclosure and loss of their home.\n  I tried now for months to get the banks to agree to this. We have sat \ndown with the American Banking Association, with the community bankers, \nwith the major banks in America. Only one banking interest, Citigroup, \nhas been supportive. Virtually every other banking operation has \nrefused to meet with us, refused to negotiate with us, refused to come \nup with any kind of a compromise.\n  How many people will be affected if we adopt this Durbin amendment \ntomorrow? It is 1.7 million families. That is the number of families \nwho will either be helped in them being able to save their home or be \nallowed to be thrown out on the street if this amendment fails.\n  Later this week, the Senate will have an opportunity to vote--\ntomorrow--on this Helping Families Save Their Homes Act, which would \nhelp 1.7 million families avoid foreclosure. My amendment would make a \nsmall change in the Bankruptcy Code, but it would create a new \nenvironment for people facing foreclosure.\n  When a foreclosure is avoided and people can stay in their homes, \neverybody wins. The family gets to keep their home. The neighborhood is \nnot assaulted by foreclosure. The banks, which can be out of pocket \n$50,000 in a foreclosure, will not have to put that money into it. The \nbanks do not end up owning this home and worrying about the safety and \nsecurity and maintenance of the property. The lenders do fine and the \nGovernment as well.\n  I have come to the floor each week to talk about this issue because I \nknow many of my colleagues have been quoted in local newspapers and \nhave not sat down to take a look at what we are going to vote on \ntomorrow. I understand. We are busy. We had a budget resolution, a lot \nof things people need to take a close look at.\n  This amendment is different than what I offered last year. It is an \namendment which I think is reasonable and allows banks the last word, \nbasically a veto, as to whether this issue can be raised in bankruptcy \ncourt.\n  Our objective is to help more Americans stay in their homes, to help \nthem renegotiate mortgages that will work for them and their families. \nMortgage servicers are given a full veto regarding which of their \nborrowers can go into bankruptcy court. They have the keys to the \ncourthouse door. You would think that was enough--that if you say to \nthe bankers: You have the final word as to whether this person goes to \nbankruptcy court, you would think that was enough, but it is not. The \nAmerican Bankers Association walked away from the table and said they \nwere not interested in negotiating. They are in a situation where they \nhave basically said they do not believe they have any obligation to \nthese people facing foreclosure.\n  There is a movie I have seen probably 100 times called ``It's a \nWonderful Life,'' with Jimmy Stewart. Remember that? You can't miss it \nat Christmas. It comes up over and over. Jimmy Stewart, in a little \ntown--Bedford Falls, I think, was the name of it--had a building and \nloan just trying to help people build and own their homes. He was up \nagainst the big banker, Henry F. Potter, played by Lionel Barrymore. \nThey had some great lines in that movie.\n  They had a little exchange there where George Bailey had met with \nthis Henry F. Potter, and Mr. Potter had said George Bailey's father, \nwho started this whole building and loan, was a failure in life. Jimmy \nStewart--through the character of George Bailey--was speaking to this \nbanker, Henry F. Potter. He was talking about the average people who \nbought homes through the building and loan, which he ran. He said to \nHenry F. Potter:\n\n       Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five \n     thousand dollars? Just remember this, Mr. Potter, that this \n     rabble you're talking about . . . they do most of the working \n     and paying and living and dying in this community. Well, is \n     it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a \n     couple of decent rooms and a bath?\n\n\n[[Page S4883]]\n\n\n  Well, you know how the story ends. The people in the community who \nhave been helped by the building and loan end up rallying to save \nGeorge Bailey's business, and it is a great, wonderful movie: ``It's a \nWonderful Life.''\n  I will tell you what, dealing with the banks on this issue, I am \nafraid they are more inspired by Henry F. Potter than George Bailey.\n  The banks that are too big to fail are saying that 8 million \nAmericans facing foreclosure are too little to count in this economy.\n  The banks that are fighting for their multimillion-dollar executive \nbonuses will not consider giving a struggling homeowner a chance to \nsave the most important asset in their life.\n  The banks that are opening beautiful branch offices on every street \ncorner cannot be troubled by America's Main Streets devastated by \nforeclosure.\n  That is the sad reality, as these banking groups have walked away. Do \nnot forget, these are the same banking groups that have collected \nliterally billions of dollars from taxpayers across this country \nbecause of their own failures in leadership and management, because of \nthe housing crisis which they created, which they fostered, and which \nis threatening our economy even today.\n  They take the money from the Federal Government, from average working \ntaxpayers, because of the mistakes they have made, and they will not \nturn around and lift their finger, give a helping hand to people who \nare about to lose their homes.\n  I know it sounds harsh when I say it this way, but I believe it. I \nhave been at this too long not to understand what is at stake. These \nbanks are unwilling to risk a dollar in profit to allow a family to \nstay in their home. That is what it boils down to. They are unwilling \nto risk a dollar in profit.\n  Well, I do not think that is good for America. I hope a majority of \nmy colleagues in the Senate agree. I sincerely hope that those who are \nhaving second thoughts about this measure will take the time to read \nit. We have worked long and hard to make this a reasonable approach, \none that will help the 8 million people who are facing foreclosure and \nsave 1.7 million homes and do it in a manner that I think most people \nwould agree is reasonable.\n  It has been a long battle. I lost it a year ago. People said: Well, \nyou know this housing crisis is not going to get any worse, Durbin. You \nare just telling us things that are not going to happen.\n  Well, I wish they were right and I was wrong. But, sadly, history \nshows that this foreclosure crisis continues. Do you want to see an end \nto this recession? Put an end to this housing crisis. Let people stay \nin their homes if they can possibly put it together. Create a market \nfor new homes to be built. And put Americans back to work building \nthose homes and remodeling and renovating them. That is what is going \nto breathe life into this economy.\n  But this Senator wants to put the banking interests on notice, I am \nnot going to be a party to shoveling billions more in taxpayer dollars \nyour way if you will not lift a finger to help these people who are \nfacing foreclosure across America today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4883-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4883-S4885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  100 DAYS OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, we have come to the day that many pundits \nsolemnly mark as the day for taking the measure of a president: his \n100th day in office.\n  In reality, there is little real difference between the 99th day of \nBarack Obama's term and the 100th day, but there is value in taking \nstock, in assessing whether we are on track and whether adequate \nprogress is being made.\n  From the moment our new President was sworn in, he faced enormous \neconomic problems, rising unemployment, and a financial system nearly \nin meltdown. He was inaugurated as the Commander in Chief of two wars, \nwith trouble brewing in other nations around the world. And he faced \ndaunting challenges in the areas of health care reform, education, and \nenergy policy.\n  There are many ways he could have begun. Calvin Coolidge once said:\n\n       Perhaps one of the most important accomplishments of my \n     administration has been minding my own business.\n\n  Teddy Roosevelt had a different view:\n\n       Far better it is to dare mighty things, to win glorious \n     triumphs, even though checkered by failure, than to take rank \n     with those poor spirits who . . . live in the gray twilight \n     that knows not victory nor defeat.\n\n  There is no question which view our new President embraced. Barack \nObama took the view that we must ``dare mighty things.'' He hit the \nground running, and our Nation is better off for it.\n  In the midst of a recession that many compared to the beginnings of \nthe Great Depression, perhaps these lines from Franklin Roosevelt's \nfirst inaugural address seemed appropriate:\n\n       There are many ways [the Depression] can be helped, but it \n     can never be helped by merely talking about it. We must act, \n     and we must act quickly.\n\n  That is what Barack Obama and this new Congress did.\n  We took action and we acted quickly.\n  So what have we accomplished in 100 days?\n  We passed the most ambitious economic recovery package in history, to \ncreate millions of jobs over the next 2 years, provide tax relief to 95 \npercent of all workers, and take steps to address our longer term \nchallenges.\n  The legislation made a wide range of investments to restore our \neconomic strength: It is putting people to work rebuilding roads, \nbridges, rail and waterways. It is developing alternative energy \nsources that will lessen our dependence on foreign oil. It is helping \nStates keep police officers, teachers, and firefighters at work serving \ntheir communities. It is funding health care coverage for the least \nfortunate among us and helping families keep their insurance coverage \nif they lose a job. It combines tax cuts for working families with \nincentives to businesses to hire. It is improving our schools and \nmaking college more affordable. It includes longer term steps to reduce \nhealth care costs by expanding medical research and jumpstarting health \ninformation technology, which will improve efficiencies in our health \ncare system and reduce medical errors. And it extends unemployment \ninsurance to people who have lost their job.\n  This President and Congress have also extended health care coverage \nto millions more uninsured children of working families; preserved the \nprinciple of equal pay for equal work for America's working women; \naddressed the crisis in our credit markets so that small businesses, \nhomeowners, and students could have greater access to the loans they \nneed to move forward; and expanded our Nation's national service \nprograms, so that more people can give back to our nation's communities \nand help meet local needs.\n  What does all of this mean for us in Illinois? We are facing tough \neconomic times.\n  The Illinois unemployment rate has jumped to 9.1 percent, \nsignificantly higher than the national average of 8.5 percent.\n  The administration has already announced $6.5 billion in funding for \nIllinois from the stimulus and economic recovery legislation we passed.\n  That measure will create or save 157,700 jobs in Illinois over the \nnext 2 years. Over 90 percent of the jobs will be in the private \nsector, in industries ranging from clean energy to health care to \ntransportation.\n  Two weeks ago I travelled throughout Illinois to see first-hand how \nthe Recovery Act is affecting workers in my State. One of my first \nvisits was to the Rockford area, where the unemployment rate is 13.5 \npercent--the highest of any metropolitan area in Illinois. Many workers \nthere have been hard hit by the state of the automobile industry.\n  Production at the Chrysler plant in nearby Belvidere has slowed to a \ncrawl and hundreds of workers have been laid off.\n  I met some of those workers in nearby Rockford, where I visited the \nEiger Lab--a manufacturing research and educational institution that \nworks with the local community college.\n  The local workforce investment board used some of the $5 million in \nstimulus funding it received to boost enrollment of the training and \neducation programs offered at the facility.\n  This funding was able to help some of the recently displaced workers \nbegin acquiring new skills to help them find work.\n  The Recovery Act included $45 billion for transportation investments \nthroughout the country.\n\n[[Page S4884]]\n\n  This funding has been critical for Illinois. Illinois has already \nseen more than a billion dollars of this funding and may receive \nupwards of $2 billion for our airports, highways, mass transit and rail \nsystems.\n  The Federal Aviation Administration has already announced $40 million \nfor 10 airport improvement projects in Illinois.\n  One of those projects included $6 million to help build a new \nterminal facility at the Peoria airport. Construction is underway now \nand the project is moving forward thanks to the stimulus funding. The \nterminal project in Peoria will create between 250 and 300 jobs by the \ntime the work is completed in October of next year. The stimulus \nfunding for this project will not just add temporary construction \njobs--it will help keep Peoria competitive in the global economy.\n  Airports have a major impact on a local area's economy--a modern \nairport and the service it provides directly affects a community's \nability to create and attract new businesses to the area. Thanks to the \nRecovery Act, Peoria Airport will soon have a 125,000 square-foot \nterminal facility that will provide the airport with the additional \ncapacity for more commercial operations and allow the airport to handle \n2 million passengers per year.\n  This is exactly the type of investment we should be making during a \ndownturn in the economy--targeted infrastructure investments that will \nmake our economy stronger in the future.\n  And we are making this kind of investment not only in Peoria but also \nat other airports around the state. For example, we have provided $12 \nmillion to rehabilitate Chicago O'Hare runways; $5 million for the \nRockford International Airport; $2.4 million for ramp reconstruction at \nthe Abraham Lincoln Airport in Springfield; and $3.7 million for runway \nconstruction at the Quad Cities Airport.\n  The Recovery Act also included $7.5 billion for mass transit across \nthe country. In Illinois, that funding is having an impact now. The \nCTA, the Nation's second largest transit agency, just announced an $88 \nmillion project to rehabilitate the subway track on Chicago's Blue \nLine. The Blue Line subway track was in dire need of repair. Without a \nmassive overhaul of the track, trains would have been forced to crawl \nat 15 miles per hour or less through the subway.\n  The delays would cause transit users to leave the trains and return \nto their cars--multiplying the gridlock on our highways and adding to \nthe pollution in our air.\n  The CTA could not find the funds to overhaul the track and instead \nhas been spending millions in maintaining track that is many years \nbeyond its useful life.\n  The funding in the Recovery Act allowed the CTA to start replacing \nthe track last week and the CTA expects to create or save 400 jobs by \ndoing so.\n  The renewed subway track will also save the CTA millions of dollars \nin maintenance costs, allowing the transit agency to making badly \nneeded improvements in other parts of the system.\n  The Recovery Act is also saving jobs and improving lives with an $84 \nbillion investment in education and training. The funding has helped \nschools avoid layoffs and is providing job training in new and \nexpanding fields.\n  Investing States face difficult choices in addressing their budget \ngaps. Education funding provided by the Recovery Act has made those \ndecisions slightly less painful, saving teaching jobs and keeping \nclassrooms smaller.\n  Last week, Illinois received $1.4 billion in Recovery Act funding \nthrough the State Fiscal Stabilization Fund. With that funding, the \nState will avoid severe cutbacks in education and help prevent layoffs \nof teachers and staff.\n  Illinois also has received nearly $500 million so far in increased \nfunding for special education and the title I program for disadvantaged \nstudents.\n  With the Recovery Act, this President and the Congress have helped \nensure that Illinois schools and children do not fall victim to the \nrecession.\n  I want to say an additional word about Pell grants, which are an \nimportant component of this education investment.\n  The recovery package included $13.9 billion to increase the maximum \nPell grant by $281 next year and by $400 in the 2010-2011 academic \nyear.\n  Students will be able to receive assistance up to a maximum of around \n$5,000 in the 2009-2010 school year and $5,300 the following year.\n  This will bring us closer to closing the gap between the value of a \nPell grant and the cost of higher education.\n  A Pell grant increase will help 7 million Americans--including \n275,000 Pell grant recipients in Illinois--finance their education \nwithout going even deeper into student loan debt.\n  The Recovery Act isn't the only legislation enacted that is \nstrengthening the country. Last week, the President signed the Edward \nKennedy Serve America Act into law. This new law will triple the number \nof national service participants to 250,000 participants within 8 \nyears.\n  Along with this expansion, the bill will also create new service \ncorps within AmeriCorps focused on areas of national need--education, \nthe environment, health care, economic opportunity, and veterans.\n  The bill will also increase the education award for the first time \nsince the creation of the national service program and make it \ntransferable, so that older volunteers can transfer the education award \nto their children or grandchildren.\n  In my State of Illinois, 2.7 million volunteers provide 300 million \nhours of service each year. The estimated annual economic contribution \nof these hours is $5.9 billion.\n  More than 66,000 of these Illinois volunteers are participating in \nnational service programs through 144 different projects and programs.\n  Because of the Serve America Act, more volunteers will be able to \nserve and improve communities across Illinois.\n  Another legislative accomplishment worth mentioning is the Children's \nHealth Insurance Program Reauthorization Act, which will provide health \ncoverage for an additional 4 million children nationwide. The CHIP \nprogram has allowed the State of Illinois to reach more children than \never before by supplementing the state's All Kids Initiative. Today, \n1.8 million Illinoisans are without health insurance, including 350,000 \nchildren. Currently, the All Kids program covers more than 1.5 million \nchildren in the state--170,000 under the CHIP program alone. But the \nState wants to reach Illinois's remaining 250,000 uninsured children by \ndoing more with the program. With new funds and a formula that takes \ninto consideration the individual needs of the State, Illinois can \ncover an additional 30,000 kids just with the CHIP program. Mr. \nPresident, 30,000 children who are uninsured today will have the \nability to see a doctor, get a check-up, and stay healthy--thanks to \nthe work we have accomplished here in the first 100 days of the Obama \nadministration.\n\n  Let me return one more time to the Economic Recovery Act, because \nthat package is addressing health care and the health care system in \ndramatic ways.\n  The law will help many working families continue to pay for health \ninsurance after the loss of a job through what is known as the COBRA \ninsurance program.\n  The average monthly unemployment benefit in Illinois is just over \n$1,300, while the average monthly family COBRA premium is just over \n$1,100. That means a newly unemployed breadwinner in Illinois would \nhave to spend 84 percent of his or her jobless benefits to pay for \nfamily health insurance.\n  In the Recovery Act, we were able to provide a 65 percent premium \nsubsidy for individuals who lose their jobs, or lost them after \nSeptember, to help cover the cost of COBRA premiums.\n  The measure also will help keep the doors open for health care \nservices for millions of people who have been hit hard by this economic \ndownturn.\n  Rising unemployment and falling State tax revenues have put the \nStates' Medicaid Program in a bind. Just as more people need Medicaid \nand other publicly funded health programs, States are having increased \ndifficulty meeting the surging need while also balancing their budgets.\n  The recovery package will provide an additional $2.9 billion for \nIllinois over the next 2 years allowing the State to pay its providers \nand meet the increased demand for services as the newly uninsured turn \nto the State for help.\n\n[[Page S4885]]\n\n  Nearly 1 million families in Illinois have at least one uninsured \nfamily member and 360,000 families making above $50,000 have at least \none uninsured family member. More and more Illinoisans are seeking \ncommunity health centers as their medical home. Since 2000, Illinois \ncommunity health centers have more than doubled the number of patients \nthey serve--from less than 500,000 then to 1.1 million today. The needs \nin the community have only increased as the economy struggles--and the \nrecovery package invests $1.5 billion in community health centers. \nIllinois received more than $20 million for more than 300 clinic sites \naround the state that are providing quality, affordable health care to \nanyone in need.\n  I have only scratched the surface of what we have accomplished in \nthese past 100 days. Among the other steps we taken to address needs, \nspecifically in Illinois: $147 million for Argonne National Laboratory \nand Fermilab; $49 million for improvements to the EJ bridge near \nMorris, which is currently the biggest safety concern for ship traffic \non the 300-mile-long Illinois River; $20 million for the Rock Island \nArsenal; more than $6 million for the Great Lakes Naval Station; and \nmore than $6 million for continued work on the barrier project to \nprevent the spread of invasive species, including Asian Carp, in the \nGreat Lakes.\n  This President and this Congress will continue to work to address the \nneeds of our nation.\n  We have made important progress in these first 100 days. We still \nhave a long way to go.\n  This President is invested in rebuilding this economy, restoring our \ndiplomatic strength around the world, reforming our health care system \nand taking concrete steps to reduce global warming. We have only just \nbegun.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4885-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4885]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\n\n                  Private First Class Richard DeWater\n\n  Mr. MERKLEY. Mr. President, I rise today in remembrance of one of \nOregon's finest young men, PFC Richard Dewater. A former resident of \nGrants Pass, OR, PFC Richard Dewater tragically lost his life on April \n15 while on patrol in Afghanistan. PFC Richard Dewater will be flown \nback to Oregon and laid to rest in Roseberg National Cemetery.\n  Private First Class Dewater was assigned to the 1st Battalion, 26th \nInfantry Regiment, 3rd Brigade Combat Team, 1st Infantry Division based \nout of Fort Hood, TX. Private First Class Dewater was deployed to \nAfghanistan in July in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in \nAfghanistan. Just days before his death, Private First Class Dewater's \nbrigade ambushed a Taliban unit near Korengal Valley.\n  Joining the U.S. Army was something Private First Class Dewater was \nextremely passionate about. Ever since Private First Class Dewater was \na young child he wanted to become a soldier. Private First Class \nDewater loved the work he was doing and was very proud of his service \nin the military. He also enjoyed fishing and camping and considered \nGrants Pass, OR, to be his home. Private First Class Dewater was a \ndevoted husband to his wife Valerie, whom he married in Topeka, KS, \nback in June 2008.\n  I offer my heartfelt prayers and condolences to Private First Class \nDewater's wife Valerie, his family and friends. I am forever grateful \nfor Private First Class Dewater's service and his dedication to our \ncountry. Private First Class Dewater was a courageous and selfless man \nand deserves to be remembered for his valiant service. I ask that my \nfellow Oregonians and all Americans join me in honoring PFC Richard \nDewater and the sacrifice he and his family have made for our country.\n\n\n                       Sergeant LeRoy O. Webster\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, it is with great sorrow that I rise \ntoday to honor a fallen soldier. SGT LeRoy Webster, a 28-year-old \nsoldier from Hartley, Iowa, was fatally shot while on patrol on April \n25, 2009 in Kirkuk, Iraq. LeRoy was serving with the B Battery, 3rd \nBattalion, 82nd Field Artillery Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division, out of \nFort Hood, TX. My prayers and condolences go out to his wife Jessica, \ndaughters Natasha, Kaydence, and Jadyn, and his parents Donald and \nCrystal Webster.\n  LeRoy was deployed to Iraq in January. He had previously served in \nAfghanistan in 2004 and 2005 and in Baghdad, Iraq from October 2006 to \nJanuary 2008.\n  An Iowa native, LeRoy was born in Spencer, IA, and graduated from \nHartley-Melvin-Sanborn High School in 1999. His family has deep roots \nin Hartley, the community where LeRoy grew up and met his wife, who was \nhis high school sweetheart.\n  LeRoy Webster was a decorated soldier, having earned numerous \nmilitary awards, and he is remembered by friends as dedicated, good-\nnatured, and an excellent father. His family said he was ``proud to \nserve in the United States Army.'' LeRoy's sacrifice deserves the \ngratitude of the entire nation and is a reminder of the high cost of \nfreedom. I express my deepest respect and admiration for this American \nhero.\n  (At the request of Mr. REID, the following statement was ordered to \nbe printed in the Record.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4885-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4885-S4886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NOMINATION OF GOVERNOR KATHLEEN SEBELIUS\n\n Mr. KENNEDY. Mr. President, I strongly supported the \nconfirmation of Governor Kathleen Sebelius to the Secretary of Health \nand Human Services.\n  America needs strong and effective leadership in public health. That \nis true at all times but never more so than when the Nation faces a \ngrave threat from a serious disease epidemic. We face such a threat now \nfrom swine flu. The world has looked on with growing apprehension as \ncases of this deadly new illness appeared first in one nation, then in \nanother, and another. Yesterday, Spain reported its first case. Today, \nNew Zealand. Tomorrow, who knows where the epidemic will have spread.\n  In our own Nation, we have seen cases of swine flu in New York, \nCalifornia, Texas, Kansas, and Ohio. The disease will surely become \nmore widespread before it abates.\n  That is why we need effective leadership at the helm of our public \nhealth agencies with the authority that only Senate approval can \nconfer. To have delayed this vote would make no sense--the epidemic \nwould grow and more cases would be reported. The Nation urgently needs \nGovernor Sebelius' leadership at HHS in the fight against this deadly \nepidemic.\n  Governor Sebelius will face other important challenges as well. None \nof these is more pressing or more urgent than the need to reform \nAmerica's broken health care system.\n  Today we stand at a historic crossroads in health care in America. \nThe United States spends more than $2 trillion a year on health care, \naccounting for roughly one-sixth of our entire economy. We spend more \nper person on health care than any other country. Yet our health \noutcomes, as measured by key benchmarks like infant mortality and life \nexpectancy, lag behind other developed countries. Nearly 47 million \nAmericans are uninsured including over 8 million children and a \ndisproportionate share of minorities. 25 million more of our citizens \nremain underinsured, and even those with insurance often receive \nsubstandard or inappropriate care. Our health care system cries out for \nreform, and now is the time.\n  Governor Sebelius has the experience, compassion and steady hand to \ntake the helm of the Department of Health and Human Services and help \nlead our Nation toward high-quality, affordable health care for all. \nShe has served the people in Kansas well for over 20 years as State \nlegislator, as insurance commissioner and as Governor, and she has \ndemonstrated deep knowledge of the problems plaguing our health care \nsystem, and the vision and skill to fix them. Time and time again she \nhas reached across the aisle and achieved practical solutions that have \nresulted in tangible benefits to families and businesses.\n  She was asked by former Republican Governor Bill Graves to design and \nlead the Kansas Children's Health Insurance Program in 1998, and she \nled an expansion of coverage from 15,000 to over 51,000 children. As \nGovernor, her Healthy Kansas Initiative has helped to contain runaway \nhealth care costs, streamline the bureaucracy, and make health \ninsurance and prescription drugs more affordable for thousands of \nchildren, working parents and small\n\n[[Page S4886]]\n\nbusinesses. To give all children a healthy start on life, she further \nproposed providing health insurance to every uninsured child from birth \nto age five.\n  Governor Sebelius set up counseling programs as well to help senior \ncitizens navigate the complexities of the Medicare prescription drug \nbenefit plan and choose the best plan for their needs. She also \nestablished a multistakeholder group of business leaders, consumer \ngroups, health care providers and private insurers to make \nrecommendations on modernizing the health system, promoting \ncoordination and consistency of care and reducing administrative \nburdens on patients and providers alike.\n  Through this broad consultative process, Governor Sebelius created a \npublic-private partnership to build and install nationally-recognized \nhealth information technology systems, and she pioneered the Kansas \n``smart card'' the first health insurance ID card to implement state-\nwide standards.\n  Achievements such as these have brought wide accolades. Governor \nmagazine named her as one of its Public Officials of the Year when she \nserved as Kansas insurance commissioner in 2001. Time magazine named \nher one of the Nation's top five Governors in 2005. Her nomination is \nsupported by the American Medical Association, the AFL-CIO, and scores \nof other stakeholders. As Warren Buffet said, ``With this appointment, \nthe President just hit one out of the park.''\n  I thank my Senate colleagues for confirming Governor Sebelius' \nnomination as Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, \nand I look forward to working with her in the months ahead to achieve \nreal health reform for the American people this year at long \nlast.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4886-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4886]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        AMERICAN LEGION POST 27\n\n  Mr. GRASSLEY. Mr. President, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize the achievements of American Legion Post 27 out of Muscatine, \nIA. This group hosted its first World War II Honor Tour in Washington, \nDC, in October 2008, sponsoring 30 World War II veterans from the \nMuscatine area. The local community raised funds by holding yard sales, \ndances, and tournaments, and also by asking help from local businesses \nand friends. The veterans attending the tour were accompanied by family \nmembers and volunteers who donated their time and money to come along \non the trip. While in DC, the group visited several historical sites \nincluding the World War II Memorial and Arlington National Cemetery. I \nam very proud to represent these honorable veterans and ask unanimous \nconsent that an article written about their time in Washington by \nMelissa Regennitter of the Muscatine Journal be printed in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n                      [From the Muscatine Journal]\n\n                        (By Melissa Regennitter)\n\n       Muscatine, Iowa.--A trip to Washington D.C. became a \n     memorable experience for 30 World War II veterans who had the \n     chance to share memories and make new ones with old friends. \n     Many people made new friends along the journey as well.\n       Muscatine hosted its first WWII Honor Tour in October after \n     much hard work and dedication from area volunteers who raised \n     more than $35,000 to give the vets an all-inclusive tour of \n     D.C. and Virginia memorials. That trip included a visit to \n     their memorial, the World War II Memorial in D.C.--situated \n     between Lincoln Memorial and the Washington Memorial. The \n     trip came about after Pam Ramer, former president of the \n     American Legion Post 27 Auxiliary heard a heartwarming story \n     about an Honor Tour her uncle Jim Marshall, 82, a former Navy \n     radio operator from Mount Pleasant, had done. His wife \n     Pauline helped him out and their tour took place in April.\n       Marshall had already taken the trip, complete with meals, \n     bus tour, hotel and flight, so Ramer looked to him to get \n     things in order. He had told her of the emotional journey it \n     had been, how the vets were treated with dignity, cheers and \n     handshakes, and how much it seemed to mean to them to go on a \n     trip they otherwise may never have taken. By June Ramer had \n     set her mind to the goal and knew it would be about $1,100 \n     per person. Though it felt like an impossible target, \n     fundraising and a town with a love for its veterans made the \n     elaborate scheme possible.\n       Fundraisers galore! Post 27 held a yard sale, 1950s-60s \n     dance, car show, volleyball and golf tournaments, dinners and \n     silent auctions. Business in town took part, offering a place \n     to hold the events, donations and prizes. Senators, \n     corporations and school kids who collected change donated \n     money and were recognized on the ``flag of honor'' wall at \n     the Legion. A woman even gave a house full of furniture to \n     auction off and a local auctioneer volunteered his time to \n     help sell it.\n       Everyone involved contacted businesses and business \n     associates to ask for support. The reception from the \n     community was remarkable as the word spread; the goal was met \n     a few weeks before the send-off ceremony was held.\n       AirTran Airways went out of their way to make scheduling \n     accommodations for the 48 people who went; 30 veterans and 18 \n     family members and helpers. The pilots were as happy to have \n     the vets on the plane as the vets were to be going to D.C. \n     When the plane landed at the Ronald Reagan Washington \n     National Airport, fire trucks sprayed the aircraft down as it \n     taxied in. The captain said it was a high honor and a way to \n     show appreciation for the vets.\n       Many monuments. The group arrived on Thursday, Oct. 2, to a \n     Tysons Corner Marriot in Northern Virginia. The weekend was \n     packed with visits to historical sites including The World \n     War II, Jefferson, Lincoln, Vietnam, Marine Corps and Korean \n     memorials as well as Air Force and Navy memorials and \n     museums. They also went to Arlington National Cemetery, the \n     Pentagon, Mt. Vernon and the estate of George Washington, the \n     U.S. Capitol, the White House and downtown D.C. where they \n     shopped for souvenirs and saw Ford's Theater where Abe \n     Lincoln was shot and the home he died in.\n       At Arlington, a visit to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier \n     brought tears to the eyes of many and honor to all as a group \n     of the Muscatine-area veterans were allowed to participate in \n     a wreath-laying ceremony.\n       The veterans were treated to fine dining where they enjoyed \n     extravagant meals and desserts which were all a part of the \n     tour package. A helping hand. Along with the 29 men and one \n     woman veteran were 10 family members who paid their own way \n     to take the trip. In addition to those people, eight \n     volunteers paid their own way so they could be there to push \n     wheelchairs, lend a hand to those who might need it, keep \n     things organized and even make the veterans laugh. What ended \n     up happening was a new found sense of honor for those who had \n     served. The helpers were at times more emotional than the \n     veterans and bonds grew that no one really expected. All of \n     the helpers say that they came home with new friends and made \n     memories they'll never forget.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4886-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4886-S4888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IDAHOANS SPEAK OUT ON HIGH ENERGY PRICES\n\n  Mr. CRAPO. Mr. President, in mid-June, I asked Idahoans to share with \nme how high energy prices are affecting their lives, and they responded \nby the hundreds. The stories, numbering well over 1,200, are \nheartbreaking and touching. While energy prices have dropped in recent \nweeks, the concerns expressed remain very relevant. To respect the \nefforts of those who took the opportunity to share their thoughts, I am \nsubmitting every e-mail sent to me through an address set up \nspecifically for this purpose to the Congressional Record. This is not \nan issue that will be easily resolved, but it is one that deserves \nimmediate and serious attention, and Idahoans deserve to be heard. \nTheir stories not only detail their struggles to meet everyday \nexpenses, but also have suggestions and recommendations as to what \nCongress can do now to tackle this problem and find solutions that last \nbeyond today. I ask unanimous consent to have today's letters printed \nin the Record.\n  There being no objection, the material was ordered to be printed in \nthe Record, as follows:\n\n       Saying that ``The continual increase in the cost of fuel is \n     affecting Idahoans'' is a major understatement. I, my \n     friends, my family, and a large number of my co-workers have \n     already cancelled a number summer activities and vacations \n     here in Idaho due to the price increases. All fuel \n     consumption has been whittled down to just bare necessities \n     such as only driving to work, school, and to purchase \n     groceries. And because of the gas prices, all store products \n     have increased tremendously. My family pays approximately $50 \n     to $60 more each week for our basic routine groceries.\n       I recently found out that my husband and I did not draw on \n     the hunts we put in for this year. And, instead of being \n     disappointed, we were somewhat relieved because of the money \n     that we would have had to spend in order to hunt. We sold our \n     snowmobiles this spring because of the money it would take us \n     in the future to trailer them and keep them operational. I am \n     considering selling my horse trailer because I cannot afford \n     to trailer my horse anywhere. People are trying to unload \n     their horses and stock because the price of hay has literally \n     doubled and they cannot afford to feed their animals. Finding \n     hay is a chore in itself because the majority of it is being \n     purchased and transferred out of state. All outdoor \n     activities have come to a screeching halt. And not only for \n     my family but for many, many others.\n       Half of the raise I received at work this past year went to \n     the increase in bus transportation to work; the other half \n     went to the\n\n[[Page S4887]]\n\n     increase in my benefits. And with the continual increase in \n     fuel prices (which affect the cost of all other things like \n     groceries, and utilities) I cannot even say I ``broke even.'' \n     I am actually behind the economy. The bus services at work \n     are considering raising the cost of the bus passes again \n     because of the fuel cost. People are starting to carpool, and \n     the traffic to work has increased tremendously, and that has \n     increased the danger factor of more accidents. Some of my co-\n     workers have purchased motorcycles because they use less \n     fuel. One employee out here at the site had a near-fatal \n     accident when he collided with an antelope while riding his \n     motorcycle to work.\n       How sad is it that I had to tell my son that if he made \n     All-Stars in baseball this year, he may not get the chance to \n     play because we cannot afford the trips out of town. We had \n     planned a family trip to Mount Rushmore this summer, and my \n     husband and I told our children that that trip is not likely \n     going to happen. My Power Stroke diesel truck stays parked in \n     the garage and only gets run occasionally to keep in \n     operating well.\n       Everyone seems to have put the ``living'' in their lives on \n     hold and have been going through the motions of just getting \n     by hoping that there will be a break in this gloom. People \n     keep saying ``something has got to give'', ``something has \n     got to happen'' and the only thing happening is the continual \n     increase in the cost of gas. This week my husband filled two \n     portable gas cans at a local gas station so we can mow and \n     weed-eat our yard. When he returned home, he held up both gas \n     cans and said ``You are looking at over $40 worth of gas \n     here''.\n       I hear a number of reasons and theories to why fuel has \n     skyrocketed. No one seems to know for sure, but we are all \n     (unhappily) trying to live with the effects of it. Thank you \n     for the opportunity to be heard.\n     Andrea.\n                                  ____\n\n       We are a retired couple. I work to provide the extras, \n     which these days are anything except the absolute necessities \n     for life. We have always been a conserving family, having \n     lived in Phoenix, Arizona, previously for 25+ years. We have \n     compact fluorescent bulbs throughout our 3,200-square foot \n     home, costly energy saving insulation, ceiling fans, we cook \n     and heat with natural gas, and we do have a huge 1,800-square \n     foot garden and orchard but water efficiently and preserve \n     all our produce and fruit. We have central air conditioning \n     but only use it during the hottest part of hot days.\n       About 2\\1/2\\ years ago, foreseeing that gasoline was going \n     to become a major cost, we traded our gas guzzling 9 mpg \n     Chevrolet Trail Blazer for a vehicle which gets about 17-20 \n     mpg in town. We combine our errands to more efficiently use \n     gasoline. We have not taken a traveling vacation in four or \n     five years as gas costs too much.\n       We also financially aid an 18-year-old daughter at home \n     struggling to provide transportation for her to a part-time \n     job and college classes. We have a married child we have had \n     to financially help as they acquire more education to \n     increase their earning capacity. We have done all we can on \n     our limited retirement incomes to conserve. We still suffer \n     and financially fall further behind every year.\n       In the past this was caused by tremendous premium increases \n     in our health insurance premiums combined with increases in \n     the cost of electricity and natural gas. Roughly two years \n     ago when gas rose to $2 per gallon and continued to increase, \n     we started observing and feeling the impact of rising fuel \n     cost as it affects every item we consume or use.\n       Recently our 32-year-old son came to live with us as he \n     could not support himself any longer living in Phoenix. We \n     felt that big time in the food budget.\n       We recently had a family meeting and we as a family are \n     doing or not doing the following trying to be proactive so as \n     not to have to sell our home, fall behind in our debt paying \n     or being in a position of bankruptcy.\n       Conservation of water, limited showers, laundry and running \n     of dishwasher. No more gas money for daughter; she must now \n     limit her trips for anything other than work or school. \n     Computer and accessories are turned off at end of day. No \n     wasting of food, take smaller portions. No extra goodies at \n     the grocery store. (We have always primarily shopped at \n     Winco.) Hardly any entertaining; cannot afford the food cost. \n     No more lights left or TVs running and no one watching. \n     Waiting longer to turn the AC on and turning the thermostat \n     higher. The stimulus check (which is a waste of government \n     money) is in our saving account. Will probably have to use it \n     for gas or food.\n       I have all but lost my job as no one has the money to spend \n     at the business where I am barely employed. Also I was \n     working full time 40 + hours at the Outer Limits Fun Zone. In \n     January my hours were cut to 16 hours or less per week and \n     June 26 my hours were reduced to a mere 6 hours weekly. Yes, \n     I am going to have to find at least another part-time job to \n     stay afloat.\n       If this keeps up I do not know if we can survive. It is \n     getting real scary!! Thanks for listening,\n     Brenda.\n                                  ____\n\n       I drive from Middleton to Boise 5 days a week to work. The \n     traffic is heavy and sometimes slow. I wish there was a \n     motorcycle lane on the freeway for those that want to ride \n     our motorcycles to work. It costs a lot less to ride a \n     motorcycle than a car. My husband rides his motorcycle to \n     work every day when weather permits. He spends $7 per week. \n     That is a relief for us, since his truck would cost a lot \n     more to fill up.\n       Nuclear power--I do not believe we need to pollute the \n     Earth with this poison. During World War II, our government \n     paid scientists to develop the nuclear bomb. These people \n     worked hard, until they were successful in their endeavors. \n     Why then can not we do the same to find other non-pollutes \n     forms of energy?\n       It is imperative that we do not continue to pollute the \n     Earth. When a natural disaster happens, like floods, \n     earthquakes, etc., the poisons of the Earth hunt mankind. Let \n     us learn from what is happening around the world--disasters, \n     and let us develop forms of energy that will not come back to \n     haunt us later.\n     Telma.\n                                  ____\n\n       You asked Idahoans to share their stories of how high \n     energy prices are affecting us. Many of us in Adams County \n     and surrounding areas face an even greater crisis than the \n     high cost of energy. We are being denied fuel to heat our \n     homes. And it is not the big oil companies or OPEC that are \n     leaving us out in the cold. It is the U.S. Forest Service.\n       As you know, all of America's national forests are required \n     to develop new Travel Management Plans to designate roads and \n     motorized trails in order to curtail indiscriminate cross-\n     country motorized travel and protect natural resources. \n     Private citizens, our Adams County Commissioners, and the \n     Adams Natural Resource Committee have worked diligently with \n     the Payette National Forest for the past two years to try to \n     craft a reasonable, pragmatic travel plan. After all, the \n     Payette National Forest makes up nearly two-thirds of the \n     land in our county. It is important to us to be good stewards \n     of our public land while maintaining access for work and \n     play. For many residents of Adams County, that access \n     includes the ability to gather firewood to heat our homes.\n       Throughout the NEPA process for the Travel Management Plan, \n     we submitted hundreds of comments regarding the importance of \n     firewood collection for personal use. Many families in west-\n     central Idaho continue to heat their homes exclusively or \n     primarily with wood. However, the Forest Supervisor has \n     determined that firewood gathering is a ``non-significant \n     issue,'' according to the FEIS. Decisionmakers seem \n     determined to move ahead with the alternative that closes all \n     roads on the forest unless they are designated open. In \n     addition, wood cutters would be limited to traveling no more \n     than 300 feet from a designated road to retrieve firewood. I \n     invite you to come drive the few roads that will remain open \n     to motorized travel and try to find enough firewood that \n     meets all of the current and proposed restrictions. You \n     quickly will see why so many Idahoans are hot about these \n     unnecessarily restrictive regulations.\n       Firewood is a renewable bio-fuel, not a fossil fuel that is \n     expensive to locate, extract, refine and distribute. Under \n     former firewood guidelines, with careful scouting, we were \n     able to find suitable firewood within 20 to 30 miles of our \n     homes. Under the proposed firewood restrictions, we may have \n     to travel 60 to 80 miles each time we need to bring home a \n     load of wood. And each household will have to make several of \n     those lengthy, fuel-consuming trips each year to lie in \n     enough wood for the winter. In addition, as accessible \n     firewood becomes more and more scarce because of these \n     restrictions, we will see more user conflicts, resource \n     damage, and accidents among woodcutters forced into close \n     proximity.\n       The solution to this problem is obvious. The Payette \n     National Forest can simply designate all existing forest \n     roads open to motorized travel unless specific resource \n     concerns necessitate closure. Remember, the purpose of the \n     national rule was to control indiscriminate cross-country \n     travel. The directive is to keep motorized vehicles on \n     the roads and trails. Blanket closures of more roads and \n     trails does not accomplish that goal. In fact, such \n     sweeping closures are counterintuitive. Nor has the Forest \n     conducted a thorough analysis of existing roads and \n     trails, despite our repeated requests. Furthermore, these \n     extensive closures create a genuine hardship for Idaho \n     families who are trying to heat their homes efficiently \n     and economically, using renewable biomass that is close to \n     home, rather than scarce fossil fuels from halfway around \n     the world.\n       Please restore some sanity to this process. Encourage the \n     Payette Forest Supervisor to select the less radical and less \n     onerous alternative for the new Travel Management Plan. By \n     designating all existing forest roads open unless otherwise \n     marked, she will make it possible for rural Idahoans to \n     continue to gather firewood from our National Forest. At the \n     same time, she will help better distribute use across the \n     forest, rather than concentrating users on few roads and \n     condensed areas, which would actually accelerate damage to \n     the resource, increase user conflicts, and raise the risk of \n     accidents when too many woodcutters converge in smaller and \n     smaller confines.\n       Let us utilize renewable biomass while reducing the \n     wildfire fuel load in our backyard. Thank you for supporting \n     responsible use of our natural resources and our public \n     lands.\n     Wendy, Indian Valley.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am glad you are willing to listen to the residents of \n     Idaho. Gas prices continue to amaze me and we have cut back \n     on traveling\n\n[[Page S4888]]\n\n     as much as possible. As a result in increased fuel prices, \n     food prices continue to climb as do electricity costs. \n     Unfortunately, salaries and benefits do not continue to rise \n     as well.\n       I know that it is hard to know what to do to help the \n     situation, but I have one solution that would benefit us. Get \n     rid of daylight savings. Not only do my children (and I) have \n     a hard time adjusting to the time change every spring and \n     fall, but I honestly feel it causes us to use more energy. We \n     have to stay up until nearly midnight every night just to \n     allow the house to cool down. My children also stay up later \n     because it is still light outside until 10 p.m. so it is easy \n     to lose track of time. I believe one of the states did a \n     study as well and found that daylight savings does indeed \n     cause us to use more energy not less. My son just returned \n     from visiting family in Arizona, and he is ready to do away \n     with daylight savings as well. Please consider this as a \n     potential help to our energy problems.\n     Sheryl.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am a 73-year-old senior trying to live on Social Security \n     and a bit of other income. Over 2 years ago, we took \n     guardianship of a great-granddaughter; her mother is \n     incarcerated due to meth addiction. We have a diabetic \n     daughter whose kidneys failed; she is now undergoing \n     treatment three times a week. She nearly bled to death three \n     times in one month, as she was home sleeping and her shunts \n     opened. They had to close them off and use a chest catheter \n     now. She is scheduled for a triple bypass and to correct a \n     heart defect on July 8.\n       We are so grateful to still have her with us. We have to \n     help her with her many bills (medical, food, gas etc.), as \n     she lives alone in a small house about 3 miles from us. She \n     still is able to enjoy some freedom in her life, as long as \n     we can afford all this. I do not know how long we can do \n     this. She is able to get some assistance, but not nearly \n     enough.\n       My husband, who will be 77 in August, has gone back to work \n     on a temporary job at the INEL, for as long as he can handle. \n     He is gone 12 hours a day from home.\n       Yesterday, I went to Wal-Mart, and a 5-pound block of \n     cheddar cheese was $18.97 per cube.\n       Just how much can this go on? Why was this allowed to go on \n     at all? With an energy bill all these years. As far as I am \n     concerned, everyone who voted against these bills [was not \n     considering the long-term. Now the American public is paying \n     for the short-sightedness of these actions.]\n     Lydia, Idaho Falls.\n                                  ____\n\n       I am writing in concerns to the raising gas prices and how \n     it is affecting me. I currently work full-time as a paper \n     delivery person. I have nine routes between two paper \n     companies, the Spokesman Review and the Daily Bee. Last year \n     I was forced to pick up more routes within my area just so I \n     could pay for gas and still support my three little girls. \n     This year as gas continues to climb, I am forced to go to \n     work cleaning houses on the side during the day, on top of my \n     paper routes. I am a mother who was working nights so I could \n     be home with my kids and not pay someone else to raise my \n     kids for me. Last year I started home schooling my two \n     school-age children due to lack of faith in the public school \n     system. My kids love it and are excelling now where one was \n     behind at the beginning of last year.\n       Now I face trying to juggle two jobs, my own schooling and \n     the schooling of two of my children. I am trying to better \n     myself, and every time things look up financially, the cost \n     of gas or something else goes up, but the cost of living and \n     the going pay rates stay the same. Tell me how a single \n     mother of three is supposed to get out of poverty when the \n     cost of everything, especially gas for those who work in the \n     service industry, is going up faster than the money is coming \n     in. I am not looking for hand-outs; I just want things to be \n     reasonable. When delivering papers, you can have a walk route \n     or motor route. The motor routes get paid twice to three \n     times as much as the walk routes. I have walk routes but so \n     many papers that I have to drive, not to mention the wear and \n     tear of the stop and go of the job. I also have to porch 90 \n     percent of my papers, which has caused wear and tear on my \n     body that cannot be fixed. I feel that a paper route is a \n     paper route, and you should get the same rate per paper, not \n     a different rate for different mileage. What about the miles \n     on my body that is twice as much as someone with a motor \n     route? I would like to see changes in the way we are \n     reimbursed for gas because 40 cents to the gallon, when a \n     gallon is $4 just is not fair for anyone.\n     Accalia, Sandpoint.\n                                  ____\n\n       Our family has cut back on the use of our auto. We have a \n     high mileage Honda Civic that gets 40+ mpg on trips but we \n     only make a trip when we have to. We combine errands and use \n     the car for dual tasks. We will walk or carpool when \n     possible.\n       Now I have an immediate short-term solution to the high \n     price of gas, jet fuel, and diesel. It involves our \n     government subsidizing the cost of energy to hold the price \n     of gas at around $2.50 a gallon to the consumer. It would not \n     increase the Federal Government's budget. You could simply \n     eliminate all the pork packages added to about every bill \n     that is passed. You could also eliminate the subsidies to the \n     big oil companies and, if necessary, eliminate the \n     agricultural subsidies, especially the ethanol support. What \n     I am saying is that if government would use the taxpayers' \n     money with frugality and common sense, they would have the \n     resources to hold the price of fuel down until a permanent \n     solution surfaces.

WRIGHT\n\n Mr. GRAHAM. Mr. President, I wish today to recognize and pay \ntribute to MG Daniel V. Wright, the Deputy Judge Advocate General of \nthe Army, for his many years of exceptionally meritorious service to \nour country. General Wright will retire from the Army on May 29, 2009, \nhaving completed a distinguished 36-year military career. We owe him a \ndebt of gratitude for his many contributions to our Nation and the \nlegal profession, particularly during operations in support of the \nglobal war on terror.\n  Born on the Fourth of July in 1951, in Birmingham, AL, this great \npatriot grew up in Miami, FL. He graduated in 1973 from the United \nStates Military Academy and was commissioned as an infantry officer. \nHis initial assignment was to the 25th Infantry Division, Schofield \nBarracks, Hawaii, where he served as an infantry officer until 1977. He \nwas then selected by the Army to attend law school through the Funded \nLegal Education Program and completed his legal studies at the \nUniversity of Miami.\n  His career as a Judge Advocate spanned the globe and included the \nmost challenging assignments. He quickly distinguished himself as an \nexpert in operational law when he served as the first Regimental Judge \nAdvocate for the 75th Ranger Regiment, America's premier rapid-reaction \nassault force. He later served as the legal adviser for the Joint \nSpecial Operations Command at Fort Bragg, NC, where he participated in \noperations in Somalia and Haiti. As the Staff Judge Advocate for the \nU.S. Army Southern European Task Force, SETAF, in Vicenza, Italy, he \ntwice deployed to central Africa as the Joint Task Force legal adviser \nin support of regional stabilization, refugee return, and noncombatant \nevacuation operations. From 1999 to 2001 he served as the Staff Judge \nAdvocate for XVIII Airborne Corps and Fort Bragg, where he advised the \noperational commander of over 85,000 soldiers worldwide.\n  Upon selection and promotion as a general officer in 2001, he assumed \nresponsibilities as the Commander, U.S. Army Legal Services Agency, and \nChief Judge, U.S. Army Court of Criminal Appeals. His service included \nsupervision of the Army's considerable litigation program, government \nand defense appellate programs, and Chief Judge of the Army's criminal \nappellate court.\n  In 2003, he was appointed the Assistant Judge Advocate General for \nMilitary Law and Operations, where he forged a cohesive team of experts \nwho delivered legal advice across a wide range of disciplines including \nthe establishment of the Office of Military Commissions, the evolving \nrole of the law in judicial reconstruction and stability operations, \nand the significant growth of contractors as force multipliers.\n  General Wright was appointed Deputy Judge Advocate General on October \n1, 2005, and promoted to the rank of major general. In this position he \nserved as the principal assistant for the largest legal services corps \nwithin the Department of Defense, with more than 9,000 uniformed and \ncivilian attorneys, paralegal NCOs, and civilian support staff across \n651 offices in 19 countries. General Wright routinely advised the Judge \nAdvocate General, the Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, and other senior \nmilitary leaders on the most sensitive matters of policy, personnel, \nethics, operational law, and military justice. His advice has been \ninvaluable because it was built on decades of perspective, experience, \nand study, and was delivered with clarity and candor.\n  General Wright's awards include the Defense Superior Service Medal, \nthe Legion of Merit, Army Meritorious Service Medal, Joint Service \nCommendation Medal, Army Commendation Medal, Army Achievement Medal, \nArmed Forces Expeditionary Medal, and Humanitarian Service Medal. He \nhas earned the Expert Infantryman's Badge, the Master Parachutist \nBadge, and the Ranger Tab.\n\n[[Page S4889]]\n\n  I know all my colleagues join me in saluting MG Daniel V.

Mr. President, I would like to recognize Mr. Jesse \nKuhaulua, renowned sumo wrestler and stablemaster. June 6, 2009, marks \nMr. Kuhaulua's 65th birthday, and official retirement from the sport of \nsumo. It is with warm aloha that I congratulate Mr. Kuhaulua on these \nmilestones.\n  The traditions of sumo span centuries. During the 8th century, sumo \nwrestling matches were integrated into the ceremonies of the Imperial \nCourt. With the support of the Imperial Court, sumo evolved and \ndeveloped rules and techniques that closely resemble the sumo of today. \nIn the 12th century, under a military dictatorship, intense warfare \nensued, and sumo was used to improve fighting skills. When peace was \nrestored in the early 17th century, professional sumo groups were \norganized to entertain the rapidly expanding mercantile class, and sumo \ncame into its own as the national sport of Japan. The present day Japan \nSumo Association has its origins in these groups. An amalgamation of \nShinto ritual, skill, and entertainment, sumo is more than a practice \nof strength and combat. Sumo epitomizes Japanese culture and its \naffinity for tradition.\n  Mr. Kuhaulua was born and raised in Hawaii on the Island of Maui, and \nin 1964 left the islands to pursue the sport of sumo in Japan. Over the \ncourse of nearly 45 years, as both a wrestler and stablemaster, Mr. \nKuhaulua has been a pioneer and a legend. As an individual athlete, his \nachievements are outstanding. Mr. Kuhaulua holds almost every all-time \nindividual sumo record of endurance or in the iron-man category. As a \ntrail blazer, he has earned a place in sumo history that will never be \nforgotten, as the first foreigner to win a tournament championship, and \nto open a sumo stable. His coaching skills helped develop the skills of \nMr. Chad Rowan, the first foreigner to achieve the rank of Yokozuna. \nThe legacy Mr. Kuhaulua leaves the world of sumo wrestling will \ncontinue to be an inspiration for generations to come.\n  I applaud Mr. Kuhaulua for his hard work and perseverance that has \nled to his great achievements in sumo, and wish him the best in the \nbright years ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4889-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING LIE-NIELSEN TOOLWORKS INC.\n\n Ms. SNOWE. Mr. President, American entrepreneurs often make \ntheir mark by honing their skills to meet a public demand. Today I wish \nto recognize Lie-Nielsen Toolworks Inc., a small business in my home \nState of Maine, that saw a need in specialty toolmaking, and moved \nquickly to fill it.\n  As a boy, Thomas Lie-Nielsen spent many hours in his father's \nworkshop as seasoned woodworkers practiced their craft, absorbing their \ntechniques. An English major in college, Mr. Lie-Nielsen always \nmaintained a fondness for woodworking, and later worked for a mail \norder woodworking tools business. When larger manufacturers began to \ndrop specialty tools from their lines, he moved to the small Maine town \nof West Rockport, where he opened his shop in 1981 to fill the \nspecialty tool niche. In 1988, as the business grew, Mr. Lie-Nielsen \nmoved the company to the neighboring town of Warren, where he later \nopened a 13,000-square-foot facility for its day-to-day operations. In \n1998, Lie-Nielsen acquired the Independence Tool Company, further \ngrowing the company's size.\n  Starting out producing just two tools in 1981, Lie-Nielsen today \nmanufactures almost 100 different tools, from planes to spokeshaves to \nspecial inlay tools. The company now employs more than 60 Mainers, \ncrafting woodworking tools from a variety of native American hardwoods \nfound mostly throughout New England. Lie-Nielsen ships its tools to \ncustomers abroad, as far away as Europe, Japan and Australia. The \ncompany also teaches the craft of woodworking through its training DVDs \nwhich feature how to get the most out of their specialty, hand-crafted \nLie-Nielsen tools.\n  Mr. Lie-Nielsen remains personally committed to the success of his \nbusiness, particularly through increased production and the development \nof new and sturdy products. He is particularly responsive to comments \nand suggestions from his company's customers in designing new tools \nthey would like Lie-Nielsen to make. Additionally, Mr. Lie-Nielsen \nfrequently travels throughout the United States and Canada discussing \nthe woodworking and tool-making trade at informational talks and \npresentations. He is also an accomplished author, having written \n``Taunton's Complete Illustrated Guide to Sharpening,'' as well as co-\nauthoring ``Taunton's Complete Illustrated Guide to Woodworking.''\n  On April 17 of this year, Maine Governor John Baldacci presented Lie-\nNielsen, along with five other excellent Maine companies, with the 2009 \nGovernor's Award for Business Excellence. Lie-Nielsen was selected for \nthe company's innovative spirit and for its strong record of community \nservice and dedication to investing in its workforce. I extend my \ncongratulations to Lie-Nielsen Toolworks for this outstanding \nrecognition.\n  Carving out a specialty niche in the woodworking world, Lie-Nielsen \nhas excelled as a leader in the craft of toolmaking. It is the passion, \ndrive, and innovation of entrepreneurs like Thomas Lie-Nielsen that \nwill shape our economic future. I wish Mr. Lie-Nielsen, founder and \nCEO, and everyone at Lie-Nielsen Toolworks, Inc. a successful \nyear.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4889-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      MESSAGES FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Messages from the President of the United States were communicated to \nthe Senate by Mrs. Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4889-4", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4889]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      EXECUTIVE MESSAGES REFERRED\n\n  As in executive session the Presiding Officer laid before the Senate \nmessages from the President of the United States submitting sundry \nnominations which were referred to the appropriate committees.\n  (The nominations received today are printed at the end of the Senate \nproceedings.)\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4889-5", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4889-S4890]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGES FROM THE HOUSE\n\n  At 12:18 p.m., a message from the House of Representatives, delivered \nby Mr. Zapata, one of its reading clerks, announced that the House \nagrees to the report of the committee of conference on the disagreeing \nvotes of the two Houses on the amendment of the House to the resolution \n(S.

A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to modify \nthe term ``5-year property''; to the Committee on Finance.\n  Ms. MURKOWSKI. Mr. President, I rise today to introduce two pieces of \nlegislation S. 922 and S. 923, that I hope will be the next major step \nthat this Congress takes to help an exciting form of renewable energy \nto become more established as a viable energy technology. I am \nreferring to helping the expansion of the ocean hydrokinetic energy \nindustry.\n  Today I am introducing the Marine Renewable Energy Promotion Act of \n2009 and a companion tax provision. They are companion measures to one \nthat has been introduced in the House of Representatives by Rep. Jay \nInslee of Washington.\n  For a number of years this Nation has been providing help with \nresearch and other assistance to promote the development of energy from \nour oceans and rivers, using the tides, currents, waves and even the \nthermal properties of our oceans to generate electricity. With 70 \npercent of our planet covered with water, and the energy that the sun \nproduces--each day oceans absorb the energy equivalent of 250 billion \nbarrels of oil--and the energy that winds produce and impart to that \nwater, marine hydrokinetic energy has the potential to be a major \nsource of the world's clean, non-carbon emitting power in the future.\n\n[[Page S4893]]\n\n  The Electric Power Research Institute has estimated that ocean \nresources in the U.S. could generate 252 million megawatt hours of \nelectricity--6.5 percent of America's entire electricity generation--if \nocean energy gained the same financial and research incentives \ncurrently enjoyed by other forms of renewable energy.\n  In 2005 in the Energy Policy Act we started the process of leveling \nthe playing field. Besides authorizing a greater Federal research \npreference, we granted ocean energy the federal purchase requirement \nand the federal production incentive. In 2007's Energy Independence and \nSecurity Act, we furthered energy research and authorized the funding \nof research and ocean energy demonstration centers. In 2008, ocean \nenergy finally was qualified to receive a renewable energy Production \nTax Credit--unfortunately at a lower rate than some other renewables \nreceive. But the PTC establishes the principle that ocean energy is a \nvaluable future technology to meet electricity generation needs.\n  Now we are proposing that additional Federal aid be granted to all \npotential forms of Marine Renewable Energy to allow the industry's \ngrowth to advance more rapidly. The bill authorizes the Department of \nEnergy to increase its research and development effort, working to \ndevelop new technologies, reduce manufacturing and operating costs of \nthe devices, improve the reliability and survivability of marine \nenergy facilities and make sure that such power can be integrated into \nthe national electricity grid. The bill also encourages efforts to \nallow marine energy to work in conjunction with other forms of energy, \nsuch as offshore wind, and authorizes more federal aid to assess and \ndeal with any environmental impacts. The bill also authorizes \nestablishment of project standards and provides for incentives to help \nthe industry comply with any standards developed.\n\n  Allows for the creation of a Federal Marine-Based Energy Device \nVerification program, so the Government tests and certifies the \nperformance of new marine technologies to reduce market risks for \nutilities to purchase power from such projects.\n  Authorizes the Federal Government to set up an adaptive management \nprogram, and a fund to help pay for the regulatory permitting and \ndevelopment of new marine technologies.\n  A separate bill, likely to be referred to the Senate Finance \nCommittee for consideration, authorizes that marine projects benefit \nfrom being able to accelerate the depreciation of their project costs \nover five years--like some other renewable energy technologies \ncurrently can do. That should enhance project economic returns for \nprivate developers.\n  The legislation in total authorizes up to $250 million a year of \nFederal funding for research. It is in keeping with the goals of the \nObama administration to markedly increase funding for prospective \nrenewable energy technologies that can help reduce U.S. and global \ncarbon emissions and reduce our dependence on fossil fuels for energy \nproduction.\n  The technology this bill could foster could be of immense benefit to \ncoastal regions and the U.S. power grid overall. In my home State of \nAlaska, for example, there are nearly 150 communities located along the \nState's 34,000 miles of coastline plus dozens more on the major river \nsystems, which may benefit from the economies that gaining power from \nthe free fuels of nature's currents and waves provides. In a State \nwhere rural electricity is currently averaging 65 cents per kilowatt \nhour when generated from diesel fuels--ocean energy offers the \npotential to sharply reduce all costs and vastly improve the local \neconomy and thus the economy of the entire Nation.\n  There are a number of difficult challenges ahead to realize the \npotential of marine renewable energy from building reliable devices at \neconomical costs. But these bills are another step toward getting on \nwith the task of identifying and meeting those challenges. The \npotential is well worth the cost.\n  I hope this body will quickly include these provisions in \ncomprehensive energy legislation and help this new industry to advance \nfor the benefit of all Americans.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. CORNYN (for himself, Mr. Voinovich, Mr. Ensign, Mrs. \n        Hutchison, and Mr. Chambliss):\n  S. 926. A bill to provide for the continuing review of unauthorized \nFederal programs and agencies and to establish a bipartisan commission \nfor the purpose of improving oversight and eliminating Government \nspending; to the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs.\n  Mr. CORNYN. Mr. President, I rise to introduce the United States \nAuthorization and Sunset Commission Act of 2009. I am very pleased to \nbe joined by my colleagues and good friends, Senators Voinovich, \nChambliss, Ensign and Hutchison, who share my commitment that every \ndime sent by taxpayers to Washington, DC is spent wisely.\n  The President has said several times that he intends to go through \nthe Federal budget line-by-line--ending programs that we do not need \nand making the ones we do need work better and cost less. It is in this \nsame spirit that I introduce this legislation.\n  The United States Authorization and Sunset Commission Act of 2009 \ncreates an 8 member bipartisan Commission, made up of 4 Senators and 4 \nRepresentatives. The Commission will look at the effectiveness and \nefficiency of all federal programs, but will especially focus on \nunauthorized and ineffective programs. The bill is modeled after the \nsunset process that the State of Texas instituted in 1977 to identify \nand eliminate waste, duplication, and inefficiency in government \nagencies. This process has led to the elimination of dozens of agencies \nthat have outlived their usefulness and has saved Texas taxpayers \nhundreds of millions of dollars.\n  The job of the Commission is to ask the fundamental question: ``Is an \nagency or program still needed?''\n  The Commission has two major responsibilities. First, the Commission \nmust submit a legislative proposal to Congress at least once every 10 \nyears that includes a review schedule of at least 25 percent of \nunauthorized Federal programs and at least 25 percent of ineffective \nfederal programs or where effectiveness cannot be shown by the Office \nof Management and Budget's, OMB, Performance Assessment Rating Tool, \nPART. The Commission's schedule will abolish each program if Congress \nfails to either reauthorize the program or consider the Commission's \nrecommendations within 2 years.\n  Second, the Commission must conduct a review of each program \nidentified in its review schedule and send its recommendations for \nCongressional review. Congress will then have 2 years to consider and \npass the Commission's recommendations or to reauthorize the program \nbefore it is abolished.\n  Congress has two bites of the apple when it comes to evaluating \nfederal spending. First, when it authorizes a program and second when \nit appropriates the money for it. Yet, the Congressional Budget Office, \nCBO, annually finds that Congress spends billions of taxpayers' money \non agencies and programs despite the fact that their authorization had \nexpired. Many of these expired programs and agencies--perhaps most--\ndeserve reauthorization. Nonetheless, Congress should aggressively \ndetermine whether these programs and agencies are working as intended \nand the Commission will help serve this purpose.\n  In addition, the Commission will use OMB's PART, which is a tool to \nassess and improve program performance. PART looks at all factors that \naffect and reflect program performance including program purpose and \ndesign, performance measurement, evaluations and strategic planning, \nprogram management, and program results. Using PART, OMB has scored \nover 1,000 government programs and found that 20 percent were not \nperforming--they were found to be ineffective or their effectiveness \ncould not be determined.\n  The Commission's work will be guided by 10 criteria, including the \nprogram's effectiveness and efficiency, achievement of performance \ngoals, and whether the program has fulfilled its legislative intent.\n  Unfortunately Congress has a tendency to create commissions and then \nignore their work and continue on with business as usual. This bill \nsolves this problem. It requires Congress to consider, debate, and vote \non the Commission's report under expedited procedures.\n\n[[Page S4894]]\n\n  The United States Authorization and Sunset Commission Act of 2009 is \nan important step to getting our fiscal house in order and to making \nsure that Congress gets back to the hard work of oversight to determine \nif programs actually fulfill their stated purpose or yield some \nunintended or counterproductive results. Periodic assessments are \nessential to good Government and this is what the Commission will \nprovide to Congress and to taxpayers across the country. For this \nreason, I ask that my colleagues join me in cosponsoring the United \nStates Authorization and Sunset Commission Act of 2009.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 926\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Upon introduction, the bill \n     shall be referred to the appropriate committees of Congress \n     under paragraph (2). If the bill is not introduced in \n     accordance with the preceding sentence, then any Member of \n     Congress may introduce that bill in their respective House of \n     Congress beginning on the date that is the 5th calendar day \n     that such House is in session following the date of the \n     submission of such proposal with provisions.\n       (2) Committee consideration.--\n       (A) Referral.--A bill introduced under paragraph (1) shall \n     be referred to any appropriate committee of jurisdiction in \n     the Senate, any appropriate committee of jurisdiction in the \n     House of Representatives, the Committee on the Budget and the \n     Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of \n     the Senate, and the Committee on the Budget and the Committee \n     on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (B) Reporting.--Not later than 30 calendar days after the \n     introduction of the bill, each committee of Congress to which \n     the bill was referred shall report the bill or a committee \n     amendment thereto.\n       (C) Discharge of committee.--If a committee to which is \n     referred a bill has not reported such bill at the end of 30 \n     calendar days after its introduction or at the end of the \n     first day after there has been reported to the House involved \n     a bill, whichever is earlier, such committee shall be deemed \n     to be discharged from further consideration of such bill, and \n     such bill shall be placed on the appropriate calendar of the \n     House involved.\n       (b) Expedited Procedure.--\n       (1) Consideration.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 5 calendar days after the \n     date on which a committee has been discharged from \n     consideration of a bill, the majority leader of the Senate, \n     or the majority leader's designee, or the Speaker of the \n     House of Representatives, or the Speaker's designee, shall \n     move to proceed to the consideration of the committee \n     amendment to the bill, and if there is no such amendment, to \n     the bill.

A motion to reconsider the vote by which the motion \n     to proceed is agreed to or not agreed to shall not be in \n     order. If the motion to proceed is agreed to, the Senate or \n     the House of Representatives, as the case may be, shall \n     immediately proceed to consideration of the Commission \n     Schedule and Review bill without intervening motion, order, \n     or other business, and the Commission Schedule and Review \n     bill shall remain the unfinished business of the Senate or \n     the House of Representatives, as the case may be, until \n     disposed of.\n       (C) Limited debate.--Debate on the Commission Schedule and \n     Review bill and on all debatable motions and appeals in \n     connection therewith shall be limited to not more than 10 \n     hours, which shall be divided equally between those favoring \n     and those opposing the Commission Schedule and Review bill. A \n     motion further to limit debate on the Commission Schedule and \n     Review bill is in order and is not debatable. All time used \n     for consideration of the Commission Schedule and Review bill, \n     including time used for quorum calls (except quorum calls \n     immediately preceding a vote) and voting, shall come from the \n     10 hours of debate.\n       (D) Amendments.--No amendment to the Commission Schedule \n     and Review bill shall be in order in the Senate and the House \n     of Representatives.\n       (E) Vote on final passage.--Immediately following the \n     conclusion of the debate on the Commission Schedule and \n     Review bill, the vote on final passage of the Commission \n     Schedule and Review bill shall occur.\n       (F) Other motions not in order.--A motion to postpone \n     consideration of the Commission Schedule and Review bill, a \n     motion to proceed to the consideration of other business, or \n     a motion to recommit the Commission Schedule and Review bill \n     is not in order.

Upon disposition of a Commission Schedule \n     and Review bill that is received by one House from the other \n     House, it shall no longer be in order to consider the \n     Commission Schedule and Review bill that was introduced in \n     the receiving House.\n       (c) Rules of the Senate and the House of Representatives.--\n     This section is enacted by Congress--\n       (1) as an exercise of the rulemaking power of the Senate \n     and the House of Representatives, respectively, and is deemed \n     to be part of the rules of each House, respectively, but \n     applicable only with respect to the procedure to be followed \n     in that House in the case of a Commission Schedule and Review \n     bill, and it supersedes other rules only to the extent that \n     it is inconsistent with such rules; and\n       (2) with full recognition of the constitutional right of \n     either House to change the rules (so far as they relate to \n     the procedure of that House) at any time, in the same manner, \n     and to the same extent as in the case of any other rule of \n     that House.\n                                 ______\n                                 \n      By Mr. LEAHY (for himself and Mr. Sanders):\n  S. 929. A bill to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \na Federal income tax credit for the purchase of certain nonroad \nequipment powered by alternative power sources; to the Committee on \nFinance.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, I rise today with my good friend from \nVermont, Senator Sanders, to introduce legislation that will help our \nenvironment and our economy by providing a 25 percent tax credit \ntowards the purchase of environmentally friendly lawn, garden, and \nforestry power equipment.\n  There are an estimated 50 million acres of lawns and managed turf \ngrass in the U.S. and the small engines used in power equipment \npredominantly used today to maintain these lawns emit a variety of \npollutants that can be harmful to people and the environment. By \npromoting the use of alternative fuels, we can reduce the carbon \nfootprint of lawn and garden equipment and reduce air and water \npollution.\n  The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, recently finalized a new \nemission control program to reduce hydrocarbon emissions and \nevaporative emissions from the small, spark-ignition engines that are \ncommonly used in lawn, garden, and forestry equipment. I applaud the \nEPA for setting these new emissions standards because they eventually \nwill reduce the harmful health effects of ozone and carbon monoxide. I \nalso appreciate the work being done in the State of California to set \nthe stage for these tougher standards and to provide State funds for \nrebates to consumers who purchase the cleanest types of lawn and garden \nequipment.\n  We can do more, though, to advance the use of cleaner, alternative \nfueled equipment. Currently, the cleanest, alternative powered \nequipment typically costs dramatically more to produce--in part due to \ntheir relatively low volumes--compared to higher volume products \npowered by traditional technologies. Our bill is designed to help \npartially close this price differential so that consumers can afford \nthe very cleanest products and help advance the most cutting-edge, new \ntechnologies.\n  That is why the bill we are introducing today would reduce air \npollution even further than the EPA or California standards by \nproviding an immediate incentive for people to go beyond the current \npowered equipment emission standards and purchase cleaner, \nalternatively powered or alternative fuel engines and equipment that \nemit half of the emission levels called for by the EPA and that operate \non little or no fossil fuels. In line with past tax credits that were \nsuccessful in advancing new technologies and boosting consumer demand \nfor environmentally friendly products like hybrid vehicles and energy \nefficient home appliances, our new tax credit would give Americans a \npowerful incentive to buy clean, alternative energy power equipment.\n  I want to thank the Outdoor Power Equipment Institute and the \nNational Audubon Society for their early endorsements of this bill. As \nthe Senate prepares to take a thorough look at our energy and \nenvironmental policies this year, I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues to find new ways to further reduce the air emissions and \nfossil fuel consumption of our Nation's lawn, garden, and forestry \nequipment.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 929\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

A bill to amend title 9 of the United States Code with \nrespect to arbitration; to the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. FEINGOLD. Mr. President, today I will introduce the Arbitration \nFairness Act of 2007. Just as its name suggests, the Arbitration \nFairness Act is designed to return fairness to the arbitration system. \nThis bill is not an anti-arbitration bill. If anything, it is pro-\narbitration. I firmly believe that this bill will strengthen the \narbitration system by returning arbitration to a more equitable design \nthat reflects the intent of the original arbitration legislation, the \nFederal Arbitration Act.\n  President Calvin Coolidge signed the Federal Arbitration Act, FAA, \ninto law on February 12, 1925. Congress passed the FAA to make \narbitration an enforceable alternative to the civil courts. Even as \nearly as the 1920's,\n\n[[Page S4898]]\n\nthere were concerns about the efficiency of the civil court system and \na desire to allow a speedier alternative. The intent of the FAA, as \nexpressed in a 1923 hearing before a Subcommittee of the Senate \nJudiciary Committee, was ``to enable business men to settle their \ndisputes expeditiously and economically.'' In a later hearing on the \nFAA, it was clarified that the legislation was not intended to apply to \nthe employment contracts of those businesses. This distinction is \nimportant because it illustrates that, while arbitration was something \nthat the FAA's original sponsors wanted to promote, they were also \ncareful to make clear that they didn't intend for arbitration to become \na weapon to be wielded by the powerful against those with less \nfinancial and negotiating power.\n  Since the FAA's enactment, the use of arbitration has grown \nexponentially. Arbitration certainly has advantages. It can be a fair \nand efficient way to settle disputes. I strongly support voluntary, \nalternative dispute resolution methods, and I believe we ought to \nencourage their use. But I also believe that arbitration is a fair way \nto settle disputes between consumers and lenders only when it is \nentered into knowingly and voluntarily by both parties to the dispute \nafter the dispute has arisen. Otherwise arbitration can be used as a \nweapon by the stronger party against the weaker party.\n  One of the most fundamental principles of our justice system is the \nconstitutional right to take a dispute to court. Indeed, all Americans \nhave the right in civil and criminal cases to a trial by jury. The \nright to a jury trial in civil cases in Federal court is contained in \nthe Seventh Amendment to the Constitution. Many States provide a \nsimilar right to a jury trial in civil matters filed in state court.\n  I have been concerned for many years that mandatory arbitration \nclauses are slowly eroding the legal protections that should be \navailable to all Americans. A large and growing number of corporations \nnow require millions of consumers and employees to sign contracts that \ninclude mandatory arbitration clauses. Most of these individuals have \nlittle or no meaningful opportunity to negotiate the terms of their \ncontracts and so find themselves having to choose either to accept a \nmandatory arbitration clause or to forgo securing employment or needed \ngoods and services. Incredibly, mandatory arbitration clauses have been \nused to prevent individuals from trying to vindicate their civil rights \nunder statutes specifically passed by Congress to protect them.\n  There is a range of ways in which mandatory arbitration can be \nparticularly hostile to individuals attempting to assert their rights. \nFor example, the administrative fees--both to gain access to the \narbitration forum and to pay for the ongoing services of the arbitrator \nor arbitrators--can be so high as to act as a de facto bar for many \nindividuals who have a claim that requires resolution. In addition, \narbitration generally lacks discovery proceedings and other civil due \nprocess protections.\n  Furthermore, there is no meaningful judicial review of arbitrators' \ndecisions. Under mandatory, binding arbitration, even if a party \nbelieves that the arbitrator did not consider all the facts or follow \nthe law, the party cannot file a suit in court. The only basis for \nchallenging a binding arbitration decision is fairly narrow: if there \nis reason to believe that the arbitrator committed actual fraud, or was \nbiased, corrupt, or guilty of misconduct, or exceeded his or her \npowers. Because mandatory, binding arbitration is so conclusive, it is \na credible means of dispute resolution only when all parties understand \nthe full ramifications of agreeing to it.\n  Unfortunately, in a variety of contexts--employment agreements, \ncredit card agreements, HMO contracts, securities broker contracts, and \nother consumer and franchise agreements--mandatory arbitration is fast \nbecoming the rule, rather than the exception. The practice of forcing \nemployees to use arbitration has been on the rise since the Supreme \nCourt's Circuit City decision in 2001. Unless Congress acts, the \nprotections it has provided through law for American workers, \ninvestors, and consumers, will slowly become irrelevant.\n  The Arbitration Fairness Act of 2009, which I am happy to say has \nalready been introduced in the House by Rep. Hank Johnson, reinstates \nthe FAA's original intent by requiring that agreements to arbitrate \nemployment, consumer, franchise, or civil rights disputes be made after \nthe dispute has arisen. The bill does not prohibit arbitration. What it \ndoes do is prevent a party with greater bargaining power from forcing \nindividuals into arbitration through a contractual provision. It will \nensure that citizens once again have a true choice between arbitration \nand the traditional civil court system.\n  I should note that the bill includes two notable changes from \nversions that have been introduced in previous Congresses. First, the \nbill creates a new Chapter 4 of Title 9, separating the new provisions \nconcerning arbitration of consumer, employment, franchise, and civil \nrights disputes from the Federal Arbitration Act. This should give some \ncomfort to those who are concerned that the bill might have an \nunintended effect on business to business arbitration.\n  Second, the bill reverses the Supreme Court's April 2009 decision in \n14 Park Plaza v. Pyett. In that case, the Court held that arbitration \nprovisions included in collective bargaining agreements can have the \neffect of preventing employees from pursuing employment discrimination \nclaims in court. Unions have never believed this was the case. The \ndecision once again expands the reach of arbitration, making less \neffective statutes specifically intended by Congress to protect \nworkers. Therefore, the bill provides that it generally does not apply \nto arbitration provisions contained in collective bargaining \nagreements, except that such provisions may not waive employees' rights \nto take constitutional or statutory claims to court.\n  In our system of Government, Congress and state legislatures pass \nlaws and the courts are available to citizens to make sure those laws \nare enforced. But the rule of law means little if the only forum \navailable to those who believe they have been wronged is an \nalternative, unaccountable system where the law passed by the \nlegislature does not necessarily apply. This legislation both protects \nAmericans from exploitation and strengthens a valuable alternative \nmethod of dispute resolution. These are both worthy ends, and I hope \nthat my colleagues in the Senate will join me in working to pass this \nimportant bill.\n  Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the text of the bill be \nprinted in the Record.\n  There being no objection, the text of the bill was ordered to be \nprinted in the Record, as follows:\n\n                                 S. 931\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Arbitration Fairness Act of \n     2009''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Federal Arbitration Act (now enacted as chapter 1 \n     of title 9 of the United States Code) was intended to apply \n     to disputes between commercial entities of generally similar \n     sophistication and bargaining power.\n       (2) A series of United States Supreme Court decisions have \n     changed the meaning of the Act so that it now extends to \n     disputes between parties of greatly disparate economic power, \n     such as consumer disputes and employment disputes. As a \n     result, a large and rapidly growing number of corporations \n     are forcing millions of consumers and employees to give up \n     their right to have disputes resolved by a judge or jury, and \n     instead submit their claims to binding arbitration.\n       (3) Most consumers and employees have little or no \n     meaningful option whether to submit their claims to \n     arbitration. Few people realize or understand the importance \n     of the deliberately fine print that strips them of rights, \n     and because entire industries are adopting these clauses, \n     people increasingly have no choice but to accept them. They \n     must often give up their rights as a condition of having a \n     job, getting necessary medical care, buying a car, opening a \n     bank account, getting a credit card, and the like. Often \n     times, they are not even aware that they have given up their \n     rights.\n       (4) Private arbitration companies are sometimes under great \n     pressure to devise systems that favor the corporate repeat \n     players who decide whether those companies will receive their \n     lucrative business.\n       (5) Mandatory arbitration undermines the development of \n     public law for civil rights and consumer rights because there \n     is no meaningful judicial review of arbitrators' decisions. \n     With the knowledge that their rulings will not be seriously \n     examined by a\n\n[[Page S4899]]\n\n     court applying current law, arbitrators enjoy near complete \n     freedom to ignore the law and even their own rules.\n       (6) Mandatory arbitration is a poor system for protecting \n     civil rights and consumer rights because it is not \n     transparent. While the American civil justice system features \n     publicly accountable decision makers who generally issue \n     public, written decisions, arbitration often offers none of \n     these features.\n       (7) Many corporations add to arbitration clauses unfair \n     provisions that deliberately tilt the systems against \n     individuals, including provisions that strip individuals of \n     substantive statutory rights, ban class actions, and force \n     people to arbitrate their claims hundreds of miles from their \n     homes. While some courts have been protective of individuals, \n     too many courts have erroneously upheld even egregiously \n     unfair mandatory arbitration clauses in deference to a \n     supposed Federal policy favoring arbitration over the \n     constitutional rights of individuals.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. President, this year marks the 80th anniversary of the \nfounding of the Daughters of Penelope. I rise today to introduce with \nmy colleague, Senator Menendez, a resolution honoring their history of \nselfless service and achievement during these eight historic decades.\n  Founded November 16, 1929, in San Francisco, CA, the Daughters of \nPenelope was established to improve the well-being of women and provide \nthem with the opportunity to make significant contributions to American \nsociety. Today its mission is to promote the ideals of ancient Greece--\neducation, philanthropy, civic responsibility, family, and individual \nexcellence through community service and volunteerism.\n  An affiliate organization of the American Hellenic Educational \nProgressive Association, AHEPA, a leading association of American \ncitizens of Greek heritage and Philhellenes, the Daughters of Penelope \nhave worked both within and beyond the Greek-American community to \nachieve remarkable accomplishments. Over its history, its members have \ntirelessly sought to strengthen the status of women in society, shelter \nthe elderly and the abused, educate our youth, promote Hellenic \nheritage, and raise funds for medical research.\n  One project adopted by the Daughters of Penelope is particularly near \nand dear to my heart--its charitable aid to St. Basil Academy, a Greek \nOrthodox Archdiocese home for children in need, which I attended for \nseveral years. Beginning in 1954, the Daughters of Penelope have been \nproviding charitable aid to St. Basil Academy when it embarked on a \nChristmas Seal Campaign to raise funds to build the new water works for \nthe Academy. Since then, the Daughters of Penelope contributed to the \nfurnishing of new buildings that have been built on campus, built a \nheated outdoor swimming pool for the children, and has provided funds \nfor ongoing maintenance and renovations to the Academy for such items \nas replacing outdated appliances and worn-out roofs.\n  In matching their own personal achievement with the desire to help \nothers also achieve their goals, the Daughters of Penelope exemplify \nthe very best in American and Hellenic values. As they embark on \nanother 8 decades of service and accomplishment, I ask my colleagues to \njoin me in congratulating them on their distinguished past, and wishing \nthem every success in the future.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4900-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     SENATE RESOLUTION 118--TO PROVIDE INTERNET ACCESS TO CERTAIN \n              CONGRESSIONAL RESEARCH SERVICE PUBLICATIONS\n\n  Mr. LIEBERMAN (for himself, Mr. McCain, Mr. Harkin, Ms. Collins, Mr. \nLeahy, Mr. Lugar, and Mr. Feingold) submitted the following resolution; \nwhich was referred to the Committee on Rules and Administration:\n\n                              S.

Without objection, it is so \nordered.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, before we move on, there are times in the \nlegislative process that you see someone who has invested a great deal \nof their personal time and passion on an issue. I came to Congress at \nthe same time that Senator Durbin of Illinois came. He is a man, we all \nknow, who is very articulate. He is a person who can express himself \nvery well. He is a person who believes in the legislative process. He \nunderstands that legislation is the art of compromise. But that can be \ncarried a little too far.\n  Senator Durbin has done everything within his power to get an issue \nthat he believes in very strongly. I agree with him. It is unbelievable \nto me that people can have their primary residence in Las Vegas and \nhave a beach house in Laguna, CA, and a ski chalet in Brian Head, UT, \nor some other ski area in Utah, and they come upon hard times. The \nresorts they have at the beach and up in the mountains, they can go to \nbankruptcy court and get that readjusted. Their primary residence, they \ncannot. But a person who has a home in Las Vegas or some other place in \nNevada who comes upon hard times, they cannot do a thing with their \nhome. They cannot go to bankruptcy court. They are stuck with this \nhorrible process, we found.\n  I do not know how to summarize this other than to say that I hope the \nbanks are proud of themselves. I hope they are proud of themselves, of \nwhat they have done--I add in that the financial institutions \ngenerally--what they have done to our country. And now they are \nstanding in the way of our trying to help a little bit, trying to help \npeople who have a home and they cannot get any relief. So the banks are \ngoing to wind up with a lot of peoples' homes because they are going to \nforeclosure upon them and the people have no alternative.\n  On the morning news today, Phoenix, AZ, the price of the homes in the \nlast year--at least the way I heard it on public radio today--the price \nof homes has dropped 50 percent. A home that was worth $500,000 last \nyear is worth $250,000 now.\n  Everyone knows that the assistant leader of the Senate is Senator \nDurbin. We work very closely together. And I help him whenever I can, \nas he helps me whenever he can. But I feel badly for the country. I am \nhappy we got this agreement. Maybe we will be able to get very \nfortunate and pick up some votes. But I am very disappointed in the \nrope-a-dope that has been used on Senator Durbin. He has tried \neverything--everything--to try to get this done. Quite frankly, the \namendment he is going to offer, I wish we would have one a little \nstronger than that.\n  But I hope that there will be a night's rest and people will come in \nand say: I guess Durbin is right. Let's do this. But I want the record \nspread with the fact that the people of the State of Illinois are very \nfortunate to have someone of his caliber, his integrity, working to \nhelp them and in the process help our country.\n  I ask unanimous consent that on Thursday, April 30, upon \ndisposition--Mr. President, I suggest the absence of a quorum.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The clerk will call the roll.\n  The assistant legislative clerk proceeded to call the roll.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the order for \nthe quorum call be rescinded.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

WEICH TO BE AN ASSISTANT ATTORNEY GENERAL\n\n  Mr. REID. I now ask that the Senate proceed to Calendar No. 65.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The nomination will be stated.\n  The assistant legislative clerk read the nomination of Ronald H. \nWeich, of the District of Columbia, to be an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral.\n  Mr. LEAHY. Mr. President, today the Senate considers another of \nPresident Obama's highly-qualified nominees for an important post in \nthe executive branch. Earlier today, the Judiciary Committee reported \nfavorably the nomination of Ron Weich to be Assistant Attorney General \nfor the Office of Legislative Affairs at the Department of Justice. I \nhad hoped that we could expedite this nomination before the recess so \nthat Mr. Weich could begin doing his job for the American people, but \nlack of cooperation from the Republican side prevented us from \nconfirming the nomination then. I am pleased that with cooperation \ntoday, we will confirm Mr. Weich.\n  In more than a decade on Capitol Hill, Ron Weich has advised three \nSenators: Senator Specter, Senator Kennedy, and now Majority Leader \nReid, who introduced Mr. Weich at his hearing 3 weeks ago and strongly \nrecommended his confirmation.\n  At his hearing, I put into the record a letter from Senator Kennedy \ndescribing Mr. Weich as a ``lawyer of exceptional intelligence, skill, \nand sound judgment'' and praising his ``remarkable ability . . . to \nwork extremely well with Members and staff on both sides of the aisle \nand to guide us toward creative solutions to seemingly intractable \nproblems.'' Many of Mr. Weich's former Republican colleagues wrote to \nthis committee to attest to the fact that he is highly regarded among \nboth Republican and Democratic staff, and they spoke of his ``respect \nfor opposing views'' and his ``constructive approach to difficult legal \nissues.'' They described him as ``honorable and trustworthy.'' And of \ncourse, Mr. Weich is equally well-respected outside of this chamber. A \nletter from the Fraternal Order of Police highlights his ``long and \nsterling career as a public safety policymaker'' and notes that he is \n``a passionate champion for justice.''\n  In addition, Mr. Weich has a distinguished record of public service \nas an assistant district attorney in Manhattan, and as a special \ncounsel to the United States Sentencing Commission. He is an \nexperienced Senate hand who has earned the respect of Senators on both \nsides of the aisle. We know him well as a former member of the staff of \nthe Judiciary Committee. I am confident he will be a welcome addition \nto the leadership at the Justice Department, and will make the \nDepartment more responsive to congressional concerns than we have seen \nover the last several years.\n  I congratulate Mr. Weich and his family on his confirmation today and \nlook forward to working with him in his new capacity at the Justice \nDepartment.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. If there is no further debate, the question \nis, Will the Senate advise and consent to the nomination of Ronald H. \nWeich, of the District of Columbia, to be an Assistant Attorney \nGeneral?\n  The nomination was confirmed.\n  Mr. REID. Mr. President, I ask unanimous consent that the motion to \nreconsider be laid on the table and there be no further motions in \norder; that any statements relating to this nomination be printed in \nthe Record; that the President be immediately notified of the Senate's \naction; and the Senate then resume legislative session.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. Without objection, it is so ordered.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4903-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4903]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          LEGISLATIVE SESSION\n\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER.

Mr. President, before I turn this over to Senator Durbin to \nclose, I want to say a word or two about this nomination we just \ncompleted. That is the nomination of Ron Weich.\n  I know Ron has waited with his family for a long time to get this \ndone, but I have tremendously mixed emotions. A part of me was saying: \nI wish maybe\n\n[[Page S4904]]\n\nhe would not get confirmed. But the better part of me and, of course, \ncommon sense dictates that the country needs him. For me, to lose him \nfrom my staff is really very difficult. He was such an important part \nof what we have been able to accomplish here in the Senate. He is a \nreally a fine lawyer with a great legal mind. I have worked closely \nwith him for years.\n  He is going to lead the Justice Department regarding legislative \naffairs. He has had prosecutorial experience and Government experience. \nI know and respect all he has done to strengthen our national security, \nforward the cause of justice, and raise the ethics standards of our \nGovernment and in the whole country. In fact, Ron took a lead role in \nthe last Congress, as we passed the most sweeping ethics and lobbying \nreforms in the history of our Congress and our country.\n  Those who know and work with Ron value not only his extensive \nexperience but just the person he is. I express my appreciation to Ron \nWeich for his sound judgment, his collegiality, his honesty, and \nloyalty to me. Eric Holder will find the same there.\n  While many of his colleagues from Columbia University and Yale Law \nSchool, where he was educated, are out in the private sector making a \nlot of money, Ron has spent most of his life in public service. He came \nback to the Senate after having been in a renowned law firm downtown. \nBut he came back because this is what he wants to do. He is able to \nmake enough money to raise his family. He is not interested in how much \nmoney he makes. He is interested in what good he can do for our \ncountry.\n  Our Nation benefits immensely when people as good at what they do as \nRon is--and as good to others as Ron is--choose to make a difference.\n  As I have indicated, I am sad to see him leave this Capitol complex. \nI am comforted by knowing that Ron will play an important role in \nrebuilding Attorney General Holder's Justice Department to a place \nwhere all are once again equal under the law, protected by the law, and \nno one is above the law.\n  The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Senator from Illinois.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4904-1", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      THANKING THE MAJORITY LEADER\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I thank the majority leader for his kind \nwords. He is a friend of long standing. We came to Washington together \nin the House of Representatives many years ago, and we certainly never \ncould have dreamed, when we arrived here so many years ago, that today \nwe would be able to work so closely and so well in the leadership of \nthe Senate.\n  Harry Reid is a terrific leader. He has done an extraordinary job. \nToday a lot of praise is being given to the President for his first 100 \ndays. I want to add in that chorus of praise Harry Reid, the Senator \nfrom Nevada, who has helped the President achieve the goals that he set \nout to achieve in the first 100 days. He has made an extraordinary \ncommitment to make that happen, not just in time and effort but in \npatience dealing with Members of the U.S. Senate.\n  I thank Senator Reid for his earlier comments.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4904-2", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page S4904]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONFIRMATION OF JOSEPH SZABO\n\n  Mr. DURBIN. Mr. President, I would like to congratulate Mr. Joseph \nSzabo on his confirmation as the next Administrator of the Federal \nRailroad Administration.\n  Joe Szabo has made a significant contribution to my State of \nIllinois, and I believe he is going to bring great success to the \nDepartment of Transportation. Joe Szabo understands better than most \nthe long days, unpredictable schedules, and sometimes hazardous working \nconditions that come with employment in the railroad industry.\n  He has worked for the railroad--both the Illinois Central and Metra--\nsince he was 18 years old, including stints as yard switchman, road \ntrainman, and commuter passenger conductor.\n  Five generations of his family worked on the railroad. Joe learned \nfirsthand about the railroads from his father, a 40-year switchman for \nthe Illinois Central Railroad. His father instilled in him a passion \nfor rail work that has helped Joe become a trusted and respected voice \nin rail labor and in the industry.\n  Joe has a distinguished record of public service and many \naccomplishments to show for his work in Illinois. As elected mayor of \nRiverdale, IL, and State legislative director for the United \nTransportation Union, UTU, Joe has developed a reputation as a \npassionate and effective advocate for freight and passenger rail and \nits workers.\n  During his tenure as UTU State director, Joe's work was integral to \nthe State of Illinois doubling its investment in passenger rail. This \nadditional State investment Joe worked so hard to achieve allowed \nIllinois to double the frequency of Amtrak trains leaving Chicago for \nQuincy, Carbondale, and St. Louis, and to lay the groundwork for \nexpanding service to Rockford and the Quad Cities--our next \nachievements, I hope soon.\n  Joe's advocacy helped Illinois passenger rail achieve the fastest \ngrowth in ridership and revenue in the entire national Amtrak system.\n  Joe will now bring his passion for the railroad industry and his \nexperience with rail labor to Washington. As all of us know, President \nObama, Vice President Biden, and this Congress have made the single \nlargest investment in passenger rail in America's history.\n  The $8 billion we included in the stimulus for high-speed passenger \nrail represents a commitment to taking the next step in intercity \npassenger rail for the 21st century.\n  Implementing this vision will be monumental. It will take a good-\nfaith working relationship between Congress, the White House, the \nindustry, and State and local governments.\n  Thankfully, Joe Szabo has earned the confidence and full support of \nPresident Obama. Joe and the President worked closely together when \nthen-State Senator Obama served in Springfield in the Illinois General \nAssembly.\n  Mr. President, I am here today to tell you what President Obama and I \nalready know: When it comes to making high-speed rail a reality in the \nU.S. and ensuring that millions of Americans have access to safe, \nreliable passenger and freight rail, there is no one better for this \njob than Joe Szabo.\n  Mr. President, in the months and years ahead, I can assure you this \ncountry will find Joe Szabo understands the critical role our national \nrail system plays to the health of our economy, our environment, and \nour future.\n  I am proud to have added my voice to the chorus of so many who asked \nthe administration to nominate Joe and give him this chance to serve \nour Nation. I know he is going to do an exceptional job.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2009/04/29/senate-section/article/S4904-3", "month": "04", "year": "2009", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages S4904-S4905]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          COMMENDING THE UNIVERSITY OF GEORGIA GYMNASTICS TEAM\n\n  Mr. DURBIN.
